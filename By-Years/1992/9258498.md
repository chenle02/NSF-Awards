This award provides support to Dr. Jean-Laurent Rosenthal under the National
Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program. The objectives of this
program are to recognize outstanding young faculty in science and engineering,
to enhance the academic career of recent Ph.D. recipients, and to foster contact
and cooperation between academia and industry. Dr. Rosenthal has already made
significant research contributions in the field of economic history, and he has
the potential to become a leader in academic research and education. This award
allow him to pursue his research interests in the area of credit markets. Dr.
Rosenthal intends to analyze credit markets in France for the period 1675 to
1860. A major component of this research will involve the extensive collection
of data from various French archives. These data will consist of individual
credit transactions and will be linked to other sources of information about
borrowers and lenders. The research agenda is important because it will shed new
light on the relationship between the evolution of credit markets and economic
growth and development. The research findings could have important implications
for the establishing credit markets in the transition economies of Eastern
Europe.
