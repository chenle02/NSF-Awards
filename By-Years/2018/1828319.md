An award is made to the University of New Hampshire (UNH) to support the
acquisition of a 700 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The 700
MHz NMR will be configured for solution and solid state NMR studies with high
sensitivity and ease-of-use to enable structural and dynamics studies of
biological and other low sensitivity molecules. The new instrument will serve 18
UNH research programs from 6 departments and 3 colleges, bringing together a
diverse group of researchers. It will also serve other colleges and universities
in the region and will be nationally accessible via remote login. The instrument
will enhance advanced training opportunities, especially for students pursuing
advanced degrees, preparing the next generation of NMR spectroscopists.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Research enabled by the acquisition encompasses a broad
range of structural biology, chemistry, and materials science based projects at
UNH and in the northern New England region. Research topics will include studies
of antifreeze proteins, scaffold proteins, photoreceptor enzymes, synthetic
enzymes, elastin-like polymers, and protein-polymer hybrids. NMR data will be
integrated with modelling and simulation data to gain a holistic view of protein
dynamics and interactions. Solid state NMR will be used to characterize the
structure and dynamics of solid samples, including membrane associated proteins,
protein-ice mixtures, polymers, and nanomaterials. Data from these studies will
be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, used
in course offerings, and leveraged in public outreach
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
