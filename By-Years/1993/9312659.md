9305219 Bass This award supports a 2-year collaborative research program
intended to elucidate the elastic properties of majorite, the garnet-structured
high-pressure phase of pyroxene that is an important constituent of the
transition zone in the Earth's mantle. The study would check previous
measurements that are controversial, resolving whether or not the properties of
majorite are anomalously sensitive to details of composition, crystallographic
structure, ordering or origin. Resolving this issue is critical to understanding
the geophysical properties of the mantle transition zone. The work would also
provide a significant cross-check between two laboratories and between two
methods of determining elastic properties on polycrystalline aggregates,
Brillouin spectroscopy and static compression. For the first time, natural
samples of transition-zone high-pressure phases would be made available to the
community for complementary studies through modern techniques of chemical and
physical micro- analysis. ***
