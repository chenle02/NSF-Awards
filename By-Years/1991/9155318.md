This project is a three and one half year program to enhance the teaching of 75
secondary biology teachers from six counties in the state of New York. This will
be accomplished via three, three week, summer institutes to be held at Elmira
College and by follow-up support services offered during the following academic
years. The program will emphasize an experimental, multidisciplinary, hands-on
approach to the teaching of secondary biology; cooperative learning will also be
employed. Four content areas will be covered in each summer institute, including
biochemistry, human physiology, molecular biology and immunology. The primary
objectives of the program include curriculum enhancement and tie-in to other
scientific disciplines, development of a more experimental outlook on biology,
and increased creativity skills. Project staff will monitor implementation
progress during the academic year and will be available to assist participants
in this phase of the project. Cost sharing equals 17.7% of the NSF award.
