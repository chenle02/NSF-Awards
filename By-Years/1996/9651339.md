In this proposed work, we intend to merge the technology of using computers in
the laboratory for introductory physics with the problem solving pedagogy we
have found to be successful with large classes at the University of Minnesota.
Where applicable, we intend to make extensive use of video data acquisition
techniques. The goal is to produce a one year, computer-based introductory
physics laboratory that is directly applicable to large classes and also
suitable for small classes interested in stressing a problem-solving approach to
introductory physics. This laboratory will build upon our current laboratory
manuals and apparatus. We expect that certain laboratory problems will be easily
adapted to the computer and others will not. In addition, new problems will be
added which were not possible without the technological strengths of the
computer. We intend to use a commercially available software environment. One
which is commonly used in engineering and research is LabVIEW/Labwindows. We
will adapt LabVIEW to existing hardware packages, such as NIH image for video
analysis, and the tools used in CUPLE and Real-time Physics. This proposal will
bring together the problem-solving expertise of the University of Minnesota with
the technical experience of Hamline University. The formative and summative
evaluation of this project will use ethnographic and numerical techniques to
determine successful attainment of our goals. The results of this project will
be disseminated through the American Journal of Physics, relevant conferences,
and workshops.
