The inland Australian desert is one of the last remaining areas where natural
wildfires remain a regular and dominant feature of an extensive, largely
undisturbed, natural landscape. A fire succession cycle generates spatial and
temporal heterogeneity. Habitat-specialized species can go extinct within a
given habitat patch (fire scar), but remain in the overall system by periodic
reinvasions from adjacent or nearby patches of suitable habitat of different
age. Such regional processes and thus the system-wide spatial and temporal al
pattern of fire disturbance, facilitate local diversity. The project will
develop and test a hierarchical Markov chain model of fire succession. The
ultimate goal is to model the entire Great Victoria desert region as a dynamic
habitat mosaic and to understand both the mechanisms of coexistence of its
component species and the effects of fire disturbance in maintaining diversity.
