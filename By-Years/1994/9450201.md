The Council on Undergraduate Research (UCR) is requesting funding in the amount
of $2,500 for travel grants to underrepresented minorities to attend the Fifth
National Conference of the Council on Undergraduate Research which is scheduled
to be held at Bates College in June 1994. The theme of this year's biennial
national conference is "The Bottom Line: Creating and Maintaining a Healthy
Undergraduate Research Environment." Particular attention will be given to
soliciting applications from black faculty at historically black colleges and
black faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions. There are three
objectives proposed i this program. The first objectives is to provide the
opportunity for underrepresented minority faculty at primarily undergraduate
institutions to learn more about funding opportunities and also to learn about
successful undergraduate research programs. The second objective is to bring the
perspective of the black community into the national dialogue of undergraduate
research. And the third objective is to foster the involvement of black science
faculty in the organization of the Council on Undergraduate Research.
