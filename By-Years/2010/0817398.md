Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;Through this project, students are developing
short video demonstrations of principles and topics in geotechnical engineering.
The modules are being developed for individuals with different learning styles
and are taking into account issues in universal access for students with
disabilities. The video clips are available through student-friendly
technologies such as podcasts or video MP3 players. The students are adopting
their traditional learning styles to unconventional learning modes with
extensive and expert use of electronic technologies, design and development of
experiments, and awareness of universal design. Through their work in developing
the videos clips, students are deepening their understanding of technical
concepts, improving their ability to communicate and work on teams, and
broadening their understanding of issues surrounding universal access for
individuals with disabilities. The flexible design employed in this project
facilitates adaptation to other subjects, other universities, and other student
populations. Best practices guidelines for using this teaching methodology are
being developed and widely disseminated.
