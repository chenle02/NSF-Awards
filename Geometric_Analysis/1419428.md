The Midwest Women in Mathematics Symposium (Midwest WIMS) will be held at Notre
Dame on April 5, 2014. The goals of this symposium are to highlight women's
contributions to the mathematical community, strengthen the network of female
mathematicians in the Midwest, encourage new collaborations, and facilitate
mentoring among graduate students, postdocs, and professors to help women stay
active in research. The symposium will include several mathematical talks,
including a keynote address given by Lenore Blum of Carnegie Mellon University.
There will be parallel sessions in algebra, dynamical systems, geometry and
topology, logic, mathematical biology, partial differential equations, and
statistics. In addition, there will be a problem session to encourage new
collaborations; problems that cut across disciplines are particularly
encouraged. The symposium encourages participation of women in various stages of
their academic careers, ranging from graduate students to full faculty.

It is not uncommon for women with research talent to drop out of the research
community. The talks and the problem session will lead women to new and exciting
projects. An extended lunch and other breaks will give participants at various
stages in their careers the opportunity discuss mathematical problems, or simply
exchange stories. The PI expects that some participants will, in discussions
that are not strictly mathematical, learn strategies for staying active in
research.
