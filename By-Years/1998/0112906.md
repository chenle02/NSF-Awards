In recent years, auction theory has been asked to provide guidance
to&lt;br/&gt;policymakers in several important areas, including spectrum
auctions,&lt;br/&gt;electricity auctions, and Treasury auctions. Unfortunately,
the received&lt;br/&gt;theory had largely focused on auctions of a single
object, and so had little&lt;br/&gt;to rigorously say about the most empirically
relevant auction problems.&lt;br/&gt;Recent research by economists has begun to
expand the boundaries of auction&lt;br/&gt;theory and analysis so as to
encompass multiple-item auctions. In prior&lt;br/&gt;work, we have analyzed the
theoretical properties of existing multiple-item&lt;br/&gt;auction formats,
proposed new efficient auction formats for multiple items,&lt;br/&gt;proposed
new applications for multiple-item auctions, and empirically&lt;br/&gt;evaluated
recent applications of auctions for spectrum and electricity.
This&lt;br/&gt;project builds upon this recent work, by examining the following
topics:&lt;br/&gt;* Development of the properties of a new, efficient ascending
auction for&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous commodities.&lt;br/&gt;* Understanding the
theoretical underpinnings for efficient
ascending&lt;br/&gt;auctions.&lt;br/&gt;* Analysis of auctions for heterogeneous
commodities in environments with&lt;br/&gt;interdependent values.&lt;br/&gt;*
Study of auction theory with agency problems.&lt;br/&gt;* Use of the reserve
price in mitigating the exercise of market power.&lt;br/&gt;* New applications
for multiple-item auction designs.&lt;br/&gt;* Empirical analysis of the
European 3G spectrum auctions.&lt;br/&gt;The project includes a balance between
further theoretical developments of&lt;br/&gt;multiple-item auctions, and
practical applications and empirical testing of&lt;br/&gt;the ideas of auction
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
