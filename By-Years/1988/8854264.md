The Expert System Workshop for Faculty Enhancement is providing six hands-on
workshops for engineering, science, and mathematics faculty in the expert system
applications area of artificial intelligence. Each of the six workshops lasts
five days. Each faculty member in attendance has the use of an enhanced IBM
PC/AT for direct involvement in the study of expert systems theory and
applications. The workshops are addressing such topics as: Introduction to
Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems, Structure of Programs including
Inference Engines and Knowledge Bases, Tools and Programs including LISP,
PROLOG, PC Plus, Shells, Analysis of Programming Concepts, including Frames,
Rules, Chaining and Parameters. Expert systems and artificial intelligence are
the leading edge areas of fifth generation computing machines and knowledge of
their nature and uses can effectively be integrated into a faculty member's
research and teaching. It is, furthermore, the case that expert systems and
artificial intelligence can be adapted to teaching and training of students and
is, therefore, a particularly appropriate area of inquiry for engineering,
science and mathematics faculty. //
