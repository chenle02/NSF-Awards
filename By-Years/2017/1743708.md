The conference will bring together researchers and students, observers and
theorists for the presentation and discussion of new advances in stellar
astrophysics enabled by the latest generation of radio facilities operating from
meter to submillimeter wavelengths. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general focus of
the workshop will be radio emission from hot and cool stars during the pre-main
sequence through post-main sequence evolutionary phases. An underlying theme
will be exploring how the new technologies that are opening the entire radio
spectrum to the study of the Sun and stars are leading to new discoveries.
