An interdisciplinary team of civil, geotechnical and electrical engineers, and
urban and regional planners will gather essential information on the underground
flooding in the Loop of the city of Chicago caused by the failure of one section
of an old freight tunnel on April 13, 1992. The team will collect information on
the tunnel grid where the event took place; soil conditions during and after the
break; sequence of events leading to the failure and subsequent flood; effects
of the flood on the electric power system and other services; buildings and
structures affected; short and long term repair and recovery measures. The
gathered data will provide benchmarks for testing and improving models for
managing the urban infrastructure, assessing the potential consequences of
similar failures, and identifying possible preventive and remedial measures.
