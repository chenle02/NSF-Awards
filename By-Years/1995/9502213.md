Dr. Lynn C. Francesconi, Chemistry Department, CUNY Hunter College, is supported
by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division under a Faculty Early Career Advancement Award to prepare
technetium oxide molecules and to pursue a five pronged program to improve the
educational experiences offered at Hunter College. In the research component
technicium will be incorported into cage polyoxoanion structures of tungsten,
molybdenum, vanadium, and phosphorus. In the educational component outside
institutional research collaborations will be established and the supervision of
undergraduate research students will be delegated to graduate students in order
the improve the relevance and vitality of the graduate training. At the
undergraduate level increased laboratory participation will be accomplished by a
redesign of the courses and the undergraduate research experience, communication
and student involvement will be increased in the freshman course through the
institution of a workshop approach, and a new inorganic chemistry lecture course
will be devised. Technecium is used as an imaging agent in medicine and occurs
as a component in radioactive wastes. This research will produce new compounds
which may be valuable both in the imaging application and point the way to
substances which can efficiently remove technecium from water solutions. The
educational efforts will improve the teaching program at Hunter College,
particularly as it relates to minority students.
