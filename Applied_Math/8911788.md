Professor Datko will investigate the effects of time delays on stabilizing
boundary controls of some infinite-dimensional systems. Three areas will be
considered. (i) The effects of small time delays on stabilizing controls for
systems described by hyperbolic partial differential equations. (ii) The
robustness of the stability of viscoelastic systems in the presence of time
delays vis a vis elastic systems. The former appear, in some cases, to be less
sensitive than the latter when time delays are introduced into their damping.
Hence viscoelastic systems may serve as more suitable models for flexible
structures than elastic systems. (iii) A reexamination of controllability and
stabilizability for elastic systems with a view to considering "approximate"
definitions of these concepts which are robust with respect to perturbations
involving time delays.
