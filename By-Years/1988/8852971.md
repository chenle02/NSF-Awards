The acquisition of a recording Infrared Spectrophotometer is substantially
improving the quality and quantity of organic chemistry instruction. Students
majoring in the pre-professional programs in chemistry, biology, environmental
science and nutrition are having the opportunity to gain first hand experience
with IR spectroscopy, an important tool in the modern organic chemistry
laboratory. The technique is enabling students to collect information about and
describe the molecular structure of known and unknown organic compounds, to
analyze mixtures of closely related compounds, to determine the purity of
products from synthetic reactions, and to detect, identify, and measure the
concentration of short-lived intermediates. By using IR spectroscopy, students
are comprehending more fully the importance of instruments at every stage of
structure determination, from isolation and purification to final comparison
with an authentic sample, and are becoming familiar with equipment that is
normally encountered by sophomores in four-year colleges. The students are being
better prepared for transfer to the four year schools. The grantee is matching
the award from non-Federal sources.
