This proposal requests support for the 4th in a series of International
Workshops on Mouse Genome Mapping to stimulate the exchange, integration and
distribution of genetic information among scientists analyzing the mouse genome.
This meeting will assist in the establishment of formalized working groups and
committees to insure the continuation of cooperative efforts for integrating
information and database development on an international basis. The mapping and
sequencing of the mouse genome is important because of the large number of
mutants and strains available for basic research in most areas of biology.*** //
