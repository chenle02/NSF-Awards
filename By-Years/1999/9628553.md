9628553 Jansma This grant provides $25,000 as one-half support of the costs of
acquiring two dual-frequency GPS receivers and a workstation to be used for
tectonic research, monitoring for hazard mitigation and for educational
purposes. Specific projects to be undertaken will include examination of the
strain partitioning within the Caribbean- North American plate boundary and its
implications for seismic hazards in Puerto Rico and measurement of surface
deformation associated with dome growth and/or magma chamber inflation in the
currently active Soufriere Hills volcanic center on the island of Montserrat,
West Indies. ***
