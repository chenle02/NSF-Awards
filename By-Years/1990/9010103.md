The development of Shape Memory Effect (SME) thin films as intelligent
materials for micro-switches and micro-mation actuators is proposed. SME
materials as "intelligent" actuator materials are attractive compared to
electrostatic actuators requiring external control. Stoichimetric NiTi is the
most promising SME thin film candidate as it is a tough material with a
convenient termperature transformation range of 30--60 C, and also exhibits a
strong recovery force on deformation. As dopants, such as Ca, radically alter
the transformation temperatures, NiTi will find applications in both micro-
sensor fabricated by the author using RF sputter co-deposition onto Si and Al2O3
substrates followed by thermal snnealing. The optimal conditions and analysis by
TEM and XRD. Prototypical micro-switches and actuators using these films will be
fabricated using conventioal lithographic techniques.
