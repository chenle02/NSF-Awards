New techniques for parallelizing scientific computing programs for distributed
memory multiprocessors will be developed in this project. In particular, the
problem of compiling nested loops will be investigated. The solution of a number
of tiling problems will be attempted first. Then examination of methods of
determining deadlock-free partitions, size, allocation, and scheduling of tiles
and minimizing communication for efficient parallel execution of programs on
distributed memory multiprocessors will be carried out. In addition, new tools
for optimizations dealing with architectural capabilities of individual
processors will be investigated.
