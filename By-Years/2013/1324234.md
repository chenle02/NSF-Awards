Dr. Daniel Goldstein (Rutgers University) will study how and why Latino migrants
use the U.S. legal system to prosecute workplace disputes. Focusing on several
study communities in central New Jersey, the research considers the ways in
which migrants who claim to have suffered from mistreatment or injury in the
workplace become active users of the law and the U.S. justice system. The
project asks how Latino migrants seek the help of lawyers and non-profit legal
advocacy groups; educate themselves about the law and appeal to its protections;
enter the court system and argue their cases; and articulate rights claims. The
project also studies the role that legal-aid organizations play in facilitating
migrants' understandings of and access to the legal
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research uses an ethnographic research
methodology, employing a research team that includes trained local research
assistants. Through participant-observation followed by semi-structured
individual and focus group interviewing, the team will study the vulnerabilities
and behaviors of migrants who have suffered workplace abuses. Additionally,
through volunteer work in a local migrant legal-aid organization, the research
team will study how these organizations facilitate migrants encounters with the
legal system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is very timely and
important given the current fluidity in the U.S. around immigration issues, with
Latino migrants potentially emerging into a new era of visibility, advocacy, and
action in this country. The research will shed new light on the realities facing
migrants in the U.S. with a special focus on workplace problems, and the legal
remedies migrants pursue in response. By training and deploying a team of
community-based researchers, this project will build capacity in local migrant
communities, preparing people for future educational opportunities and
employment in social science research.
