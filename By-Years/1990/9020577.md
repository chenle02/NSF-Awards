Abstract This proposed work seeks to develop a flare model which self-
consistently incorporates the quasi-static fields, currents, and wave-particle
interactions important in determining the particle dynamics. The model will be
based on earlier work which has investigated some of the characteristics of
microwave and soft and hard X-ray emissions. The model will be able to make
predictions on basic flare processes, including the necessary conditions for
flare onset (e.g. magnetic field configuration), the flare current system and
the evolution of flare emissions at a variety of wavelengths, including
microwaves and X-rays. These predictions will be tested against observations,
allowing more detailed analysis of the observations and better insight into the
underlying physics. ***
