Studies of galaxy evolution will make use of the previously unavailable
capabilities of a newly completed near-infrared camera. This instrument allows
improvements in sensitivity over the single detectors used earlier and, of
course, permits imagery and a real coverage not even contemplated with the
instruments available previously. The history of star formation at the galactic
center will be determined by studying the variability of the individual stars.
It will also be determined whether the "missing" mass in our Galaxy is in the
form of massive sub- stellar objects (brown dwarfs). Two major surveys will also
be undertaken, the first survey will be of 13 square degrees of the sky and the
second survey of a much smaller area to somewhat greater depth. If current
theories are correct, these surveys should detect primeval galaxies. The surveys
will also provide considerable information about the distribution of low mass
stars in the Galaxy, about distant active galaxies and quasi-stellar objects
(QSOs), and, as with any pioneering survey, something new and unexpected will be
found.
