This award supports the research in algebraic geometry, coding theory, and
analytic number theory of Professor Carlos J. Moreno of Baruch College of the
City University of New York. Dr. Moreno will be working on several questions,
all inter- disciplinary within mathematics. One of these is to apply techniques
of algebraic geometry to the theory of the error correcting codes arising from
algebraic curves that were first developed by Goppa. Another field in which Dr.
Moreno will be working involves congruence properties for the weight
multiplicities and partition functions of highest weight representations of Kac-
Moody Lie algebras. The several themes of Professor Moreno's research are
unified by his expertise in algebraic geometry. This is one of the oldest parts
of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the
past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in
the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field
makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in theoretical
computer science and in robotics.
