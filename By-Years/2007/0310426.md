Title: Strengthening Minority Access Through Research Training
(SMART)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Southern University and A&amp;M
College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HRD 0310426&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Mildred R.
Smalley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Southern University will implement comprehensive
approaches to strengthen the institution's undergraduate science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and research infrastructure. The
University will (1) increase by 30% the number of STEM baccalaureates; (2)
significantly increase the number of these baccalaureates who pursue doctoral
degrees in STEM disciplines; and (3) increase the number of these STEM
doctorates who enter the professoriate and the STEM
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project efforts cut across the disciplines of
architecture, agricultural sciences (animal, plant, soil, and urban forestry),
biology, chemistry, computer science, physics, electrical engineering
technology, engineering (chemical, civil, electrical, and mechanical),
mathematics, and science education in chemistry, biology, physics, and
mathematics. The design of the SMART program operates on the proven thesis that
the scope, depth, and quality of undergraduate training and participation of
students in undergraduate research have a strong bearing on the desire and
ability of undergraduate students to attend and to succeed in graduate studies.
