This project is a three year program that offers five-week teacher enhancement
summer institutes, followed by academic year curriculum development activity.
The summer institutes will be held at Mankato State University. A total of 72
middle school science teachers (24 per year), from a six state Midwest region,
will participate in summer research experiences and presentations in the subject
area of soil biology/agroecology. Teachers will have the opportunity to study
the organisms in soils, apply what they learn to issues in agroecology, and
participate in writing, testing, and revision of classroom materials. Laboratory
materials to be used are readily available to participant teachers and their
students for in-class experimentation and study. Research projects undertaken by
the participants will be designed for transport back to the home classroom to
engage students in the projects, and will not require complex instrumentation
and techniques. Each teacher will provide in-service training for colleagues.
Included will be 6 one-week workshops conducted by two teacher teams at
different locations within the region. At least 60 additional teachers will be
trained in these workshops to conduct similar research activities with their
students. These workshops will be funded, in part, by local funding. An amount
equal to 20.5 % of NSF costs has been provided as cost sharing.
