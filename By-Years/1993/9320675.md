9320675 Stearns This is a project designed to help us understand when and why
upsurges in corporate mergers take place in the American economy. Goverment
documents, the business press, and other sources of data will be used to test an
explanation drawn from resource mobilization theory in order to explain these
merger movement upsurges. All four of the peaks of corporate merger activity in
the last century (circa 1897, 1929, 1968, and 1985) will be examined in light of
this theory. Up until now the periodic upsurges of corporate merger activity in
the United States have been seen as akin to earthquakes or hurricanes--
unpredictable and mysterious events that wreak havoc on a wide scale. Case
studies of individual mergers abound, but these contribute little to an
understanding of why mergers are common in some periods and rare in others. To
the extent that this project is successful, it will make upsurges in corporate
mergers less mysterious and more interpretable. Those who feel that at their
peaks such merger movements generate substantial waste and disruption should
find that this project provides information that can be used to moderate these
problems. ***
