This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Pseudomonas aeruginosa Multi-Host
Virulence." Using a novel system of invertebrate hosts to rapidly identify
Pseudomonas aeruginosa genes that confer virulence, significant overlap in the
genes required for pathogenesis in both invertebrate and mammalian hosts has
been discovered, suggesting that the mechanisms that direct pathogenesis are
common among the many hosts of P. aeruginosa. To dissect the molecular events of
pathogenesis the role of the fatty acid biosynthesis gene, fabF, a gene isolated
by multi-host screening, is being examined. Novel virulence factors are also
being identified using a library of non-redundant mutants with a disruption in
every non-essential open reading frame in the P. aeruginosa genome. The defined
nature of this library allows exhaustive screening for all genes required for P.
aeruginosa pathogenesis. Such analyses will provide a comprehensive view of the
universal mechanisms employed by P. aeruginosa to infect its many hosts.
