Under this Small Grant for Exploratory Research the Principal Investigator will
design a special purpose spectrograph and explore observing methods for
automated spectroscopic observing. This could open a research technique to many
smaller institutions as well as make it much easier for researchers with
synoptic requirements to obtain the needed spectroscopic data.
