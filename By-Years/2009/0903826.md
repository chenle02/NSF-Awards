This award represents part of a proposal submitted to the NSF/DOE Partnership in
Basic Plasma Science and Engineering. The majority of the research effort will
be carried out under a separate award from the Department of
Energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide for research experience for
an undergraduate student and some travel. The research will examine low
frequency, electromagnetic wave turbulence in space plasmas. The research will
be done primarily by using gyro-kinetic simulations.
