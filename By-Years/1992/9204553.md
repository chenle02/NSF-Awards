This research is to study the extent and mechanism of lateral heterogeneity in
the oceanic upper mantle. The method of analysis will be joint inversion of
seismic wave travel times, geoid, and bathymetry anomalies to determine upper
mantle temperature and/or compositional variations. It is intended to attempt to
distinguish between the competing models of thermal and compositional mechanisms
for lateral heterogeneity on a regional (500-5000 km) scale in the vicinity of
mid-ocean ridges and mid-plate swells. The initial effort will be to incorporate
surface wave data into the joint inversion and apply the technique to the East
Pacific Rise region.
