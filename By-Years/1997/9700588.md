ECS-9700588 Tannenbaum The proposal deals with partial differential equation
methods for the control of distributed and nonlinear systems. In particular, the
focus is on the benchmark area of certain key semiconductor manufacturing
processes including etching, deposition and lithography. We will also discuss
some new directions we are taking on the robust control of distributed parameter
systems using skew Toeplitz theory. This allows one to reduce the design of H
-optimal and suboptimal compensators to finite dimensional linear algebra
problem, the dimension of which only depends on the McMillan degrees of the
weights and not the (state-space) dimension of the plant. Thus even for infinite
dimensional systems, we are reduced to finite matrix manipulations. We will also
consider some time-varying generalizations of these ideas.
