The ultimate objective of this project is to develop and to make available to
the neuroscience research community siliconbased microelectrode arrays
("probes") for recording signals from nervous tissue, as well as critical
supporting equipment for performing practical multisite neuronal recording
experiments. The tiny fork-shaped silicon probes have several microelectrodes on
each of their multiple shafts, and allow simultaneous recording from multiple
neurons at various depths and lateral spacings. Each shaft typically occupies
less volume than a pair of microwire electrodes. Using these probes, it will be
possible to obtain a detailed look at a local network of neurons. Initial
development of the basic technologies has been accomplished with the support of
a previous grant from NSF. Probes have been manufactured using a new
microfabrication process, and neural signals have been recorded with them from
the cerebellar cortex of an anesthetized rat. The present grant will support
efforts to further develop the instrumentation and to test it in three different
neurophysiology laboratories. The goal of this funding period is to develop the
technology to the point that it can be distributed to outside users at the end
of the grant, through a collaboration with a commercial ncuroscience equipment
vendor. With this approach, the project should have a broad and rapid impact by
making silicon probe experiments accessible to the neuroscience community at
large.
