During a six week period in May-June 1991 the Cloud and Aerosol Research Group,
University of Washington, carried out an intensive airborne field study of the
enormous plume of smoke produced by over 600 oil fires in Kuwait. Rates of
emissions from these fires were: 2% of worldwide emissions of CO2 emissions from
all electric utilities in the USA, and thirteen times the soot emissions form
all combustion sources in the USA. In this grant support is provided to complete
the reduction and analysis of the large amount of data collected in the project,
and to archive the data set for other users. This research will emphasize
characterization of the nature of the chemical emissions from the various types
of fires, the regional distributions of the emissions, the transformations of
plume constituents as they dispersed downwind, comparisons with other polluted
environments, and the effects of the smoke on weather and climate.
