This research project, at an undergraduate institution, addresses the
photoisomerization of trans-stilbene adsorbed on single crystal alumina
surfaces. Support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program will enable
the characterization of adsorbed molecules using temperature programmed
desorption and polarized UV- VIS spectroscopy. The effects of inert Xenon spacer
layers on the arc lamp induced photoisomerization will be examined, as will
variables such as adsorbate coverage, excitation wavelength, and surface
temperature. The detailed mechanism of the surface mediated photoisomerization
will be explored. Photoinduced chemistry on surfaces is an expanding area of
research due to interest in photocatalysis and the use of light for electronic
materials processing. The work supported here addresses basic aspects of this
general area, by considering the simple model system of light induced
isomerization. By examining a system which has been well studied in the gas
phase and in solution, an understanding of the surface mediated process should
emerge.
