DMS-9501062 PI: Constantin It is proposed to work on variational bounds for bulk
dissipation in boundary driven Navier-Stokes turbulence, with particular
attention to Rayleigh-Benard convection. It is proposed to investigate
analytically properties of invariant measures for Navier-Stokes turbulence, with
the aim of studying scaling of structure functions and making connection with
aspects of the Kolmogorov phenomenology at the dissipative and inertial scales.
It is also proposed to investigate inviscid blow-up in the Euler equations and
active scalars, with emphasis on the quasi- geostrophic model of atmospheric
flow. The aim is to understand inertial super-exponential generation of
energetic small scales. The present proposal is aimed at the understanding of
incompressible turbulence. This most common class of physical phenomena at the
human scale is important for a large number of scientific and industrial
activities, from weather prediction to computer technology. This proposal is
aimed at the mathematical aspect of an interactive effort: the PI collaborates
with theoretical physicists, experimental physicists, engineers and
computational scientists, working on the same specific experimental situations
and investigating the same theoretical issues.
