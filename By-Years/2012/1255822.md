The need for failure-resistant circuit and system design is becoming critical as
mobile devices continue to be constructed with enhanced computing and video
processing capabilities using heterogeneous intellectual property blocks such as
CPU, memory, sensors, and graphics/image processing units. Furthermore, ever-
increasing miniaturization of integrated fabrication processes (e.g., 40
nanometer CMOS or below) is creating challenging problems including higher rates
of failure at the device level, reliability degradation, and severe
process/voltage/temperature variation, resulting in unpredictable behaviors and
temporary or permanent failure of circuits and systems. This project proposes a
failure-resistant and variation-tolerant interconnect system that will enhance
the reliability of the system at the circuit level. The project will also
enhance the self-healing capability of mobile platforms by developing adaptive
and automatic fault detection techniques as well as by developing reconfigurable
data access capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methodologies for developing
failure-resistant computing and communication systems are critical for future
semiconductor fabrication processes. An innovative failure-resistant and self-
healing system could have significant impact on the industry and enhance
national competitiveness. The microelectronic industry needs engineers trained
in both analog/mixed-signal and radio frequency/microwave integrated circuit and
system design. This project will thus contribute to the training of a
competitive workforce.
