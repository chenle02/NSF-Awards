This is the initial funding of a project submitted by the Computer Sciences and
Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the Commission on Physical Sciences,
Mathematics, and Applications of the National Research Council (NRC). The CSTB
organizes a multi-stage convening activity for academia, business, and industry
to consider the deployment of technologies and services expected for the near-
term national information infrastructure (NII), their relationships to key
applications which are representative of those under the NII umbrella, and their
anticipated degree of interoperability. Activities under this project include an
initial workshop to structure the kinds of information on which common
understanding is desired, a solicitation of white papers to explore industry,
technology, and applications perspectives based on the outcome of the initial
workshop, convening of a larger forum to air and discuss perspectives presented
in the white papers, and a synthesis of the insights from all these activities
and from related reports generated by others into a succinct summary to inform
the development of the initial phase of the NII roadmap development.
