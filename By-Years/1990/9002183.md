Dr. Margaret M. Bruehl has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship In
Chemistry. Dr. Bruehl's doctoral degree was from Northwestern University under
the supervision of Professor George Schatz. Dr.Bruehl intends to continue
research at the University of Colorado under the sponsorship of Professor James
T. Hynes. Dr. Bruehl's area of postdoctoral training and research will be
theoretical chemical dynamics with emphasis on simulation, and interpretation of
results in terms of analytic and approximation theories. Complex systems in the
condensed phase will be considered, specifically proton and hydride transfer
reactions in solution and in model enzymes. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
