Abstract for award of Ellenberg DMS-0401616&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rational
points, Galois representations, and fundamental groups&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.
The investigator proposes to continue his study of traditional
&lt;br/&gt;problems of arithmetic geometry (bounds and asymptotics for the
number &lt;br/&gt;of rational points on varieties, counting number fields,
computing &lt;br/&gt;Mordell-Weil ranks of families of abelian varieties) by
means of less &lt;br/&gt;traditional methods (Galois actions on arithmetic
fundamental groups, &lt;br/&gt;non-abelian Iwasawa theory, Batyrev-Manin
heuristics.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The investigator's research is in the field
of arithmetic geometry,&lt;br/&gt;whose central problem is the determination of
the set of solutions of&lt;br/&gt;equations. A typical problem in this area is
the conjecture of Fermat,&lt;br/&gt;which asserts that two perfect nth powers
cannot sum to another nth power. &lt;br/&gt;The resolution of this conjecture by
Wiles resulted from the application&lt;br/&gt;of deep geometric methods to this
seemingly arithmetic problem; the&lt;br/&gt;investigator's research, similarly,
centers on the application of modern &lt;br/&gt;geometry to questions about
equations and their solutions in integers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
