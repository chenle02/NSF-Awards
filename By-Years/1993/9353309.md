9353309 Henry The establishment of a multi-user, transmission electron
microscope facility is requested for the departments of biology, chemistry and
physics. The electron microscope facility will replace a dated instrument of
twenty years and will enhance the current research efforts in the
structure/budding of pathogenic spordia and the microstructural characterization
of superconducting materials. The mutant spordia infects barley, which has an
important nutritional value for humans and animals, and also is reputedly an
opportunistic agent in human AIDS. For the superconducting materials, the
electron microscope will be used to characterize at the micron regime
superconductive materials whose electronic properties are affected by the
substructure during processing. ***
