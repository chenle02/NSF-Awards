One of the missing elements in a push-button approach design for robotic
assembly is the automatic generation of fixturing configurations for part
presentations. Past research efforts have focused on fixturing for machining
with minimal usage of workpart geometry. This research addresses the question:
given the part or subassembly geometry and its physical properties,
automatically determine the fixture necessary to hold the part for a particular
assembly operation. For analysis, limited sets of primitive shapes, grasp
points, fixturing elements, and assembly operations will be used. These sets are
considered with (a) resultant assembly force, (b) tolerance, (c) flexibility,
(d) material properties, and (e) stability with no slipping to establish,
through an algorithm, a geometric configuration for the fixture. This potential
fixture can be modeled on a solid modeler. Interference checks between the
fixture and part models, can validate the fixture model. The tools used will be
a solid modeler, a kinematics and dynamics simulation software package and a
modular fixturing kit to empirically verify the analytic results. This research
formulates an analytical algorithmic approach for automatic robotic assembly
fixture design.
