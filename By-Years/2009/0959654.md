This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation-
Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award funds the acquisition of an integrated
research system for the evaluation of biochemical and culture properties of
local species of microalgae at Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi (TAMUCC).
The instrumentation requested allows TAMUCC to develop new innovative systematic
research on microalgae and enhance the quality of research and student
instruction. The system provides faculty with critical tools for pursuit of
their research and improvement of laboratory projects in various undergraduate
and graduate courses in biology, ecology, chemistry, mariculture and
environmental science. Moreover, this equipment aids TAMUCC in its mission to
increase minority participation in science by providing students with research
and training opportunities that would not otherwise be available to them.
Results from these studies will be disseminated by student and faculty
presentations at regional and national meetings, and through publication in
peer-reviewed journals.&lt;br/&gt;
