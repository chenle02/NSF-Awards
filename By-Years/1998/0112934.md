EIA-0112934&lt;br/&gt;Ting Chen&lt;br/&gt;University of Southern
California&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Title: ITR/AP(BIO): Algorithmic Study in
Computational Proteomics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus of this project is
on developing computer algorithms and programs to support a technology called
High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS-MS),
a very powerful tool for high-throughput protein identification. This technology
generates mass patterns for peptides, and relies on fast and accurate computer
algorithms to map mass patterns to peptide sequences. This project aims at
designing algorithms for multiple proteomic applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This project addresses four fundamental computational problem areas in
Proteomics: (1) the problem of peptide identification (2) the problem of de novo
peptide sequencing, which aims to sequence peptides directly from tandem mass
spectra without database search, (3) the problem of identifying protein cross-
linking sites, which looks for a pair of cross-linked peptide sequences
optimally correlated to a tandem mass spectrum, and (4) the problem of peptide
mass fingerprinting, which aims to identify proteins by their masses of enzyme-
digested peptide mass patterns. Novel and efficient algorithms are being
designed to solve these problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
