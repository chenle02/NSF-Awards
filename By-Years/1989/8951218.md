In keeping with the "learn by doing" philosophy at Cal Poly, Pomona, the
Chemistry Department has developed a strong set of upper division laboratory
courses which allow the students access to a variety of state-of-the-art
instruments. One clear deficiency in this program is the lack of an NMR
comparable to one which is used by the students in post-graduate or industrial
positions. This is a rapidly expanding area for all of chemistry-organic,
organometallic, inorganic, physical and biochemistry. To remedy the deficiency a
200Mhz FT-NMR was purchased. Experiments have been designed to use this NMR in
upper division courses. The majority of these experiments utilize the
multinuclear capability of the FT-NMR. The most important use for the new
spectrometer is in selected upper division chemistry courses and in the required
senior project research courses. We believe that students can only begin to
appreciate the role of NMR in problem solving through first hand experience in
the measurement of spectra. The institution is matching NSF grant with an equal
amount of funds.
