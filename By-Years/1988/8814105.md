Dr. Timothy Keiderling is supported by a grant from The Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to continue his research in the application of vibrational
optical activity (VOA) to the determination of chemical structures of molecules
with chiral centers. This research has important potential applications as a
structural tool for biologically important polypeptides. Dr. Keiderling will
continue his pioneering work in this active field of research with an emphasis
on using vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) studies of small theoretically
tractable molecules with a goal of correlating spectra and structure. Intense
effort will also be made to generalize previous work on magnetic vibrational
circular dichroism (MVCD) to further clarify the role of vibronic coupling in
VCD. Finally, instrumental improvements in the area of Raman circular intensity
differential (RCID) spectroscopy will enable systematic empirical studies of
several small molecule systems for which VCD data have previously been obtained.
