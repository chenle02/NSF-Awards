The PIs propose to develop a robust production planning and control scheme that
is adaptable to shop floor uncertainty. The project will be a Private Sector
Initiative with joint funding by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. The problem
the PIs hope to solve is the achievement of a production process which can
achieve global managerial objectives while allowing for input from the shop
floor as changes and local constraints emerge. The PIs' approach is to extract
critical decisions from the production planning process and to solve them.
Decisions left unresolved are made on the shop floor, thus allowing for
adaptation to changing shop conditions. The PIs will further develop the
theoretical and computational issues and will extend the approach to address the
specific situation at Bethlehem Steel.
