The technology to harvest electricity from wind energy is now sufficiently
advanced to make entire cities powered by wind a reality. High-quality, short-
term forecasts of wind speed are vital for making this a more reliable energy
source. The investigator proposes to study two topics in wind power forecasting,
develop relevant methodologies and analyze their corresponding properties and
performances both theoretically and through Monte Carlo simulations studies. The
new methods will be applied to a first-of-a-kind testbed wind dataset from
northeastern US. The first topic concerns shrinkage and selection of space-time
variables in various models for wind power forecasting. The investigator
proposes to combine techniques such as partial least squares and the adaptive
lasso with space-time correlation information that naturally arises among the
predictor variables in the wind forecasting models. The second topic concerns
realistic forecast evaluations in the context of wind power forecasting. The
investigator proposes to develop new loss functions that are economically
relevant for wind power and study their properties and their use in building and
evaluating forecasting models in the wind energy arena.

The primary impact of this project is that the new methods for wind power
forecasting will provide valuable tools to applied practitioners in wind
farming. There is an obvious need for statisticians to be involved in such
important problems related to renewable and clean energies for the well-being of
our society. In particular, the research topics address crucial and major
challenges for advancing the use of energy from wind.
