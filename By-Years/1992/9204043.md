This U.S-Venezuela award will support Professor Cora Sadosky of Howard
University in a research collaboration with Professor Mischa Cotlar of the
Universidad Central de Venezuela. The researchers intend to work on problems of
approximation and interpolation of functions in several complex variables. The
approach will focus on their recent extensions of classical techniques involving
approximation and interpolation of functions in the one-dimensional case to many
dimensions. The proposed work continues a collaboration started several years
ago that has produced more than twenty papers and presentations in several
international meetings. In addition, it has potential applicability to various
fields of science and engineering, for example electrical engineering and
geophysics.
