This proposal sets out a goal to understand the dynamics of nanopore-Room
Temperature Ionic Liquids (RTIL) interactions better, in order to improve the
ability to design better supercapacitors for energy-storage. The specific
objective of this research is to investigate, using atomistic simulations, the
electrically-driven transport of RTILs in nanopores and its applications in the
charging dynamics of supercapacitors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success of this
project can help the development of new energy-storage approaches by providing a
better understanding of the fundamentals of RTILs in super-capacitors that use
nanoporous materials. The PI has an active plan to train undergraduates,
participate in K-12 outreach activities, and to publicly share the PI?s
Molecular Dynamics codes for modeling charged interfaces, which is an efficient
way of disseminating the outcome of this research.
