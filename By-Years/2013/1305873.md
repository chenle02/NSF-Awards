This research program is focused on the discovery of physics beyond the standard
model utilizing novel techniques to look for new phenomena in the complicated
LHC environment. This research program will expand the scope of dark-matter
searches at the LHC by introducing new models of interactions, enabling stronger
collaboration between experimentalists and theorists, and by fleshing out
theoretical assumptions of the dark-matter models. Model-independent search
techniques will then be applied to new, unexplored final states. In addition,
novel jet-substructure techniques will be developed at CMS to look for new
physics associated with boosted hadronic W's, Z's, and Higgs bosons. This
program will develop a better understanding of high transverse momentum
identification of b quarks and of jet sub-structure algorithms. This research
program also includes contributions to the development of the CMS pixel
luminosity telescope, and contributions to the simulation and front-end needs of
the CMS hadronic calorimeter upgrade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts
include their planned contributions to the existing Rutgers QuarkNet effort and
plans for speaking to high school groups.
