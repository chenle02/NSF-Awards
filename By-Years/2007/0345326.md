Project Summary: Auto-ignition of wood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Small
Grant for Exploratory Research. A model for autoignition of wood is developed
and solved numerically. The model considers physical and chemical processes in
both solid and gas phases. The char surface oxidation, important when the
incident heat flux to the solid surface is low, is included in the solid-gas
interface boundary conditions. The numerical code can reproduce the experimental
results for autoignition and ultimately can explain the underlying physical and
chemical processes governing the autoignition of wood. Auto-ignition is a
significant mechanism in the spread and growth of fire. It is of fundamental
interest, but its complexity has prevented a definitive study of the important
mechanisms that control it. Although the focus of this study is wood, the
proposed modeling can relate to other charring and non-charring solids as well.
The heating of wood in an oxygen atmosphere leads to exothermic surface
oxidation and thermal decomposition of the virgin material. Smoldering ignition
can occur at the surface, and flaming ignition is also possible. These two forms
of ignition have not previously been distinguished in the process of
autoignition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
fundamental work is important to the overall safety of the public and
infrastruture. Significantly, it embraces the problem of spread in forest fires
since this spread involves the radiant heating of discrete woody material
causing oxidation and flaming. From an educational point of view, the results of
this work are transmitted to fire-protection engineering students in a unique
program. This result will be the first of its kind in addressing both the
surface and gas-phase ignition processes, and is significant to public safety
and the spread of fire in forests and structures.&lt;br/&gt;
