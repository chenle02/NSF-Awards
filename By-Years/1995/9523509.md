9523509 Sheble The Extended Brokerage System (EBS) is a multiple timed period,
multiple commodity implementation of previous research and development of an
electric market exchange. The present evaluation of transactions occurs only as
a direct sale of electric production beyond schedule capacity. The EBS is
directed at evaluation of transactions beyond present schedule techniques to
increase the economic benefit of transactions between utilities and independent
power producers beyond electric sale only. The possibility of selling the raw
materials is included if a more economic solution can be found. The bids for
potential transactions are not based on unit schedules but on a market
assessment of the price of electricity either in product form or as a raw
material (e.g.coal, oil, natural gas). The net result should b increased usage
of the transmission grid across the country and a decrease in the cost of
electricity to the consumer. The EBS is appropriate if the industry is
reorganized horizontally or if some form of the present vertical integration is
maintained. Since the focus of the on-going deregulation is to price electricity
as any other market commodity, the development of an electric market place (EBS)
is very timely research and development activity to provide the foundation for
an efficient and comparably fair pricing mechanism. Only through open markets
can a true price discovery process function to find the optimal schedule given
all constraints and all resources as outlined in the proposal. ***
