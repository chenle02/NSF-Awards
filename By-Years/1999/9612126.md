*** 9612126 Azadivar The goal of this project is an in-depth understanding of
the social, behavioral and related barriers for small manufacturing companies in
managing the innovation process from the conception of an idea to its successful
implementation. Based on these findings, techniques will be developed that will
assist individuals and organizations in the decisions within the innovation
process that require integration of social and behavioral factors as well as
financial and technological considerations. These techniques will be evaluated
and refined with Manufacturing Learning Center (MLC) members and their impact
evaluated on MLC members' innovation process results. The techniques identified
through this project will be integrated into the learning experience of the
student interns with MLC as well as shared through publications and workshops.
This work should offer a broader understanding of the social and behavioral
barriers to innovation in small manufacturing firms as well as providing
management techniques to minimize these barriers to the innovation process in
these types of organizations. ***
