New variables recently introduced by Abhay Ashtekar will be used to calculate
numerically solutions to Einstein's equations corresponding to plane
gravitational waves propagating on spacetimes of finite spatial extent. The
results of the computations will be compared with known exact analytical
solutions, approximate analytical solutions, and numerical solutions obtained by
other authors using conventional variables. It is expected that this new
computer code will result in more rapid computation with greater accuracy.
Generalizations of the technique, including the incorporation of matter sources,
the relaxation of symmetry requirements, and changes of spatial topologies, will
lead to potent new tools for studying problems of current astrophysical
interest. In particular, a new approach will be available to study the relation
between non-linear gravitational wave interaction and the formation of galaxies,
and to generate numerically the radiative spacetimes of two interacting black
holes.
