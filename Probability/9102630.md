This award will support the work of faculty associate Steven Kalikow. The
proposed work is a mixture of probability and ergodic theory. The ergodic theory
topics seek a way of expressing transformations, a way of constructing new
transformations, and new approaches to the question of whether mixing implies
threefold mixing. The probability topics involve a measure on stationary
measures, phase transition, and finding the longest common subsequence of two
sequences of random variables. The work is at the interface of these two
disciplines. One application of the work is in the area of DNA sequence
alignment, where individuals are looking for common subsequences of two DNA
sequences.
