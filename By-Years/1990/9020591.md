In this project in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Prof. Holcombe will use graphite furnaces to study means of improving
trace metals analysis, and also to study gas/solid interactions. Graphite
furnace methods are already among the most sensitive available for detecting
trace metals in biological and environmental systems, and Holcombe's work will
improve the reliability and generality of the approach. Theoretical calculations
will aid in understanding the chemical and physical processes occurring. Among
the novel features of the research, Holcombe will use temperature-programmed
static secondary ionization mass spectrometry to characterize the furnace
surface as first solvent, then the analytical species are vaporized. Spectral
interpretation and collection of basic surface kinetics data will be emphasized.
Monte Carlo calculations of gaseous dynamics will be carried out on a
supercomputer to couple the fundamental data to predictions of analytical signal
behavior. If successful, inexpensive methods for ultratrace quantification will
be at hand, which will compete in performance with the much more expensive
plasma/mass spectrometric techniques now in use.
