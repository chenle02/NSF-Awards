Davidson 9707932 Studies will assess the relationship between "key innovations"
in the digestive anatomy of ants and the carbohydrate (CHO) : protein (N) ratios
in ant diets. Experimental manipulations of diet, together with other
investigations, will determine the effects of CHO: N ratios on ant foraging
"tempos" and paths (correlated with food discovery rates), territoriality, and
offensive and defensive chemical weaponry. Stable isotope ratios, % dry weight
nitrogen measures, and "giving-up concentrations" for CHO and N resources, will
be investigated as potential indicators of ant dependency on plant resources and
should be intercorrelated. The extent of evolved dependency of various ant taxa
on exudates vs. prey will be further assessed in laboratory feeding trials. All
comparisons among taxa will be made in legitimate phylogenetic contexts. The PIs
will also examine the ways in which other organisms (plants, insects, etc.) may
have evolved to manipulate ants via the CHON ratios of food rewards. Results
should suggest ways in which ant taxa with different diets can be manipulated by
CHO:N ratios in potential food sources. The PIs should also be useful in
assessing the functional by which some pest ants have broken the evolutionary
trade-off between characteristics leading to rapid resource discovery vs. those
correlated with resource domination.
