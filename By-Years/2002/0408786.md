Professor Hans Christian Andersen of Stanford University is supported by an
award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to carry out
research in which improved theoretical methods for understanding the glass
transition are developed. Three interrelated approaches are taken, all of which
make combined use of a formally exact diagrammatic theory and simulations which
are used to test predictions of this diagrammatic theory. The three approaches
to understanding the glass transition include: development of accurate
approximate kinetic theories for the determination of time correlation functions
of atomic liquids in the low temperature equilibrium liquid and slightly
supercooled liquid regimes; the development of lattice models for liquids and
polymers; and the study of the inhomogeneous nature of relaxation toward the
glass transition in simple lattice models. This theoretical research is
important for understanding the glass transition, since critical slowing down
occurs as the transition is approached, making simulations difficult or
impossible, and requiring the development of better analytical theories. The
research is expected to have a broad impact on several technologies including
supercooled liquids, colloidal solutions, phase ordering and granular
media.&lt;br/&gt;
