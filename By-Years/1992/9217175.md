Vocal learning has evolved independently and is widespread in two distinct
groups of birds, songbirds and parrots. Thus, parrots and songbirds have both
independently solved similar neurological and developmental problems related to
vocal learning. Contrast and comparison of vocal learning in songbirds and
parrots can then provide insight into the underlying biological processes of
this complex learned behavior. To best understand these processes, many
different researchers simultaneously study behavior, development, perception,
hearing, and neuroanatomy of a few key species. The parrot species that is
receiving the most study in the laboratory setting is the domesticated
Australian parakeet, the budgerigar; however, little field work has been done.
Further, it is unknown if the domesticated form, which has received so much
study, has diverged from the wild form. Dr. Farabaugh will describe the vocal
behavior and repertoires of wild budgerigars and will bring back 20 wild
budgerigars to the University of Maryland in order to test their hearing and
perception of sound. From these data, she will be able to address the function
of vocal learning in budgerigars as well as determine to what degree
domesticated budgerigars are different from the wild form. A lack of difference
would support the studies already conducted on captive domesticated budgerigars.
Alternatively, the discovery of differences would open new avenues of profitable
comparative research investigating the neurological underpinnings of the
observed differences. This research is important because it will provide basic
behavioral data on the key parrot species for intensive study of vocal learning.
This data base will allow comparison and contrast not only of wild and domestic
budgerigars but also of parrots and songbirds. Such comparative studies increase
our understanding of the basic biological processes that underlie complex
learned behavior in all species, including humans.
