9312772 Hsuan The objective of this research is to provide a data base of
knowledge and a prediction methodology in the area of long term behavior of high
density polyethylene (HPDE) geomembranes. Its primary focus is to predict the
functional lifetime of the material used in landfills and surface impoundments
based on short term accelerated laboratory tests. Elevated temperature is the
principal acceleration factor. Extrapolations to lower site specific
temperatures will be performed utilizing Arrhenius modeling techniques.
Additionally the project will also attempt to correlate between microscopic
(i.e. changes in physical and chemical properties) macroscopic (i.e. changes in
mechanical properties) behavior. ***
