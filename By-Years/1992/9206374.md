This award supports the research of Professor R. Stanley and Professor G.C.
Rota to work in combinatorics. Professor Stanley intends to work on Schubert
polynomials and the connection between subdivisions and local h-vectors.
Professor Rota will work on the umbral calculus and invariant theory. The
research is in the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find
efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects can be organized.
And, so it is extremely important to modern communications, for example the
design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of algorithms in
computer science.
