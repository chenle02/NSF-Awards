This project will focus primarily on problems arising in the theory of elliptic
partial differential equations. They are motivated to some extent by
considerations of quasiregular mappings in n-dimensional Euclidean space. These
are considered as natural extensions to higher dimension of classical analytic
function theory. In addition, solutions of quasilinear elliptic partial
differential equations replace harmonic functions. The conformally invariant
extension to n-dimensions of the Laplace operator is the so-called N-Laplacian.
Work will be done in seeking conditions on bounded weak solutions of quasilinear
equations to have gradients of bounded mean oscillation. Even in the linear case
this question is still open. Estimates on the oscillation of boundary values of
the gradient will be sought. Another line of investigation will focus on the
existence of branched quasiregular maps. When the maps are sufficiently smooth,
no branching occurs. The minimal smoothness assumptions are not known. Finally,
studies will be made of parabolic divergence type equations to establish whether
Holder continuity can be expected of bounded weak solutions. This work is
related to research in conformal geometry and potential theory.
