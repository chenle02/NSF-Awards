This project will fund special sessions at the National Educational Computing
Conference. The speakers at the sessions will be past and current recipients of
DUE grants who will share their expertise and experience with the NECC audience.
The speakers will be chosen for their work in pre-college education and teacher
preparation and will interact with other educators involved in computer-based
education.
