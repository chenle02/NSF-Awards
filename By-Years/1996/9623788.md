AST 9623788 ABSTRACT A two-channel infrared camera with a 1024 x 1024 pixel
HgCdTe array will be constructed. The camera will initially be used for imaging
at the 2.3 meter telescope of the Steward Observatory. In a second phase of the
work, the camera will be used at the 6.5 meter telescope, the converted MMT,
where it will take advantage of an adaptive optical system on the telescope to
provide a large field (~ 40 arcsec) corrected to diffraction-limited resolution
in the JHK bands. The resolution ranges from images of 0.032 arcsec FWHM at 1
micrometer wavelength (in the best seeing) to routine high Strehl images of 0.16
arcsec at 5 micrometers. Wavelengths above 2 micrometers will be accessed with a
second 1024 x 1024 array of InSb, to be procured in the third year. The cooled
optics include a dichroic beamsplitter to allow two color imaging in one
exposure.
