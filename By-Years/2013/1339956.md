The Montclair State University (MSU) Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program is
recruiting, preparing, and supporting 30 new science teachers for New Jersey's
high-need K-12 school districts. The project is offering scholarships equal to
the amount of New Jersey in-state tuition and fees to Biology, Chemistry, Earth
Science, and Physics majors in their junior and senior years who were recruited
in their freshman or as transfer students and subsequently admitted into the
Teacher Education Program. The PI team is promoting the diversification of the
population of science teachers by recruiting STEM majors from three
collaborating community colleges: the County College of Morris, Essex County
College, and Passaic County Community College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Noyce
Scholars participate in a Science Career Survey Experience (SCSE) that is
coordinated with university partners in local biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and
manufacturing industries, as well as The Liberty Science Center, a nationally
renowned science museum. The purpose of the SCSE component of the Noyce program
is to cultivate a working knowledge of the how the curricular content of high
school science classes is currently used in these careers, and the expectation
is that these experiences will influence their
teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also advances discovery and
understanding through a research program entitled Knowledge in Science Teaching
(KiST). The KiST project is studying the way in which individuals learn to teach
secondary science in diverse classrooms and examining changes in science
teachers' pedagogical content knowledge over the course of the teacher
preparation program and through student teaching.
