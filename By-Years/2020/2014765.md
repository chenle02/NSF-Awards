The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project will develop a new solution to help prevent insect-borne
diseases, such as malaria, Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Over half the worldâ€™s
population is at risk of contracting an insect-borne disease, and the global
mosquito repellent market is expected to grow to $11 billion by 2021. Use of
personal repellents is a promising solution to prevent insect-borne diseases,
but challenges include adherence because products may only be effective for a
few hours (and less when rubbed or washed off). The proposed technology is a
material to serve as a platform for insect repellents in a costly and effective
fashion. The proposed material enables ultra-long-lasting efficacy and will be
customizable, waterproof, not absorbed into the bloodstream, and imperceptible
to the touch when applied to the skin. The technology could be extended to other
applications, such as antimicrobial use and sunscreen.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a platform
technology to extend the life of functional skin products. Phase I aims are to:
1) Optimize a skin formulation for repelling insects with performance goals:
99%+ efficacy for at least 3 days, waterproof, not absorbed into the
bloodstream, containing zero synthetic repellents, and imperceptible to touch
when applied to skin; 2) Explore the parameter space for manufacturing the
polymer and insect repellent formulation at scale; 3) Conduct testing to
determine efficacy of the insect repellent formulation compared to a reference
formulation; 4) Demonstrate extended life of a variety of active ingredients for
utilization in topical sunscreen and antimicrobial products. Phase I work will
establish feasibility of the proposed platform, while meeting a recognized need
in the area of protection from vector-borne illnesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
