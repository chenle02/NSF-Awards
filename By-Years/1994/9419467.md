O'Neil 9419467 This research will determine how the genetic correlation among
traits may constrain the ability of a species to become optimally adapted.
Specifically, working with the plant species, purple loosestrife, the researcher
will manipulate the timing of flowering events to determine which
characteristics, such as flowering duration, date of flowering initiation, and
flowering synchrony, are genetically correlated. Preliminary results suggest
that selection favors individuals with certain combinations of traits that are
negatively correlated with other traits also favored by selection. Consequently,
the optimal, or best, combination of traits for seed production may not be
achievable by selection. The results of this research will provide plant
breeders with information on how genetic correlations among traits may constrain
the improvement of domesticated plants. For example, selecting for traits such
as higher fruit yield, could lead to selecting for undesirable characters
correlated with the traits of interest. This research will also provide basic
ecological information on purple loosestrife, a pest species taking over
wetlands, and provide information useful in controlling the spread of this
species.
