9312918 Saltiel Photoisomerization in olefins having one or more conjugated
double bonds will be studied. Progressively more complex olefins will be
studied, starting from stilbenes, through 1,6-diphenylhexatrienes to
bacteriorhodopsin. The question of diradicaloid versus zwitterionic twisted
excited singlet states will be examined in the simpler olefins by evaluating
medium, substituent, and structural effects on their photochemistry and
spectroscopy. Emission and product quantum yields will be measured as functions
of medium, temperature, and excitation wavelength. The method of principal
component analysis with self-modeling (PCA-SM) will be used to analyze these
data. From this analysis, intermediates and the mechanisms of the
photoisomerization processes will be determined. %%% This grant from the Organic
Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Professor Jack Saltiel at
Florida State University. Mechanisms of rotation about carbon-carbon double
bonds that are induced by absorption of light in the visible or ultraviolet
region will be studied. Of particular interest will be compounds that have
alternating carbon- carbon double and single bonds. The most complex molecule in
this study is bacteriorhodopsin, the visual pigment. Light emission and product
yields, based on the amount of light absorbed, as a function of solvent,
temperature and excitation wavelength will be treated by a modeling program.
This treatment will allow a description of the mechanism of these
photoisomerization reactions. ***
