The Pacific Coast Undergraduate Mathematics Conference (PCUMC) is a one-day
conference specifically for undergraduate math students in the Southern
California region. The conference is held annually each spring at rotating
institutions in Southern California and will be held at California Polytechnic
State University at Pomona on March 9, 2013. The conference has been designed so
that all sessions and keynote addresses are accessible to undergraduates and
that panel discussion topics would be of particular interest to math majors and
students in math-related fields. The key components of each conference are (1)
student talks in all fields of mathematics, (2) panel discussions on career
opportunities, summer opportunities and/or graduate programs in mathematics, and
(3)lively, accessible keynote addresses by reputable professionals.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference organizers strive to attract student
participants and speakers at all levels and provide them with valuable
information about professional opportunities in mathematics. By designing some
of the student sessions specifically for first or second year students, the
organizers hope to encourage more freshmen and sophomore math students to attend
the conference and participate in the sessions. Students can present on
everything from results of original research to purely expository work. The
conference organizers have also been extremely successful in encouraging the
participation of women and underrepresented minorities. Through participant
tracking, we expect to see that the PCUMC students are positively impacted in
their mathematical career trajectories, including likelihood to consider
graduate school, increased participation in extracurricular mathematics
opportunities and success in finding mathematical employment. There is a
national need for more well trained mathematicians, and the PCUMC is designed to
play a role in encouraging bright mathematics students early to persist in and
expand their mathematical studies.
