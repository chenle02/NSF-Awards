This project continues mathematical research into problems of complex function
theory, concentrating on geometric ideas which use differential geometric tools.
The common feature in the investigation of all these problems is the use of
conformal metrics, especially the hyperbolic, euclidean and spherical metrics.
One is interested in obtaining information about one conformal geometry, say
hyperbolic, in terms of another conformal (usually euclidean) geometry or in
studying analytic functions viewed as mappings from one geometry to another. For
instance, from this perspective, Bloch functions are precisely those analytic
functions from hyperbolic to euclidean geometry with bounded distortion.
Problems of interest include two-point comparison theorems for euclidean and
hyperbolic geometry, generalized convexity-concavity properties of the
hyperbolic metric, Bloch and linearly invariant functions, quasi-invariant
domain constants, and a study of various conformal metrics and distance
functions defined by families of holomorphic or harmonic functions. Complex
function theory encompasses the study of differentiable functions of a complex
variable and related classes of functions such as harmonic functions and
quasiconformal mappings. The subject is highly geometric; many of the problems
concern the properties of various sets under transform by functions from one of
the above classes. Applications of the theory to potential theory and fluid
dynamics are standard in engineering circles.
