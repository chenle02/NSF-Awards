Gareth Ruane is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the California
Institute of Technology. Ruane will build and test instruments designed to study
the detection of Earth-like planets around other stars ("exoplanets"). The
search for signatures of biological activity in the atmospheres of Earth-like
planets, the aim of this work, is a major effort in the study of exoplanets.
This award could also lead to significant advances in the capabilities of
astronomical instrumentation. In addition to instrument development, Ruane will
lead a program within the Pasadena Unified School District designed to encourage
interest in science and engineering in a diverse population of students from
historically underrepresented groups.

The detection of biosignatures in the spectrum of an Earth-like exoplanet
requires instruments that can discriminate light from a host star many
magnitudes brighter than the exoplanet, over a large spectral bandwidth, coupled
with high throughput from the off-axis planet. With the construction of larger
telescopes, the newer structures in the telescope apertures introduce
diffraction of the brighter starlight, complicating the existing mechanisms used
for starlight suppression. Ruane has designed new types of optical components
that are optimized for large, obstructed, potentially segmented telescope
apertures similar to those planned for ground-based and space-based telescopes.
These designs will be refined and tested both in laboratories at Caltech and
JPL, and on sky at the Palomar and Keck Observatories. Ruane will also conduct
an outreach program aimed at encouraging interest in science and engineering
among students at the Pasadena Unified School District.
