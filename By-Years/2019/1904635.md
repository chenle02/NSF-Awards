This award supports a four-day Conference in Discrete Geometry and Algebraic
Combinatorics to be held from April 29 to May 2, 2019 in South Padre Island, TX.
The conference, the 10th in a series, is devoted to a wide range of classical
and modern problems in these active areas of mathematical research. The
conferences bring together students and researchers in the region centered at
the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Due to the diverse composition of the
student body, conference organizers expect to be able to attract a sizable
fraction of attendees from among groups traditionally underrepresented in U.S.
mathematics studies. The grant provides travel support for graduate students and
early-career researchers, as well as non-local participants without other
sources of support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics to be discussed at the
conference include packings, coverings, and tilings; rigidity and flexibility;
geometric graph theory; topological combinatorics; incidence structures;
lattices and discrete groups; geometric set partitioning and transversals;
optimal configurations; spherical and Euclidean designs; semidefinite and linear
programming in coding theory and discrete geometry. More information is
available at the conference website

mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
