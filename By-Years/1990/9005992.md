A procedure, called temporal logic model checking, for automatic verification of
concurrent programs has been developed. This procedure determines if a
collection of finite-state processes satisfies its specification in a
propositional temporal logic by methodically searching the global state graph
determined by the processes. The first part of this project deals with temporal
logic model checking and how it can be extended to verify hardware controllers,
cache coherency protocols, and real-time programs. In particular, new techniques
(various methods for compositional model checking, alternative state space
representations using binary decision graphs and partial orders, etc.) will be
developed to extend the size of the finite state programs that can be handled
using this technique. The second part of this project deals with parallel
theorem proving and symbolic computation. A parallel resolution theorem prover
called Parthenon has been built. In this project, a number of important
algorithms for theorem proving and symbolic computation will be implemented on
different types of multiprocessors.
