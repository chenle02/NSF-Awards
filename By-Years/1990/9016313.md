This award supports the research in the analytic theory of automorphic forms of
Professor Isaac Efrat of the University of Maryland at College Park. Dr. Efrat
has proposed to investigate a collection of problems in the harmonic analysis of
graphs and surfaces that arise as quotients of spaces of rank one, modulo
discrete groups. These problems stem from questions about the existence of
discrete spectra for such groups, and the construc- tion of discrete
eigenfunctions for them. Other aspects of Professor Efrat's project involve the
study of certain arith- metically defined Eisenstein series attached to non-
congruence subgroups. Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth
century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that century,
mathematicians had realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-
Euclidean in their basic nature. The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane
geometries has given rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which
the study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active. This field
is principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use
of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots.
