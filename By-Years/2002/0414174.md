This project seeks to uncover the fundamental aspects of the biophysics
associated with synchronization in small groups of neurons, in particular to
investigate the role of synaptic plasticity, widely believed to underlie memory
and learning, in synchronization and information transport in neural circuits.
The members of the project will investigate this question both in their
biological laboratory as well as using numerical and electronic simulations of
the neurons seen in the lab. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers from
Physics and Biology will work alongside the principal researchers and in their
training they will learn about the biological sciences as well as the physical
processes underlying the biological activity.
