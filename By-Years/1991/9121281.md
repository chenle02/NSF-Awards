This U.S.-Hungary research project between Dr. Gabor T. Herman of the
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Dr. Attila Kuba of Kalmar
Laboratory of Cybernetics, Jozsef Attila University, Szeged, Hungary, has the
long-term objective to develop computational and mathematical procedures for the
reconstruction of internal structures in a body from data collected by detectors
(sensitive to some sort of energy) outside of the body and for the visualization
and analysis of information contained in these reconstructions. These procedures
are applicable in many areas of science and engineering, including:
neuroscience, medical imaging, industrial inspection, geoscience, astronomy, and
fluid dynamics. This project in radiology fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas
of strong mutual interest and competence.
