This experimental research program will precisely study the quantum scattering
of ultracold cesium atoms in an atomic clock. The group has demonstrated a new
type of scattering experiment that scatters a cesium atom in a coherent
superposition of its two clock states off atoms in a pure state at ultracold
temperatures. Each clock state experiences an s-wave scattering phase shift and,
by detecting only the scattered part of each atom's wavefunction, the difference
of the scattering phase shifts is directly observed as a phase shift of Ramsey
fringes. A unique feature is that the observed difference of the scattering
phase shifts is independent of the atomic density. The technique provides atomic
clock accuracy to scattering measurements and is expected to significantly
improve our knowledge of atomic interactions that are relevant for laser-cooled
cesium clocks.

The group will perform precision measurements of the scattering of different
internal states of cesium as a function of magnetic field. These experiments
will constrain unambiguously and help to determine precisely the ultracold
cesium-cesium interactions that are still insufficiently known. Better knowledge
of the interactions is required for the frequency shifts of atomic clocks due to
ultracold scattering, especially at the very low energies of cesium clocks in
microgravity.

Broader impacts of this program include the training of a graduate student in
many areas of modern technology from lasers, electro-optics, radio-frequency and
microwave techniques, ultra-high vacuum, and atomic clocks and frequency
control. The work will impact the understanding of ultracold atom-atom
interactions with highly precise measurements, giving important information
about the ultracold cesium interactions for laser-cooled microgravity clocks.
This information will help establish and improve the accuracy of a space-based
laser-cooled atomic clock under construction.
