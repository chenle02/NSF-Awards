Mixing, transport and sequestration of heat in the Earth's oceans contributes a
major element of uncertainty to our present understanding of the climate system.
Double diffusive instability refers to a set of mixing processes that have no
analogue in the atmosphere and whose existence was unsuspected before 1960.
Driven by the vast difference in the molecular diffusivities of heat and salt in
seawater, these processes contribute significantly to ocean mixing. In the
simplest model, double diffusion takes one of two forms: salt fingering and
diffusive layering, both of which form easily recognizable thermohaline
staircase structures in many regions of the world ocean. Salt fingering is
common in mid-latitude waters, while diffusive layering is more prominent near
the poles. This theoretical study of shear / double diffusion interactions will
illuminate mixing mechanisms active in the large regions of the ocean interior
that are subject to both shear and double diffusive instability. The research
will employ a combination of primary and secondary stability analyses and direct
numerical simulations. These will focus on inflectional shear flows (with and
without inertial rotation) and fingering-favorable stratification. Broader
Impacts: Besides furnishing new physical insights into this oceanographically
important regime of stratified turbulence, the work will result in improved
parameterizations of diapycnal fluxes and anisotropy statistics for use both in
the analysis of observational data and in large-scale modeling. The proposed
work will benefit society by improving the representation of small-scale fluxes
in large-scale ocean and climate models, thereby addressing one of the main
obstacles to reliable climate forecasting. The project will provide partial
support for a scientific programmer and full support for a graduate student, who
will learn the latest techniques for the theoretical study of ocean mixing. The
research will be done in collaboration with Professor Eric. Kunze of the
University of Victoria, Canada.
