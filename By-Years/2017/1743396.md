This award provides support for the Biomedical Engineering Society's Advanced
Biomanufacturing Special Interest Group to hold its first conference on August
18-19, 2017, at the University of Wisconsin. The theme of the conference is
"Biomanufacturing: Past Successes and Future Challenges." The small meeting will
allow plenty of opportunity for networking between all attendees. The two-day
conference will consist of keynote and plenary speeches, oral and poster
presentations, panel discussions, a biotech showcase exhibition, and a tour to
local biomanufacturing companies. In addition, to generate interaction between
industry and academia, there will be a "un-conference," which is an interactive
session where people coalesce around topics they are interested in with minimal
guidance from conference organizers. Advanced biomanufacturing has become a
focus area for advancement within the US economy. This conference will spur
collaborations between academic researchers as well as between academia and
industry in order to tackle some of the remaining challenges on the road to
successful and efficient manufacturing of cellular and tissue components.
Support of students and junior faculty to attend the conference will enhance
their professional development by allowing them to participate in this focused
conference and the networking activities with both established researchers and
industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced biomanufacturing has become an area of
national focus. The overall aim of this inaugural meeting is to stimulate
collaborations and promote research and education programs in advanced
biomanufacturing. Building on the success in protein and small molecule
manufacturing, the focus of this meeting will be on the challenges faced in
manufacturing of cells and tissues. The specific goals of the meeting are to:
identify new collaboration opportunities between academia and industry; grow and
sustain advanced biomanufacturing industries and research programs; form a
community to share ideas, resources, and technologies; introduce junior
investigators to research leaders and encourage interactions; and expose
students to exciting research at the cutting edge of advanced biomanufacturing
and regulatory sciences. The award will partially support travel for 12 keynote
speakers, 8 graduate student travel awards, and 4 travel awards for junior
faculty.
