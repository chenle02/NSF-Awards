Missing data is a problem that plagues every branch of empirical science.
Sensors do not always work reliably, respondents do not fill out every question
in the questionnaire, and medical patients are often unable to recall episodes,
treatments or outcomes. This project attempts to recover information of interest
from partially observed data by reasoning about the process that could have
caused some data to be missing and others to be observed. Recent advances in
graphical models and causal inference permit us to describe such processes
formally and identify conditions under which recovery from missing data would be
feasible and, if so, how. This project will focus on conditions in which
recovery is deemed infeasible by available techniques. By learning to manage
such conditions this research will benefit empirical research in a variety of
fields, including machine learning, big data, epidemiology, statistics,
economics, social science and medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the
proposed research is to develop computer systems capable of learning from
incomplete data by encoding assumptions in a graphical causal model. Using such
models we will identify conditions that facilitate (or prohibit) inference and
learning. In particular, this research will develop effective procedures for
determining whether unbiased estimates of statistical and causal relationships
can be computed given incomplete data and whether assumptions that facilitate
such estimability have testable implications. Additionally, it will generate
bounds for those relationships that are proved to be inestimable. These will in
turn lead to a theoretical understanding of what is possible and impossible
under missing data conditions. Given the ubiquity of the missing data problem we
believe this research will create new and important tools for all data-intensive
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
