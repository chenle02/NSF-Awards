9452009 Romanishin An old (1930's vintage), hard-to-operate 10 inch Newtonian
telescope will be replaced with a modern teaching telescope and electronic
imaging camera. The new telescope will be used to enhance the teaching of
astronomy and technology at both the introductory non-science major survey
course and at the senior astronomy/astrophysics major level. The new electronic
imaging camera will allow even non-science students to record simple
observations that they can look at and manipulate using a computer. There is a
new student computer lab in the Physics Department which will allow
participation in these activities by all students. This equipment, although
simple enough for introductory students to use under supervision, will be
powerful enough that the junior/senior astronomy/astrophysics majors will be
able to obtain data that they will be able to analyze in a more sophisticated
manner, to illustrate important aspects of observational astronomy in a real
"hands-on" approach not now possible.
