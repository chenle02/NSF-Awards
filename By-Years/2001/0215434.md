This funding will allow Florida International University (FIU) to contribute a
key technology component to the 2002 AMPATH StarLight Rio Grid Workshop in
Brazil. FIU has lead the nation in establishing research networking connectivity
to South Amercan through the AMPATH Project. A corporate donation has been made
to provide high-speed connectivity between StarLight in Chicago and AMPATH in
Miami and thus from Miami and to Rio. The proposal forms a partnership with
three scientific applications. This will bring an un-paralleled level of network
services to them for an appropriate tuning period and then for the length of the
conference. The workshop has a high likelyhood of inciting subsequent non U.S.
investment in networking infrastructure that would benefit currently challenged
U.S. programs.
