The purpose of this project is to introduce Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FT-IR) into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. FT-IR is an
advanced technique used widely in industrial and academic chemical research. FT-
IR spectroscopy allows improvements in the quality of chemistry instruction by
providing high resolution spectra and computer- assisted analysis and
presentation of spectral data. A low-cost FT-IR spectrometer, capable of
providing high-quality spectral data, will be used in at least four courses
spanning three sub-areas of chemistry: organic, physical, and instrumental
analysis. In addition, this instrument will be used extensively as an analytic
tool in undergraduate research. The use of the FT-IR spectrometer will result in
direct experience with FT techniques, and will allow new, pedagogically superior
experiments to be integrated into several laboratory classes.
