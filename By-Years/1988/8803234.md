Investigations in Gravitational Physics will continue in the study of
relativistic theories of dissipative fluids. Fundamental issues will be
considered, and applications to astrophysical situations begun. The theory of
shock waves in relativistic dissipative fluids will be developed. Applications
will be made to the theory of galaxy formation in cosmic string "wakes",
stability of relativistic stellar models, and relativistic heavy ion collisions.
The relation of general relativity to quantum physics will also be examined in
several areas.
