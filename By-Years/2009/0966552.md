Non-destructive, high-resolution imaging using x-ray and neutron tomography has
become an extremely valuable tool in geoscience and geoengineering research.
Louisiana State University and the Naval Research Laboratory, Seafloor Sciences
Branch, will be co-hosting GeoX 2010: 3rd International Workshop on X-ray CT for
Geomaterials in New Orleans, LA, March 1-3, 2010. GeoX 2010 follows two highly
successful GeoX workshops (2003 in Japan and 2006 in France). NSF funding is
requested to support U.S. graduate students and junior faculty participation in
a one-day pre-workshop and then attendance at GeoX 2010. The pre-workshop is
designed to educate potential new users of these technologies on: (1)
fundamentals of x-ray and neutron tomography; (2) basic image processing and
analysis techniques, with particular emphasis on geomaterials; and (3) various
federal, university, and private sector x-ray and neutron tomography facilities.
This material will provide essential concepts and background for investigators
that are considering using tomography for their research and will prepare
attendees so that they can fully benefit from the GeoX 2010 presentations and
discussions.&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination of pre-workshop information will be
primarily through the workshop web site supplemented by e-mailings. Potential
participants will be asked to submit requests for support, and these
applications will be reviewed by the workshop organizing committee with the goal
of increasing the range of participants at the workshop. Participants will be
given pre- and post-workshop questionnaires; the organizers and speakers wish to
better know the participants concerns and whether or not those concerns were
adequately addressed by the pre-workshop tutorials.&lt;br/&gt; The workshop will
provide funds to graduate students and junior faculty from US institutions to
attend the workshop which will enable them to utilize computed and neutron
tomography in their research. They will also meet experienced researchers from
US, Europe, and Japan which will foster possible future collaboration.
