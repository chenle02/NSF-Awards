9628787 Meerow With combined expertise in morphological and molecular studies of
plants, Drs. Alan Meerow and Charles Guy of the University of Florida are
investigating the phylogenetic relationships among tropical New World members of
the large and taxonomically difficult family Amaryllidaceae. Building upon
Meerow's field experience in the neotropics, the investigators have developed a
network of collaborators in South America who can provide materials of localized
species, material that will include samples for DNA sequencing to yield new
molecular information for taxonomic comparisons. The new data from sequencing of
nuclear ribosomal DNA will be integrated with other molecular results from
colleagues in England, and in turn, these data will be integrated with
morphological and anatomical characters, in collaboration with South African
colleagues. The family Amaryllidaceae, with numerous horticulturally important
forms like Crinum, Narcissus, and Zephyranthes, is notoriously difficult
taxonomically, in part because the floral features used for classification are
suspected to have evolved in parallel (hence, converged in similarity) in
numerous separate lineages in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, for pollination by
moths or birds. Molecular estimates of nucleotide substitutional differences
from 75 or so exemplars of all the New World genera will provide data to
construct a broad genealogical framework for the family, and morphological
characters can then be used to assess fine-scale species-level relationships.
Phylogenetic and taxonomic analyses of the Amaryllidaceae will improve
documentation of biodiversity patterns in the tropics, facilitate study of
biogeographic migrations and regions of endemism, guide selection of stocks for
horticultural improvement, and identify clusters of related species and genera
that may share biosynthetic capabilities, in a family well-known for producing
novel alkaloids, some poisonous to humans.
