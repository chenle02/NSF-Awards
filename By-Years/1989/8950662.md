Students are being provided the opportunity for computer experimentation and
this will help them to develop their mathematical intuition and insight,
expecially in visualizing higher dimensions. The primary focus is on the two-
year sequence of calculus courses, which is taken by mathematics majors and non-
majors alike. Students are able to join more readily in mathematical research
projects accessible to undergraduates, and thus gain the understanding that
mathematics is a continually evolving subject with the potential for new
discoveries. The Classroom Graphics Laboratory is equiped with Macintosh SE
computers which are running Mathematica, a powerful graphics and symbolic
manipulation package. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal
amount of funds.
