A workshop on symplectic geometry will be held at the Isaac Newton Institute in
Cambridge, England on August 14-18, 2017. This award supports the participation
of US-based researchers. The conference topics center on an area of geometry
united by certain common ideas: the importance of moduli spaces, the relation
between differential-geometric and algebro-geometric concepts, and semi-
infinite-dimensional homology theories. The workshop aims to provide a venue for
both junior and advanced researchers to broaden their outlook beyond their
existing areas of expertise, by being exposed to promising new areas of
activity. This award intends to offer this opportunity to a diverse group of US-
based participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the meeting is to reconnect
these research strands and spur interactions, as illustrated by the following
examples. Talks will discuss work in progress relating gauge theory and the
Four-Color Theorem. The considerable computational difficulties in this project
may well be more approachable from other directions, including Fukaya categories
and mirror symmetry, which are the areas of expertise of several speakers,
making the conference a good venue for catalyzing that interaction. Another talk
will discuss recent work on equivariance in Floer cohomology, a powerful tool
that should have many concrete topological applications; among the participants
are leaders from the well-developed field of equivariant symplectic topology,
who can contribute ideas for such applications. Higher-dimensional gauge theory
is another subject that, following recent breakthroughs, seems ready for wider
developments. At the conference, leading specialists from the analytic side and
from Picard-Lefschetz theory will contribute their respective viewpoints.
