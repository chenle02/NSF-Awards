This international collaboration between the PI and Gerhard Michler at the
UniversitÂªt Gesamthochschule Essen will develop a better fit between network-
based parallel architectures and applications. The U.S. personnel are experts in
computer architectures, while the German group's expertise is in algebraic
applications. The interaction collaboration between the two groups will result
in ways to restructure underlying algorithms and better support software for
parallel computations, as well as generate methods to reduce the current
communications overhead between workstations. Lessons learned in solving
problems associated with applications for parallel and distributed systems will
benefit many other applications areas. In addition, flexible, stable, efficient,
and user-friendly parallel systems will greatly benefit the computational
infrastructure of science and engineering. Through this project, the U.S. group
will gain access to a highly respected computer algebra group, and to the
knowledge in the German national computer-algebra focus program administered by
the German equivalent of NSF.
