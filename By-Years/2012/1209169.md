The University of Cincinnati ADVANCE program integrates programming and policy
change in an effort to broaden participation and improve the climate for STEM
women faculty. This is accomplished through bottom-up initiatives, top-down
leadership reform initiatives and advocacy and accountability initiatives. These
initiatives will be implemented through a range of strategies that includes, but
is not limited to professional development workshops for STEM women faculty at
all career stages, learning communities for informal and formal mentoring and
mini-grants to support research, professional development, and collaborative
activities. Also, an Accountability and Advocacy Council (AAC), comprised of
various institutional stakeholders, coordinates and ensures the integration of
these various top-down and bottom up strategies with the goal of producing
actionable and sustainable change. The social science research that forms much
of the framework of this effort is centered on discourse analysis as it relates
to online communications to STEM scientists. Through traditional means of
dissemination, the work of the University of Cincinnati has the potential to
influence not only other ADVANCE programs, but all of higher education. This
project is expected to also seminally contribute to the body of knowledge
related to of research on the underrepresentation of women in the STEM
disciplines.
