ABSTRACT The Workshop on Cross-Language Speech Perception will bring together
22 investigators currently pursuing programmatic research in 4 areas: 1)
development of language-specific patterns of perception during first language
acquisition, 2) perception by multilingual children and adults, 3) perceptual
changes during foreign language learning, 4) modification of perception in the
laboratory (perceptual training studies). The 4-day workshop will provide an
opportunity for intensive disucssions of theoretical issues and methodological
problems among senior investigators and less experienced researchers.
Presentations will include: 1) individual oral reports, 2) panel discussions on
broad topics of concern, and 3) poster sessions in which graduate students,
postdoctoral students and established researchers can present new experimental
results. The audience will be interested faculty and students, including
students of the invited participants. During the workshop, participants will
complete plans for publication of a monograph which will include jointly-
authoried papers on recent data on cross-language speech perception, current
theoretical perspectives, methodological issues, and directions for future
research. The objectives of the workshop are to: 1) provide a forum for in-depth
exchange of "cutting edge" information on cross-language speech research, 2)
facilitate collaboration in future research, and 3) provide a set of "position
papers" which summarize the status of knowledge of this research area.
