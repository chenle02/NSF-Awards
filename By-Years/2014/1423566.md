Present-day cryptography crucially relies on secret-key cryptography, the
setting where communicating parties use a shared secret key, hidden to the
attacker, to securely encrypt and/or authenticate data. Secret-key cryptography
is based on standardized efficient algorithms known as cryptographic primitives,
such as block ciphers and hash functions. These act as building blocks for so-
called modes of operations, cryptographic algorithms achieving strong security
goals for encryption and authentication, and which are orders of magnitude
faster than public-key ones. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the
two shortcomings of current symmetric key cryptography, namely the lack of
provable security for existing block ciphers and the lack of flexibility due to
fixed parameters in existing implementations of primitives. The project develops
new provably secure ciphers with strong security guarantees under the assumption
that an attacker only has black box access to a simple underlying component. The
investigator explores a new formal model that captures tradeoffs between local
computation and key-dependent access in cryptographic attacks, and develops new
modes of operation with improved security under this new viewpoint. The project
will have broad impact on society by laying the foundations for the development
of secret key cryptography which is used to secure modern communications and
commerce.
