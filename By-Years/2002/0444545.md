This grant uses small islands as a model system to understand how ecological
systems work. Small islands are simple and numerous, facilitating interpretation
and statistical replication. A major goal is to determine the effects of a large
predatory species, concentrating on how that species affects an intermediate
predatory species, and through it,lower levels of the food web such as other
predators, herbivores and plants. While many kinds of effects will be studied, a
particular focus is how natural selection changes traits of the intermediate
predator, in turn modifying how the latter affects lower levels. Models of
extinction will continue to be developed and tested with field data. The speed
and extent of recovery from hurricanes will be ascertained for the animals,
plants and habitat in our study sites.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Results of this
grant, which seeks in part to establish broad ecological principles, also have
important applications. These include improving yield from agroecosystems,
predicting consequences of biological invasions, assessing hurricane damage and
potential for recovery, and preserving species and habitat. The grant
contributes importantly to educational outreach, particularly of undergraduates,
by making possible their direct participation in field and laboratory
studies.&lt;br/&gt;
