The Artic Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS) will administer and implement,
"Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating (PolarTREC)", an
international program that brings together U.S. teachers to participate in
cutting-edge field research with polar scientists in various, and often remote,
locations in the Arctic and Antarctica. Through hands-on field experiences in
the Arctic and Antarctica, participating teachers (pre-service and in-service)
will improve teaching strategies, develop resources for their careers, and
change how they teach STEM in the classroom. The program goal is to invigorate
polar science education and understanding by bringing educators and polar
researchers together in professional collaboration. By integrating research and
education, PolarTREC will help sustain and grow the considerable scientific and
public enthusiasm for polar research and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARCUS
will support a total of twelve teachers for Arctic field seasons in 2017 and
Antarctic field seasons in 2017/2018. ARCUS will recruit, select, and match
teachers and researchers, maintain a website for dissemination of information
about the expeditions, provide orientation training for the teachers that
includes field safety and communication training, provide travel support for the
teachers to meet with scientists prior to deployments and for them to join the
scientific expeditions in the field, and evaluate results of the program.
Dissemination efforts via the website and public presentations are expected to
reach many additional teachers, students, scientists and the public.
