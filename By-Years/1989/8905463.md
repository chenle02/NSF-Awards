This research concerns hydrodynamic phenomena occurring in gas-liquid-solid
fluidized beds. Specific areas of investigation include transient bed expansion
dynamics, bubble wake dynamics, and mass transfer to particles and gas bubbles
in the wake region of fluidized bed bubbles. Three phase fluidized beds are
important gas-liquid-solid contacting devices being applied to chemical,
petrochemical and biochemical processing. This research should aid in the
design, scale-up or operation of such contactors.
