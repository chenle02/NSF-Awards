This research is to continue investigation of geological observation and
samples collected during the 1985 Alvin/Atlantis II cruise in the Galapagos
Propagating Rift area 95.5 degrees W. The work will be concentrated on obtaining
an expanded data base of mineral compositions, selected glass separate trace
element compositions, and melt inclusion major elements. The results will answer
some of the fundamental questions about the magma generation and mining
processes in a propagating rift area which has shown interesting petrological
diversity. This study will also contribute to the understanding of the tectonics
of failure and propagation of rifts within a lithospheric plate. The project
will be supported at $65,000 in FY87 for 18 months.
