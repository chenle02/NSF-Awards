Since 1976, plastics have been the most widely used materials in the U.S.,
surpassing steel, copper and aluminum combined by volume. Among the various
plastics processing methods, injection molding accounts for one-third of all
polymers processed. This research is aimed at developing the scientific basis
for a novel co-injection molding process that combines the aesthetic and
processing advantages of injection molding with the property attributes and
benefits of microcellular plastics (MCPs). By integrating solid plastics with
MCPs via co-injection molding, synergistic benefits, such as increased
productivity, reduced energy consumption, additional design freedom in part
geometry, and a means to control the microstructure and properties of the molded
products, can be realized. Furthermore, this environmentally benign process is a
perfect candidate for recycling of post-consumer plastics.

This research involves systematic analytical, experimental, and computational
efforts to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of this novel process,
advance the understanding of the process physics, develop computer modeling and
simulation tools, and incorporate the research activities/results into the
curricula to stimulates students' interest in advanced research and education.
Collaboration with industrial partners in this research facilitates the sharing
of expertise and resources, validation of research outcome, transfer of
technology, education of the workforce, and assessment of the economic gain.
Successful execution of this research will extend the applicability of MCPs and
injection molding, ultimately helping the U.S. plastics industry gain
competitive strength in the global marketplace.
