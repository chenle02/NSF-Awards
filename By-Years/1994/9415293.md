Pressure swing membrane absorption-permeation (PSMABP) is to be demonstrated
and examined for the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in this SGER
project. In PSMABP, air or N2 containing VOCs will be introduced into a hollow
fiber module and separated by a cyclic process. VOCs in N2/air will selectively
permeate the walls of one set of microporous hollow feed fibers, absorb into an
inert high boiling mineral oil, and then emerge into a second set of evacuated
strip fibers. This project can help industry and government to address the
cleanup of VOC contaminated air streams mandated by the Clean Air Act. The
technique to be explored is expected to overcome certain problems with current
technologies.
