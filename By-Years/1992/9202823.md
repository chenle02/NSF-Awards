The primary objective of this doctoral dissertation improvement proposal is to
investigate the relationship between habitat structure and foraging behavior in
two howler monkey populations. Recently, many anthropologists have been
interested in the ways in which morphology and positional behavior relate. One
application of such information is in the added ability to then interpret the
fossil evidence of human and primate evolution. Here, the PIs will observe two
howler monkey populations living in different habitats and with differing
dietary options. The PIs record movement, body postures and vegetational
architecture on video for computer analysis in light of the available food
sources. The results may help elucidate the extent and significance of
interpopulational variation in positional behavior as it relates to habitat
structure and food sources.
