Seven community colleges in South Texas are planning for the development of the
South Texas Advanced Technological Education Center in order to implement a new
paradigm for teaching and learning. The project is ensuring an environment which
fosters inventive curricular revision and faculty development; increasing the
productivity of education and training by using computer-based multimedia and
telelearning systems; expanding resources for innovations; empowering all
faculty and students to learn how to learn, and expanding collaboration between
regional alliances. The application of the paradigm is being accomplished
through a long-term, comprehensive, systematic restructuring process which
involves secondary school teachers; two-year and four-year college and
university faculty; administrators; practicing scientists and engineers;
business and industry representatives; community and governmental agencies; and
professional organizations. The following goals form the core initiatives of the
South Texas Advanced Technological Education Center: (a) develop of model
curricula which reflect both integration and application of concepts within the
real-life/work-related context of a dynamic global society; (b) establish a
faculty enhancement program which provides faculty with development options so
that they can become the force behind curricular changes and innovations; (c)
create a student outreach and support program which recruits, retains, and
supports underrepresented populations for science, mathematics, and
technological careers; (d) broaden collaborative endeavors with present partners
and increase efforts to forge new regional partnerships; and (e) support a
teaching and learning environment which incorporates state-of-the-art equipment
for laboratories and multimedia and telelearning technology in the classroom.
