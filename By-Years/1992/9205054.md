This project is to continue study of ultramafic xenoliths from the Samoan
hotspot chain. Previous work has demonstrated very high noble gas concentrations
in the xenoliths, and at least some of them have highly elevated 3He/4He ratios
(to 22 RA) and non- atmospheric heavy rare gases. Continued studies of xenoliths
from throughout Samoa will provide an important test of the tentative
conclusions reached, based on analyses of xenoliths from just two localities. In
addition, individual crystals will be analyzed by laser fusion to characterize
small-scale noble gas heterogeneity within the xenoliths. To more fully
understand the significance of the rare gas results the PIs plan to study the
gross chemical composition and the filling pressures of the fluid inclusions in
which rare gases reside.
