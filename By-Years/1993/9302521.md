The current award will support travel to an International Conference on the
Commission on Plant Gene Nomenclature. The conference will involve scientists
from around the world and will be held in Bellagio, Italy, May 3 - 7. At this
conference the commission expects to complete recommendations for a system of
plant-wide designations of sequence plant genes. At the conference, the
commission will also discuss plans for establishing a Plant Gene Registry to
serve as a clearing-house for the naming of newly sequenced genes, and for
developing a database of sequenced plant genes, including cross-references and
eventually electronic links to sequence libraries and to databases of
Arabidopsis, maize, of other plants as those are develope, and to genetic
databases of other organisms.
