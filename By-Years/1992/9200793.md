This is an Industry-University Collaborative Research project, between the Ohio
State University (P.I. L.-S. Fan) and Amoco Oil Co. (Dr. D. Arters) in the area
of high-pressure high- temperature three-phase fluidization. The experiments in
university will be conducted on a small apparatus. Pilot scale experiments will
be performed at Amoco to examine the scale effects. It is proposed to visualize
the three-phase flow microstructure and study the pressure and temperature
effects in Newtonian and non-Newtonian systems, in two- and three-dimensional
fluidized columns. Bubble dynamics, including bubble coalescence and breakage,
will be an area of focus. Particle image velocimetry will be used in a mixture
of fluid and solids with the same refractive index. The effect of pressure on
the bubble wake, as well as other microstructural aspects of three-phase flow
will be investigated for the first time. If successful, the proposed research on
three-phase fluidization at high pressure and temperature will extend the
current limits of application of this approach in chemical synthesis, energy
production and biotechnology.
