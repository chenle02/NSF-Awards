This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, "Nanoscience
and Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education at the University of Michigan-
Dearborn," under the direction of Dr. Pravansu S. Mohanty is being funded by the
Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Engineering Education and Centers
(EEC). The project's objectives are: 1) to develop an introductory nanoscience
and nanotechnology course which will be taught more from the perspectives of
concept development and qualitiative analysis rather than mathematical
derivations; 2) to develop nanoscience and nanotechnology modules and integrate
them to existing courses; 3) to create undergraduate research opportunities on
nanotechnology; and 4) to partner with the Dearborn Center for Math, Science,
and Technology and the Academy of Engineering and Technology (DCMST-AET) Magnet
School to integrate nanoscience and technology concepts into their curriculum.
