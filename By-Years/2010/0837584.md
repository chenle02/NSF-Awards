Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a set
of learning materials and laboratory modules in bio-nanorobotics that can be
used in undergraduate biomedical, electrical and computer engineering curricula.
The learning materials are being developed using a challenge-based pedagogy and
incorporating active learning so that students may achieve adaptive expertise in
the area. The learning materials include lecture units on micro- and nanorobot
components and design, case studies on the use of micro- and nanorobots in
biomedicine, and an open ended design problem involving pill sized robots for
the gastrointestinal tract. The laboratory modules use a combination of computer
simulation and a small robot test bed to teach robot navigation and multi-robot
cooperation. The project includes rigorous formative and summative evaluation
plans with both qualitative and quantitative components coordinated by an
independent evaluator. The evaluation plan is designed to establish the quality
of the materials and to ensure the project goals are met. The projects results
are being disseminated through conferences and journal publications and through
direct contact with four other institutions of higher learning with diverse
student bodies.
