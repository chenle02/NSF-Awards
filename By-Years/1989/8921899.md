The Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr. Ei-ichi Negishi
of the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University. Dr. Negishi will continue
his innovative studies on organometallic carbon-carbon bond forming reactions
catalyzed or promoted by transition metal complexes. This study includes
discovery and development of synthetically attractive new organometallic
reactions and exploration of the scope and mechanism of fundamental
organometallic reaction patterns. Dr. Negishi will focus on the chemistry of
low-electron-count metallocenes containing titanium, zirconium and hafnium
wherein a wide variety of novel skeletal rearangements and migratory insertions
are anticipated. Another major thrust is the study of migratory insertions
arising from the reactions of alpha-halo-alpha-silylalkyllithiums with
organotransition metals. The synthetic aspects of palladium- or nickel-catalyzed
cross coupling reactions and efforts to develop useful carbometallation
reactions involving titanium, zirconium, nickel, palladium and copper are other
areas of interest.
