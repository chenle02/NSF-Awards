The goal of this Engineering Microsystems: "XYZ" on a Chip project is to
investigate magnetic colloidal particles and their use in several micro-fluid
mechanics applications. The need to miniaturize and perform parallel chemical
and biochemical processes for efficient drug screening, chemical detection, and
combinatorial chemistry motivates interest in chemical processes on a
microscopic scale. Most of the current state of the art relies on pressure-
driven and electrokinetic processes to transport analytes and products around
device. In this work another control parameter, a magnetic field, is added to
the system. The self-assembly of magnetic colloidal particles into chains is the
key process. When tethered to surfaces in microscopic fluid flow and suspended
analytes. The microscopic flow system, chemically patterning the surfaces, and
linking the magnetic chains to surfaces will be designed, and then studying the
resulting fluid mechanics and magnetic chain dynamics will be investigated. The
fundamental issues to be addressed include: the dynamics and mechanical
properties of tethered and untethered chains of magnetic colloidal particles;
the microscopic fluid mechanics; the filtering and sieving capabilities of
magnetic bead arrays; and the micro-scale mixing performance of actuated
micromagnetic stirrers. Examples are presented for separation processes
involving sieving or filtration of cells or particles, and the converse issue of
effective mixing in a microreactor.

This project will be conducted in collaboration with the Stanford
Nanofabrication Facility, a part of the NSF National Nanofabrication Users
Network.
