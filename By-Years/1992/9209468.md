Professor Westling will study the intensity and phase fluctuations of diode
laser sources. The goal of her research is to understand the role of these
fluctuations when exciting atomic ensembles. Professor Westling will measure the
correlation function of spontaneous emission in the atomic ensemble when excited
by fluctuating laser diode light.
