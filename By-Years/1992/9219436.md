All living cells are constantly exposed to chemical and physical agents that
have the ability to alter the primary structure of DNA. Thus, it should be
expected that all organisms appears to have mechanisms for the removal or repair
of this damage. During the last thirty years, a great of effort has been placed
on trying to elucidate the various DNA repair mechanisms that exist as well as
the relationship of these repair systems to cell survival, mutagenesis, genetic
recombination, DNA replication, carcinogenesis, toxicology, differentiation and
development. The Gram positive spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis a model
for the study of the interactions of DNA repair with differentiation.
Specifically, aspects of this SOS system are spontaneously activated when B.
subtilis differentiates into its competent state. The present study concentrates
on the molecular mechanisms that regulate the damage induction and the
competence specific induction of din(DNA damage inducible) genes and of the recA
gene. Operator/promoter regions from these genes have been isolated and
sequenced. Regulatory elements, transcription start sites have been tentatively
identified. The preliminary data suggest the existence of complex regulatory
networks involved in the regulation of some of these genes, especially the recA
promoter. Using the appropriate techniques of molecular biology and genetics,
such as S1 nuclease protection, gel mobility shift assays, Western Blots, DNA
sequencing, cloning mutational analysis, polymerase chain reaction, transposon
inactivation, etc, the following questions will be addressed: 1) What DNA
sequences are essential for the damage inducible expression of the recA gene;
and 2) what DNA sequences are essential for the competence specific induction of
the recA gene? %%% This award should provide detailed insight into how bacterial
cells regulate an important aspect of their response to environmental stress.
