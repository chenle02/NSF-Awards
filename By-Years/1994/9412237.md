9412237 Wine This four year program will involve continuing research aimed at
elucidating the kinetics and reaction mechanisms which control the atmospheric
oxidation of sulfur compounds, with particular emphasis oxidation pathways for
dimethylsulfide (CH3 \SCH3, DMS). The goals of the program is the definitive
determination of the rates and mechanisms for conversion of reduced sulfur
compounds to relatively stable S(IV and S(VI) and products such as sulfur
dioxide (SO2), sulfuric acid (H2S04), sulfoxides, sulfones and sulfonic acids.
Direct, "real time" observations of reactive intermediates and stable end
products is emphasized because only through such observations can results with a
unique interpretation be obtained. The research will contribute significantly to
our understanding of the global sulfur cycle, thus facilitating accurate
assessment of the contribution of both biogenic and anthropogenic sulfur to such
problems as climate modification (or regulation), visibility reduction, and acid
precipitation. Specific experimental investigations will focus on DMS, DMS
adducts, DMSO (CH3SOCH3), carbonyl sulfide (OCS), and S03 H2) adducts. The
experimental methodology will involve coupling radical generation by laser flash
photolysis with a number of time-resolved detection techniques including pulsed
laser induced fluorescence, atomic resonance fluorescence, UV-visible absorption
using both incoherent and laser light sources, infrared tunable diode laser
absorption, photoionization mass spectrometry, and resonance enhanced
multiphoton ionization mass spectrometry. In these mechanistic studies, th
ability to obtain time-resolved data on 10- 7-10-3 s time scales is critical to
defining the detailed reaction sequences leading to product formation. The
investigators will, of course, keep abreast of progress in other laboratories
and new developments in the area of tropospheric chemistry, and may alter their
sub-tasks somewhat to accomm odate newly identified research needs. ***
