This project is an integrated study of forest dynamics and ethnobotany in
Peruvian Amazonia, which will provide essential data for the sustained use of
these highly varied forests. The investigation centers on mortality, ingrowth,
and growth rates for trees and lianas >10cm d.b.h. in eight fully identified
one- hectare plots established in 1983. Preliminary data indicate major between-
site variation in mortality rates; these will be examined for the dependence of
forest dynamics and diversity on each other and on soil and climatic variables.
For thirteen one- hectare plots, the researchers will take local informants to
each identified tree and liana to quantify their knowledge of plant use, and to
compare such knowledge between informants. Data on plant use and population
dynamics will be used to discover if the common useful species in each plot are
regenerating. For selected palm species, the project will compare the
effectiveness of canopy diameter, tree height, and d.b.h. as predictors of one
year's fruit yield. The research will contribute directly ecological theory of
forest dynamics and conservation.
