Support is requested for the 36th annual meeting of the Wind River Conference on
Genetic Exchange to be held at the Wind River Ranch, Estes Park, Colorado, June
10-14, 1992. This conference is primarily concerned with the biology and
molecular biology of genetic exchange systems in a variety of procaryotic and
eukaryotic systems, and is the major annually occurring meeting devoted to this
subject area internationally. One significant feature of these meetings is their
accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral students, whose travel
funds frequently are limited. Specifically to address this problem, we request
funds to provide travel support scholarships to facilitate the attendance of
graduate students and post-doctoral students working in various areas of genetic
exchange and related subject areas. %%% This consistently excellent meeting is
the major forum for discussion of transfer of genetic information between
organisms.
