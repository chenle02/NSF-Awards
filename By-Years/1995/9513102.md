9513102 Liebermann This award supports a three-year cooperative research project
between Professor Robert C. Liebermann of the State University of New York at
Stony Brook and Professor Tetsuo Irifune of Ehime University. The collaborators
assembled also include faculty and postdoctoral staff of the Mineral Physics
Institute at Stony Brook and Hokkaido University. This proposal will address
some of the most important areas of research on the elastic and rheological
properties of the high-pressure phases of mantle minerals. The objective of this
research is an improved understanding of the dynamical processes in the Earth's
interior. This proposal brings together research scientists from two countries
working in complimentary ways on mineral physics and chemistry. The U. S.
scientists will have the opportunity to become familiar with the high-pressure
facilities at Ehime University and the electron microscope facilities of
Hokkaido University. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the
Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through
international collaboration. ***
