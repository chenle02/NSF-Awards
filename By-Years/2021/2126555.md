The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is to improve outcomes for ablation, a
procedure to address tumors. Currently, surgical removal is the preferred
treatment for most focal tumors, but it is an invasive, expensive procedure.
Thermal ablation, an alternative treatment, represents a $2 B market growing at
10% annually, even with the current limitations. It is a minimally invasive,
outpatient procedure that can be performed safely at a fraction of the cost;
however, incomplete ablation can result in local recurrence. The proposed
project improves ablation technology for low-cost treatment and improved
clinical outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
Phase I project advances a human serum albumin-based formulation that can be
injected to a target site to serve as a thermal accelerant. This project
conducts diffusion studies, important for certain site like the highly perfused
environment of the liver. This project will measure electrical conductivity and
specific heat values over a wide range of temperatures (20-90 oC) to explain the
enhanced temperature profile observed during the microwave ablation with the
technology. These results are essential to understanding the thermal behavior of
both the technology, the thermal effect on the surrounding tissue, and the
overall ablation volume and shape. These data will inform a computational model
for predicting the microwave ablation patterns in a clinical
setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
