In 1983 the Division of Industrial Science and Technology Innovation published
a technical review of the research on innovation entitled The Process of
Technological Innovation. Since that time, an estimated 200-400 new research and
conceptual articles have been published, and important reconceptualizations of
the field have emerged. Among the latter are: 1) an increased importance placed
on the differences between process and product innovation; 2) new work on
defining characteristics of technologies; 3) research on dissemination modality;
and 4) human resource implications of innovation. This project proposes to
upgrade the 1983 review by a major rewrite, and analytic review.
