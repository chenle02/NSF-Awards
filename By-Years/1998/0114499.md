This grant provides funding to create a mathematical framework to design
effective aviation security system strategies. Aviation security protects vital
national interests, as well as passengers and aircraft. Key components of an
aviation security system include baggage and passenger screening devices and
operations. The goals of this project are to determine: (1) how to measure the
performance of aviation security systems, (2) where to deploy aviation security
technology devices when designing such systems, (3) how to operate such devices
optimally after they are deployed, and (4) how to quantify and optimize the
resulting effectiveness of deployment and security operation strategies. The
methodology will use discrete optimization models such as the knapsack problem,
complexity analysis, and heuristics developed for intractable instances of the
models to conduct the necessary analysis and to obtain the desired results.

The results of this research will provide a systematic approach to compare and
evaluate different types of aviation security system strategies that incorporate
both new and existing aviation security technologies. This approach also has the
potential to be used to design and implement new aviation security system
strategies capable of enhancing the level of security attainable given the
security resources and technologies that are currently available or may be
available in the future. Moreover, the results of this research can be used to
quantify the value of new investments in different types of aviation security
technologies, to determine their potential impact on enhancing aviation security
at airports within the nation. Beyond aviation security, this approach may also
be applied to other screening environments, such as computer security systems
screening for unauthorized users and food safety systems screening for toxic
levels of bacteria.
