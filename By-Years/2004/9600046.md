9600046 Sanders This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project will study the
time duration of highly deformed configurations of lighter nuclei that are
formed in heavy-ion fusion reactions. Together with Alejandro Szanto de Toledo
of the Nuclear Physics Department of the Universidade de Sao Paulo, the PI's,
Stephen Sanders and Francis Prosser at the University of Kansas, will use the
Pelletron at Sao Paulo and the Argonne National Laboratory ATLAS facilities to
perform an extended series of sensitive tests to deduce compound nucleus
lifetimes from the fluctuation measurements of fission fragments. Fine-step
excitation functions of these fission yields will be obtained to evaluate the
autocorrelation function. It is expected that the measurements will be effective
for lifetimes between 7x10^- 22 sec and 7x10^-21 sec. The projected series of
tests will make excellent use of the lower-energy facilities in Sao Paulo, where
more beam time is available than would be possible in the US labs. Higher energy
experiments will be carried out at Argonne in the US. The proposed work forms a
coherent collection of experiments in an area where little data is available and
capitalizes on the expertise and facilities of the two countries. A graduate
student will also travel to Sao Paulo to participate in the work. ***
