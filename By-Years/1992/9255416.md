Economics faculty will participate in three-day workshops at the University of
Arizona to learn instructional techniques that utilize laboratory experiments by
undergraduate students who are enrolled in principles of economics and
intermediate theory classes. These techniques demonstrate to students the basis
and applicability of economic theory and provide valuable feedback to
instructors on student perceptions of theory. Also, the faculty will participate
in established experiments and learn the techniques for designing experiments
for undergraduate instruction. The objective of the workshops is to add a new
dimension to instruction and to improve the teaching and understanding of
undergraduate economics. The workshops will be conducted during the Summer and
Fall, 1993.
