Ceniceros The investigator and collaborators develop two classes of modern,
hybrid numerical methods to study fluid-structure interaction for multi-phase
flows in two and three dimensions. The hybrid computational methodologies merge
two sets of usually disjoint approaches, front capturing (both through the level
set method and through phase field based models) and front tracking (immersed
boundary setting) on one hand, and moving meshes and adaptive mesh refinements
on the other, to produce an efficient method that exploits the best features of
each individual approach. In addition, controlled adaptive front-tracking in
concert with a leading small-scales semi-implicit time discretization is used to
overcome the long-standing time stepping problem (stiffness) associated with
interfacial tension. The blending of all these ingredients produces fully
adaptive and non-stiff hybrid methods for capturing accurately small-scale
effects, high interfacial deformations, and flow-structure interaction in multi-
phase and complex flows. The understanding of how flow-structure interaction
influences the macroscopic behavior of multi-phase flows is of both fundamental
and practical significance. Surfactants, viscoelastic fibers, fluid interfaces,
and polymeric microstructures and nanostructures can radically change the
behavior of a flow and ultimately determine the properties of complex soft
matter formulations. The methodologies are an important tool to study flow-
structure interaction for a wide variety of problems of direct interest to
nanotechnology, the soft materials industry, and to some biomedical
applications. The project also serves an important education goal: the
interdisciplinary education and training of undergraduate and graduate students.
