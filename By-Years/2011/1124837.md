The ability to use teams of robots in interesting, real-world tasks such as
exploration, reconnaissance, and search and rescue depends on their ability to
effectively cooperate in complex and dynamic environments. Observations from
nature and personal experience show that leadership can have a significant
positive impact in the coordination and performance of a team. However, current
processes for selecting leaders in teams of robots are either unable to adapt to
changes to team membership or require significant time and effort to do so. In
contrast, research in the biological sciences has shown that systems with
leaders that emerge by way of internal motivation, and not external
communication, are able to adapt to changes in team membership in complex and
dynamic environments. In these systems, leaders are thought of more as
"initiators of action" rather than "managers" that direct other individuals.

In this project, the researchers will use these insights into biological systems
to investigate the motivations and mechanisms that contribute to the emergence
of not only a single leader, but to the emergence of a hierarchy of leaders in a
team of robots. Potential motivations and mechanisms will be evaluated in
simulations of common team-based robot tasks that require cooperation and
coordination of the individual robots. An understanding of the emergence process
will enable roboticists to use teams of robots in tasks for which their use is
currently impractical. Furthermore, this project will also increase the body of
knowledge in the life sciences by providing a theoretical foundation on which
further biological experiments can be based. The combination of these
contributions is transformative not only for the practical impact it will have
on the ability to design multi-robot systems that benefit from improved
coordination and cooperation, but also for its impact on our fundamental
understanding of what facilitates the emergence of organized leadership
structures.
