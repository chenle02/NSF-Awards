This project will introduce undergraduate students at East Stroudsburg
University to chromatographic techniques for efficient, simultaneous
determination of ionic species. Students in instrumental analysis and
environmental chemistry courses will learn techniques for the determination of
anions such as chloride, fluoride, nitrite, nitrate, sulfate, and phosphate in
parts-per-million quantities. The ion chromatography system will also be used by
undergraduates in research projects which include investigating effects of acid
rain, monitoring local potable water supplies, and studying the water chemistry
of several lakes and streams in the Poconos.
