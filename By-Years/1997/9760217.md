This Small Business Innovation Research (Sbir) Phase I project will develop a
layer-by-layer method to manufacture electric motors that are exceptionally
efficient and compact. In conventional motors, the magnetic field is produced by
current flowing through coils of insulated wire placed in slots punched in low
silicon steel laminations. Phase I would eliminate wire and improve the magnetic
efficiency of the laminations. Conductors and their insulators will be built up
in layers using a computer-controlled laser to produce ceramic insulators and
fused powder metal conductors. Techniques to increase the silicon content of the
laminations and reduce their losses will be developed. Compared to conventional
motors, this technique would reduce core losses by a factor of three, winding
losses by a factor of 2.5, and reduce energy consumption by 2.5-5% through
greatly increased thermal conductivity. In addition to motors, this technology
may be applied to generators, transformers, and similar devices. Where size,
weight, and efficiency are important, applications include: traction motors for
electric cars, compact automobile motors and generators, lightweight motors for
aircraft and space vehicles, and high power motors for machine tools.
