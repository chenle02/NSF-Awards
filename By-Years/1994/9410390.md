9410390 Hasslotis In this research planning grant a complete literature review
will be taken into the state-of-the-art to identify the needs of the research
community. In addition, preliminary computational work will be conducted to
asses the feasibility of several proposed projects. These projects include a
search for the best modes and degrees of freedom to measure for accurate
structural identification, the determination of the optimal placement of
actuators and sensors in active control, and the improvement of algorithms used
in the identification of damage. Such research will be helpful in the
development of non-destructive methods for evaluation the condition and
remaining life of civil engineering structures, as well as in the design of more
reliable and safer structures.
