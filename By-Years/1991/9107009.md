Technical Narrative: This U.S.-Egypt collaborative research project involving
Washington State University and Cairo University is in the general area of water
resources engineering. Project funding will allow a highly qualified researcher
from Egypt to spend one year in the laboratory of Dr. M. Hanif Chaudhry at
Washington State University. The collaborative research will investigate
experimentally and theoretically the modelling of unsteady flows. Computer
models are expected to analyze these flows accurately for the design and
operation of various flow-conveyance structures. This project in water resources
engineering fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading experts in the United States and Egypt to combine complementary
talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence.
