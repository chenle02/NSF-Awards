The goal of this project is the understanding of the metric properties of
Thompson's groups. Thompson defined a fascinating family of groups, which appear
in a wide range of mathematical disciplines, including logic, homotopy theory
and the measure theory of discrete groups. Thompson's groups are often the
simplest or only known examples of a number of strange group-theoretic
phenomena. Despite a great deal of study by a number of researchers, many
properties of these groups are poorly understood. This project investigates the
metric structure of Thompson's groups by developing a better understanding of
the Cayley graphs of these groups. This research builds upon earlier results of
the researchers, working together in some cases and separately in others,
relating to various metric properties of Thompson's groups.

This award supports US-Spanish cooperative research in mathematics. It provides
travel support for Sean Cleary of The City College of New York and Jennifer
Taback of the University at Albany to visit Jose Burillo of the Universitat
Politecnia de Catalunya in Barcelona. This mathematical research lies in the
area of group theory. A group is an abstract structure, which can often be
visualized as a collection of symmetries of a geometrical object. Some common
properties of a set of such symmetries can be made abstract in systematic ways.
In this research, groups themselves are studied as geometric objects, and
geometric insight can help to understand the algebraic structure of some groups
more effectively. This research focuses on a family of groups known as
Thompson's groups, after the researcher who first defined them. Thompson's
groups can be understood geometrically using pairs of binary trees, an approach
that relates this group to questions in theoretical computer science. The
broader impacts of this project include these applications to algorithmic
questions in computer science related to the shape of binary trees,
international involvement and exchange between researchers interested in similar
projects, and possible student involvement in research.
