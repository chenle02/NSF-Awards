This project establishes an economics computer laboratory. The laboratory
enables the department to incorporate the computer into its undergraduate
curriculum and thus enhances the ability of the students to conceptualize the
essence of economic and empirical techniques. The award provides adequate
capacity to absorb large classes such as introductory statistics, takes
advantage of recent developments in object oriented languages, relational data
bases, and integrated applications, as well as user friendly environments
developments that will help the student conceptualize the substance of the
course material. Thirty one MacIntosh II's along with related peripheral
equipment and software are provided. All students in the introductory statistics
class can now take a computer laboratory course in statistics. In addition, by
taking advantage of recent software developments, the computer laboratory is
used as a tool to enhance students' understanding of important economic and,
especially, empirical concepts. The award will be matched by an equal amount
from the grantee.
