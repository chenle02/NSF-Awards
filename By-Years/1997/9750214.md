Abstract DBI 9750214 David Hooper This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1997. This fellowship
provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain additional scientific training
beyond the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative into the
fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between organisms and their
environment at the molecular, cellular, organismal, population, community and/or
ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by the Directorate for
Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation. Each fellowship supports
a research and training plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The
research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Storage of carbon in
arctic tundra plants in response to climatic change." The research is
investigates temperature as a direct effect and nutrient availability as an
indirect effect on plant gross productivity. Predictions of flux measurements
from 2 models, GASFLUX and MBL/CSA, are being compared for different arctic
plant communities. The differences in these models will be exploited to better
understand how plant functional traits control the carbon balance in the tundra
ecosystem.
