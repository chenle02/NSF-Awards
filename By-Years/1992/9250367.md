The purchase of a GC-MS is enabling this hyphenated technique to be used
throughout the curriculum. The goal of the project is to make the introductory
laboratory more representative of chemistry as it is actually practiced. For
example, students in general chemistry use GC-MS in a special project undertaken
during the second semester. Experiments in upper level courses are designed to
provide experience with both qualitative and quantitative GC-MS as it is applied
in the different chemistry subdisciplines. The instrument is also enhancing the
undergraduate research program.
