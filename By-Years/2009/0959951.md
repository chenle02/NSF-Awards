"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."

This award will allow the Western New England College (WNEC) School of
Engineering to acquire the equipment necessary to achieve a state-of-the art
biomedical materials and mechanics research and training laboratory. The
requested equipment will supplement existing equipment and serve a common goal
of supporting current and pending biomedical materials and mechanics research
and educational activities. The two major pieces of equipment requested are an
electrodynamic test instrument (mechanical fatigue instrument) and a materials
and mechanics. The equipment will also place the WNEC engineering faculty in a
better position to pursue additional research opportunities and partnerships
with local industry. The primary areas of research that will be directly
supported by the equipment will be: (i) dynamic testing of tooth enamel/dentin
for stress/fatigue corrosion susceptibility, (ii) screening of nano-scale
topographies for applications in tissue engineering and implantable devices,
(iii) pre-clinical evaluation of novel prosthetic socket designs, and (iv)
continued collaboration with the Santore lab at the University of Massachusetts
for the development of nano-scale engineered surfaces.
