This is an award to support US involvement in a week-long workshop, from
11/09/2015 to 11/13/2015, titled "Moduli Spaces and Arithmetic Geometry," which
will be hosted by the Lorentz Center in Leiden. This workshop will feature many
of the current, exciting developments in arithmetic algebraic geometry,
presented by leading experts of the highest level; for instance among the 16
confirmed invited speakers are two Fields medalists. The program is designed to
stimulate interaction between participants in diverse areas and of different
generations, so that they can brainstorm and stimulate each other for further
progress.

The workshop will feature two miniseries with four lectures each, on Andre-Oort
conjecture and K3 surfaces respectively, where major breakthroughs have taken
place in recent years. For instance the notion of o-minimality, a concept from
mathematical logic, is the new input which led to the recent breakthrough in the
Andre-Oort conjecture. In addition to the eight thematic talks there will be ten
lectures by top experts in the general area of arithmetic geometry, plus two
colloquium-style lectures aimed at a wider audience. There will also be Q&A
sessions in four of the five days of the workshop, exclusively for early-career
researchers, to stimulate interactions among the younger participants, and to
help them to get in touch with experts on topics that are of interest for them.
