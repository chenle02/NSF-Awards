Intelligence analysts must sift through massive amounts of information, using
perspective gained from history and experience to pull together from disparate
sources the best coherent picture of what is happening. Today's world has grown
far more complex, but human cognitive abilities have remained unchanged. This
project is tackling this problem by exploring how to tightly combine three kinds
of AI techniques: deductive reasoning over a large common sense knowledge base,
analogical reasoning, and intelligent information retrieval, to create new power
tools for intelligence analysts. The hypothesis being explored is that these
techniques can be combined synergistically, each overcoming limitations of the
others. The team has access to detailed data about how analysts work and
opportunities for feedback about prototypes through Cycorp's participation in
ARDA/NIMD's Glass Box Analysis Environment, which records the information
streams analysts use while working on unclassified but representative problems.
This work could have a significant positive impact on homeland security.
