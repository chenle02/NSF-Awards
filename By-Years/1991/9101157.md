PI proposes a theory of electronic structures based on new physical
interpretation of interacting non-uniform electronic systems. The new physics
introduced is that of associating a force-field with the Fermi-Coulomb hole
charge distribution of an electron. The local potential seen by the electron is
then the work done to move an electron against the force-field of the charge
distribution. This proposal deals with the further development of these ideas
together with application to metallic surfaces. PI intends to further strengthen
the foundations of this formalism in order to enable meaningful application to
even more complex electronic systems.
