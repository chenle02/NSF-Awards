Analysis will be completed on previously collected data to compare the
evolution of turbulence in the wake of a sphere with that generated by a mesh
with uniform grid size. Completion of this project will lead to better
understanding of turbulent mixing in stratified flows and internally consistent
criteria to describe its evolution.
