"Workshop on Transport and Localization in Random Media: Theory and
Applications" will be held at Columbia University in New York City from May 1st
to May 3rd, 2018. Random environments are ubiquitous to many physical systems:
gases, condensed matter, chemical reaction, etc. The inherent complexity of
these phenomena motivates the use of noise in their mathematical description. A
fundamental challenge is to interpret how this noise affects the dynamical
aspects of the system. In condensed matter physics, the lack of synchrony
between random scatterers can eliminate all propagation of waves-- a phenomena
known as Anderson localization. On the other hand, disordered gases exhibit high
diffusivity properties, with applications in imaging. A mathematical
understanding has impact on technological applications in atmospheric science,
wireless communications in urban environments, physiological imaging and
electronic transport in nano-structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop
will present recent developments on wave propagation, scattering and diffusion
in random medias at the interface of probability theory, mathematical physics
and partial differential equations. Accessible lectures by leading
mathematicians will catalyze interactions among both junior and senior
researchers in fundamental and applied fields.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop website
