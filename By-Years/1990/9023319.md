This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research of Professor
David Lewis at Colgate University. The results of this research will provide new
understanding to the mechanism of the thermal reactions of small-ring
hydrocarbons. The shock tube method will allow high reaction temperatures to be
reached (1100 K) without the complication of reaction on the reactor wall. New
and sophisticated spectroscopic methods will be used to detect intermediates in
these reactions, and from this analysis an insight to the mechanism of the
reaction can be reached. The isomerization and fragmentation reactions of small-
ring hydrocarbons will be studied by shock tube and static reactor techniques.
Mechanistic details of these reactions will be probed with state of the art
spectroscopic techniques, namely, high resolution IR absorption spectroscopy,
tunable diode laser methods, and vibrational circular dichroism. Sophisticated
deuterium and carbon-13 labeling experiments will be employed to determine the
course of reaction. From these experiments it will be possible to determine if
these reactions proceed in a concerted or stepwise manner, and if orbital
symmetry rules are obeyed.
