9355826 Dugger Standards for technology education are needed to complement the
national standards in mathematics and science. The first phase of the project is
to articulate a rationale and structure for technology education - a vision for
the intellectual domain for technology education and its interface with science
and mathematics. The International Technology Education Association (ITEA)
develops the document and the processes for evaluating it to gain consensus and
acceptance by the technology education community and other constituencies. An
Advisory Board of people with national reputations in various fields oversees
the process.
