9318970 Saumon Stars with masses below about 0.08 solar masses can not sustain
nuclear reactions. The existence of such objects, known as brown dwarfs, could
have important consequences in a variety of areas of astrophysics including the
missing mass problem and star formation. However, it has not been possible to
unambiguously distinguish brown dwarfs from the very numerous M dwarfs which are
similar in luminosity and temperature. This is due in large part to deficiencies
in the theoretical models which are compared with the observed spectra, colors
and luminosities. With the support of this grant, new more realistic model
atmospheres and interiors will be constructed for M dwarfs and brown dwarfs. The
spectra and colors calculated from these models will allow the identification of
brown dwarfs. ***
