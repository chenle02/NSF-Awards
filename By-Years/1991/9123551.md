This award supports a group of three U.S. computer scientists coordinated by
Professor Steven Homer of Boston University to collaborate with Professor Peter
van Emde Boas and others of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science
of the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Their research will focus on
several current topics in the theory of computation, including structural
complexity theory and Kolmogorov complexity theory. The planned collaboration
will be expedited by several reciprocal working meetings among the participants
that will give opportunities to local young researchers and particularly
graduate students to benefit from participation in the discussions. This
research lies on the boundary between mathematics and computer science. The
various research partnerships among the seven participants should yield
significant results in several central areas of complexity theory. The
complementary expertise contributed by the U.S. and Dutch participants has the
potential to contribute insights and connections which would not emerge without
the cooperative interactions.
