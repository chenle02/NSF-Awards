The proposed work is a continuation of current research to develop impedance
pneumography as a new diagnostic tool. The investigators propose to build a
vest-like garment with multiple electrodes through which impedance changes
across the chest can be monitored during breathing. Using numerical techniques
an "impedance image" of the thorax may be obtained. The device should be very
useful for accurately monitoring changes in tidal volume as a function of time;
a new generation of apnea monitors may result from the proposed research.
