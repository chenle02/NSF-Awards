0111510&lt;br/&gt;Dewers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particle size distribution of
aggregates influences many material properties, such as strength, friction,
porosity and permeability. Grain-size distributions of fine-grained sediment
yield important paleoclimate proxy data. Temporal and spatial resolution of
particle size distributions can be used to infer growth and nucleation rates in
crystallite suspensions, and sediment sorption properties, as well as aridity
and wind strength from sediment cores to name a few applications. In contrast to
more traditional methods, e.g. sieving, settling, or optical microscopy, laser
light scattering has emerged as an efficient, accurate, and rapid method for
particle size and volume distribution of aggregates and suspensions. We propose
to purchase a state-of-the-art Coulter LS230 Laser Particle Analyzer, which has
an unparalleled sensitivity over the range of 0.04 to 2000 microns in a single
analysis. We will use two different sample introduction modules, allowing
measurements in water, organic solvents, oils, or as a dry aggregate. This
instrument will be used in sedimentological, geochemical, rock mechanics, and
reservoir characterization studies that include: strength and permeability
evolution in fault gouge, microbial influenced nucleation and growth of
carbonate and sulfate minerals, calibration and quantification of grain-size
distribution information from borehole image well logs, climate interpretations
of lacustrine sediment and loessite, and "sanding potential" of seafloor
boreholes among others.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
