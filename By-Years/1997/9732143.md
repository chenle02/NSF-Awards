This grant will continue support for the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
physics program at the University of Washington. The program offers prospective
students a wide variety of research opportunities: astrophysics and cosmology,
atomic physics, nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, particle physics, and
physics education. Each student is paired with a faculty advisor, who often is
supported by interested postdocs and advanced graduate students. The program
lasts 10 weeks and includes a machine shop course, a faculty lecture series on
research opportunities in physics, and informal Monday gatherings. Special
efforts are made to encourage women and minority group members to apply and
participate. As the new UW physics/astronomy building meets or exceeds the
latest ADA standards, we also emphasize our ability to accommodate the needs of
physically challenged students. As typically one student in 10 works with the UW
Physics Education Group, our project also has an impact on the training of in-
service elementary and secondary teachers.
