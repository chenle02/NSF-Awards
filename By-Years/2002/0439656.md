This award supports a workshop to bring together geoscientists working with
sedimentary cores, samples, and collections acquired as part of academic
research projects. The workshop's primary goal is to determine the long-term,
marine-core repository needs of US Antarctic Program investigators for the next
twenty to forty years. The location of the workshop in Tallahassee will allow
the experts to visit the Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility to assess
its operations and current state of utilization. Through the workshop,
participants will identify the needs of this research community; including the
facilities, equipment, and data/metadata needed. By establishing a list of
priority needs and major issues, an effective plan for meeting those needs will
be formulated and recommended to the National Science Foundation.
&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The USAP marine-core repository provides a primary
resource for research on the Antarctic ice sheets, which play an important role
in global climate and sea level change. &lt;br/&gt;
