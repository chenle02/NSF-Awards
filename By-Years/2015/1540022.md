This award aims to support a planning meeting to explore the potential for an
NSF I/UCRC for Complex Adaptive Systems for Society 2030 aims to solve cross-
cutting challenges faced by the mobility and health-care delivery industries
that will result from ongoing demographic changes in society. These challenges
will be addressed through the Center's innovative and inter-disciplinary
research to develop and deliver technical and systems solutions that positively
impact the lives of people of diverse age, sex, racial, ethnic and cultural
backgrounds. The center will Advance Discovery and Understanding While Promoting
Teaching, Training, and &lt;br/&gt;Learning, for example, by training graduate
students and junior faculty and involving undergraduates in research
experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working with the proposed industrial
partners, the PIs have developed two preliminary thrust areas where they have
significant shared expertise and interest. The first is Mobility and
Transportation Across the Lifespan, focused on maximizing the impact of new
technologies such as smart and connected vehicles, active safety, and automotive
human-machine interfaces. The second is Technology-Health Interface Across the
Lifespan, focused on advances in wireless sensor and microelectronic devices and
the revolution in smartphone application development.
