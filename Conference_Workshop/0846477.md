The MAA Regional Undergraduate Mathematics Conferences program supports
conferences that provide undergraduates the opportunity to present mathematical
results to their peers and to ensure a firm regional basis for these conferences
throughout the United States. The numbers of undergraduate students involved in
research activities has been increasing at a tremendous rate. This phenomenon
presents an opportunity for the U.S. to reverse the trend of decreasing
enrollments in graduate programs in the mathematical sciences.

Undergraduate students who are offered the chance to engage in individual study
and research in mathematics and to present the results of their work to their
peers are more likely to pursue graduate studies. Even those students who do not
continue to graduate study will benefit from the experience, and their
participation will benefit mathematics as well. Many will become teachers;
others will use mathematics in other science and engineering fields, or in other
areas of their professional lives. All will have an enriched mathematical
experience. Faculty mentors can broaden the dissemination of their own research,
both through their direct work with students and through their students?
presentations at conferences. Availability of conferences within reasonable
travel distances is an important consideration for student participation. The
MAA Regional Undergraduate Mathematics Conferences project seeks to expand
undergraduate mathematics research by increasing the number and geographical
disbursement of events for students to report on their work, thus making these
experiences available to many undergraduate mathematics students in the country.
