This two-year award to Wayne State University is made under the high
performance connections portion of ANIR's "Connections to the Internet"
announcement, NSF 96-64. Wayne State will connect its campus-wide ATM backbone
network to the National Science Foundation's very high speed Backbone Network
Service (vBNS) by establishing an OC-3c connection to MichNet, the statewide
computer network operated by Merit Network, Inc. The connection at Wayne State
University will complement the high performance connections that Merit is
establishing with the help of NSF (NCR-9616938) at the University of Michigan
and Michigan State University. Collectively these OC-3c connections will support
special research requirements at Merit, Michigan State University, the
University of Michigan, and Wayne State University. This NSF award provides
partial support for the Wayne State component of Merit's OC-3 infrastructure,
which is connected to the vBNS in Chicago. With this high performance
connection, Wayne State will expand current research and collaboration with both
academic institutions and federal laboratories. Wayne State's OC-3 connection
will support research related to automatic parallelization environments for
distributed high performance computing, a collaborative digital library, quantum
chemical reaction dynamics, quantum molecular dynamics, and high energy physics.
Each of these projects will benefit considerably from the increase in network
bandwidth and performance, bringing substantial advances to research in these
fields. In addition, a high performance connection at Wayne State will encourage
other faculty to pursue research opportunities that require access to resources
at other vBNS connected sites.
