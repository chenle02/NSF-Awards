9503412 Sen This is a project to develop a more rigorous technique of amplitude
variation with offset (AVO) inversion for application to marine multichannel
seismic data. Global optimization methods such as simulated annealing and
generic algorithms will be used to estimate the background velocity field which
will then be combined with a very simplistic approach to derive estimates of the
high frequency material property components. The primary goal is to develop,
test, and evaluate the proposed methodology in the estimation of material
properties from multichannel seismic data. ***
