This project expands the demonstrative capacity of biology laboratories and
increases opportunities for hands-on and research at the undergraduate level. It
enhances students' opportunities for advancement in their chosen degree
programs. The grant provides three Ward Model 16 LEAP computerized biology lab
systems, one Ward spectrophotometer and supplies, three 386/486 computers to run
the equipment, and one laser printer. The equipment is being integrated into
biology labs at all levels. The project better prepares biology students to
bridge to 4-year biology programs successfully by providing them with better
technological training and a firmer hands-on grasp of basic biological concepts.
