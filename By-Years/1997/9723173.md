IBN 9723173 PI: RAO Dr. Rao's long term goal is to understand molecular
mechanisms underlying vertebrate eye development. The focus of the research
supported by this grant is on functional studies of ET, a T domain protein in
the Xenopus frog recently identified in Dr. Rao's lab. The T domain is a DNA
binding domain first characterized in the mouse T gene product. T domain
proteins are emerging as a new family of developmental regulators essential in
both vertebrates and invertebrates. Xenopus embryos provide a powerful system
for studying the roles of T domain proteins. Previous work by Dr. Rao led to the
hypothesis that there were multiple T domain proteins in Xenopus embryos, and
that some of these could be involved in eye development. Dr. Rao's preliminary
studies have resulted in the isolation of the ET gene. By in situ hybridization,
ET messenger RNA was found to be present in the primordia for the retina and the
cement gland. To study the functional role of ET, Dr. Rao's group will determine
the distribution of ET protein in Xenopus embryos, dissect the functional
domains of the ET protein, and investigate the role of ET in eye development.
Results from the proposed experiments will be integrated to reveal the role of
ET in vertebrate eye development. Accomplishment of the proposed research will
further our understanding of molecular mechanisms of vertebrate eye development.
