The objective of this project is to develop a storyboard defining a detailed
roadmap for an entire interactive eTextbook on data structures and algorithms,
an end-to-end framework for the development process, and several complete
prototype sections. The project improves the development of future eTextbooks by
demonstrating ways to integrate text, interactivity, and assessment in a
creative commons environment. The integration of online textbook content,
interactive courseware, collaborative creation, open source, and online
assessment benefits students, instructors, content authors, and algorithm
visualization developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactive hypertextbooks are
valuable beyond Computer Science since online instruction in many fields can be
enhanced by student interaction with well-designed simulations. The project
provides an exemplar of how collaborative, open-sourced workflows could be used
to develop hypertextbooks for many disciplines. The goal is to allow instructors
to modify existing eTextbooks by adopting major portions and then changing
sections, or taking text and visualizations from different books and combining
them.
