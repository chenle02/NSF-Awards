The goal of the RIDGE (Ridge Inter-Disciplinary Global Experiments) program is
to understand the geophysical, geochemical and geobiological causes and
consequences of energy transfer within the global rift system through time. This
grant is to support the RIDGE Coordinating Office which provides a focal point
for the planning, organization, and communications essential to the development
of a successful program. The RIDGE Office has a variety of program
responsibilities including the development and implementation of the RIDGE
science plan, organizing planning meetings and workshops as needed, holding
conferences like the RIDGE Theoretical Institute, producing and distributing a
semi-annual newsletter, coordinating timely scientific responses to major
earthquake or volcanic events on the mid-ocean ridge, implementing a RIDGE-
oriented data management and archiving system, and pursuing international
collaborative research efforts on a bilateral and multilateral level.
