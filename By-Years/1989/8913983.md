The primary objective of this US-Poland Cooperative research project between
Dr. Karol Taylor of the University of Gdansk and his counterpart, Dr. Donald
Helinski of the University of California, San Diego, is to study the replicating
molecules in 1) radio isotope- labeled phage DNA separated by pulse-field gel
electrophoresis and 2) phage Lambda DNA molecules separated from bacterial DNA
by equilibrium sedimentation. Results may help determine a tentative scheme of
the replication pathway. Funds for the project are awarded through the Maria
Sklodowska-Curie Joint Fund II, Warsaw in accordance with established
guidelines.
