ABSTRACT

The primary focus of this proposal is to study the local structure of weak
limits of (smooth as well as singular) immersed stable minimal hypersurfaces of
arbitrary dimension, with the ultimate goal of extending the partial regularity
theory of embedded stable minimal hypersurfaces, developed in 1981 by R. Schoen
and L. Simon. Relaxing the embeddedness hypothesis allows the presence of
additional singularities, for instance points where the tangent cones are
hyperplanes with multiplicity greater than one. It is proposed to investigate
the nature of these singularities, with the aim of obtaining information
concerning the size and the structure of these singularities, possible
uniqueness of their tangent cones as well as the local nature of the
hypersurface near the singularities. The second project proposed is a study of
the effect of certain topological and analytic constraints (on the target
manifold) on the regularity propeties of the singular sets of energy minimizing
harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds.

The regularity theory of minimal surfaces and harmonic maps has a very rich
history and the results and ideas developed in these areas have profoundly
influenced several other fields of contemporary research in mathematics and
physics, such as Yang-Mills fields, free boundary problems, curvature flows and
general relativity. Obtaining a good structural description near singularities
turns out to be highly desirable in many problems in pure and applied
mathematics, and any new advances in minimal surface theory in this regard will
likely have an impact on these other fields.
