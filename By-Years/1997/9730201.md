NCR9730201&lt;br/&gt;McRobbie&lt;br/&gt;This award to Indiana University,
entitled "TransPAC: A High-Performance Network Connection for Research and
Education between the vBNS and APAN" provides support for a High Performance
International Internet Services connection between the networks of the Asia-
Pacific Advanced Networking consortium (APAN) and NSF's very high-performance
Backbone Network Services (vBNS). APAN presently involves advanced networks in
Japan, Korea, Singapore and Australia and is expected soon to involve other
countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The overall consortium (APAN plus Indiana
University) is called TransPAC. TransPAC proposed to provide a 35 Mbps link
between the Tokyo node of APAN and the vBNS via the NSF-funded international
connection point for high-performance networks, STAR TAP, in Chicago. TransPAC
will initially provide a high performance connection for about 50 joint US/Asia-
Pacific projects that will leverage an estimated $200 million of research over
the period of the TransPAC award.
