This three year renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site
from the Jacobs School of Engineering at the University of California-San Diego
will focus on the expanding research strength in biomaterials across engineering
departments and expose students to biomaterials research with a focus on
applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery. This Site will provide
lower-division, undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented
groups, with limited research opportunities, with a hands-on biomaterials
research experience, faculty and near-peer mentoring, research presentations at
local and national meetings, and professional development activities that
encourage continued graduate training in biomaterials.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a three year period, this REU program will engage
undergraduate students in a 10-week intensive, summer research experience
focused on the generation of new biomaterials knowledge made possible through
access to state-of-the-art facilities at UCSD, cutting-edge research projects,
and accomplished faculty mentors. A "boot camp" will be conducted during the
first week of the program to ensure that all participants have the necessary
basic skills required to succeed in their research experience. Community
building, professional development activities, weekly research skills workshops,
a biomaterials-based REU journal club, and attendance and participation in
research conferences and professional meetings are components of this REU Site
and will result in better-trained undergraduate students who are highly
motivated to pursue graduate training in biomaterials.
