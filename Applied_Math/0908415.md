Energy-driven systems are characterized by two elements: the energy being
dissipated and the mechanism by which the energy is dissipated. The dissipation
mechanism endows the configuration space with a geometric structure. The
investigator studies the geometry of configuration spaces and relevant energy
landscapes, and their applications to the dynamics of gradient flows. Gradient
flows in Wasserstein metric provide a prime example, given the number of the
systems that can be described as such flows and the wealth of results obtained
over the last decade. The investigator continues studying gradient flows in the
Wasserstein metric, but also examines gradient flows with respect to other, less
studied, metrics that appear naturally in physical and biological systems.
Understanding the geometry of energy landscapes enables one to make conclusions
and predictions about dynamics of complex nonlinear systems. In such systems the
detailed dynamics are often practically intractable, but many system-averaged
quantities, such as energy, follow precise scaling laws. The investigator
studies scaling laws in several energy-driven systems that display coarsening
behavior.

The investigator studies complex nonlinear systems relevant to applications in
materials science, physics, and population biology. Being able to accurately
predict the large-scale features of these systems is important for designing
better man-made materials, controlling processes involving phase separation,
achieving controlled self-assembly of nano-particles, and understanding (and
potentially controlling) the behavior of large-scale animal groups (such as
insect swarms). Additionally, he works on geometrical approaches to
understanding collections of microscopy images in biology and medicine, in
particular, on developing novel tools for image classification and registration,
which can lead to a variety of applications to automated processing of
biological and medical images.
