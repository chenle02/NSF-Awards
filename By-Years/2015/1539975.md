The project will add an I/UCRC site at Virginia Tech, as a new member of Center
for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS). C-UAS is currently the only NSF-sponsored
unmanned aircraft research center. It was established in 2012, with BYU as the
lead institution and UC-Boulder as a member. VT faculty will share
responsibility for managing research projects with BYU and CU. The participating
members of the VT site will also collaborate with members of the current sites
to ensure technical success and to foster multi-corporate relationships among
industry partners. The Site will focus on the following application areas:
agriculture (e.g., methods to monitor plant pathogen transport), civil
infrastructure (e.g., bridge inspection), and geographic information systems. It
will make an impact on society by developing: (1) pre-competitive research
products and intellectual property that will advance UAS technology for commerce
and security, (2) curriculum enhancements to support the special technical
training needs of students pursuing engineering careers in the UAS domain, and
(3) a diverse, strongly connected human network of forward-thinking, technically
excellent professionals who will invent the future for the UAS commercial
sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Tech faculty will make contributions in
the broad areas of (1) advanced flight control (e.g., methods to construct
robust, secure, and mathematically certified control algorithms), (2)
airworthiness, cybersecurity, and reliability (e.g., reliability prediction
methods that incorporate imprecise uncertainties intrinsic to small UAS); (3)
machine vision and machine learning (e.g., software for real-time, on-board
intelligent image processing), (4) multiphysics design optimization (e.g.,
aircraft design optimization tools that incorporate unsteady fluid/structure
interaction), and , and (5) wireless communication (e.g., the use of software
defined radio and intelligent communication protocols that adapt the information
flow to the environmental conditions).
