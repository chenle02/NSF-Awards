This work concerns itself with Topological Graph Theory. This includes vector
representations of graphs, regular connected graphs which are locally paths, and
graphical designs. Also edge decompositions of a complete graph on n vertices
represented by a set of n vectors from a suitable vector space will be studied.
Finally more algebraic problems including combinatorial aspects of determinants
and Hamiltonian groups will be investigated. Topological Graph Theory uses the
deep tools of topology to study graphs. Graphs themselves are an increasingly
important tool in many areas including computer science and the social sciences.
This research will concentrate on graphs and their applications.
