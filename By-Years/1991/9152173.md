The computer science program at Goucher College is implementing a research
component in the undergraduate curriculum. An independent project is carried out
with a faculty member in the student's senior year. The purpose of this project
is to introduce our students to advanced computer science topics and to
stimulate interest in research. This project creates a multifunctional
workstation laboratory which allow research activities in programming languages,
artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and interdisciplinary work. The
laboratory is used for upper level computer science courses in these areas, and
by seniors to carry out their research projects.
