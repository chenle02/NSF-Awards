1With support from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program and the
Materials Theory Program, Professor Silby will investigate three problems in
quantum mechanics: (1) tunneling in gas and condensed phases, (2) spectroscopy
of guest molecules in low temperature glasses, and (3) competing electron-phonon
and electron-electron interactions in molecular systems. The theoretical models
that result will lead to a better understanding of the important experimental
data generated in the above areas. Tunneling in molecules and condensed phases
will be studied for both symmetric and asymmetric potentials. Hole burning in
glasses will be investigated focusing on the basic aspects of energy states in
glasses (interacting vs. non-interacting two-level systems) and their
ramifications for imhomogeneous broadening. The dynamics in low dimensional
molecular crystals and polymeric systems with competing interactions will be
studied. These systems show a rich variety of possible states, such as charge
density waves, spin density waves, and solitonic, polaronic, and bipolaronic
defect states.
