An image analysis system attached to a scanning electron microscope will be
utilized to obtain morphometric measurements of selected Paleogene calcareous
nannoplankton. This technology will open up a new method in studying
nannoplankton phylogeny, which has hitherto been hindered by the small size of
these fossils. The combination of scanning electron microscopy and image
analysis enable detailed measurements of several morphological parameters to be
made on a large number of specimens, leading to data set which can be
statistically evaluated in terms of phylogenetic trends. The simple shape of
nannoplankton lends itself to shape analysis using uncomplicated and unambiguous
parameters. The intention of this study is to construct a
morphometric/phylogenetic scheme which is largely independent of previous
taxonomic complications. Construction of this scheme will allow: 1) Quantitative
assessment of the evolutionary mode and tempo of the calcareous nannoplankton
through the Paleogene, 2) Correlation of evolutionary trends with
paleoceanographic and paleoenvironmental events, and 3) Development of a
"morphometric biochronology" in which an age and error bar can be obtained from
morphological measurements on a small number of specimens.
