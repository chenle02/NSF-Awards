The Broadband Opportunity Council (BOC) defined its guiding principles as
identifying and removing regulatory barriers to the deployment of broadband
infrastructures, encouraging public and private investments in networks and
services, promoting adoption and meaningful use of broadband, and accomplishing
the above in ways that promote the public interest. To secure these principles
the BOC, among other recommendations, called on agencies to 'improve data
collection, analysis and research on broadband.'

This project includes organizing a workshop designed to promote a three-cornered
dialog between policymakers, researchers and data managers (implementation
agencies), to collectively define a broadband research agenda that will
ultimately provide answers to questions relevant to each of these stakeholders.
The organizers will seek to secure the participation of broadband experts from
multiple stakeholders, including universities and university affiliated research
institutes, regulatory agencies, policy makers, industry bodies, and
implementation agencies. A publicly available workshop report will be created to
disseminate workshop findings.
