This three-year grant is to Professor Steven Csorna, Vanderbilt University.
Csorna will continue his research at the CLEO II detector at the Cornell
electron-proton collider, CESR. The new detector and increased luminosity at
CESR will allow advances in the study of neutral B mixing, b to u transitions,
and the detailed study of B decay modes. The energy of the Cornell e+e- collider
is such that there is copious production of particles containing the "b" quark.
Experiments there can probe the details of the interactions of "b" quarks with
other quarks and with other elementary par- ticles. The upgraded detector will
answer important questions about these interactions.
