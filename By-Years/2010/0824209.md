Objective: &lt;br/&gt;Development of terahertz oscillators and amplifiers that
are based on plasmon amplification by stimulated emission in
graphene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Graphene supports
plasmons that have frequencies in the terahertz range (2-10 THz). Plasmons in
graphene are strongly coupled to the interband electronic transitions and can
have very large gain values under population inversion conditions. Such large
gain values could enable micron-scale room temperature terahertz oscillators and
provide coherent terahertz sources for applications in areas such as ultrahigh
speed electronics, biological/chemical sensing, and security and medical
imaging. The vision of the research proposed here is to create a new paradigm
for ultrahigh frequency electronics by borrowing concepts from lasers to realize
electronic devices that provide gain from stimulated emission rather than from
transistor action. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The
proposed work will support the PhD research of two graduate students at Cornell
University. The proposed project would provide a rich set of areas for graduate
student research in cutting edge areas of nanotechnology. The PI will introduce
a new advance undergraduate course titled Semiconductor Nanostructures at
Cornell. The PI will participate in the newly established Pakistan-US joint
project, "Technology for the poor: low-cost information and computing
technologies for the masses," recently funded by the US Government. The PI will
also organize group visits/meetings/workshops between faculty/students belonging
to different northeastern US universities working on topics related to graphene
with the aim of involving faculty/students from smaller universities and
colleges in order to promote collaborations among the faculty and research
interest among the students.
