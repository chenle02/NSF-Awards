This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor Joseph B. Lambert at Northwestern University, who will study
stereoelectronic aspects of reactive intermediates. One focal point is to
determine how electronic effects are propagated through sigma bonds. Targets are
to evaluate the zeta effect of stannylenium ions, the mechanism of the beta-
silicon effect, and a search for the beta-phosphonate effect in carbocation
formation. The second focal point is to obtain new formulations of solvents and
anions to produce free silyl, germyl, and stannyl cations. The third topic
concerns conformations of flexible molecules in the solid state, which is footed
on five- membered rings and the use of a cultivated solid state NMR
spectroscopic technique. %%% The results from Professor Joseph B. Lambert's
studies on reactive intermediates will contribute to our understanding on how
electronic effects are propagated through bonds. His research is focussed
largely on silyl and stannyl cations. Their isolation is also sought to verify
their existence as intermediates. These mechanistic studies have the potential
to translate in a broad spectrum of synthetic applications. Novel conformational
studies on cyclopentanes will be conducted that will provide information that is
relevant in the area of molecular dynamics.//
