This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will investigate
the feasibility of incorporating diamond powder in epoxy molding compounds at
high packing densities using optimized multi-modal distributions of diamond
powder. The resulting thermalconductivities of these composite encapsulants are
expected to be higher than 100 W/mK. Selection of semiconductor molding
compounds that exhibit high thermal conductivity are crucial in dissipating heat
generated by high-power electronic components, particularly as feature sizes of
future chips decrease in size. Most epoxy molding compounds used to encapsulate
semiconductors contain fused silica (55-70% by volume) to maintain a compatible
thermal expansion coefficient and impart moisture resistance. However, the
resulting thermal conductivities of the composite compounds are very low (<3
W/mK). By loading commercial molding epoxies with optimized diamond powder
distributions, diamond volume fractions above 65% may be obtained in the epoxy
molding liquid with a viscosity compatible with commercial molding processes.

The diamond/epoxy molding compound will serve as a upper-limit benchmark
material for thermal conductivity and will be used in high-performance
microelectronic packaging applications where heat dissipation is critical.
