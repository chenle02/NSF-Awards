This research is in the general area of commutative algebra. The project is
concerned with the question of which ring theoretic properties are preserved
under residual intersections. In addition, the principal investigator will find
necessary and sufficient conditions for an ideal to be in the linkage class of a
complete interesection. One goal in the study of commutative rings is to
classify ideals having certain properties. Many of these results have
applications to problems and counterparts in algebraic geometry. One interesting
topic is whether an ideal related by linkage to another ideal shares any of the
second ideals interesting properties, or to what extent it does so. This latter
problem is the primary concern of this project.
