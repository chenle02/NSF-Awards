Future impacts from climate change can be better understood by placing modern
climate trends into perspective through extension of the short instrumental
records of climate variability. Although researchers tend to focus on extremes
of temperature associated with global warming in these analyses, precipitation
changes (and related hydrological extremes) are likely to be an important
consequence of anthropogenic climate change, due to changes in global wind
patterns that control rainfall patterns and the hydrology of regions. This is
especially evident in the Southern Hemisphere, where the strength and
positioning of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds have a large influence on
storm tracks and therefore precipitation changes over terrestrial mid-latitude
regions, such as in Southern New Zealand. This projects aims to create high-
resolution paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental records in collaboration with Dr.
Christopher Moy at the University of Otago, New Zealand. These records will be
used to reconstruct past changes in precipitation of the region.

In order to create a comprehensive record of climate variability and to
accurately place the magnitude of modern hydrologic change occurring in New
Zealand in a longer perspective, this project will use a multi-proxy analysis of
sediment cores obtained from fjords in Southwestern New Zealand to perform a
comprehensive paleoclimate reconstruction. This multi-proxy analysis will
include X-Ray Fluorescence analysis, bulk density, organic biomarker analysis
and magnetic susceptibility analysis. This project will contribute to
constructing a pan-Pacific paleoclimate synthesis, which should identify past
shift and strength changes within the South Pacific and provide a useful
constraint in climate studies throughout the Southern Ocean. This will then be
used to evaluate global carbon cycle models and potentially constrain the
westerly wind influence on Holocene atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This NSF
EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Royal Society of New Zealand.
