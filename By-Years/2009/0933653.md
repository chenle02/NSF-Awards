This NSF award by the Biosensing /CBET program supports work by Professor Zhang
at Boston University to pursue biological/biochemical sensing at cellular and
even finer levels by converting a biological response to an electrical signal
using micro/nanosystems and further implementing an impedance-based real-time
assay system for high-throughput screening (HTS). The objective of this research
is to design and test a multidisciplinary micro/nanosystem for positioning
individual cells into an analyzing matrix for real-time monitoring cell
viability and response with a miniaturized HTS system. In the proposed
micro/nanosystem, existing electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS)
techniques will be modified for single cell monitoring. In order to broaden
range of usable cell types, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) will be
employed to characterize cell electrical properties and a cell-free system. To
precisely position individual cells to correctly sized working electrodes,
alternating current electrokinetics (ac EK) will be exploited and integrated
into the proposed micro/nanosystem.

The development of highly sensitive, yet simple and robust impedance-based
biosensors, integrated into a miniaturized system will enable real-time high-
throughput study of single cells, best monitoring living cells to observe,
characterize, and model functional behavior at the cellular and even finer
levels so as to explore biosensor specificity and flexibility for distinct
responses to different combinations of stimuli, making an impact on fields
ranging from biosenisng/bioinstrumentation to micro/nanosystems with
applications to the biomedical, environmental, and security needs.
Educationally, this program will impact a diverse student population through
merging biosensing and engineering education research to train the next
generation of scientific/engineering leaders.
