This Research Initiation Award will be used to study the epitaxy, stress and
interface structure which develop during the initial stages of layer growth in
sputtered thin films of alternating metal pairs. Growth conditions and metal
systems will be chosen to provide systematic variation in interface dynamics,
lattice misfit, and growth kinetics. Initial work will concentrate on the Ni/Mo
system for which sudden onset of crystallinity has been observed and which shows
large coherency stresses.
