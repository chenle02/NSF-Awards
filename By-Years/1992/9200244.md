This award will enable the National Academy of Sciences/National Research
Council (NAS/NRC) to continue activities of its Board on Atmospheric Sciences
and Climate (BASC) in FY 1992-93. Specifically BASC will: 1. Provide scientific
advice and guidance to the federal government on national and international
issues in the atmospheric sciences and climate, and on coordination between
discipline oriented activities within the atmospheric sciences and
interdisciplinary programs. 2. Continue the Climate Research Committee (CRC) to
guide and advise federal agencies on U.S. participation in the World Climate
Research Program (WCRP) 3. Maintain overview of science issues and implications
of atmospheric chemistry in the earth and environmental sciences through the
Committee on Atmospheric Chemistry (CAC). 4. Continue activities of the
Committee on Meteorological Analysis, Prediction, and Research (CMAPR) in
providing scientific oversight and assessment of basic and applies research in
meteorology, weather prediction, atmospheric and cloud physics, weather
modification turbulence and diffusion. 5. Continue activities of the Committee
on Solar-Terrestrial Research (CSTR), including participation in the
international Special Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP). 6.
Maintain capability to respond rapidly and effectively to requests by federal
agencies and congress for evaluations, guidance, recommendations, and support in
research and applications in the atmospheric and climate sciences. 7. Serve as a
focal point for (a) coordination and provision of scientific expertise for other
National Research Council units whose activities include topics on atmospheric
sciences and climate, and (b) liaison with relevant international sciences
activities.
