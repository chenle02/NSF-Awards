Over the past decades, the study of the motion of a viscous liquid interacting
with solid bodies has become one of the main focuses of applied research.
Objective of this project is to address two fundamental aspects of solid-liquid
interaction directed toward the accomplishment of the following objectives. The
first one is devoted to the motion of a rigid body with internal cavities that
are completely filled with a viscous liquid. The second one concerns the
vibration-induced motion of a rigid body in a viscous liquid. A particularly
significant case is when the vibration is induced by a time-periodically
displaced mass inside the body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interaction of a
viscous liquid with a solid body (either rigid or deformable) constitutes a
complex and intriguing topic of theoretical and applied research. In fact, not
only is it of fundamental theoretical interest, but it also represents the focus
of many engineering, biological and medical studies at different scales.
Important applications that are immediately related to the present project
include, on the one hand, dynamics of flight, space technology, and geophysical
problems, and on the other hand, robotic engineering and design of micro- and
nano-technological equipment.
