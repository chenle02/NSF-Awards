This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will permit
production of sodium chlorate without the addition of Na2Cr2O7 to the
electrolyte during electrolysis and thereby eliminate all the treatment steps
involved in removing chromate to achieve zero chrome in the crystal chlorate and
in the plant effluent streams. We propose to investigate various non-chrome
based, poorly conducting, porous films. Such films will be formed on the cathode
before assembly of the cell. We propose to demonstrate the superior performance
of such coatings for the production of chlorate in an environmentally acceptable
manner.

Potential customers for this innovation include producers of electrolytic sodium
chlorate and the sodium chlorate technology suppliers. Currently, the world
production capacity of NaClO3 is 2,800,000 metric tons/year, with the North
American share being 1,950,000 metric tons. This industry is projected to grow
at an annual rate of 2-3% through 2005.
