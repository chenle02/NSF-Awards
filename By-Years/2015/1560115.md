This REU Site award to Auburn University, located in Auburn, AL, will support
the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2017-2019.
Undergraduate students will participate in research projects in computational
biology/bioinformatics. Students will work with faculty mentors on projects
involving functional, evolutionary, environmental, and speciation genomics,
among other topics using large-scale computational analyses. Several
professional development activities are associated with the training program
such as a summer-long writing workshop, computational skills training, graduate
school preparation and planning as well as training and mentoring in the
responsible conduct of research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a
total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research
opportunities, will be trained in the program. There is a particular focus on
increasing the participation of underserved groups in computational biology
research. Students will learn how research is conducted, and will present the
results of their work at scientific conferences including a capstone research
symposium with other summer undergraduate research program participants at
Auburn. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU
programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for
Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training
program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine
student career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email
sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is
available by visiting www.auburn.edu/bioinformatics/nsf_reu.htm or by contacting
the PI Dr. Leslie Goertzen at bioinformatics@auburn.edu.
