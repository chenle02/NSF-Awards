PI: Prakash, Manu&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1453190&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
is rooted in leveraging diverse scientific fields, creating a new approach for
large-scale roll-to-roll manufacturing of optical instruments for a global need
of optical instruments in biosciences. This research is transformative because
it will create, for the first time, the ability to mass manufacture optical
instruments in a scalable and cost effective approach. This methodology of
monolithic fabrication of optical instruments is unique and has significant
implications in field microscopy, low-cost disease diagnostics, environmental
field biology and climate monitoring. The educational and outreach component of
this project includes K-12 education, international outreach in India and
Thailand, and mentoring of high school and undergraduate students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central objective is to develop a new fabrication
process for engineering low-cost optical components and new assembly protocol
for engineer miniature imaging devices with high throughput and low cost. This l
involves printing-based microfabrication and paper folding (like in origami) for
components assembling. The research plan is based on the PI's work in origami
optics, where low cost microscopes can be fabricated by folding cardboard and
installing low cost plastic lenses. This is an exciting and compelling new
direction for building microscopes with significant potential for impacting the
developing world. The research here seeks to leverage this design to improve
manufacturing processes. The approach for rapid prototyping of lenses is very
innovative and if lenses of sufficient quality can be produced, this could have
substantial impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the
Biophotonics program (CBET) in the Engineering Directorate and the IDBR program
(Instrument Development for Biological Research) in the BIO Directorate.
