9634028 FUHRMAN Although viruses are now thought to be major players in marine
food webs, we know very little about what happens to viral "biomass" in these
food webs. The subject is important because a significant fraction, on the order
of 10s of %, of total marine primary productivity passes through the viral
"compartment." While it has been assumed that this matter is utilized by
bacteria, there have been no studies of the actual fates of this material nor of
the rates with which it is transformed or decomposed. This project will use a
combination of laboratory and field studies to determine the fates of viral
matter and cell debris released when viruses lyse an organism, and the rates by
which this matter travels through different routes in the microbial food web. A
major method to be used is radiolabelling of the products of viral infection,
purification of the products, and then addition to fresh seawater. The project
will examine the interactions with bacteria, phytoplankton, and other protists.
Of particular interest is the variability of these processes, within communities
and between different times and places. It is also proposed to develop an
approach to label natural viruses with colloidal gold and then use an electron
microscopy-based analysis analogous to "isotope dilution" to estimate
simultaneously the production and loss rates of each labelled viral
morphological type. The information should improve our ability to form
conceptual and numerical models of marine microbial food webs. It also should
prove useful in the more general study of the turnover of marine dissolved
organic matter (to which viruses operationally belong), which now appears to be
of considerable significance in global geochemical cycles. ***
