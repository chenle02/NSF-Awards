IIS - 0968647 Automatic Indexing of Polyphonic Music by Cascade Classifiers Ras,

Abstract

The goal of this EAGER project is to support exploratory work on a new class of
cascade classifiers and hybrid classifiers for automatic indexing of polyphonic
music according to instruments and types of instruments. Testing new classifiers
for automatic indexing of polyphonic music, specifically those for the automatic
classification of instrumental sound from recordings of orchestral music is
difficult and involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty as to the outcome.
If successful, the results may prove to be transformative and have significant
impact on music information analysis. The work will employ resources in the
MIRAI database developed in an earlier NSF supported project. The main MIRAI
database contains about 1,000,000 musical instrument sounds, each represented as
a vector of approximately 1,000 features. Each instrument sound is identified
and matched to a corresponding instrument.
