The goal of this project is to enhance students' understanding of how the
scientific method is applied to psychological phenomena by giving them first-
hand experience with principles and methods of behavioral observation. This
project fits into a larger curriculum revision in the department aimed at
expanding students' exposure to research methods. High quality videotaping and
computerized event recorders make possible an integrative focus on observational
methods in biological, developmental, comparative, and social psychology
laboratory courses. The equipment also enhances laboratory instruction in
learning, personality, and abnormal psychology. Students mastery of
observational skills will facilitate planning and implementation of senior
thesis research. Furthermore, students acquire confidence and expertise in
modern methods and instrumentation, which better prepares them for graduate
study. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
