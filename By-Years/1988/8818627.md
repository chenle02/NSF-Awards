The proposed research relates to development of principles for engineering the
crystallization product of organic electrolyte solutions. Models to describe
adequately the nucleation and growth rates and to elucidate precipitation
mechanisms of organic electrolytes have been proposed for experimental
verification. Emphasis will be placed on developing heuristics for predicting
the inclusion of the additives in the precipitate and the role of included
additives on the properties of the precipitate crystals. The significance of
this research is its relation to the design of solids with carefully engineered
physicochemical and biological properties. These properties can dramatically
affect the biological activity of pharmaceutical products. It is expected that
the goals of the project will be accomplished by studying the precipitation
kinetics of a monoprotic acid (diphenylhydantoin) and an amino acid (glutamic
acid). The influence of other amino acids and other structurally related
additives will be studied from both a structural and a kinetic points of view.
