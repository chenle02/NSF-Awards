The first part of this research will deal with Brownian motion on negatively
curved manifolds. The investigator intends to find the Martin boundary for
strongly negatively curved manifolds, and identify the bounded solutions of the
heat equation. Also, conditions will be found under which harmonic measure on
such manifolds is absolutely continuous with respect to angular measure, in
polar coordinates. The second problem will deal with a nonlinear stochastic
version of the heat equation. The investigator will study the rate at which the
solution decays to zero. This will be a first step toward studying the
qualitative behavior of such equations. The third problem will deal with the law
of iterated logarithm for analytic functions, recently obtained by Markov. A
version of Chung's law of the iterated logarithm will be sought for analytic
functions. From this, packing dimension of the support of harmonic measure might
be found in the same way as Markov found the Hausdorff dimension of the support.
