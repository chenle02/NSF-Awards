Abstract CTS-0132695 M. Yoda, Georgia Institute of Technology

The objective of this SGER proposal is to study steady streaming flows due to
oscillating bluff bodies of complex shape in highly confined fluid geometries.
It is hypothesized that fish determine the direction of incident sound by
exploiting such flows in their inner ears. If proved to be correct, this
"auditory retina" hypothesis could lead to a new paradigm in sensory biology
with possible application in human hearing. In engineering practice, this
hypothesis could lead to compact and sensitive underwater acoustic transducers.
