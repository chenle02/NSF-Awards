The interaction of very high power radio waves with the ionospheric plasma at
high altitudes produces turbulence and irregularities that could have important
consequences on signal transmission through the medium as well as on radio
communication. This program defines a thorough experimental and theoretical
investigation of Langmuir turbulence resulting from transmissions below the
penetration frequency of the F2 layer. Analysis and publication of past results
as well as new observations from the heating facility at Arecibo, Puerto Rico
are planned.
