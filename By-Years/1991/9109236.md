This research addresses a fundamental problem of language acquisition, how
young children figure out the meanings of words. Children must determine what a
novel word refers to from a limited amount of information about how a new term
is used. Thus, word learning poses a difficult inductive problem for children.
This research proceeds from the premise that part of the solution is that
children focus quickly and effectively on the correct meaning of terms because
they consider only some kinds of hypotheses. One way children may limit
hypotheses is in accordance with the mutual exclusivity assumption, which states
that children expect each object to have only one label. Although previous
findings strongly suggest that preschool children use mutual exclusivity to
guide their interpretation of a novel label, there is as yet little evidence
about children beginning to acquire language. Moreover, alternative explanations
for some of the findings have been raised. Controlled experimental tests of
these alternative explanations will establish how mutual exclusivity is used by
beginning language learners. The research will determine how mutual exclusivity
supplements other information and how it provides children with a safeguard
against certain errors. This work will enrich our understanding of how word-
learning assumptions interact with cognitive, linguistic, and environmental
factors to help very young children figure out what words mean. This improved
understanding of the basic processes underlying language acquisition might
better enable early childhood educators to provide learning environments that
will facilitate word learning, and may promote more accurate diagnoses and more
effective remediation of language disorders.
