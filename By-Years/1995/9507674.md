The teeth of primates, both living and fossil, represent the most complete
evidence of the evolution, ecology, life history, and taxonomy of this important
group. The microscopic structure of tooth enamel, a previously neglected aspect
of tooth morphology, holds great promise for increasing our understanding of
primate dental function and phylogenetic relationships. This research will
document enamel variation in a broad taxonomic sample of living and fossil
primates, and use these data to test specific functional hypotheses and to
assess the phylogenetic utility of enamel characters. It represents an important
step forward in the comprehensive study of these rare biological and fossil
specimens. The research design consists of two components: 1) analysis of
intraspecific and interspecific variation in enamel in a broad sample of living
primates and 2) analysis of enamel evolution, based on comprehensive sampling of
molar tooth enamel of fossil primates. Analyses will be based on scanning
electron microscopy of histological specimens of mature enamel. The objectives
of the study are: 1) To test the hypothesis that differences in occlusal enamel
among functionally distinct areas of molar teeth are linked to differential
resistance to wear. 2) To test the hypothesis of linkage between some enamel
features and body size. 3) To test hypotheses of functional constraints on
enamel structure among developmentally and functionally distinct parts of the
dentition (e.g., incisors, canines, premolars, molars). 4) To explore the links
between enamel structure and diet using comparative study of closely related
primates that differ in diet, and statistical methods of matrix correlation
analysis. 5) To assess the phyletic utility of enamel characters among living
primates, and, using phylogenetically reliable enamel characters, to test
hypotheses of relationships among fossil primates. This research will be the
most comprehensive study of primate enamel structure to date. By study of
mechanically important enamel characters it will contribute to a broader
understanding of dental function and evolution in Primates. Moreover, it will go
a long way towards establishing how enamel structure can and cannot be used to
resolve questions of phylogeny and systematics.
