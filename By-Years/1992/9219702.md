The initiation and development of folds in layered rocks is a fundamental
phenomena, however the process involves a complex set of possible variables.
This project continues research on folding in layered materials by modeling in
linear and non-linear viscous materials. Finite element models will study how
shape and strain distribution in single-layer and multilayer folds vary as a
function of viscosity contrast, the exponent in a constitutive relation of
power-law type, and initial shape, wavelength and layer spacing. Results should
increase understanding of the fundamental controls on the rheology of rocks
deformed under natural conditions.
