This proposal provides for U.S. cognizance of European academic networking
plans and activities, and for support of the U.S. segment of a joint United
States - French network development project which will, when complete,
facilitate interworking between U.S. and European academic and research- support
computer networks. By taking out liaison membership in RARE (Reseaux Associes
pour la Recherche Europeanne) the Principal Investigator will be eligible to
attend (without voting status) both technical and policy meetings of RARE; by
both speaking and listening he will be able to apprise RARE members of US
networking requirements, to influence RARE recommendations, and to learn at the
earliest stage of RARE activities that may affect US networks. RARE,
representing high-end users, and ECMA (the European Computer Manufacturers
Association) are the two most influential Pan-European bodies influencing
computer networking standards and their harmonization. The project also provides
for US expenses in joint United States-French development of a gateway that will
translate between the US and European versions of the International Standards
Organization (ISO) computer networking protocols; without such a gateway, US and
European networks will not interoperate even though both "conform to the ISO
protocols". Infrastructure funded by the project includes the US share of a 56
kilobit satellite link between the US and France; the link will allow United
States and French participants to collaborate in the gateway development, serve
as a testbed for the gateway itself, and in addition carry selected routine
operational traffic between the US and the RARE community.
