9625179 Grant This Americas Program award will fund a visit to Santiago, Chile,
by Dr. William E. Grant, Texas A&M University, to plan a workshop on systems
analysis and simulation of Chilean ecological systems, with the collaboration of
Dr. George-Nascimento, Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion,
Concepcion, Chile. The workshop will bring together a selected team of U.S.,
Chilean, Argentinean, and other Southern Cone scientists and graduate students
with similar ecological interests, with the objective of developing and
evaluating initial simulation models of several ecological systems. to help
