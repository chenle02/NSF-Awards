This award supports cooperative work between Charles Dalton, University of
Houston, and Zhuang Lixian, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China
on wake dynamics around a cylinder in oscillatory flows. This is an important
problem, with potential application to understanding offshore wave loading on
pile structures. This collaboration involves the strengths and innovation in
computational approaches of the Chinese team, and the US PI's experience and
accomplishments in prediction of unsteady wakes. Both countries will benefit
from further understanding of such phenomena as boundary layer separation,
vortex shedding, flow instability, wake turbulence, and wake vortex motions due
to both induced-velocity and convective effects. These results may be applied to
improved design of offshore structures. This award provides eighteen months of
graduate student support, which will be used to enable the participation of a US
student. The Chinese have obtained support from the Chinese National Natural
Science Foundation.
