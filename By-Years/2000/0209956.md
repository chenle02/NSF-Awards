0209956&lt;br/&gt;French&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award supports US-
UK cooperative research and undergraduate research experiences in organic
chemistry. The investigators are Andrew N. French at Albion College and Thomas
Wirth at Cardiff University in Wales. The project involves the synthesis of
chiral hypervalent iodine compounds. The goals are to design new chiral
hypervalent iodine reagents, to determine their scope and limitations, and to
investigate the possibility of catalysis. Undergraduate students will perform
both synthesis and evaluation of the compounds, first during a semester in the
US laboratory, then followed by a summer in Wales with the Wirth group.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US researcher brings to this project expertise in
synthesis and evaluation of chiral hypervalent iodine compounds. This is
complemented by the similar UK's expertise in organoselenium chemistry and
reagents. This research partnership will advance the chemistry of new reagents
and their possible uses. It will also integrate education and research in an
international environment. The US undergraduates will have an opportunity to
conduct research in a laboratory at a major graduate institution and university
in the United Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;
