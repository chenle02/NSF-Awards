The goal of this proposal is to increase our understanding of the mechanisms
that normally regulate homologous recombination in mammalian cells. Such an aim
seems relevant in light of the often made observation that cancer cells exhibit
aberrant chromosomal rearrangements. To study homologous recombination, mouse
Ltk cell lines will be transfected with DNA substrates that contain two
defective Herpes thymidine kinase (tk) gene sequences. Recombination events that
reconstruct a functional tk gene will be monitored by the appearance of tk-
positive cells. This work will refine earlier measurements of the homology
dependence of "normal" recombination as well as explore the possibility that DNA
lesions or sequences that promote DNA strand breakage can alter the rate or
relax the homology requirements of recombination. %%% This proposal also
includes studies of "gene targeting", or homologous recombination between a
transfected molecule and a specific chromosomal target sequence. Gene targeting
offers a powerful tool for studying gene function and potentially a methodology
for eventual gene therapy. By studying gene targeting events involving a
selectable chromosomal marker, they propose to measure the homology dependence
as well as make an assessment of the rate-limiting step of targeted
recombination. Experiments will also be done to test the hypotheses that
inhibiting random integration of DNA into a mammalian genome will improve
targeting efficiency.
