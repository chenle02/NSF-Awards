This project will use meta-analysis to synthesize the results of independent
ecological studies. Meta-analysis is a statistical approach that has had a
profound impact on the resolution of longstanding questions in other fields, but
has not previously been used in ecology. The research will extend existing meta-
analysis techniques taken from the social sciences and epidemiology to analyze
ecological data and to address ecological questions. Methods currently used to
synthesize research results in ecology are logically, conceptually, and
statistically flawed. Meta-analysis offers a sounder alternative, but the
statistical models available are inadequate for many important tasks in ecology,
such as examining interactions among factors. The proposed study will develop
meta-analytic statistical models from ecological research (mixed models and
factorial designs). These models will then be used to resolve a specific
question, that of the effects of competition in the presence and in the absence
of predators. Meta-analysis can potentially change the way conclusions are drawn
from the outcome of experiments in ecology, and may have a major influence on
the way data are collected, analyzed and interpreted in this field.
