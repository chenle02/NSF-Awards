This project will examine the geochemistry of oceanic basalts by isotopic and
trace element study to examine detailed geological processes such as magma
supply dynamics beneath mid-oceanic ridges, convection in magma chambers, and
ridge-plume mixing phenomena. Study areas include the East Pacific Rise, the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and the Galapagos Islands.
