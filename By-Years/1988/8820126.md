The nickel sulfide deposits at Kambalda, Western Australia are the type-
examples of Archean komatiite-associated nickel sul- fide ores. Stratigraphic
and volcanological relationships at Kambalda suggest that the lowermost flows
were channelized, that they may have assimilated underlying sediments and
basalts, and that this may have induced sulfide separation, modified magma:
sulfide ratios, and influenced the composition of the sulfide ores. An essential
element in the evaluation of this process is a determination of the degree of
hybridization experienced by the host units. Although there is abundant
geochemical and isotopic evidence that associated komatiitic basalts have been
contaminated by granitic crust during ascent, geochemical recognition of
hybridization in the komatiites is hampered by the dynamic nature of the lava
flows and a paucity of detailed geo- chemical data in critical areas. The
purpose of this project is to evaluate the degree of hybridization within the
basal host units and across the komatiite sequence, using the trace element
geochemistry of specially selected samples taken from diamond drill core and
underground miner openings. Geochemical analyses will be performed by wavelength
dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and isotope dilution mass
spectrometry. Metasomatic alteration during low grade regional metamorphism will
be evaluated using mass balance calculations and emphasis will be placed on
least-mobile trace elements. The degree of hybridi- zation will be established
by linear least-squares mixing calcu- lations and the combined effects of
fractional crystallization and assimilation will be modeled thermodynamically.
The results of this study will have wide applications in the fields of Archean
geology, volcanology, and economic geology.
