This award provides funds to the Division of Medical Sciences at Harvard
University to continue a successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates
SITE. The Division supervises Ph.D. training programs of the Graduate School of
Arts and Sciences for students who are engaged in biological research in
laboratories on the Medical School campus. This 10 week summer research program
will support 10 undergraduate students working in the fields of microbial
biochemistry and genetic regulation. A research-related course, a student-
faculty research seminar series that will include discussions of ethical issues
related to the project focus, and a career development discussion series will
accompany the laboratory research. Students will be recruited from a nation-wide
pool, with a particular emphasis on recruiting qualified minority students and
women. They will have the opportunity to carry out projects in the laboratories
of any of 17 Division faculty who are participating in this program. The
undergraduates will also be provided with opportunities to meet other majority
and minority research faculty and graduate students, in both academic and social
settings.
