The principal investigator will study the implementation of nonlinear filtering
algorithms to be used in real-time applications. In order to implement a
filtering algorithm, it is necessary to discretize the state space, the
observation space, and the time interval. This leads to comparatively simple
equations for the optimal filter, or conditional expectation, which are a
combination of ordinary differential equations and linear updating operations.
Filtering is the general theory of extracting signal from noisy observations.
Applications include such diverse areas as radar image analysis, sonar tracking,
flight control, quality assessment, stock market policy making, processing of
pictures transmitted from spacecraft, and general parameter estimation for
random systems.
