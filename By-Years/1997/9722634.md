Theoretical and computational research into the collisional and radiative
processes of atoms in laboratory and cosmic plasmas will be performed.
Particular attention will be directed toward high density, magnetized plasmas of
interest to inertial fusion, laser-matter interactions and compact stellar
remnants such as white dwarfts and neutron stars.
