This award supports cooperative research in commutative algebra to be conducted
by Wolmer Vasconcelos of Rutgers University and Aron Simis of the Federal
University of Bahia in Brazil. They will study Cohen-Macaulay rings and modules
which are connected with many parts of combinatorics, geometry and algebra. They
will also compute the invariants of these algebras. Specifically, the work will
aim at finding the solution to and detecting Cohen-Macaulay structure in systems
of polynomial equations in large numbers of indeterminants. This has been a
productive cooperation to date producing twelve papers so far. Therefore it is a
good example of international collaboration with benefit to both sides.
