New electronic and optical instrumentation will be acquired for two advanced
laboratories. This will include equipment for computer control, digital data
acquisition, data storage, and data treatment in several different modern
physics experiments involving chaos, the speed of light, superconductivity,
atomic energy states, and optical interference and diffraction. A whole new
field of laser related physics experiments will be opened for students with the
acquisition of the proposed pulsed YAG and the tunable CW diode laser systems.
New experiments in non-linear optics, Q switching, CW and pulsed laser
operation, diode laser mode structure, molecular spectroscopy, coherence length
and others will be introduced. Fiber optics experiments involving single and
multimode propagation, mode structure, and data transmission will be introduced.
The equipment is state of the art and presents students with the opportunity to
employ modern measurement capabilities in studying important physical phenomena
of current interest.
