The principal investigator, in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Hoisch (Northern
Arizona University), will study metamorphic rocks of the Big Maria Mountains in
southeastern California using petrologic and isotopic techniques. The
investigation will help geologists to understand fluid flow and fluid-rock
interaction in rocks that have undergone metamorphism at mid-crustal depths in
the Earth.
