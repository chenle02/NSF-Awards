Karen Armstrong-Malatesta DUE 9551624 Princeton University FY1995 $ Princeton,
NJ 8544 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Life Sciences Title: Instrumentation for
Modern Developmental Biology Laboratories A cell and developmental biology
laboratory unit is being developed for two introductory courses in cell,
developmental and molecular biology. This laboratory unit includes a series of
intellectually cohesive exercises based on the biology of the developing sea
urchin embryo. Designing the unit this way enables the inclusion of more
sophisticated techniques and more in-depth data analysis than is possible if the
laboratory exercises are unrelated to each other. Students perform experiments
to determine the kinetics of larval alkaline phosphatase, investigate the tissue
distribution and temporal restriction of ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal
antigens, and determine if perturbing development affects expression of these
same antigens. The methods that students use to answer these questions include
protein isolation, a colorimetric assay for enzyme activity, whole-mount
immunocytochemistry, fluorescence microscopy, blastomere separation and culture,
and an ELISA assay. Upon development and refinement of this laboratory unit the
two PIs will publish the laboratory manual for distribution outside Princeton
University.
