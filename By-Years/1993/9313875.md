9313875 Goodman In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Lionel Goodman of the Department of Chemistry of
Rutgers University will study the methyl group internal rotational motions in a
number of molecules using the techniques of Rydberg and ZEKE (Zero Kinetic
Energy) spectroscopy. The shapes and heights of the torsional potential barriers
in the ground-, radical cation-, and excited Rydberg states will be obtained in
order to provide data for testing molecular models for internal rotation
potentials. %%% The torsional motions of methyl groups in molecules are
presently under intensive investigation for the insight that they provide to the
problem of intramolcular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR). The goal of
controlling chemical reactions by laser excitations requires an understanding of
how the excitation energy flows into various possible reaction channels. Methyl
group torsional motions can be studied in an accessible region of the spectrum
and offer a one dimensional theoretical model for tracking IVR. ***
