Antiquated equipment for doing Moessbauer spectroscopy is replaced and
renovated. The system is used in studies of effects of dispersion and support
interaction on catalyst selectivity and stability in acetonitrile synthesis
catalysts, of the active sites involved in the synthesis of methanol over
supported iron-platinum catalysts, and of the role of the surface chemical state
of tin in tin-containing methane oxidative coupling catalysts.
