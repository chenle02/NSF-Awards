United States building codes have been very successful in protecting life safety
during earthquakes, but they do not aim to protect against damage and high
repair costs. Despite societal concerns over economic disruption after a future
earthquake, a building's susceptibility to damage is almost never analyzed
during the structural design process. This leaves us with a building stock that
is vulnerable to damage, monetary loss, and possible closure after an
earthquake. This I-Corps team's research activities and long-term vision focus
on enabling engineers to consider damage/loss reduction in the building design
process.

The team's plan is to create a commercial software tool that enables engineers
to predict seismic damage and loss as part of the design process. This design
approach will be new to many engineers, so the tool will be created to also
provide Probable Maximum Loss (PML) analyses results (which engineers are
accustomed to doing for the mortgage industry). If successful, this new design
approach and the enabling software tool could revolutionize the way that
buildings are designed in seismic areas. Specifically, this software tool (and
the theory implemented in the tool) will give engineers a clearer understanding
of the extent to which buildings will be damaged in earthquakes and provide an
estimate of the cost to repair the buildings; this will enable engineers to
design buildings in such a way as to reduce the seismic damage and repair costs,
instead of using the current approach of only designing buildings to protect the
life safety of building occupants.
