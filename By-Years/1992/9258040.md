The research to be conducted under this award will include laboratory and field
investigations of photochemical and dynamical factors that govern the chemical
composition of the earth's atmosphere. An attempt will be made to gain a
mechanistic understanding of low-temperature processes which determine the
concentration of ozone in the stratosphere and radiation balance in the upper
troposphere.
