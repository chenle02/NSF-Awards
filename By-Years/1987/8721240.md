The purpose of this conference series is to stimulate discussion and research on
the frontiers of the state-of-the-art of econometric and mathematical economic
theory and methodology, and the application of advanced mathematical,
statistical and numerical analysis techniques in empirical economic studies. The
conference is an attempt to hasten and improve knowledge and its use, by
shortening the time lags between the conception of ideas and their dissemination
and by inducing leading scholars to cooperatively apply their talents to
selected, unresolved issues which they feel are currently receiving inadequate
attention. The conference series has played an important role in providing
informal channels of communication to specialists and young scholars in
mathematical economics and econometrics. The recent record of successes point to
its continuing vigor and ability to accomplish its goals.
