This research will involve finite element analysis and other general purpose
computational methods applied to continum mechanics problems. Convective-
diffusive flows will be modelled with finite element methods, as will
compressible purley convective flows. The research also includes utilization of
adaptive grid technqiues, and element-by-element factorization procedures.
