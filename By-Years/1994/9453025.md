9453025 MacNeice ABSTRACT Washington Independent Writers is engaged in a
planning phase toward publication of Quest?, a 4-page, tabloid sized newspaper
about science, technology, and society for children and their families. The
target audience is children age 8 to 16, with a focus on the 10-14 year-old age
group, along with their parents, teachers, and counselors. A prototype version
of the paper has been published locally and distributed through Safeway stores.
During the planning phase, the PI and staff will conduct the following
activities: o Conduct front-end evaluation of the target audience with
particular emphasis being given to identifying ways to reach underserved and
underrepresented groups. o Work with science, technology, and graphics experts
to improve the quality of the content and design. o Explore traditional and new
distribution mechanisms and cooperative arrangements. o Create and test
interdisciplinary procedures for evaluation. o Establish a network of
individual, community, corporate, and institutional supporters, including
educators, community leaders, scientists, and engineers. o Create linkages with
schools and school programs. o Explore funding sources and sponsorships. o
Continue building a Board of Advisors.
