This project will investigate algorithmic solutions to several geometric
problems arising in layered manufacturing, where a physical prototype of a 3D
object is built directly from its computer model by orienting and slicing the
model into parallel layers and manufacturing the layers successively. The
problems considered include finding orientations of the model that optimize one
or more design criteria (e.g., number of layers, surface finish, amount of
support structures needed), and algorithms for model decomposition, packing,
slicing, support generation, and computation of offsets and tool-paths. The
scope of the project includes the design and analysis of efficient and practical
algorithms, their implementation in software, and, furthermore, the evaluation
of this software via actual fabrication of parts on a layered manufacturing
machine. The project will draw upon combinatorial, algorithmic, and data
structuring techniques from computational geometry. The project will also
benefit considerably from the input and practical expertise of engineers at a
leading company specializing in layered manufacturing, with whom a collaboration
is already underway. It is expected that the proposed work will result in
significant design and performance improvements in layered manufacturing and
will also open up interesting new directions for research in computational
geometry.
