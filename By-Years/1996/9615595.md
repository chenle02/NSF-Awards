9615595 Kaufman WNET is conducting planning for Wild TV, a new environmental
education public television series for children ages 8-13. The planning
activities consist of post-production and evaluation of a new version of the
pilot episode of the series. WNET will reversion the pilot episode to address
concerns raised by the reviewers to a previous proposal, as well as
incorporating recommendations from the formative evaluation conducted by RMC
Research Corporation. During the planning phase, the producers will work closely
with Dr. Betty Faber and Mark Testa, two environmental educators with expertise
in extra-curricular settings. These educators have been added to the advisory
committee and Dr. Faber will serve as lead content advisor to the project. After
production of the revised pilot is completed, RMC Research Corporation will
conduct another evaluation to determine the effectiveness of the revisions to
the project.
