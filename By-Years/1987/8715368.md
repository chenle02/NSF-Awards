Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award, co-supported by
the Chemical Instrumentation Program and the Biological Instrumentation Program,
will help the Chemistry Department of the University of Hawaii, Manoa to acquire
a high-field NMR spectrometer. The areas of research that will be enhanced by
the acquisition include: 1) Structure Elucidation of Compounds from Marine
Organisms with Immunomodulating or Antitumor Activity 2) Isomers of Vitamin A,
Visual Pigments and Carotenoids 3) Amino Proton Resonances as Probes of
Oligonucleotide Interactions and Helical Conformation 4) New Pharmaceuticals and
Agrochemicals from Blue-green Algae and Marine Organisms that Harbor Algal
Symbionts 5) Conformation of Biological Macromolecules 6) Marine Natural
Products
