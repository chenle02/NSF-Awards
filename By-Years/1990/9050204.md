This project is designed to develop, test, and prepare for dissemination
curricular materials to encourage active and comprehensive student learning in
geography in grades 6-12. These materials will build on the structure used for
the videotapes on "Global Geography", produced and disseminated by the Agency
for Instructional Technology. That structure is based on major geographic themes
and concepts that are keyed to important global issues. The project will engage
nationally-known geographers, educators, and outstanding classroom teachers in a
major program to develop materials that are inquiry-based, issue-oriented, and
based on specific data. They will build critical thinking skills and address
attitudes and values. They will reinforce the widely adopted "five fundamental
themes" in geography and will encourage and facilitate learning a variety of
geographic skills. The project will test the materials locally in Colorado
classrooms and nationally through the network of state-based geographic
alliances supported by the National Geographic Society. The materials will be
relevant for use throughout the U.S. and in a variety of community settings.
