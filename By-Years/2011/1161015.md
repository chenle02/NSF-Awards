The University of North Carolina Charlotte (UNCC), George Mason University (GMU)
and the University of California-Davis (UCD) are collaborating to establish the
proposed center, with UNCC as the lead institution. The planning grant will
permit these universities to coordinate, prepare and conduct meetings with
potential industry members who have expressed interest in joining CCAA.

The goal of the proposed center is to build the critical mass of an inter-
disciplinary academic researchers and industry partnership for addressing the
current and future challenges of configuration analytics and automation to
improve enterprise IT system and service manageability, performance,
assurability, security and sustainability; and applying innovative analytics and
automation to complex networked systems including: enterprise networking of
clouds and data centers, hybrid and cyber-physical systems, smart critical
infrastructures, mission-oriented networks (sensor-actuator networks), virtual
overlays, social networks and mobile systems.

The proposed center will address the need of large Enterprises in the private
sectors dealing with regulatory compliance requirements; government
organizations; and IT product providers who have significant share of the market
either in private sector or government and those niche products adopted by
specific industries such as IT management systems, and emerging cloud services
who are essential participants. The three participating universities have a
strong record of industry collaboration and technology transfer. In addition,
CCAA has a strong educational components that includes training undergraduate
and graduate students, creating a new multi-disciplinary certificate on
Configuration Analytics at UNCC, and involving minority and under-represented
students through courses, seminars, workshops and research projects.
