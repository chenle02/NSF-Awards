With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor
Alexander Schwab from Appalachian State University and colleagues Grant Holder,
Nicole Bennett, Michael Ramey and Michael Hambourger will acquire a 400 MHz NMR
spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education
at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) investigation to probe whether
there is a kinetic microwave effect utilizing the Wittig reaction of stabilized
ylides; (b) structure of the organic anion transporter in biological membranes;
(c) cobalt bis(glyoxime) complexes as reversible catalysts for hydrogen
production; (d) metabolic screening of antioxidant-bearing raw materials using
1H NMR and multivariate analysis; (e) multifunctional hexaphenylbenzenes; and
(f) modular approach to metal coordination polymer
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This
instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research at
Appalachian State University.
