This program is designed to provide differentiated science instruction to
teachers of grades 3-8 so they can be equipped to teach and motivate gifted and
talented students in their classes. It will consist of a two week intensive
summer workshop and an academic-year follow up. The teachers will be trained in
science areas (notably Physics, Geology and Earth Science) in which they are
admittedly weak; they will be provided with experiences to develop skills in
motivating gifted students; they will have opportunities to produce teaching
materials and kits to take back to their schools; they will establish teams of
participants in each school system to act as resource individuals and future
leaders in their school systems. An equivalent of 25 percent of the NSF award is
being contributed as cost sharing.
