Sensorimotor Transformations in the Withdrawal Reflex&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of this project is to understand how the location of a sensory stimulus
relates to the direction of reflex movement that it evokes in the tail
withdrawal reflex of the rat. Previous studies have suggested the movement is
directed away from the stimulus, while others propose that the response is
relatively independent of the location of sensory stimulus. Brief, pinpoint
stimuli will be delivered to different parts of the rat tail and the direction
and magnitude of the reflex withdrawal response will be recorded using force
transducers. Multiple stimuli will also be delivered to determine how the
central processing of the two responses interacts. These studies will greatly
enhance training of undergraduates and future faculty by establishing a Teacher
Scholar Fellowship opportunity. The actual results of these studies will allow
evaluation of the two alternative hypotheses described above and more generally
provide information on how the central nervous system processes sensory
information. This information may be important for better designing artificial
robot systems to avoid disturbances and understanding the basic rules by which
the nervous system transforms sensory information.&lt;br/&gt;
