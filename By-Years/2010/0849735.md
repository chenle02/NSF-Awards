This proposal is concerned with formal modeling of risk analysis as it relates
to the security of systems. Risk analysis in the literature has focused on
offline computations in conjunction with a manual response. We propose a real-
time approach to risk management by dynamically trading utility for security. A
consequence of our approach is that it provides users with the maximum possible
functionality for any predefined level of risk tolerance.&lt;br/&gt; We model
risk management through flow adjustment in a tripartite graphs, with the
partitions corresponding to threats, permissions and assets in the system. The
focus is on establishing the complexities for the various flow queries in this
setting. We have already established that some of the problems in this setting
are weakly NP-complete and this raises the possibility of designing polynomial
approximation schemes for them.&lt;br/&gt;
