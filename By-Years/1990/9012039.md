Title: Developing New Alliances for Increasing Minority Participation in Science
and Engineering This grant assists the Institute for Space, Science and
Technology to increase the visibility of the current status of minorities in
science and engineering and to design solutions for effecting change. The
Institute will inform and help mobilize the leadership of the Congressional
Black Caucus, the leaders of selected Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCU), other national leaders, and universities and colleges in
the Washington/Baltimore Metropolitan area. Specific activities to be conducted
include: 1. collecting, analyzing and reporting critical information on minority
students, educational programs and institutions, scientific and technical
businesses, and service and community organizations in preparation for a
Washington/Baltimore alliance for increasing minority access and graduations in
the sciences and engineering; and 2. developing a plan for the White House
Initiative for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to enhance
the contribution of HBCUs in increasing minorities in science and engineering.
