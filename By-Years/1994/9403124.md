9403124 Nguyen Dr. Sonbinh T. Nguyen has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Nguyen received his doctoral degree from
the California Institute of Technology under the supervision of Professor Robert
Grubbs. Dr. Nguyen will continue research at the Scripps Research Institute
under the sponsorship of Professor Barry Sharpless. His postdoctoral research
will train him in the fundamentals of transition metal mediated asymmetric
catalysis. Specifically he will study the reaction mechanism of the osmium-
catalyzed dihydroxylation of olefins. Longer term, he plans to focus his
research on the metal-catalyzed 2+1 cycloaddition of carbenes and nitrenes to
double bonds, with particular emphasis on the rhodium-catalyzed aziridination
reaction. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed
as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
