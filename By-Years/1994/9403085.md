9403085 Goroff Dr. Nancy S. Goroff has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Goroff received her doctoral degree from the
University of California at Los Angeles under the supervision of Professor
Francois Diederich. Dr. Goroff will continue research at Michigan State
University under the sponsorship of Professor James Jackson. Her postdoctoral
research will focus on the structure and reactivity of bis-alkynylcarbenes and
other neutral odd-numbered pi-systems. Longer term, she plans to develop a
research program probing the structure and reactivity of other neutral all-
carbon molecules by photoelectron spectroscopy and matrix isolation. The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
