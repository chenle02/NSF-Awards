Professor Strauss will investigate conditions under which a plasma may become
turbulent, especially under the influence of a large initial disturbance,
collisions of particles or reflections off boundaries. He will study the
solitary waves of various energy-conserving systems and their stability
properties. He will also study the scattering of solutions of scalar wave
equations, both linear and nonlinear.
