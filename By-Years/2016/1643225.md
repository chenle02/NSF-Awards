The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to evaluate
the market potential of a technology that can essentially store and transport
molecules of biological and clinical significance without refrigeration.
Currently, the lack of proper infrastructure of cold-chain logistics
geographically limits distribution and storage of critical biomolecules. The
development and commercial implementation of a technology that can enable room
temperature stabilization of important biological molecules opens the door for
highly sensitive diagnostic devices in the field and in developing regions.
Furthermore, stabilization of biologics at room temperature can significantly
reduce shipping and storage costs reducing the overall end-user pricing for the
drugs. A business strategy based on successful implementation of such a
technology can provide a strong case for delivering high quality healthcare
anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps Project is based on a novel method
for creating a highly uniform vitrified (glassy) coating to preserve and protect
temperature sensitive biologics including cells and proteins. Formation of a
uniformly vitrified environment surrounding the biomolecules in thin film format
can arrest degradative chemical reactions and enable storage. The thin-film
vitrification technique primarily depends on preferential desiccation of a
substrate containing the biomolecules. The technique utilizes a carbohydrate-
based formulation which facilitates rapid vitrification at desiccated state.
Besides biomolecules, hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells vitrified at
ambient temperatures using this process have been shown to successfully retain
their viability following processing.
