The U. of New Orleans establishes a Research Expereinces for Undergrdautes (REU)
Site in the general area of nanostructured materials. The REU Site is affiliated
with the interdisciplinary Advanced Materials Research Institute at the
University. Eight students are recruited every year for a ten-week summer
research experience. Recruitment efforts focus on undergraduates from
historically black colleges and universities in the New Orleans area. The REU
Site involves faculty mentors from the Chemistry and Physics departments.
Students participate in research projects within the areas of synthesis,
characterization and application of nanoparticles and their composites and
assemblies. Undergraduates also attend scientific and professional development
seminars, a session on research ethics, and participate in field trips to local
industrial and related sites and in organized social activities.
