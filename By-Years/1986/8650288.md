Through the purchase of a liquid scintillation counter (LSC), the Biology
Department at Valdosta State College is adding radioisotope experiments to its
curriculum in Immunology and Cellular Biology and, to a lesser extent, to
laboratory work in Chemistry and Physics. The Cellular Biology laboratory has
completed the first phase of its development, and students have grown mammalian
cells under varying growth conditions. Acquisition of the LSC completes the
second phase of the development plan. Students now are able to carry out
experiments at the molecular level. This will enable them to work through
techniques which are aimed at gaining a better understanding of principles that
lie at the foundation of modern molecular biology. Support for the Physics and
Chemistry Departments through this project also contributes to the modernization
of their laboratories, enabling all three departments to provide their
undergraduates with a safe introduction to laboratory uses of tritium and
carbon-14. Valdosta State enjoys an enviable reputation for sending graduates on
to advanced studies, and the benefits gained through this project should enhance
the preparation received by many of its science majors.
