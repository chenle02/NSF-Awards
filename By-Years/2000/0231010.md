0231010&lt;br/&gt;Raikh&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the PI and postdoctoral
and graduate students from the University of Utah in a collaboration with Felix
von Oppen of the Department of Physics at the Free University of Berlin,
Germany. Combining complementary expertise, the German and US groups will make a
theoretical study of Coulomb drag between low-density electron systems. A
crucial element of the research is the use of Monte Carlo methods in simulation,
which is a technique the German side specializes, and the simulations will be
carried out in Berlin. Coulomb drag has garnered interests from both theorists
and experimentalists in the past few years because it reveals makes measurement
of intra-layer electron correlation possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
also has an educational objective. The project will allow postdocs and graduate
students from the University to gain experience with Monte Carlo simulations
during the summer at the Free University. Besides exposing them to one of the
foremost groups in Monte Carlo techniques, this will also make them more
competitive in the global job market.&lt;br/&gt;
