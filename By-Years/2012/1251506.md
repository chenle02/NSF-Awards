This proposal supports the continuation and extension of the highly successful
program of Summer Institutes in Social and Personality Psychology. Scheduled
every two years, the SISPP brings together approximately 80 graduate students in
social and personality psychology from graduate programs throughout North
America and abroad for an advanced two-week intensive training program, led by
the best scholars in the field. Supported by NSF, the first five SISPPs (2003
through 2011) have been highly successful in its goals of providing advanced
training in theory and methodology. Evaluations of the first five SISPPs
indicate that they were exceptionally strong in both intellectual merit and
broader impacts. Participating in SISPP has significantly facilitated the
scholarly careers of several cohorts of new social and personality
psychologists, offering unique training and collaborative
experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SISPP is designed to provide promising young
scholars with intensive experience and instruction into cutting-edge theories,
research, and methods. Preference is given to students who do not have access to
this expertise at their home institutions. In order to make valued
contributions, young scholars must have access to the increasingly specialized
knowledge and technical complexity that marks the best research programs. The
SISPP program is carefully designed to provide instruction in research domains
and methodological innovations that represent the field's most promising areas.
It offers an intensive and intimate intellectual experience. Thus participation
in SISPP significantly enhances the training of young scholars and stimulates
significant and innovative research.
