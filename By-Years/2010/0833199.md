High-end computing systems are needed to study important, compute-intensive
applications such as scientific simulations, multimedia stream processing, and
geographical information systems. While these systems are still evolving, it is
clear that they will be extremely large and complex, with tens to hundreds of
thousands of processors providing a deep hierarchy of systems and resources.
This research will develop the theory, techniques, and building blocks that can
be used by domain scientists who are not expert parallel programmers to compose
efficient applications for such complex systems.&lt;br/&gt;Hence, the outcomes
of the research should greatly increase the number of potential users of high-
end machines to include essentially all scientists whose problems could take
advantage of such systems. The software resulting from this research, including
the testbed applications for important problems in computational biology and
physics, will be made publically available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Composition is
a natural way to construct and reason about large, complex systems. This
research will develop compositional strategies for building applications and for
optimizing and controlling the application and its use of system
resources.&lt;br/&gt;This project will use the STAPL (the Standard Template
Adaptive Parallel Library) infrastructure for parallel C++ code. STAPL includes
of a collection of generic parallel algorithms and distributed containers. In
this research, STAPL's existing adaptive capabilities will be further refined
and novel techniques will be developed for compositional performance modeling
and for providing fault-tolerance capabilities that can be set individually for
each container or algorithm instance in the program. A modern programming
interface will be designed based on composition of parallel operations that will
be modeled on the range abstractions in STAPL and C++0x and directly supported
by a high-level compiler.&lt;br/&gt;
