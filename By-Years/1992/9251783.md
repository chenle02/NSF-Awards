The Department of Biological Sciences at Mankato State University has recognized
strengths in microbiology, environmental science, toxicology, and an emerging
program in biotechnology. The department is dedicated to providing hands- on
training to undergraduate students. Purchase of a Lachat Ion Analyzer will
enhance interdisciplinary undergraduate instruction and student research related
to the analyses of constituents such as nutrients (phosphates, nitrogen
species), salts (chlorides, sulfates), trace metals (sodium, calcium), and other
chemistries that are important in growth and fermentation processes. This
capability will provide a significant improvement over the typical laboratory
exercise by allowing the student to progress beyond data collection and number
generation to data analysis, data interpretation, and decision making.
