Experimental investigations on the growth behavior and properties of metal
surfaces, interfaces, overlayers, and multilayer structures. The purpose is to
understand the principles governing their crystalline form, chemical
composition, and electronic properties. Techniques employed include
photoemission, at synchrotron sources and in-house, Auger spectroscopy, electron
diffraction, molecular beam epitaxy, and scanning tunneling microscopy and
spectroscopy.
