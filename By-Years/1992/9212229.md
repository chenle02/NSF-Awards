The project involves the data capture into MUSE of approximately 114,000 records
of fishes in the WHOI collection being transferred to Harvard as well as the
older fish collection at the MCZ. After entry, the data will be verified against
the collection using the collection printout. The database will be made
accessible to scientists and students and will be used for collection management
purposes. %%% This project will complete the computer cataloguing of the fish
collections at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, especially the collection of
adult and larval fishes transferred from the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution. These collections are unparalleled in documentation and quality and
are critical to research on fish biology, diversity and ecology. The
computerization of these collections will make them much more accessible to
scientists and students and increase the role of these fish collections in
research and education.
