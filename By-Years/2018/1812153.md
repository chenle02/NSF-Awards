The richest symmetry groups in nature are exemplified by the collection of all
rotations of a two-dimensional sphere or the collection of all rigid motions of
the Euclidean plan. The operations of applying two symmetries in order, and of
inverting a symmetry to get another one, endow these sets of symmetries with the
structure known in mathematics as a group. Many other groups arise as subgroups
of these groups of continuous motions, modeled on the group of rigid motions of
a planar tiling and its relationship to the full group of isometries of the
Euclidean plan. Number theory give rise to many of these examples, with
constructions that are analogous to the discrete, widely separated way that the
integers sit within the real number line. One of the projects to be pursued
seeks to find a computationally feasible way to list all of the arithmetically
defined discrete subgroups of motion within the most important groups of
continuous motions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The continuous groups of motion
referred to above are known in mathematics as semisimple Lie groups; Sophus Lie
was the nineteenth-century mathematician who discovered the basic structural
facts of such groups of continuous transformations, and semisimplicity is an
algebraic property shared by most of the important examples. The first line of
work planned will recursively enumerate arithmetic lattices in semisimple Lie
groups, providing a solution to the isomorphism problem for this class of groups
and addressing a conjecture of Belolipetsky and Lubotzky on the number of
isometries between distinct finite covers of an arithmetic manifold. A second
line of investigation concerns the relationship between a manifold and its
finite-sheeted covering spaces, which is encoded in the profinite completion of
the manifold's fundamental group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
