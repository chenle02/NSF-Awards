Dr. Marcia Inhorn, Yale University, will convene an international and
interdisciplinary conference on medical anthropology. Medical anthropology is a
subfield of anthropology that employs social, cultural, biological, and
linguistic anthropological methods and theory. Medical anthropologists study how
interrelationships between humans and other species, cultural norms and social
institutions, and micro and macro politics and economics at multiple scales
interact with the health of individuals, larger social formations, and the
environment. The field is now just fifty years old. The overarching agenda of
this conference is to consider what medical anthropology has contributed to
basic scientific research and to create new research agendas and collaborations
for the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four day conference will be anchored
by thirteen plenary speakers who will highlight the potential for future
research in the most significant research areas. The speakers will report on the
social science of health research from a variety of perspetives, including
inequality, science and technology, genomics, bioethics, and the science of
public policy. The conference also will provide a forum for the dissemination of
new findings and the development of international collaborations through
research working group sessions. A special student poster session will provide
an opportunity for senior medical anthropologists to offer constructive feedback
to the next generation of scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is
important because the last half-century of research has shown that across the
globe, social and cultural institutions, not just medical practice, have
significant influence in human and community health. This conference will bring
together the very best researchers in this area to move the field forward at a
time of critical need.
