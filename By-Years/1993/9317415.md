9317415 Herman The primary objective of this U.S.-Czech project between Dr.
Herbert Herman of the State University of New York, Stony Brook, and Dr. Pavel
Chraska of the Czech Institute of Plasma Physics, Prague, is to examine the
processing, structure, and property relationships of net-shapes and deposits
manufactured by water stabilized plasma torches. This will be done by comparing
water stabilized plasma formed coatings with those manufactured by conventional
processes. Specifically, the researchers intend to: 1) Manufacture coatings,
net-shapes and composites at high production rates via high production rate
plasma spray technology; 2) Optimize the processing technology of water
stabilized plasma torches using laser diagnostics; and 3) Characterize the
material structure and mechanical properties of net-shapes and composites.
Overall, results are expected to improve our understanding of fundamental
plasma/particle interactions and particle/substrate interactions. This
engineering project in thermal systems fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources
in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ***
