To support incoming freshmen majoring in computer science, this college
supplies each student with a computer at well below one-half of wholesale cost.
Students can soon get portables at the same price. If these computers are
networked together, a hands-on method of teaching can be employed. Students can
do their work at their seats and then send the results to the instructor,
receive exercises and program segments, and display their problems using big-
screen projection units already installed in the classrooms. This approach
facilitates the demonstration and reinforcement of new concepts by having each
student send his or her application of the concept to the instructor; instructor
generated handouts and student generated submission of exercises and quizzes;
interactive student and instructor solutions to problems and bugs in student
programs; and problem solving by problem division and modular software
engineering techniques. Students can be provided with transceivers to plug into
their portables. The instructor works at a base transceiver that also connects
to the campus-wide network. The ability to display any of the students' screens
and the instructor's screen can be used to make concepts clear. The experience
of providing this teaching tool at a small, independent, liberal arts college
should be of interest at similar institutions.
