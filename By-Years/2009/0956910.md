This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop a
commercial prototype of an aberration compensated focus control device. This
device, based on a MEMS technology, will allow the user to deflect a deformable
membrane mirror in a controlled manner in order to select a desired focal
length. The device also features active control of low-order aberrations. This
technology will enable the next generation of biomedical imaging devices for
microscopy applications by enabling focus control and aberration correction in a
simple, compact and low-cost sensor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of
this research are primarily in biomedical imaging. An industry partner is
interested in using the technologys aberration correction capabilities to
improve skin cancer detection with their confocal microscopy product line.
Microscopy and endomicroscopy researchers at the University of Arizona have
stated that this technology will be a valuable asset in their research in the
fight against cancer. The company will also team with a recognized leader in
MEMS technology to enable enhanced imaging capabilities, primarily for imaging
in the field of ophthalmology.&lt;br/&gt;
