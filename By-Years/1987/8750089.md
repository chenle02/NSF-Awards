In this project, students will be introduced to some of the instruments,
techniques, and concepts of modern Cellular and Molecular Biology through a
series of experiments performed with primary cultures of skeletal muscle cells
prepared from chick embryos. The new equipment provided through this project
consists of a biological safety cabinet and controlled-atmosphere incubator for
the preparation, maintenance, and incubation of cell cultures of skeletal muscle
(a cell type that differentiates in vitro and lends itself to a variety of cell
biology experiments), an ultra-low-temperature freezer for the storage of
perishable materials needed for cell culture, a liquid scintillation counter,
micro-computer and associated software for the quantification, analysis, and
presentation of the results of radiobiological experiments designed to
investigate the rates of synthesis, degradation, transport, and secretion of
muscle proteins, and three gel electrophoresis units for the determination of
the molecular weight and identity of muscle- specific proteins. These
experiments will allow students to use a variety of techniques from modern
Cellular and Molecular Biology to explore some of the fundamental properties of
living cells.
