Uncovering fundamental mechanisms of organelle and cell dynamics is required for
a comprehensive model of plant growth and development as well as for
understanding how plants adapt to their environment. Such knowledge is critical
for fundamental advances in basic plant cell biology and promoting future
applications to agriculture. The 2016 Plant Cell Dynamics conference, to be held
June 21-24 in St. Louis, Mo, will focus on providing opportunities for plant
cell biologists to learn quantitative approaches for analyzing cellular dynamics
and function, including high-resolution microscopy and computational tools. It
will also provide a venue for students, postdoctoral scientists and new
investigators to interact with established leaders in the field of plant cell
biology, thus providing positive impacts on career development for students and
trainees at all levels. By encouraging and supporting attendance of trainees
from underrepresented groups, the conference will broaden participation in this
developing field, which employs techniques of quantitative, predictive and
theory-driven biology, and encourages multidisciplinary approaches at the
interface of biology, physics, mathematics, and computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will include keynote talks from
experts in the field of plant cell biology on methodology appropriate for
quantitative studies that probe how plant cells integrate metabolism,
cytoskeletal organization, and vesicle trafficking in overall cellular function.
In addition, there will be opportunities for oral and poster presentations by
trainees and participation in hands-on workshops on spectral imaging, automated
plant phenotyping, quantitative image analysis, and super resolution microscopy
using attendee-provided samples.
