This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports an investigation of
the deglacial record in the Gulf of Mexico, specifically the timing of the
initial melting of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS). The PI will use a multi-proxy
approach (d18O, Mg/Ca, and Ba/Ca) to detect salinity anomalies associated with
the input of meltwater via the Mississippi River. The records will test the
hypothesis that LIS melting was synchronized with Northern and Southern
Hemisphere mid-latitude glacial melt, and comparison of the results with proxies
records of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will help
assess the role of LIS meltwater in early deglacial AMOC changes and associated
climate shifts. Results will be incorporated into the SynTraCE21,000 model-data
comparison effort. Funding will support a PhD student, who will also lead the
marine geology component of an oceanography camp for girls during each summer of
the award term.&lt;br/&gt;
