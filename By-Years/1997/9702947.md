Research in this project seeks to address issues arising in two computationally
challenging problems with great economic potential, namely the analysis of
dental implants and supporting bone structure, and the modeling of complex time-
dependent 3D viscous flows. These applications will drive development of an
integrated problem solving environment that can subsequently be used to solve
many similar problems. The overall goal of the research is the simultaneous
optimization of the computational process with adaptive hp discretizations and
the use of the most powerful HPC hardware available, namely massively parallel
distributed memory parallel architectures. This combination of technologies
should allow realistic computer simulations of the complex time dependent
behavior inherent in both of these problems, for the first time. However, this
goal needs several advances in the enabling technologies required for parallel
adaptive methods - data structures, mesh partitioning, inter-processor
communications, error estimation, adaptive mesh design strategies, and fast and
stable solvers for adaptive grids in multiprocessor environments.
