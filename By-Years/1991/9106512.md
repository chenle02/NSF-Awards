A user mode research program will be carried out in nuclear structure studies
with electron scattering and charge exchange reactions. This work will be
carried out at the Bates linac and at IUCF. Some effort will also be dedicated
towards experiment development at CEBAF. Improved understanding of nuclear
structure and effective interactions is sought. Data will be compared to
theories including large basis shell model calculations. Simulations, detector
development, data analysis, interpretation, and other related activities will be
carried out at Kent State University.
