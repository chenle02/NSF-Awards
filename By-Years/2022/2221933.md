This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project is focused on
improving the understanding of condensed-phase reactions that lead to the
formation of brown carbon in the atmosphere. The proposed research effort will
explore the mechanistic and kinetic changes that occur through the aqueous
reactions of carbonyls and ammonium sulfate. This work includes a systematic
study of light absorption as a function of composition and could lead to
improved predictions of brown carbon formation in atmospheric
particles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort involves research on the cross-
reactions of ammonium sulfate with paired Î±-difunctional carbonyls
(glycolaldehyde, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal) to determine the effects of
carbonyl ratio and identity on product formation, brown carbon light absorption,
and reaction rates. The proposed work aims to answer the following key
scientific questions: (1) How do cross-reactions of carbonyl compounds with
ammonium change product composition? (2) How do light absorption properties of
the product mixtures change as a function of cross-reaction between carbonyls?
(3) How do product formation and chromophoricity change as additional complexity
is added to mixture? Supercritical fluid chromatography-mass spectrometry and
UV-visible spectroscopy will be utilized for this
study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate research students will perform the
laboratory experiments and will be involved in all aspects of the data workup
and the presentation of the data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
