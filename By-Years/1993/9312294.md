9312089 Brand This project establishes an Arizona statewide networking
consortium, connects eight rural community colleges to NSFNET, and provides
self-sufficiency training for the new campuses and connectivity to the network
for 24 months. Faculty and students will benefit from access to the resources of
the Internet, including libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they will be
able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in
pursuit of research and educational projects. The award provides partial support
of the project for two years. ***
