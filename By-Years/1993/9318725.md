In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Giacinto Scoles of Princeton University will apply molecular beams to
study the dynamics of molecular systems, particularly highly vibrationally
excited (HVE) molecules. Intramolecular Vibrational Redistribution (IVR) in
isolated molecules as well as the dynamics of HVE molecules colliding with
surfaces will be the focus of most of this research. Molecules will be excited
in high vibrational levels in supersonic beams and then directed onto surfaces.
In other studies HVE polyatomics will be examined in the gas phase in the
frequency domain to determine the effect of high energies which may be above
barriers for bond breaking or isomerization. In these studies Scoles will be
examining molecules which are highly energized in terms of the internal motions
of the atoms relative to one another. Such molecules are usually more reactive
than they are in their unenergized state. Hence, this project will be able to
shed some light on many different types of chemical processes, from combustion
to surface oxidation and catalysis.
