9421780 Chang This research advances the methodology of phase diagram
calculations recently formulated by the principal investigators. The
calculations include ternary and quaternary systems and integrates these
calculations with solidification models to predict the paths of solidification.
The phase diagram of the quaternary system aluminum-magnesium-zinc-copper (Al-
Mg-Zn-Cu) and the solidification paths of selected Al-rich alloys are to be
calculated and verified by related experiments. Phase diagram calculations for
the quaternary system includes the constituent ternaries, Al-Cu-Zn, Cu-Mg-Zn,
and Al-Mg-Cu. Solidification path calculations are carried out for selected Al-
rich alloys using the Schiel model and modified Schiel model, which includes
back diffusion in the solid. The solidification experiments emphasize several
alloys on the Al-rich side of the Al-Mg-Cu alloy system. %%% A knowledge of the
thermodynamics and phase equilibria of multi-component alloy systems is vital in
developing advanced materials and in improving the processing and manufacturing
of advanced materials. ***
