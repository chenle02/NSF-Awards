Bowman 9705782 The continued fraction algorithm is one of the most important
fundamental algorithms in mathematics. It returns for any given real number a
sequence of rational numbers that in a very specific sense are the best possible
approximations to the given real number. As a consequence continued fractions
have applications throughout mathematics including, but not limited to: finding
units in quadratic fields, solving linear congruences, identifying a rational
number in a floating point calculation, and factoring large composite numbers.
Part of this investigation deals with finding other algorithms similar to the
continued fraction algorithm, but that give approximations that are best in
other senses. One part of the research deals with the problem of determining an
algorithm to return best approximations in some previously specified sense.
Another deals with determining in what way some known algorithms are giving
"best" results. In much of the research, computers are used to aid in the
discovery and analysis of algorithms -- and this is necessary as many of the
algorithms of interest are quite complex. One way of understanding these
algorithms is through their combinatorial properties. Thus one avenue of
research being studied is into the combinatorics of the algorithms. Applications
of the combinatorics of the algorithms to other areas of mathematics is also
considered. Algorithms are recipes, descriptions of how to solve a problem step
by step. They are the basis for programs that tell a computer what to do. The
speed of an algorithm usually depends on the size of the problem. For instance,
the usual algorithm for solving a linear system of equations takes about 1000
times longer to solve a problem with 10 times more unknown variables; algorithms
for sorting a list of items may take 100 times longer to sort a list that is 10
times longer. For any significant problem (modeling the earth or atmosphere,
understanding the security of cryptosystems, protein folding, etc.) creating
more efficient algorithms is an important goal. This project looks for best
possible algorithms for several kinds of problems. Employing such algorithms can
make the difference between solving a problem in five years or in five hours.
