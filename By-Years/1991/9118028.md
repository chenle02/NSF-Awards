This award provides 50% funding required for the acquisition of a direct-
coupled plasma spectrometer to be installed and operated in the Department of
Geology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The University of
North Carolina is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary. The
instrument will be used primarily in the analysis of geological samples such as
igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks, sediments, and pore waters. The Principal
Investigator, on-campus colleagues, and colleagues from Duke University and
North Carolina State University are expected to be the most frequent users. Many
of these investigators are actively involved in research projects supported by
the National Science Foundation for studies in igneous petrogenesis, continental
evolution, sedimentology, chemical alteration of sediments, paleoceanography,
and environmental geology.
