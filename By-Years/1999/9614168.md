9614168 Beroza This research is to develop new techniques for imaging and
understanding fault rupture by means of a dynamic approach to the finite-fault
inverse problem. The finite-fault inverse problem is inherently under-determined
and hence non-unique. Smoothing constraints, often arbitrary, are usually
applied to stabilize the solution. Dynamic rupture modeling puts the
stabilization parameters on a physical basis. The research will focus on 1)
solving the finite-fault inverse problem of dynamic parameters and 2) developing
a method to properly account for data, model, and modeling uncertainty in
waveform inversion. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program. ***
