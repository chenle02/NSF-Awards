With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Sita, who recently moved
from Carnegie Mellon University to California Institute of Technology, will
study the synthesis and chemistry of cyclic and polycyclic polystannanes.
Syntheses will be pursued in each case by delineating the steric and electronic
factors which govern a proposed series of reactions that lead to the target
cyclic and polycyclic organostannanes. Once each synthesis has been achieved,
the new organostannane will be studied by using a variety of spectroscopic
methods in order to confirm its molecular structure and to investigate the
nature of bonding to tin in the new molecular system. The data thereby obtained
will be correlated with existing theoretical models. %%% Dr. Sita's research
program is concerned with elevating the level of understanding of the cyclic and
polycyclic chemistry of organotin compounds to that which is presently enjoyed
by carbocyclic systems. Dr. Sita's research on the synthesis and chemistry of
these new systems is expected to provide new insight into: (i) the ways in which
steric strain is expressed and, ultimately, accomodated structurally in cyclic
and polycyclic organotin compounds, (ii) the development of new organotin-based
materials, and (iii) the development of synthetic strategy in organotin
chemistry. Dr. Sita's research is likely to lead to improved understanding of
the various factors which govern structure/bonding/physical property
relationships and chemical reactivity in systems that contain heavy elements
(such as tin). His work in this area is likely to be of interest to organic and
main group organometallic chemists as well as to structural chemists.
