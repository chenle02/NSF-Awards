&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BITS: Sensory Coding and Pattern Recognition with Hybrid
Olfactory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The natural olfactory system combines high
sensitivity with broadband detection, excellent discrimination, and fast
response times. These characteristics are a result of the sensor array design
and the down-stream neural processing. In addition to being relevant to the
development of an artificial nose, the pattern recognition problem faced by
olfactory systems is analogous in many respects to problems in data mining,
especially related to DNA micro arrays. To further our understanding of the
biological solution to this general problem, it will be advantageous to record
from multiple olfactory neurons simultaneously. This proposal seeks to develop a
novel hybrid-device olfactory biosensor, and then to use this system to
investigate signal coding and pattern recognition. This will provide information
about the coding strategy of the natural system, and provide a test case for new
approaches to pattern recognition in complex signals.&lt;br/&gt;
