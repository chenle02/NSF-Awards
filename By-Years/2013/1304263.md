Documenting and understanding the past behavior of the climate system provides a
critical reference for comparison with future potential climate change. Since
the record for instrumental measurements covers only the most recent 100-150
years, indirect ("proxy") measurements must be considered. Quantitative analysis
of these proxy data is challenged by the fact that the proxies apply to specific
locations, and their relationship to the main feature in the climate system are
not well understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this project, researchers from
the University of Washington build on recent progress in using state-of-the-art
tools from the weather prediction community to reconstruct past climate states
by a method referred to as paleoclimate data assimilation (PDA). The research
involves optimally blending information from climate models and proxy data to
reconstruct Earth's climate over a wide range of time scales. PDA provides a
transformative synthesis of irregularly spaced pointwise data into global
gridded data, similar to reanalysis products derived from weather observations.
Reconstructed climate states will be used for hypothesis testing using numerical
models to evaluate climate sensitivity and predictability on decadal and longer
timescales with robust sample sizes over a wide range of climate states.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research leverages expertise from both the
paleoclimate and climate dynamics communities. Further interdisciplinary
collaboration will take place through interactions with the PAGES (PAst Global
changES) community. Funding supports education and training of a graduate
student, as well as outreach activities to schools, community organizations and
state agencies.
