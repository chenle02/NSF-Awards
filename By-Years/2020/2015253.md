Since 2016 there has been considerable activity towards a rigorous type of post-
election statistical tabulation audit known as a risk-limiting audit (RLA). The
states of Colorado, Nevada, Rhode Island and Virginia require post-election
RLAs, and Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and others carried out pilot RLAs before
2020. This project develops algorithms for RLAs where ballots are drawn in
stages, as opposed to one at a time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current solutions are
based on ratio tests such as the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT)
proposed by Wald in 1945, which is a most efficient test (smallest expected
sample size) if the sample is tested after each ballot draw. In real elections,
ballots are drawn in stages, n ballots at a time, and then tested. n may be tens
of ballots for a local contest, or hundreds of ballots for a state-level
contest. Direct application of the SPRT results in a very inefficient procedure
for ballot polling audits. This project develops algorithms specifically for
ballots drawn in stages, and preliminary results demonstrate a significant
improvement in efficiency. Beginning with an algorithm for two-candidate
elections and polling audits using sampling with replacement, this project
develops algorithms for multiple-candidate elections and comparison audits. It
provides both: rigorous proofs that the resulting audits are risk-limited as
well as software implementing the algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
