Karpovsky This research focuses on the development of a unified framework for
combining on-line and off-line error detection mechanisms at both the chip and
board levels. This framework includes: concurrent checking of the device for on-
line detection, space and time compression of test responses, analysis of
distortions in the resulting signatures for error detection and diagnosis for
built-in self-testing (BIST), and concurrent checking of hardware required for
(BIST).
