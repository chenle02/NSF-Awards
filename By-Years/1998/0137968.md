This project aims to understand the role of polymer composition, chain
architecture, and individual chain dynamics in determining local structure at
length scales less than the radius of gyration in the solid state for polyolefin
blends. Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance will be the chief tool used to
interrogate the morphology and dynamics in selected blends. Magnetic resonance
is ideally suited for selectively probing structure and dynamics in
macromolecules, even for polymer blends prepared without any special isotopic
labeling schemes. The result of this work will be a detailed understanding of
structure/miscibility relationships for solid polyolefin blends at the chain
level, which should lead to novel blend compositions based on designed chain
architectures, and therefore, new and industrially useful materials. Graduate
and undergraduate research students will apply the latest instrumentation and
polymer synthesis techniques, and strong industrial relationships in this area
will afford ample opportunity for working collaborations. In turn, they will
share these experiences with middle school students in the North Carolina State
University area as part of a project to develop programs for exposing these
students to exciting aspects of polymer science.

Polymers are a class of materials made from extremely large molecules that find
applications in many important commercial areas ranging from food packaging to
aerospace composites. Within this class of materials are the saturated
hydrocarbon polymers, or polyolefins, which are among the most economically
important industrial polymers. The research students trained in the "science" of
designing new polymeric materials will be very competitive for employment
opportunities in both the industrial and academic sectors.
