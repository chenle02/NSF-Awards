9457372 Chmielewski With this National Science Foundation Young Investigator
(NYI) award, the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division is
supporting the research and teaching activities of Dr. Jean A. Chmielewski of
the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University. The focus of Professor
Chmielewski's research is to design a new approach to enzyme inhibition which is
based on the dissociation of enzyme subunits. The dimeric enzyme HIV-1 protease
has been targeted as a test case to assess the inhibition strategy. The focus of
Dr. Chmielewski's teaching activities will be the redesigning of the
departmental laboratory curriculum in organic chemistry.
