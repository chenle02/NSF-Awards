Professor Reed J. Blau and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Texas at Arlington are being supported to establish a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93,
eight undergraduate students will spend eleven weeks each summer actively
engaged in a variety of research projects. Projects range from organometallic
chemistry and biochemistry to synthesis and characterization of polymeric
materials. Students will earn three hours credit for their work, participate in
weekly seminars, and visit area research laboratories. Both oral and written
reports will be required.
