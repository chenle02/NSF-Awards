This award provides one half of the funds required to purchase a SUN-4 computer
workstation to be installed and operated in the Department of Earth and
Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. The workstation will provide both
local computational resources and a means to access and process results from the
NSF supercomputer centers at Princeton and Illinois. The Department's research
projects that will depend on the workstation include investigations into the
dynamics of the Earth's core and lowermost mantle as well as the processes of
magnetic field generation in the core. The research involves simulations of
complex natural phenomena and is very computer-intensive.
