Presently very little is known about the ecological role of medusae, a group of
gelatinous zooplankton, in Antarctic waters. Many medusae which normally occur
only at depth are found under the ice in Antarctic surface waters. The taxonomy
and abundance of this group is fairly well known. In contrast, virtually nothing
is known about their biology or place in the Antarctic food web. Larson proposes
to conduct field studies uing SCUBA diving to document the in situ behavior of
medusae. Individuals collected in situ will be used in laboratory experiments to
obtain information on their metabolic physiology and reproductive patterns.
Diets will be analyzed using material collected and preserved in situ. Knowledge
of this group is essential for understanding the structure and function of the
overall marine ecosystem. The fact that medusae are relatively abundant under
the ice in nearshore waters, where high primary production attracts juvenile
krill, suggests they may be an important krill predator.
