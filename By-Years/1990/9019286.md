A controversy exists surrounding the age assignment of the Erin Slate,
outcropping in the Talladega Slate Belt of Alabama. The age assignment of this
unit has become pivotal in the paleotectonic interpretation and timing of
emplacement of the Talladega slate belt in the southern Appalachian orogen. The
disputed age assignment of the Erin Slate is based on the reported presence of
permineralized Carboniferous lycophyte cones, Lepidostrobus hobbsii D. White.
Subsequent workers were unable to collect additional permineralized fossil
plants, although compression-impressions have been documented in the matrix and
an indistinguishable petrologic similarity between the Erin Slate and matrix
adhering to one of the cones exists. The lack of subsequently collected
material, equal in preservational mode and type to that of the original two
lycophyte cones, has led some workers to question the validity of a
fossiliferous Erin. The original plant fossils are currently considered to be
"exotics", and the Erin Slate has been lithostratigraphically correlated with
the Early Devonian Jemison Chert. Newly discovered permineralized plant fossils
provide unequivocal evidence that the Erin slate is fossiliferous. The project
herein proposed is designed to assess this newly recovered paleobotanical
evidence for a definitive age assignment of the Erin Slate and its regional
correlatives. The taxonomic diversity and systematic affinities of this
permineralized flora will be ascertained and compared with those plants of
homologous structural advancement, paleogeographic distribution, and
biostratigraphic position. The age assignment based on the constraints of the
paleobotanical evidence will form the foundation for evaluating the tectonic
setting of the Erin Slate and its relationship to the tectonic framework now
proposed for the southern Appalachians.//
