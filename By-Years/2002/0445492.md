Professor Gary Blanchard of Michigan State University is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry program to construct and then optically
characterize a set of monolayer and bilayer fluid interfaces. Hybrid lipid
bilayer structures have been created and characterized for over a decade,
however, there is still a great deal unknown regarding relationships between
membrane composition and physical properties. The PI seeks to establish a linked
set of time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopic and imaging measurements in
order to extract information about the local environment and its dynamics via
fluorescent probes. The optical approaches include epifluorescence microscopy,
photobleaching experiments and two-photon fluorescence experiments. The work is
being done in collaboration with Prof. Pawel Kryskinski of the Polish Academy of
Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control over rationally constructed mono- and bi-
layer fluid interfaces will benefit biotechnology, biosensor development and
efforts to make artificial cell mimicks. These experiments provide fundamental
underpinnings for applications such as drug delivery and medical implants.
