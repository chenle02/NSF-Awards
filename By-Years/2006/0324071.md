Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Li&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is for partial support
of the Young Analysts Meeting of the Southeast that has met annually since 1995.
The primary objective of the meeting is to bring together graduate students,
young investigators, and more senior researchers. The program features plenary
talks by eminent mathematicians, with parallel sessions of contributed papers by
younger participants. The funding will be used primarily for the travel support
of graduate students and young PhDs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
