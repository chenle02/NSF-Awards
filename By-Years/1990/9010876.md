Dr. McMillan will study the behavior of stellar dynamical systems using new
computational techniques and capabilities. In particular he will perform
numerical studies of two separate, but closely related, problems involving the
dynamics of self-gravitating systems. The first entails the extension of
existing integration techniques into qualitatively new domains, via the
incorporation of new force evaluation methods into established integration
codes. The second involves a detailed investigation of the celebrated three-body
problem, concentrating on the structure of its parameter space for scattering
encounters, and on the stability of so called hierarchical triples. The results
of this work will be: (i) the development of a new stellar dynamical integration
code that will permit a qualitatively new degree of realism to be introduced
into star cluster simulations; (ii) a significant improvement in our
understanding of the microphysical processes that drive the evolution, and
determine the appearance of star clusters; and (iii) important new additions to
the arsenal of numerical techniques that will enable us to fully utilize the
capabilities of the next generation of super and parallel computers. Of
particular interest is the application of a new massively parallel computer in
star cluster simulations and comparison of its suitability for these
computations with that of more traditional supercomputers.
