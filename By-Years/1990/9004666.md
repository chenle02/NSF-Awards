The immune response pattern of tadpoles of the South African clawed frog,
Xenopus laevis, is distinct from that of the adult. Metamorphosis is a
transitional period that separates the two patterns. The objectives of this
research are to examine the hypothesis that development of the adult immune
system requires metamorphosis and is characterized by the loss of a major
population of larval lymphocytes and replacement with new, adult- type
lymphocytes. To prove or disprove the hypothesis, larval thymus or spleen cell
populations will be cytogenetically labelled, and their fate during and after
metamorphosis will be followed. By implanting triploid thymus or spleen into
diploid hosts and blocking metamorphosis in some of them, it will be determined
whether renewal of T and B cell populations at metamorphosis is dependent on
thyroid hormones. Because metamorphosis is regulated by thyroid hormones whose
effects may be modulated by corticosteroid hormones, the direct effects of
thyroid hormones and corticosteroid hormones in promoting metamorphosis-
dependent changes in the immune system will be analyzed. These studies will
contribute to a better understanding of the ontogeny of the immune system of
amphibians, the mechanisms that regulate production of lymphocytes during
ontogeny, the neuroendocrine regulation of development of the immune system, and
how immunological tolerance to "self" develops.
