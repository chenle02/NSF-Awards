The South American continental plate overrides the Chile Rise spreading center
off the coast of southern Chile and the region is thought to have had a
relatively simple geometry and geologic history since the late Cenozoic. Thus
the region is one of the simplest areas in which to study the tectonically
important processes of an active triple junction. This project will map and
analyze faults and sedimentary strata that are the result of the Chile Rise
collision. The data will be integrated with results from adjacent onland and
offshore marine studies currently in progress by other investigators. The
results of this study will provide important information on the geological
consequences of ridge/continental plate collision.
