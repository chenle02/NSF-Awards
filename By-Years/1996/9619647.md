Research is to be conducted in several key areas of robotic movement planning.
The emphasis is on robot motion planning algorithms for autonomous robots. A
principal focus is on the investigation of motion planning problems with
incomplete information or changing information about the environment, requiring
the motion planning algorithm to be adaptive. Moreover, the research considers
movement problems with inherent errors in the sensing and control, so the motion
planning algorithms must be robust to a lack of information on the position of
the robot, and if possible the algorithms must be minimal: that is use the least
possible amount of information about the robot position and environment. The
investigations will also consider motion planning problems in environments which
are dynamically changing; these will require dynamic algorithms that respond to
changing inputs. The research will involve solving motion planning problems
using new formulations that have not yet been fully investigated. The research
will concentrate particularly in emerging new areas in robotic movement planning
that impact most strongly the overall goals of adaptive, robust, minimal, and
dynamic robotic algorithms. Examples of topics to be researched are on-line
planning algorithms for unknown environments which are randomized and/or may
dynamically learn probabilistic models of the environment, and pursuit movement
games (which involve movement planning with an adversary).
