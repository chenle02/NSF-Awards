Abstract DBI 9750196 Shannon Stahl This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1997. This
fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain additional scientific
training beyond the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative
into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between organisms
and their environment at the molecular, cellular, organismal, population,
community and/or ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by the
Directorate for Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation. Each
fellowship supports a research and training plan to be carried out in a
sponsoring laboratory. The research and training plan for this fellowship is
entitled "Studies of methane monooxygenase, an enzyme important for oil spill
cleanup and greenhouse gas depletion." Methane monooxygenase (MMO) catalyzes the
aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol and has important implications for
environmental issues ranging from global warming to bioremediation. This
research examines the mechanism of dioxygen activation and substrate oxidation
by MMO using various methods ranging from kinetic isotope effect studies to
site-directed mutagenesis.
