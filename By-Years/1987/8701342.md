This is a fundamental study of the kinetics and mechanism of heterogeneous
oxidation by metals. The work includes determining the identity and reactivity
of intermediates formed in the oxidation over group IB and group VIII metals
with particular emphasis on the role of oxygen adatoms on the activation of
small organic molecules and the further reaction of the intermediates formed.
These processes will be studied using a combination of ultrahigh-vacuum
techniques and a compatible high-pressure cell. Low-pressure studies of the
oxidation of hydrocarbons, amines, nitriles, thiols, and heterocyclic species
will provide a broad and general basis for the prediction of reactions
encountered in oxidation processes. The overall approach is to activate
molecules selectively using oxygen activation and to determine the nature and
reactivity of the intermediates formed using temperature-programmed spectroscopy
and vibrational spectroscopy. These data are valuable in design of catalytic
processes in the chemicals, drug, and petrochemicals industries and also in
designing new microelectronic devices electrode surfaces for chemical processing
or pollution control.
