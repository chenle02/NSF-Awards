Pitzer College is creating a series of five three-week long experimental
investigations in the Human Physiology course, and is supporting undergraduate
research projects in Psychobiology. The physiology lab consists of open-ended
experimental investigations on the nervous system, including membrane
potentials, synaptic transmission, neural integration in motor control,
processing of visual information, and a human electroencephalogram. Students
make their own electrodes with a microelectrode puller, and use computer
interfaced instruments to record and analyze data. These challenging exercises
encourage exploration and help students gain a greater appreciation for
physiology as an experimental scinece. They will also be better prepared for
senior thesis research work, which is required at the college. The equipment
used previously in the physiology course will now be used in the introductory
biology laboratory, thus benefitting the beginning students with experimental
exercises. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
