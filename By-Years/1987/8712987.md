Brown University is being supported to establish a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
The program will support 8 undergraduate students for the summer of 1987, of
which almost half will come from other institutions. The research activities
will include the following: o Biosynthesis of Antibiotics and Terpenes o
Preparation of Isotopically Labeled Enolate Precursors o Conformational Effects
on Radical Cyclizations o Studies of Thin Films and Glasses
