9409011 Leamer This research will study the consequences of partial economic
integration of high-wage and low-wage countries. The study is divided into two
parts. In the first part, several alternative theoretical models of economic
integration are formulated which focus particularly on the effect of global
competition on internal labor markets. The second part of the study uses the
theoretical models to develop empirical analyses of the effects of economic
integration on employment, prices, wages and other economic outcomes in
particular sectors of the economy or among particular groups of workers. This
research is of significant interest because the empirical results would improve
our understanding of what role trade and investment with low-wage countries
might play in eroding or increasing wages in the United States. .
