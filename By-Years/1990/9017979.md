This research is focused on quantitative studies of organic carbon diagenesis
in rapidly accumulating coastal and upper slope sediments. The intermeshing
goals reflect the central processes associated with accumulation and recycling
of organic materials in all organic-rich marine environments. The goals are: 1)
to quantify seasonal variations in the sources and input rates of organic matter
to coastal sediments, 2) to understand the role of organic carbon source in
controlling the rate and extent of organic carbon degradation, 3) to elucidate
the role of bacterial assimilation of DOC ("secondary production") in the
sediment carbon cycle, and 4) to determine the rates and pathways of organic
carbon fermentation.
