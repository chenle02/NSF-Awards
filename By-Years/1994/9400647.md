ABSTRACT CTS-9400647 A. Haji-Sheikh The proposal is to explore an inverse method
for solving three-dimensional heat conduction problems based on Green's theorem.
Verification of the method is proposed by both forward solution of the inverse
problem and by experiment. Solutions to inverse problems are necessary when
property data is to be recovered from temperature and/or heat flux measurements
at surfaces, and accurate three-dimensional methods are not available. The work
has application in providing real-time control of spray cooling in metallurgical
heat treating and the cooling of high temperature materials in manufacturing
processes as well as in advanced electronic cooling.
