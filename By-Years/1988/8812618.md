This research proposal concerns the designs of nonswitching controllers for
systems with multiple operation conditions. These multi-mode control systems
occur in many practical systems, such as aircraft, automobiles and power
systems. A nonswitching controller can potentially reduce costs and improve
performance compared to the commonly used gain switching controllers. The design
approach in this proposal will be based on a recently developed novel multi-
model controller design approach built on multivariable state space techniques.
The focus here is to investigate the performance optimization aspect of systems
with multiple operating conditions. A main motivation is that the problem
formulation would allow the construction of a procedure for the computation of
simultaneous stabilizing controls.
