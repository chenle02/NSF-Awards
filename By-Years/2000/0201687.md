0201687&lt;br/&gt;Burdea&lt;br/&gt;Under this Investigator Initiated Award,
studies will be performed that develop and test a computerized system for at-
home mobility rehabilitation. The PI has developed the "Rutgers Ankle System"
that provides a 3D, 6 degrees of freedom interface. The system provides the
position and pressure/force information from the human foot. The present system
is for a single limb. Developing a duel platform for the measurement of both
limbs is the first aim of this proposal. The patient/subject is asked to
control/pilot a plane through 3D hoops in the Virtual Reality (VR) world using
the ankle-foot complex. A VR exercise library will be developed including
exercises incorporating stair climbing, walking on uneven surfaces, etc. After
the system is validated in the clinical setting, the PI will implement a VR
based tele-rehabilitation system using the INTERNET and network technology so as
to provide in home VR rehabilitation exercises with remote monitoring of the
patient's progress. Though initially developed for stroke survivors, other
patient populations, such as orthopedic, arthritic and cognitively impaired
patients, may benefit as well.
