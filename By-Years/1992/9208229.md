In tropical forests, most colonization of small disturbed areas (e.g., treefall
gaps) is from dormant seeds deposited by animals in intact forest some time
before the disturbance occurs. Such seeds become incorporated into the soil, and
germinate in response to a later disturbance. These "soil seed banks" have
profound consequences for such "pioneer" plants and the communities in which
they occur. Species composition in regenerating patches is largely determined by
the composition of the seed bank at the time of disturbance, for example.
Nevertheless, virtually nothing is known about the dynamics of seed banks,
especially rates of seed removal by predators and pathogens, physiologically-
imposed limits to longevity, etc.. This study will make use of carefully
replicated experiments to measure rates of seed arrival, transition from litter
to soil, and removal in order to understand the dynamics of soil seed banks in
detail. I will then examine the consequences of seed demography for community
structure in regenerating forest patches, as well as for the evolution of
ripening phenologies and plant-disperser relationships. The data gathered in
this project is basic to understanding natural forest regeneration , and to
efforts to preserve or restore species-rich tropical forests.
