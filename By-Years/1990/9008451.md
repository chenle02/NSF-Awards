This work is a synthesized approach to the interdisciplinary design of complex
engineering systems. The traditional design process involves a conceptual design
stage which utilizes simple, experience-based methods, along with a preliminary
design stage involving intermediate models and finally a detailed design stage,
with complex numerical models. The integration of the various engineering
disciplines takes place almost entirely within the conceptual design. This
research develops a way of synthesizing these design phases in order to achieve
better design integration. The approach combines experienced-based methods with
computationally-based methods, combines simple models with complex models, and
combines global approximations with local approximations. The objective, besides
achieving better and more efficient integrated designs, is the education of
numerically- oriented analysts with design insight. The research is conducted in
the framework of the simultaneous aerodynamics-structures- control design of
aircraft wings.
