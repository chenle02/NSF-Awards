Enabling image reconstruction from low-dose X-ray data has been a major
challenge in Computed Tomography (CT) imaging for several decades. Model-Based
Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) algorithms enable high-resolution image
reconstruction from low-dose data by incorporating models for X-ray physics, the
acquisition process and image priors into an optimization process for
reconstruction. Despite promising dose-reduction results from these modern image
reconstruction algorithms, the classical filtered back projection algorithm and
its variants are widely employed in practical settings, especially when rapid
imaging is necessary. The main impediment in translating these low-dose imaging
technologies to practice has been their computational cost â€” long reconstruction
time compared to classical methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a
novel algorithmic approach that leverages techniques from approximation theory
together with performance optimization tools for tackling the computational
challenges in MBIR. The project has a set of inter-connected goals that develop
the proposed framework for 3-D optics, specializing to common X-ray and detector
geometries. Moreover, signal processing tools are developed within this
framework for increasing image resolution, in a computationally efficient way,
in a broad set of CT inverse problems. The project also includes an extensive
evaluation plan using established benchmarks as well as a repository of data
maintained by the US National Library of Medicine specifically for validation of
acceleration methods that seek to enable routine use of MBIR methods. These
developments could play a game changing role in the applicability of low-dose
imaging in practice and, ultimately, adoption in a wider range of
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
