We propose to hold a 2-day NSF-sponsored workshop in Chicago, Illinois in
October 2003 to study future research directions of the interplay between
Information Theory and Computer Science. The tentative proposed workshop dates
are Friday and Saturday October 17-18, 2003.

The objective of the workshop is to bring together leading researchers and
innovators from both academia and industry in order to discuss the open problems
and future directions of information theory and computer science. More
specifically, the goals of this workshop are to:

Provide a contextual basis for understanding the interplay between information
theory and algorithmic aspects of computer science;

Assess the potential impact of computer science and information theory on
emerging areas and technology such as bio-informatics and multimedia
informatics, and vice versa;

Identify and characterize the major research issues associated with the design,
development, and deployment of information systems and algorithms behind them;

Develop a conceptual framework for future cross-cutting research activities;

Present recommendations to NSF on how to promote research excellence in the
interplay between IT and CS.
