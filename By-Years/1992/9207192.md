An Ecological community is usually defined as an assemblage of species in a
given habitat, with trophic interactions among these species represented by a
static food web. Most communities, however are not isolated from the effects of
species in adjacent habitats and individuals can change their position in the
food web or move between habitats as they change body size. This award focuses
on interactions that take place across habitat boundaries, using observations of
natural populations, experimental manipulation of habitat boundaries, and
experiments in artificial habitats to estimate the importance of interactions
between members of stream and wooodland communities. The study focuses on
resources of salamanders and on interactions among salamander populations and it
tests ecological theories on the maintenance of complex life cycles and models
interactions between size-structured populations as well as the role of
interactions between communities in landscape ecology. The study of interactions
among species at habitat boundaries is important to understanding the
consequences of habitat fragmentation that results from shifting land use
patterns.
