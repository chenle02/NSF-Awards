This project deals with fundamental, microscopic aspects of the wetting and
spreading of fluids on solid surfaces. Understanding and controlling these
phenomena pose both scientific questions and technological problems. Static and
dynamic phenomena will be probed on both the macroscopic and microscopic scales
using optical, x-ray and neutron techniques. One goal is to understand the
behavior of macroscopic contact angles and their dependence on properties of the
materials involved. A further goal is to understand the origins of the
macroscopic behavior with the microscopic structures and dynamics of fluids
confined by the interfaces at and near the contact line, the point where the
fluid body ends at the solid surface. Results of the proposed research will
improve the understanding of fundamental wetting phenomena and will add to the
needed scientific basis needed for engineering advanced materials and
technological processes dominated by wetting and spreading.
