The proposed research is on algebraic approaches to understanding aspects of
M/Superstring Theory and Supergravity. The PI proposes to obtain the spectra of
M/Superstring theory in different space-time backgrounds. The main thrust will
be to understand better AdS/CFT dualities in these backgrounds. The PI intends
to make further studies of gauged N=2 supergravity theory and to understand
their embeddings in M/superstring theory. The connection between supercoherent
state bases of conformal supergroups and harmonic superspace will be
investigated with an eye for understanding AdS/CFT dualities. In a more formal
area, the PI will investigate the unitary representations of non-compact
symmetry groups of extended supergravity theories and use this information to
better understand M/superstring theory.
