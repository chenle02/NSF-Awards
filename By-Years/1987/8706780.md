Many materials that exhibit unusual chemical reactivity or unusual transport
properties owe their uniqueness to a near-degeneracy of the electronic ground
state. Existence of a low-lying electronic state in a molecular species results
in thermally excited interconversions which can enhance reactivity. Rates of
processes involving electron transfer can also be affected by near-degeneracy of
the ground state. In materials with extended structures, "ground state
degeneracy" can take the form of a high density of states at the Fermi level,
with attendant metallic behavior. Like their molecular counterparts, however,
these systems are often subject to some form of Jahn-Teller instability which
can introduce a gap at the Fermi level and give rise to transport properties
characteristic of a semiconductor. In order to understand better the structural
interactions that result in unusual properties for inorganic systems, Dr.
Strouse will carry out extensive low temperature crystallographic studies. All
of the inorganic systems to be studied exhibit temperature dependent structures.
Almost no other laboratory in the country is equipped to carry out low
temperature crystallography (as low as 20K) and related studies on the magnetic
resonance and Mossbauer measurements of inorganic systems. The experimental
capability of this laboratory has the potential to be important for eventual
structural studies of high temperature superconductors.
