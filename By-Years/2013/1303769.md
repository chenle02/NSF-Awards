Indian Hills Community College (IHCC) requests funding for a Planning Grant to
research the feasibility of establishing a Regional ATE Center focused on
bioenergy called the Bioenergy Technology Education Center (B-TEC). The goals of
this planning grant are to: 1) Determine the current and future bioenergy
workforce need in a 12 state Midwest region; 2) Identify the colleges serving
this need or wanting to serve this need; 3) Determine additional educational
resources required to meet current and future need; 4) Identify how the
Bioenergy Technology Education Center could support colleges serving the
bioenergy industry; and 5) Determine what partner resources and management
systems are needed in order to sustain an ATE Regional
Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a well-conceived planning grant that could
potentially lead to a Center that focuses on a growing industry. The development
of alternative fuels, especially biofuels, could be an important economic
resource in the near future.
