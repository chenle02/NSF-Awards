In developing the concept of social capital, sociologists have extended the
general meaning of capital - the investment in the acquisition or creation of a
resource with the expectation of a return beyond the cost of the initial
investment - to apply to social networks. Social capital refers to both the
productive benefits of social relationships for the economic status of
individuals, and the forces that act to preserve the social resources of
densely-connected, homogenous communities. This project builds on the social
network foundations of the concept of social capital to determine how 1)
participation in certain types of organizations and activities affects an
individual's social capital, and 2) an individual's level of social capital
affects economic success, tolerance, health, and happiness. To answer these
questions, the project gathers data from a questionnaire sent to 1000 households
in Miami, Florida. The data measure participation in political, civic,
religious, work, and informal organizations; social network ties to persons in a
representative set of occupations; and personal characteristics relating to
economic status, health, happiness, and tolerance. Analysis of the data
identifies how social capital is created, what benefits it can bring to
individuals, and if it is harmed by the decline in participation in certain
types of organizations.
