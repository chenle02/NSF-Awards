This grant will fund a conference on important measurement issues in the
economy. As the new economy has developed, intangible assets and high-technology
investments have played an increasingly important role in the economy. Important
measurement issues have emerged such as how to measure intangible assets, and
whether we are measuring high-technology capital accurately. The conference,
being co-sponsored by the Conference on Research on Income and Wealth of the
National Bureau of Economic Research Inc., will be held in April 2002. Topics to
be addressed at the conference include: Financial markets and the valuation of
intangible assets, the role of human capital and human resource practices in
measuring and understanding intangibles, and the relationship between R&amp;D
and the measurement of intangible assets. The goal of the conference is to
promote better measurement of capital, which would improve assessments of the
economy's long-run rate of growth, the pace of technological change, and of the
nation's wealth.
