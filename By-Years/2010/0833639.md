Collaborative Research: ARI-MA: Tensioned Fluid Metastable State Special Nuclear
Material Detector

The objective of this research is to develop novel, transformational impact,
low-cost, effective, portable particle detector systems to detect highly
enriched uranium and other special nuclear materials. Seed funding-sponsored
research reveals that "tensioned" metastable states in materials potentially
offer unique, unsurpassed capabilities for detection. The approach is to develop
a theoretical foundation of interaction of nuclear particles with fluids in
metastable states. Prototype device designs will be fabricated and assessed
experimentally versus state-of-the-art systems for sensitivity and selectivity
for neutron vs. gamma vs. alpha vs. fission product detection. Qualification of
operation under American National Standards Institute standard test environments
will be performed. The main intellectual merit of this project will be a
transformation in highly enriched uranium and other special nuclear materials
detection methods by paving the way to novel, low cost, compact to large, high
efficiency, readily adaptable and portable detectors. Scientific merit will be
attained through the advancement of the fundamental understanding of tensioned
fluids and detection techniques. Addressing the broader impact, the diverse
research group includes two major university systems, a Historically Black
Colleges and Universities institution and an inner city high school. The project
will provide training and educational experiences to students from high school
to PhD. Benefits to the society include progress in addressing the problem of
nuclear threat detection and strengthened partnerships for teaching and
research. The new knowledge and equipment will be employed in academic courses.
As allowable, research results will be disseminated through journal and
conference papers and student presentations .
