This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Janet Pierrehumbert
of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and Professor Gunnar Fant, Royal Institute of
Technology, Stockholm, in the area of linguistics. The aim of the project is to
establish rules for the influence of intonation patterns in speech on the
perceived characteristics of the voice source. As a first step, intonation
patterns will be related to detailed characteristics of the air flow in the
throat. Experiments will be carried out in which the important factors affecting
intonation, such as stress pattern, choice of melody, and pitch range, are
varied independently. The air flow will be analyzed non-invasively by using
already-known functions to transform between the sound actually produced and air
flow details. Studies will be made using both English and Swedish speakers,
taking advantage of the very different intonation characteristics of these
languages. The Swedish collaborator has pursued studies on the effects of speech
patterns on air flow and therefore has direct experience with the measurement
and use of these flows for speech characterization. The description of air flows
developed by the Swedish investigator will be combined with the linguistic model
of intonation developed by the U.S. investigator. This research may lead to
important applications in the fields of linguistics and speech synthesis.
