9316177 Archer PIs will conduct sedimentological analyses of the Proterozoic Big
Cottonwood Formation, including facies and basin analysis, attempted
correlation, and detailed studies of tidal rhythmites. The rhythmites are the
oldest yet documented and offer an opportunity to study paleoseasonality, lunar
cycles, lunar recession rates, and paleotidal and paleorotational periods,
extending knowledge of tidal settings and earth-moon dynamics several hundred
million years farther into Earth history.
