The present body of knowledge in monotone regression is confined to some
isolated existence theorems about point estimation and hypothesis testing. The
investigator plans to implement these general methods for as many aspects of
regression analysis as possible. In particular, formulas for confidence and
prediction intervals will be derived by inverting hypothesis tests, since usual
methods are inapplicable because of lack of pivotals. The proposed study will
also involve construction of user-oriented tables to bring the restricted
procedures to a level comparable to the unrestricted ones. In regression
analysis one tries to predict one variable in terms of another. In many
applications, especially in social sciences and economics, it is reasonable to
assume that the predicted variable tends to increase (or decrease) as the
predictor variable increases. Statistical inferences under such assumptions are
at a very primitive stage at present, and consist primarily of some general
mathematical theorems. The proposed study aims at developing concrete formulas
and tables so that users can apply them directly to real-life problems.
