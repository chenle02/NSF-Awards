A conjecture of Serre predicts that certain 2-dimensional mod
p&lt;br/&gt;representations of Galois groups over Q arise from modular
forms,&lt;br/&gt;and it further predicts the level and weight of the
form.&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator and his collaborators are
investigating&lt;br/&gt;a possible generalization of Serre's conjecture to the
context&lt;br/&gt;of Hilbert modular forms and Galois groups over totally real
fields. &lt;br/&gt;The prediction of the weights suggests interesting new
phenomena, and&lt;br/&gt;the immediate aims of the research are to investigate
these phenomena&lt;br/&gt;and provide numerical evidence for the
generalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Serre's conjecture and its generalizations
can be viewed as part of&lt;br/&gt;Langlands' program, which predicts a deep
correspondence between objects from&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry (solution sets
of polynomial equations, such as elliptic&lt;br/&gt;curves) and objects from
representation theory (functions with symmetry&lt;br/&gt;properties, such as
modular forms). While there has been significant&lt;br/&gt;recent progress (for
example, the investigator and collaborators,&lt;br/&gt;building on Wiles' work
on Fermat's Last Theorem, proved that all&lt;br/&gt;rational elliptic curves
arise from modular forms), Langlands'&lt;br/&gt;program remains largely
conjectural. The links it provides between&lt;br/&gt;two seemingly different
branches of mathematics reveal properties &lt;br/&gt;of the integers, which can,
in turn, have applications to
cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
