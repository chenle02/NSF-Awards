Arginine vasotocin and angiotensin II are antidiuretic hormones that influence
water balance in many vertebrates. Since water is critical for survival,
understanding how these hormones enhance water-absorption is critical. While
most vertebrates have a regular and predictable water supply, desert animals
live in harsh conditions in which survival is dependent upon the ability to
find, obtain and conserve water. These species have evolved mechanisms of water
retention which allows them to survive under these uncharitable conditions. Dr.
Propper has selected two species that differ in genetic background but live
within the same austere environment. She will employ a combination of
behavioral, neuroanatomical and endocrine techniques to determine how these two
neuropeptides influence water balance in two distinct desert species. Dr.
Propper will define the behavioral responses to arginine vasotocin and
angiotensin 11, localize the neural binding of these neuropeptides; and then
determine how environmental changes influence the brain and plasma
concentrations. By comparing the hormonal effects species that differ in their
genetic background, she can determine whether similar neuroendocrine mechanisms
are employed to manage water balance in vertebrates in general.
