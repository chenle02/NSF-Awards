9315660 Stoler This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural
anthropology student from the University of Michigan. The student will study the
changes in Malaysian people's self concepts of their ethnic identity caused by
rapid urban development. Using methods of in-depth interviews and participant-
observation in an urban and in a rural community, the student will interpret
changing concepts of ethnic affiliation. This research is important because the
determinants of ethnic affiliation are not fully understood. In some cases
people identify as members of the national state or of the regional community,
and in others as members of localized ethnic groups. Increased understand of how
people conceptualize their ethnic identity can help us understand and moderate
ethnic conflicts when they do occur. ***
