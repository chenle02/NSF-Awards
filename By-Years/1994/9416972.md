9415673 Brady This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative
research in chemical engineering between John F. Brady of the California
Institute of Technology and Georges Bossis of the University of Nice. The
objectives of their research are to demonstrate that short-term range repulsion
does not change the rheological behavior of hard-sphere suspensions and to
determine the minimum size of a particle which can be used in electrorheological
fluids without melting the chemical chains. The research involves the use of
Stokesian dynamics. The will work on a third, but related project, a monograph
on suspension of dynamics. The U.S. and French investigators have a long-
standing collaboration and are co-inventors of Stokesian dynamics. The U.S.
investigator and his group will carry out the electrorheological fluid
simulations. This will be complemented by French investigators work on the
simulations of short-term range repulsions. The project will advance our
understanding of the physics of suspensions and their role in the engineering of
new materials. ***
