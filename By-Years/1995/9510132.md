9510132 Plummer This research program is aimed at an investigation of the
physical and chemical properties of surfaces, interfaces, and thin films of
simple metals, with the objective of using these model systems to elucidate
fundamental concepts. A wealth of fascinating physical phenomena awaits
investigation, such as pinned charge density waves at the surface of potassium,
pre-martensitic surface transitions on lithium, surface reconstructions such as
the missing row reconstruction on a beryllium surface, oscillatory structural
transformations in thin films, and collective excitations in "designed"
multilayers. The impact of these studies will be the development of new concepts
that govern the behavior of a surface and an interface. %%% The physical and
chemical properties of materials are varied and extremely complex, governed by
the details of the interactions of billions and billions of electrons with
billions of ions. On the other hand, it is this complexity that leads to
applicability of materials in our daily lives, such as integrated circuits
(computers), magnetic recording, catalytic activity, and light weight but strong
materials, so that new material, with quite different or better physical or
chemical properties can be prepared. This research program uses the simple
metals (e.g., lithium, sodium, beryllium) as the vehicle for developing a
fundamental understanding of the physical and chemical properties of surfaces
and interfaces. It is the characteristics of the surface or interface that
dictates the behavior in most of the applications above. ***
