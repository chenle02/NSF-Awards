This award is partial support of the Symposium on Stakeholders Perspective on
the Bioeconomy as part of the meeting of the USDA S-1075 Multistate Committee.
The biobased economy has potential to produce biofuels and bioproducts in an
environmentally sustainable way. This consortia of researchers from 35 land
grant universities address barriers to a bioeconomy including challenges in
feedstock logistics and conversion technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Annual
meetings of the S-1045 multistate committee are held to coordinate and share
research from land grant universities across the nation. Symposiums are
organized with leading researchers and speakers from funding agencies to share
the latest research knowledge and coordinate future research. The 2019 S-1075
Multistate Committee annual symposium will be held at the USDOE National
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) on July 29-30, 2019. The goal of the 2019
symposium is to develop an understanding of the key challenges when trying to
commercialize bioenergy and bioproduct technologies. NSF funding will be used to
support graduate students to attend this symposium and to meet with NREL
researchers. This is a meeting where the students can interact with the entire
sector of the bioeconomy including researchers, producers, processors, financial
sector and government agencies. This will help in orienting the next workforce
generation to challenges and opportunities in the bioeconomy. The proceedings
from the symposium will be published in both hard and soft copy formats and
distributed widely to interested audience by S-1045
members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
