This research group has attacked a wide range of problems in quantum liquids,
including the excitation spectra and transport properties of the helium liquids,
properties of superfluid helium three, properties of superconductors, heavy
fermion systems and the high temperature superconductors. It is anticipated that
future research will include topics in the above general areas and that it will
include as well ordinary metals and nuclear and neutron matter.
