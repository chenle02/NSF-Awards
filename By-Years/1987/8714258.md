This proposal requests funds to establish a Biological Facilities Center in
state.of.the.art high.resolution NMR and computer graphics/molecular modeling
methodologies to determine the 3D solution structure and dynamics of
biomolecules. The Center will provide the infrastructure support for a diverse
range ofprojects requiring NMR, molecular modeling, molecular mechanics/dynamics
and perturbational free energy calculations to design new biomolecules.
Initially the Center's focus will be on the study and design of proteins,
modified DNA analogs and DNA binding drugs and proteins. In a number of
projects, these "designed" biomolecules will be synthesized using established
synthetic organic methods or through automated DNA or oligopeptide synthesizers.
Alternatively, recombinant DNA methdologies will be used to genetically engineer
mutant proteins. The Center will then determine the 3D structure of the designed
biomolecules via 2D NMR nd distance geometry methods and compare the structure
with that predicted by the calculations and modeling. Structure and activity of
the designed biomoleculeswill be compared to better understand the biological
activity of these biomolecules. This center will benefit a large and diverse
group of researchers, estimated at about l20 faculty members. Thus, it has
considerable potential for fostering interactions of unique combinations of
multidisciplinary talent.
