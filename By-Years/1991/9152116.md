A parallel computing laboratory facility is being established for developing a
distinct course in parallel computing and upgrading the instructional content of
other undergraduate computer science courses that make use of parallel concepts.
This includes, but is not limited to, analysis of algorithms, operating systems,
programming languages, artificial intelligence, senior projects, data base
systems, and numerical analysis. The project utilizes an existing network host-
server that will be connected to a multiple-processor parallel computer system
using Transputers. The Transputer system and related software for parallel
programming is being purchased as part of the grant. Course modules are being
developed initially as part of special topics courses and then are being allowed
to migrate as appropriate to other courses in the curriculum, including a
separate course on parallel computing that is to be developed. As parallel
computing takes on more significance in the real world of computer systems the
project will be used to strengthen the related foundations of computer science
education and give students experience in a variety of parallel computing
applications.
