PI: James O. Berger Proposal Number: DMS 9714876 Project: Group Travel Award to
the 6th Valencia International Meeting on Bayesian Statistics Abstract: The
Sixth International Valencia Meeting on Bayesian Statistics will be held from
May 30 - June 4, 1998, in Las Fuentes, Spain. This series of international
Valencia meetings has long been the major venue for presentation and
dissemination of research on Bayesian statistical methodology and its
applications. The Bayesian approach to statistics has experienced astonishing
growth in recent years, driven in large part by its ability to solve difficult
applied statistical problems in science, engineering, and society in general.
This group travel award is in support of expenses of participants from the
United States. Participation in this meeting is crucial for researchers,
especially new researchers, as the pace and breadth of developments in the area
is making it increasingly difficult to monitor the field. By attending the
meeting, researchers will be able to acquire the latest Bayesian techniques, and
will have ample opportunity to obtain feedback on their own work. A large
portion of the grant will go towards expenses of graduate students, new
researchers, and members of underrepresented groups. In addition, special
activities for students and new researchers will be instituted, in part to
initiate international interactions and collaborations.
