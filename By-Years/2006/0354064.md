The University of Washington will continue to host a Physics Research
Experiences for Undergraduates Program for the summers of 2004 - 2006. Each
student participant is partnered with a UW faculty member for the 10-week
program. The students become deeply involved in the faculty member's research,
which may come from any part of physics and in some cases other related physical
sciences. This allows the student first-hand involvement in the scientific
process, including but not limited to: design, construction, and/or
commissioning of novel instrumentation, data collection and analysis, numerical
modeling, ab initio computation, development of software for statistical
modeling, and theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education of young scientists is
of paramount importance to the continuing success of science in the United
States. The REU program at the UW Physics Department has supervised over 120
students in its nine years of existence, with the vast majority of the student
participants continuing to graduate school in the physical sciences, becoming
involved in secondary education of science, or moving to the biological sciences
for advanced study. By placing some emphasis on students from smaller colleges
that lack research opportunities, this program further broadens the talent pool
for science in the United States. In addition, efforts are made to attract women
and minority students. This program is administered jointly by the Institute for
Nuclear Theory and the Department of Physics at the University of
Washington.&lt;br/&gt;
