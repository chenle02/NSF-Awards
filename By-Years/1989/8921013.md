The objective of this proposal is to prepare synthetic polymeric materials that
are capable of functioning as enzymes and biological receptors. A template
synthesis method is used to construct selectively functionilized sites on or
near the surface of highly crosslinked network polymers. The functionilized
sites provide a binding cavity for the template molecule. The research will
concentrate on the following topics: the synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts
for olefin cyclization, Diels-Alder reactions, and phosphate diester hydrolysis.
An attempt will be made to develop solid polymers that bind metal ions. These
materials have potential use in water purification. Fluorescence diagnostics
will also be developed for evaluating the solvation and penetrability of
crosslinked network polymers.
