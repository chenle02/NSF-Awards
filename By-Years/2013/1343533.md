Abstract #1343533 Roger J. Narayan

Standard protein assays and analyses involving quartz crystal microbalance
technology will be employed to qualitatively and quantitatively assess protein
adsorption dynamics. The information obtained in these studies will serve as the
basis for a material property-biological performance database, in which the
associations among in vitro cell-material interaction, protein adsorption, and
processing parameters will be considered. The database will be of fundamental
value for regulatory decision-making in FDA-CDRH related to devices with
titanium oxide or zirconium oxide surfaces. This research and education program
is well-suited to goals of the Scholar-in-Residence program because it combines
nanomaterials processing capabilities at the UNC/NCSU Department of Biomedical
Engineering with in vitro biological characterization capabilities at the CDRH.
This program will involve graduate student and PI activities at the FDA White
Oak campus over a two-year period.
