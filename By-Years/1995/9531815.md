*** 9531815 Stiglich This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project
will develop a commercially viable nano grained tungsten carbide composite for
dies, cutting tools, drills and reamers, and drill bit inserts applications.
Phase I results were generally successful in demonstrating that 50-100 nm WC
grains could be dispersed in a 6 wt% Co matrix by solution chemistry. The
resulting powder, along with commercial "submicron" WC/ 6 wt% Co powders from
three cutting tool companies, was consolidated by five different pressure
assisted processes. Four of them were "fast" - total process time densified all
of the powders to 97% to 100% of theoretical density. Microhardness data were
compared among several commercial materials with the proposed material being the
hardest at 2300 Vickers vs. 1600 to 1800 for commercial materials. Phase II will
accomplish the following objectives. Commercial viability will be established by
working with several industrial partners. A WC/Co composition will be developed
including grain growth inhibitors (such as VC) which will be suitable for
extrusion and sintering while maintaining the WC grain size achieved in Phase I.
Physical properties such as transverse rupture strength, fracture toughness, and
wear resistance will be related to WC grain size and consolidation parameters.
Cutting tools of various types will be fabricated for commercial evaluation.
There are many wear parts, tool and die, and metal cutting applications for
commercial carbide materials. Besides single point tools there are miniatures
(down to 250 to 500 micron diameter) drills, reamers, etc. which are important
for machining microcircuit boards. ***
