The principal investigator will work on a broad class of problems from
nonlinear control theory, including local and global controllability. A specific
goal will be to increase the understanding of invariants and normal forms of
control systems with feedback. The techniques of nonlinear control have many
practical applications from robotics to landing a space probe on some distant
planet. It is one example of the power and applicability of nonlinear
mathematics in the modern world.
