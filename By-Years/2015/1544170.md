Penguin: A Film

Penguin is a feature-length natural history film, produced in conjunction with
DisneyNature, for release on Earth Day 2019. Produced by the team that made
Frozen Planet, the Penguin film will be an in-depth documentary of the life-
cycle of the Adelie penguin. The goal is to explore the fascinating behaviors of
this particular species (Pygoscelis adeliae) within the context of the broader
ecosystem of the Antarctic continent.

While there have been other highly successful and popular films about penguins,
this will be the first to focus on the Adelie population. The majority of
filming will be in and around the penguin colony of Cape Crozier. The end
product will be the first feature length documentary on Antarctic wildlife to be
created in 4K, and the resulting footage will constitute the largest 4K film
archive of the Ross Sea. The film will be complemented by an extensive
Educator's Guide made readily available to teachers in grades 2-6 across the
country, and a separate parent activity pack in English and Spanish. Beyond the
theaters, the film will be distributed on DVD and Blu-ray for years to come. NSF
is providing the filmmakers logistic support only.
