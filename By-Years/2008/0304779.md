0304779&lt;br/&gt;Boyd&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the PI's graduate student
from the University of Michigan in a collaboration with Martin Tajmar of the
Space Propulsion Laboratory at the Austrian Research Center in Seibersdorf,
Austria. The collaboration will develop a first-principles model for Taylor cone
droplet formation through a combination of experimental activities and steady
state code development at the Austrian lab, which is a world leader in the
development of field emission electric propulsion systems. FEEP is a technology
suitable for spacecraft missions (such as the laser interferometer space
antenna) requiring thrusts in the sub-milliNewton level and needing precise
control abilities. The US and Austrian teams will investigate the effects of
viscosity, time of formation of Rayleigh instabilities, and convection of
vaporizing ions. A model of those effects will lead to optimized current levels
in future FEEP thrusters, thereby achieving maximum mass efficiency for a given
thrust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also fulfills a training objective. The
project will allow the graduate student involved to benefit from performing
research in another country. They will develop a heightened appreciation of the
world around them while also learning important new technical skills.&lt;br/&gt;
