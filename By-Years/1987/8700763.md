This study concerns the mechanisms that enable certain types of seaweed common
to high latitude North American waters (specifically kelp belonging to the
Laminaria genus) to maintain rapid rates of photosynthesis at low temperatures
(0-20 degrees centigrade). This phenomenon of low temperature photosynthetic
adaptation is poorly understood. The results of the proposed work will have a
major impact on our understanding of photosynthesis in marine algae that account
for over a third of the plant growth on the planet. Also, a better understanding
of the adaptations these kelp have made in their photosynthetic machinery at
extreme conditions may have applications ranging from the aquaculture of these
plants to the improved understanding of how crop plants on land can be made more
resistent to cold.
