A mutant for variegated flower color in the Japanese Morning Glory will be
investigated for the presence of a transposable element. The hypothesis states
that the unstable nature of this mutant is due to a transposable element. The
mutation will be studied and the putative transposable element isolated, cloned
and sequenced. The study of transposable elements in this model system will
provide information valuable to those wishing to develop conscious gene tagging
strategies.
