The present study is a continuation of the investigation on the tectonic
history of the Gulf of Mexico. Four tasks will be undertaken: 1) reprocessing of
five seismic profiles collected between 1977 and 1980; 2) analysis of these data
using a GEOQUEST workstation; 3) preparation of a regional synthesis of the SE
Gulf, including two-week field excursion on Cuba; 4) preparation of an ODP
drilling proposal that targets Jurassic rocks in the deep SE Gulf. The specific
object of this study and the ensuing drilling program is to improve the
understanding of the breakup and early paleogeography of the SE Gulf region. A
more general goal is to study the processes of continental rifting and creation
of transitional crust along a transform plate boundary.
