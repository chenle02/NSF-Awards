The goals of this research are the characterization of pollen specific genes
and genes expressed in both pollen and in sporophytic tissues and an
identification of cis-acting regulatory sequence elements and trans-acting
regulatory factors and their genes. The immediate objectives of the proposed
research are: (i) to completely sequence the coding and 5' and 3' flanking
regions of two pollen specific genes and two genes that are expressed both in
pollen and in vegetative tissue; (ii) to identify cis-acting regulatory elements
required for pollen expression by the use of cloned genes and DNA footprinting
following binding with nuclear proteins; (iii) to determine the developmental
time course of activation of trans-acting nuclear factors; (iv) to determine the
organization in the chromosome, of pollen and sporophyte expressed genes, and
(v) to determine by in situ hybridization the sites of localization of specific
mRNAs in the male gametophyte.%%% The male gametophyte (pollen grain-pollen
tube) plays a very important part in the life cycle of flowering plants. It
produces two sperm cells and transports them through the tissues of the style
and into the embryo sac in the ovule in the immediate vicinity of the egg and
central cell. In the double fertilization that follows, fusion of the sperm
cells with the egg and central cell gives rise to the zygote and primary
endosperm cell respectively. The embryo and endosperm of crop plants are of
vital importance to the nutrition of humans and domesticated animals. The
results of these studies could help us to better utilize pollen selection as a
tool in plant breeding. The isolation and characterization of pollen specific
promoters will be of value in plant biotechnology in the engineering of male
sterile lines for the production of hybrid seed.***
