This research project explores questions at the interface of geometry in
mathematics and string theory in physics. The project aims to investigate the
structure of physical theories by using methods from the mathematical fields of
non-commutative geometry and K-theory, and in turn, to utilize ideas from
physics to study new phenomena in geometry and topology. The results are
expected to advance several research areas in mathematics and physics. Graduate
and undergraduate students will receive research training through involvement in
the interdisciplinary project, and the investigator will continue active
leadership in the K-theory community.

The three primary areas of focus for the project are the relationship between
topological K-theory and string theory, the geometry of noncommutative
manifolds, and the study of metrics of positive scalar curvature and the Yamabe
invariant. In the first area, the project will study how K-theory constrains and
suggests dualities in string theory, F-theory, and M-theory, and why K-theory
isomorphisms associated with T-dualities seem to be related to the Baum-Connes
conjecture. In the second area, the project aims to understand the geometry of
metrics on the noncommutative 2-torus that are not conformally flat, and to
prove a noncommutative Gauss-Bonnet theorem for such metrics. In the last area,
the project will attempt to establish what curvature positivity conditions
guarantee vanishing of terms in the Witten genus, and to better understand the
topology of the space of positive scalar curvature metrics on a manifold.
