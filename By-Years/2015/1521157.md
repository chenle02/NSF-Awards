This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the need for
obtaining sustainable sources of chemicals and fuels. This proposal aims to
solve the problem in the context of a chemical with uses in high performance
polymers with total addressable market in excess of $7 billion per year. A key
requirement of such processes is high efficiency of conversion for economic
viability. We propose an integrated bio-thermochemical platform for production
of a monomer which can be used for production of unsaturated polyester resins.
The polymer properties can be fine-tuned by copolymerizing our monomer with
other monomers so as to achieve desired cost and performance needs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is in the high
yield bioprocess coupled with selective chemical conversion to develop an
economically viable bio-based process for production of a bulk chemical. The
proposed research would involve testing of various catalysts for polymerization
of the monomer along with other co-monomers, followed by characterization of
these polymer formulations. Another aspect of the work would be screening of
downstream processing methods for producing monomer at desired specification.
Upon full development, the process could produce a bulk chemical at half the
current market price, and with renewable sources as the raw inputs. This would
translate to lower cost to end customers and a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas
footprint relative to existing petro-based process.
