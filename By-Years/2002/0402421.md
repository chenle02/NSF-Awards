This award will be used to help recover annually laminated (varved) sediments
from three lakes on northern Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic to
reconstruct Late Holocene climate variations from the last 5,000-6,000 years.
The sediments from Ellesmere Island offer the opportunity for high-resolution
records of past climate variations in a region where few paleoclimatic records
exist. Varve thickness and grain size characteristics of each sedimentary layer
may reflect changes in summer temperature conditions in the region.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will focus on the warmest episodes of the
time period. The relationship of summer temperature changes to proxies of past
changes in total solar irradiance, episodes of explosive volcanism, and
variability in Earth-Sun orbital geometries will be examined to test the
hypothesis that solar forcing has influenced climate at high latitudes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be of value to a broad spectrum of
researchers across the science community by helping place modern Arctic climate
conditions in a long-term perspective by examining the frequency and timing of
warm climate episodes in the region over time.
