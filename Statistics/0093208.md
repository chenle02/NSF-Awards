This project extends current interests of the P.I. in new directions, in both
research and education. The project aims at the development of wavelet methods
as well as at their use in interdisciplinary research efforts. Wavelets, the
P.I.'s Ph.D. thesis subject, have become increasingly popular in many scientific
fields since the discovery of orthonormal wavelet bases by Daubechies and Mallat
in 1989. The work that the P.I. intends to do over the next five years addresses
the application of wavelet methods in four different but interrelated areas: i)
nonparametric density estimation; ii) time series; iii) dimension reduction in
curve regression, and iv) interdisciplinary research in biology. Specific
contributions include the development of nonparametric wavelet-based hypothesis
tests; the wavelet estimation of parameters of random processes, with emphasis
on long-memory; Bayesian wavelet component selection techniques and, finally,
applications of wavelet methods in the analysis of proteins and genomes.

In addition to the research component, the P.I. will develop a course on wavelet
methods. Theory will be interlaced with applications in many areas of practical
interest and lectures integrated with computer demonstrations. The course will
be at the advanced graduate level, for statistics and non-statistics majors. The
goal will be to train students that may subsequently do their dissertation work
on wavelets. The course will also produce students capable of bringing wavelet
methods in research fields other than statistics.
