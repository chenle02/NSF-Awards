9416416 Mader This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects of the
January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake. The objective of the project is to
evaluate the effectiveness of the City of Los Angeles Recovery and
Reconstruction Plan as a guide to city actions after the Northridge earthquake.
As part of the evaluation, the project team will explore the roles of the city's
departments, agencies, and ad hoc organizations created specifically to assist
recovery, and the value of ordinances and procedures prepared in advance for
immediate implementation after the earthquake. Actions pertaining to long-term
recovery and rebuilding will be emphasized, but the team will also look at the
impact of the plan on emergency response. ***
