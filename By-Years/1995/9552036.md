This project funds a computer-based laboratory for improving the teaching of
research design and analysis skills in the psychology curriculum. The general
objective is to improve students' competence, interest, and experience in
conducting and analyzing research with computer equipment. This may serve as a
model for comprehensive regional universities in widening the pool of future
researchers. Students in a two-semester Research Design &amp; Analysis sequence
gain experience using a wide range of modern research methods on the computers;
these experiences are tied to course objectives to improve understanding and
skills in design and analysis. Students design, conduct, and analyze their own
original research using the laboratory and are better prepared to enter graduate
school and pursue careers in research. The laboratory is also used in other
lower- and upper-level psychology classes to provide firsthand experience with
research methods covered during class and is available to students working on
individual research projects. Hardware and software is being chosen to maximize
flexibility and ease of learning, and use of the equipment is being integrated
into the Research Design &amp; Analysis curriculum.
