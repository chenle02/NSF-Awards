This award provides support for student attendance at the 34th annual meeting of
the Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (DAMOP) of the American
Physical Society. The meeting will be held at the University of Colorado,
Boulder, 20-24 May, 2003. This is the principal meeting covering principles of
AMO physics held each year, and this award gives students the opportunity to
participate in DAMOP sponsored events. As part of the activity, conference
organizers will hold a special pre-conference symposium for students to hear
special presentations on topics of particular DAMOP interest.
