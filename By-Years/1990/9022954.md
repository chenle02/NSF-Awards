The Ichthyology Collection of the California Academy of Sciences contains more
than 200,000 lots of specimens, and includes historically important collections
that have been transferred from Stanford and Indiana Universities, and from the
George Vanderbilt Foundation. Drs. Tomio Iwamoto and William Eschmeyer, Curators
in charge of the Collection, have embarked on a plan to computerize all specimen
lots, in order to make them more readily available to the research community.
They plan to begin with data entry for freshwater fishes from South America, and
this will add important data to a multi-institution international database
project supported by the National Science Foundation, coordinated by Dr. Scott
Schaefer of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. The proposed
database of South American fishes is an unprecedented effort to link separate
databases of museum specimens to create a wide-area network with open access to
researchers. Once completed, the database will be a unique and heavily used
resource for systematic, evolutionary, ecological, and biogeographic research.
