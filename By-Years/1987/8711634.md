The principal objective of the research is an improved understanding of the
Bloch wall structure and substructure associated with magnetic bubble domains
with major emphasis on dynamic effects which occur only when the walls are inm
motion. Through a cooperative effort with Magnesys, a Bubble Memory Systems
Company, this research effort will be integrated with their plans to achieve
gigabit vertical Bloch line memory systems in the next decade. The study of wall
dynamics will be carried out on (111) and (110)- oriented magnetic garnets as
have been used, or proposed for use in bubble and Bloch line magnetic memories.
Dynamic observations will be carried out on wall structures in bubbles which are
in steady motion, achieved when a bubble moves in a uniform circular path under
the influence of applied field gradients. These field gradients are produced by
suitable conductor patterns, readily made in our laboratories. This experimental
technique, developed at Purdue University, provides a unique method to determine
details of the dynamical domain wall structure such as the number and sign of
vertical Bloch lines.
