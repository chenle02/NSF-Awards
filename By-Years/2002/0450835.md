The purpose of this research is to further the understanding of DNA damage and
repair by elucidating the relationship between these processes and DNA
nanomechanics and by visualizing repair protein activities on DNA using atomic
force microscopy techniques. The objectives are: 1) optimize the AFM platform
for single-molecule DNA measurements 2) examine various lesions in individual
DNA molecules and follow in the AFM their direct reversal by DNA repair enzymes
3) use AFM imaging and force spectroscopy to visualize the mismatch repair
reaction of E. coli. To achieve these objectives the AFM platform needs to be
optimized to reduce force errors to single piconewtons and to accelerate image
acquisition by using the ultra-small cantilever technology. DNA repair proteins
such as photolyases, endonucleases and ligases will be used as damage markers
and will be imaged in complexes with DNA by AFM in order to locate and identify
the damage sites. Force spectroscopy measurements will determine the mechanical
fingerprints of various types of DNA damage caused by UV and gamma radiation and
will directly follow damage reversal in the presence of the repair activities.
This project will also examine and visualize the DNA mismatch repair reaction
using E. coli repair activities and AFM imaging and force spectroscopy
technologies. This project will provide an exciting education and research
opportunity for three graduate students at the interface between engineering and
biology and will likely develop new ultra sensitive assays for DNA damage
detection that is of significance to many areas of biology.
