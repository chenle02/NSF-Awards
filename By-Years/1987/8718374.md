The viviparous-1 (vp) gene of maize blocks the normal arrest of embryo
development, thereby causing precocious germination of the seed on the mother
plant. The objectives of this proposal are to 1) isolate the vp gene by
transposon tagging and determine its molecular structure and 2) identify the vp
gene product by making antibody to a synthetic peptide derived from the gene
sequence. Dr. McCarty's goal to clone the vp gene is very important for the
study of developmental gene regulation and seed development in maize. The
findings generated by this work will clearly set the stage for significant
future work.
