Recently, algebraic topology has found a number of applications within
mathematics and beyond. For example, topology provided powerful new methods for
detecting and describing shape and structure in complex and high-dimensional
data. This award supports the Research Training Group in Algebraic Topology and
its Applications at Ohio State University. This work will be performed in a
highly collaborative and active interdisciplinary research environment that has
recently emerged, involving investigators from the Departments of Mathematics
and Computer Science &amp; Engineering. The main objective of the project is to
provide early-stage mathematicians and computer scientists with opportunities to
learn about both theoretical and applied aspects of topology and related fields.
Exposure to these topics will allow students and junior faculty to move fluently
across a range of research topics, to enter research communities in traditional
core areas, and to work in new interdisciplinary
directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports postdoctoral researchers,
graduate students, and undergraduate researchers studying such topology-related
fields as geometric group theory, metric geometry, computational geometry and
topology, knot theory, and stochastic topology. The award also supports the
development of new courses, as well as working groups, seminars, and workshops
in these areas. At the heart of the project is an emphasis on mentoring at all
levels. The program also places a strong emphasis on developing writing and
communication skills, particularly for postdoctoral researchers and graduate
students involved in the research group.
