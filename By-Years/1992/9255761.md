Louisiana Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation (LaCEPT) The
Louisiana Collaborative, an integral part of the Louisiana Systemic Initiative
Program (LaSIP), will engage the efforts of key stakeholders to institutionalize
statewide reform of teacher education in mathematics and science. The specific
goals of LaCEPT are to 1) establish a statewide consortium of key partners; 2)
deepen understanding of reform issues; 3) develop a statewide strategic plan; 4)
establish partnerships between school and college sectors; 5) reorder campus
priorities and faculty rewards systems; 6) redesign preservice courses in
mathematics, science and methods; 7) revise instructional materials; 8) increase
the number of certified teachers in science and mathematics, focusing on
underrepresented groups; 9) expand the boundaries of research and practice; 10)
maintain national standards for teacher performance as students progress from
preservice to certification to extended service. The signature program of LaCEPT
will be sponsorship of campus-based renewal projects at Louisiana's public and
private colleges and universities. Each campus will develop a plan for long-term
systemic renewal and will fashion a distinctive proposal engaging mathematics,
science and education faculty in the redesign of curriculum, instructional
materials, assessment; mentorships and internships, partnerships with schools;
research and technology centers; precollege recruiting of potential teachers;
revision of certification standards.
