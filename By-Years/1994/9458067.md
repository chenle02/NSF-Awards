9458067 Stevens Two areas of research are being pursued that focus on the
receptor molecules that are responsible for neuronal signal transduction. The
first project takes a structural approach using x-ray and electron
crystallography to elucidate the structure and function of the family of
7-transmembrane G- protein coupled receptors. Although there has been a great
deal of information obtained about 7-transmembrane cell receptors, the
information has not been expanded and consolidated so that an understanding of
their structure and function is known. These molecules are key to understanding
how signal transduction occurs between the cells in the brain and nervous
system. The second project uses the neuronal receptors described in the first
part in the design of a new molecular biosensor. The receptor biosensor
harnesses the power of these selective and sensitive receptors by mimicking how
cells communicate the detection of drugs, odorants, etc. The biosensor is a new
material that couples the receptor biosensor to colored lipids that change color
upon ligand binding induced structural changes in the receptor. By designing
materials that mimic how neurons communicate, we are able to learn more about
how communication occurs.
