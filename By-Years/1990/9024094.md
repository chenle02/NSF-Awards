This award will support the research collaboration of Alwyn Gentry of the
Missouri Botanical Garden and Ricardo Rueda, a Nicaraguan graduate student in
biology at the University of Missouri, St. Louis. The project aims to elucidate
the taxonomic relationships within Petrea, an important and poorly understood
neotropical genus of about 30 plant species. The last taxonomic treatment of
Petrea was done over 50 years ago. The limits of the taxa are unclear and their
interrelationships need reevaluation. Very little is known about Petrea's
ecology, cytology, anatomy, phylogeny, and pollination biology. Because its
species can be propagated by seed, seeds will be collected and germinated for
root tip chromosome counts. Differences between trees and lianas in the genus
will be investigated to see how they have originated and what anatomical
features differentiate the two life forms. Both the U.S. and Nicaraguan sides
will benefit from acquiring new data about this little-known genus. The U.S.
side will gain from _______ and the Nicaraguan collaborator will acquire
training in modern techniques of systematic biology and field-oriented research,
needed to help train the next generation of Nicaraguan botanists.
