The polymer laboratory at William and Mary consists of three experiments in
polymer synthesis, four involving solution characterization of polymers, and two
treating mechanical and thermal properties of bulk polymers. The objective of
the laboratory is to give students hands-n experience with important techniques
and to provide them with first-hand experience in the principles of polymer
chemistry. Two major instruments are utilized in this project. First , a
membrane osmometer for determining the number-average molecular weight of a
polymer sample and a light-scattering photometer for the weight-average
molecular weight and also for determining molecular sizes. The latter will also
be used downstream from a GPC instrument for the analysis of molecular-weight
distributions. The introduction of this laboratory courses allows the Department
of Chemistry to make available to its majors a curriculum option of a chemistry
major with a polymer emphasis. The institution is matching the award with an
equal amount of funds.
