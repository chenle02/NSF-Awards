Abstract - Vohs 9712774 Professor John M. Vohs, of University of Pennsylvania,
will investigate the structure and reactivity of model vanadia catalysts
supported on single crystal titania, ceria, zirconia, and magnesia. This
fundamental research is of relevance to various industrial processes, such as
selective oxidation and ammoxidation of hydrocarbons and alcohols, reduction of
nitrogen oxides by ammonia and hydrocarbons, and hydrotreatment of
heteroaromatics. HREELS, Auger, RBS, XPS, LEEDS, STM/AFM; TPD of methanol,
formic acid, water, ammonia and ethylamine; reaction kinetics of the atmospheric
pressure oxidation of methanol; and reduction of NOx with NH3 will be the
primary techniques to characterize structure and reactivity. The distinctive
feature of this investigation is the vapor deposition of uniform (possibly
epitaxial) vanadia overlayers and the determination of the strength of the
support-O-V bonds -- to which the selectivity of supported vanadia is usually
attributed. Such strength will be correlated with local structure and probe
molecule reactivity, and will be varied by the composition and structure of the
support. The vibrational characteristics of both supported vanadia and
chemisorbed probe molecules will be determined with an HREELS technique having
spectral resolution as low as 8 cm-1. In addition, the author will study the
surface-O stretching modes, and the O-V-O bending modes, which are more
indicative of support interaction than the V=O mode. Surface species (hydroxyl,
amino, nitrosyl, methoxy) will be produced by chemisorption and desorbed by TPD.
The steady state reactions (methanol oxidation or NOx SCR with NH3) will be
carried out on a side microreactor chamber to which samples can be transferred
without air exposure.
