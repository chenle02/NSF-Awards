This research studies new mechanisms for enabling the consumer of the service to
reduce the visibility of consumer computations to the service provider and
thereby reduce the trust that the consumer places in the provider. At the same
time, the mechanisms allow security of the cloud computing environment to be
monitored by a trusted third party. The work also develops a quantified method
to evaluate the degree to which a user's privacy is disclosed and tools for
monitoring causality relationships.
