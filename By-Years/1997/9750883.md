Chiroscience is prevalent in academic research laboratories, as well as in many
industries, but most issues of chirality are either inadequately described or
not coherently integrated into undergraduate curricula. In response, this
project is reformulating the undergraduate organic laboratory curriculum around
the topic of chirality. The new curriculum is designed to: make the connection
between synthesis, separation, and identification; introduce synthetic
methodology and reagents for stereoselective synthesis; introduce new technology
and instrumentation for chiroptical measurements; and provide an equipment base
for enantiomer separations and analysis. Experiments from the previous
curriculum are being revised and new experiments are being developed to
incorporate aspects of chirality and biotechnology. This project is making it
possi`le for instructors to teach a traditional undergraduate laboratory
curriculum, with the inclusion of new synthetic reagents and methodology. This
approach is directed toward teaching asymmetric induction, providing techniques
for the separation of enantiomers and quantification by chiral chromatography,
introducing chiroptical measurements, and using nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy with chiral shift reagents for analysis. The project is also
extending the scope of the laboratory to better overlap with industrial science
and biological chemistry while maintaining writing in the curriculum. Finally,
several group projects are being provided to promote collaborative learning.
