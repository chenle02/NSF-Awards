There is an increasing awareness of the importance of macromolecular chemistry.
Indeed, some exposure at the undergraduate level for chemistry majors is now
recommended by the American Chemical Society. The focus of this project, through
the acquisition of appropriate instrumentation, is to significantly improve the
level of exposure for students to several important aspects of polymer
chemistry. A core course was in place but had several gaps in the laboratory
program. Specifically, the significant areas of thermal analysis and molecular
weight distribution were treated only with "dry labs". The acquired Differential
Scanning Calorimeter and High Pressure Gel Permeation Chromatograph allowed a
number of in- depth experiments to be done, not only in Polymer Chemistry, but
in several upper level courses as well. The institution contributed to this
project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
