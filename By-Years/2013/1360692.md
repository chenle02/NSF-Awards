In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
(CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Kit Bowen of Johns
Hopkins University and his graduate and undergraduate student researchers are
conducting experiments to measure the strength of electron binding to neutral
molecules. The results from these experiments are important to other areas of
chemistry, including mass spectrometry, enzymology and the chemistry of
radiation damage. Graduate and undergraduate students working on this project
will receive excellent training in experimental physical chemistry. Prof. Bowen
also opens his laboratory to urban middle and high school students, exposing
these students to state-of-the-art laboratory
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Bowen and his research group are conducting
a large number of experiments on atoms and molecules, using laser-based
photoelectron spectroscopy. Among the projects being carried out are: (1) the
study of electron induced proton transfer; (2) the investigation of diffuse
electron states in molecules and clusters including dipole-bound anions and
double Rydberg anions; (3) the measurement of the electron affinities of
nucleobases. Over the course of these measurements, Prof. Bowen and his students
will further develop new experimental tools and methods in cutting-edge gas-
phase experimental chemistry.
