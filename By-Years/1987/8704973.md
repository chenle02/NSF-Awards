Funding is provided for the purchase of a high-speed imaging system consisting
of a scanner, recorder and controller and various accessories (lenses, tapes,
etc.) needed to use the device in the laboratory. The system will interface to
an existing super micro-computer resulting in a powerful, software driven image
analyzer. The device will be used for basic research in biomechanics and fluid
mechanics to the measure the mechanical properties of soft tissues and to make
quantitative flow visualization in cardiovascular flow models.
