Previous studies of primate evolution have demonstrated that certain aspects of
evolution, ecology, and behavior have a direct impact on the size and shape of
the bony and muscular elements of the skeleton. However, the relationships are
not always clear, nor are the correlations the same across different primate
groups. Several specific determinants of form have been identified, such as diet
and foraging behavior, size and orientation of branches used in the natural
habitat, locomotor movements and postures, body size, and evolutionary history
of the lineage. The goal of this study is to correlate skeletal and muscular
anatomy with these key determinants of form in eleven species of poorly-
understood and highly endangered group of South American monkeys. Specific
measurements and descriptions of the bones and musculature of all four limbs in
each of the eleven monkey species will be taken. Such data will also be
collected in a group of eight additional primates, sharing ecological and
behavioral similarities with the monkeys, to be used for comparative purposes.
Details of the behavior and ecology of each monkey species and members of the
comparative group will be taken from published field studies and films of
several monkeys in captivity. The anatomical data will be analyzed for its
functional significance, determining the movement capabilities of each limb
joint, and then will be statistically correlated with the behavioral data for
each species. This integrated approach will provide a comprehensive
understanding of the functional anatomy of an important group of South American
monkeys. It will also serve as a rigorous test of several previous suggestions
of anatomy/behavior correlations and will address numerous broader issues in
primate anatomy and evolution.
