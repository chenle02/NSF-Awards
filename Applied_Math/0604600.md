The investigator studies thermal, elastic and other effective properties of
high-contrast two-phase particulate composites where concentration of inclusions
in the matrix is high. He uses their fundamental property: the dominant
contribution to the rate of thermal dissipation, elastic energy and other bulk
properties comes from the areas between closely spaced particles. This allows to
develop Discrete Network Approximations to effective properties of a composite.
The main goal of the project is to develop rigorous mathematical foundations for
these approximations. The investigator studies the concept of a Perforated
Composite as the key step in his analysis. This concept allows to develop the
discrete network method into an effective and attractive tool for analysis and
applications. He applies this concept to determine effective elastic properties
of particulate composites, conductivity of strongly nonlinear composites, and
rate of viscous dissipation in highly concentrated suspensions.

The investigator studies a class of heterogeneous media such as ocean flows,
oil-bearing sands, particle-reinforced and fiber-reinforced composites, mud and
blood among others. These media are ubiquitous and characterization of their
properties is paramount for development of new technologies and materials.
Experimental studies of many such media are impossible or prohibitively
expensive. Computational studies of such media often are beyond our current
capabilities. The investigator characterizes analytically these media as
networks, which allows developing reliable and effective reduced models amenable
to further analysis and numerical simulations. Such models help to assess
thermal and elastic properties of ceramics/polymer composites, augmented
transport of plasma proteins in blood, and the spreading of pollutants in ocean.
