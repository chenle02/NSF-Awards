This project is working to develop a new system that simultaneously discovers
the patterns of word morphology and parts of speech for a wide range of the
world's languages from unannotated text. Given a quantity of training text, such
a system will yield a transducer, which segments the words in new texts into
stems and affixes and determine the part of speech of each word as a whole.
Through unsupervised learning, an iterative bootstrapping procedure will combine
several different linguistic knowledge sources to gradually build up a
representation of the language in the form of paradigms. From these paradigms,
symbolic part of speech rules and morphophonological rewrite rules will be
extracted, which will then be compiled into a probabilistic finite-state
transducer, which can label new texts with morphology and part of speech.

Despite the widespread application of machine learning techniques to natural
language processing, developing morphological analyzers still involves much
human effort. While the morphology of English is very simple, the automatic
analysis by computer of texts or speech in the majority of the world's languages
depend on the availability of appropriate morphological analyzers. It is also
important for the important problem of automatic information extraction in the
biomedical domain, where it is necessary to analyze the complex structure of
technical terms, even in English. Such analyzers are useful in most applications
in natural language processing, including parsing, information retrieval,
machine translation, text summarization, correct pronunciation in speech
synthesis, language models in speech recognition, language generation, and named
entity recognition.
