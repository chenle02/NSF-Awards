In this project, the P.I.'s will continue studies using sea level data from the
Navy's GEOSAT satellite. Operationally, they are producing 17-day maps of large-
scale sea level distribution in the equatorial Pacific. Comparison of these
products with island sea level measurements will be used to investigate meso-
and basin- scale circulation in the equatorial and mid-latitude Pacific.
