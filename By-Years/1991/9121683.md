This effort will provide the overall management for a US JGOFS Equatorial
Pacific Process Study to be conducted during the Spring and Fall of 1992. In
addition, certain scientific services necessary for the completion of the
project will be provided: ship use, hydrography, analysis of doppler current
meter data, acquisition and archiving of satellite imagery, site mapping and
sediment coring. These services do not stand alone as scientific research
efforts, but are necessary to participating investigators and have been
identified as critical to the success of the overall experiment by the US JGOFS
Steering Committee. The US JGOFS Rational and Plan for Equatorial Pacific
Process Studies, provides the overall scientific rationale and justification for
an equatorial Pacific process study; it also describes the conceptual plan and
experimental strategy that has been endorsed by the US JGOFS Steering Committee
and the scientists who want to take part in the study.
