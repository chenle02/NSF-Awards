Research is concerned with the role of statistical design, modeling, and
analysis in quality engineering. Because industrial experimentation is usually
expensive, emphasis is given to techniques and strategies which minimize
experimental effort, and maximize information gained from analysis of results.
Central topics are: reduction of variation; designing products robust to
transmitted variation and to environmental variation; modeling control processes
to achieve better understanding of the roles and possible conflicts between
statistical process control and automatic process control; developing bases for
choosing standards and; data-based prediction of possible future upsets.
