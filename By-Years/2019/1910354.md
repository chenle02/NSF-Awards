The Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) is a radio interferometer
dedicated to the study of the Sun located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory
(OVRO). It collects microwave imaging spectropolarimetry measurements of the Sun
and space weather phenomena in the microwave frequency band. The proposers seek
to operate EOVSA as a community resource, making the data public to all users
within hours of collection. The chief science aims of the array are the study of
solar flares, the magnetic and plasma structure of solar active regions, and
drivers of space weather. EOVSA provides a test bed for prototyping of antennas,
feeds, analog and digital systems, calibration methods, and data management for
the Frequency Agile Solar Radio Telescope (FASR), a proposed next-generation
solar radio observatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposers will operate the
Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array, which uses radio interferometry to collect
full-disk images of the Sun every second in a series of wavebands in the
frequency range of 1-18 GHz, excluding 1.9-2.4 GHz due to noise. The
instantaneous bandwidth is 500 MHz; it switches between each band in 20 ms,
allowing full coverage of the whole frequency range in 1 second. The data they
collect will be used to study solar flares, solar active regions, and sources
for space weather. EOVSA consists of 13 2.1-meter radio dishes, with a 27-m dish
used for high-sensitivity calibration. The array covers an area 1.1 by 1.2
kilometers in extent, and operates seven days a week, from sunrise to sunset.
The proposers seek to use the Array as a community instrument, not only making
the data available to the larger solar astronomy and space weather community,
but also using the system a testbed for prototyping systems for potential future
instrumentation in the microwave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
