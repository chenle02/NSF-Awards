Flowering plants limit self-fertilization and maintain genetic diversity by a
number of mechanisms, ranging from simple physical barriers to complex
interactions between components of the pistil and pollen. In plants that posses
self-incompatibility systems, self-pollen is distinguished from pollen of
genetically unrelated origin in the stigma or style of the pistil. Following the
recognition of the presence of self-pollen, the development of self-related
pollen grains, but not of genetically-distinct grains, s halted. Although the
mechanism of self-recognition is not yet known, a chromosomal location, the S
locus, has been shown from genetic crosses to encode the putative pistil and
pollen elements that interact in this recognition process. This research will
determine: whether a specific region of these genes is a" master switch" which
confers specific expressed in the sigma and style of the flower, whether
specific DNA binding proteins regulate these genes, and which pollen products
interact with proteins coded for by these genes.
