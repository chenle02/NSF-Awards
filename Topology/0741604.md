The study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds has made tremendous progress in the past
five years. The new tools available have great potential for attacking
previously inapproachable questions. These new tools include Perelman's Ricci
flow techniques, the presently quite sophisticated theory of discrete subgroups
of PSL(2,C), and interactions with number theory via arithmetic lattices. Peter
Storm will work to apply these new tools to the study of 3-manifolds, and more
general negatively curved spaces such as Gromov hyperbolic spaces, or higher
dimensional negatively curved manifolds. A 3-manifold is a mathematical object
which models the three dimensional world we occupy. Thus questions about the
nature of 3-dimensional space become mathematical questions about 3-manifolds.
For this and other reasons, 3-manifolds are carefully studied by many
mathematicians. They occupy a special niche between strongly intuitive subjects,
such as geometry in the plane, and more abstract subjects, such as the study of
mathematical objects with more than 4 dimensions, where meaningful mental images
are difficult to produce. The research of Peter Storm tries to benefit from both
the intuitive and the more abstract points of view, with the goal of gaining a
better understanding the nature of three dimensional objects, and their
mathematical cousins.
