The goal of the the work of the principal investigator is to develop geometric
techniques for applications in representation theory and the geometric Langlands
program. From this point of view the basic geometric problem is to understand
perverse sheaves from the microlocal point of view. A sufficiently deep
understanding of microlocal perverse sheaves on flag manifolds should lead to
interesting invariants of irreducible representations of reductive Lie groups
and, hopefully, in the end, to an understanding of unipotent representations.
Similar techniques are also being applied to modular representation theory. The
goal of the last project is to gain insight in the geometric Langlands
conjecture in its various forms. In addition to microlocal techniques the point
of view of Whittaker models is used.

The fundamental theme of the project is the interplay between geometry and
representation theory. The idea of reducing the understanding of various
geometries to their groups of symmetries goes back to Felix Klein at the end of
the nineteenth century. From this point of view the basic objects, the "atoms"
of the theory, are the irreducible representations of the group of symmetries of
a given geometry. It turns out that these atoms arise from a particular
geometric situation and hence we can apply geometric methods to analyze the
properties of the irreducible representations. This is the goal of the first
part of the the proposal. The second part of the project deals with the deep
conjectures of Langlands. Here the geometry in question arises from an
arithmetic situation and this brings number theory in the mixture of geometry
and representation theory.
