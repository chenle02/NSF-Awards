Despite considerable public and scientific concern about the presence of
anthropogenic chemicals in the environment that can interfere with the endocrine
system (endocrine disrupters), little is known about the effects of chronic
exposure to low levels of endocrine disrupters on animal behavior. The proposed
project will:

1) Determine how lifetime exposure to environmentally-relevant levels of ethinyl
estradiol affects behavioral development, life history traits and biomarkers of
endocrine disruption in threespined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus); 2)
Determine how chronic exposure to low levels of ethinyl estradiol affects the
developmental trajectories of full sib families of stickleback from two
populations where adults differ in behavior, morphology and life history.

The proposed experiment will examine the influence of lifetime exposure to low
levels of an exogenous estrogen on the development of behavioral traits. It will
contribute to the growing literature on endocrine disruption by relating widely-
used toxicological biomarkers with ecologically relevant traits, such as life
history and behavior. In addition, the study explicitly examines intraspecific
variation (among full-sib families and populations) in susceptibility to
endocrine disruption. These data will shed light on important questions
regarding the source of population-level variation in stickleback.
