The goals of this proposal, to be done in collaboration with P. Feehan, are to
prove Witten's conjecture relating the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants
of smooth four-manifolds, to understand the relation between the conditions of
Seiberg-Witten simple type and Kronheimer-Mrowka simple type, and to search for
possible topological constraints on these invariants. This work will be carried
out by exploring the moduli space of PU(2) monopoles which contains a moduli
space of anti-self-dual connections and the moduli spaces of Seiberg-Witten
monopoles for certain Spin C structures. This implies that the Donaldson
invariant can be expressed as a sum, over these spinc structures, of an
expression given by pairing certain cohomology classes with the link of the
moduli space of Seiberg-Witten monopoles in the Uhlenbeck compactification of
the moduli space of PU(2) monopoles. The first phase of this work is to complete
the proof that the pairing of these cohomology classes with the link of the
moduli space of Seiberg-Witten monopoles can be expressed in a universal form
depending only on the Seiberg-Witten invariant and the homotopy type of the
manifold. This work will also yield a proof of the Kotschick-Morgan conjecture
on wall-crossing formulas for Donaldson invariants. The second phase of this
work is to calculate this universal form in sufficient detail to allow the
computation of the explicit relation between the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten
invariants. We intend to do this calculation by using known surgery formulas for
both invariants (e.g. blow-up formulas), examples where both invariants are
known, and some internal symmetries of the sum mentioned above. It is possible
that this relation between the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants is over-
determined and thus will reveal constraints on these invariants given by the
topological type of the four-manifold, as was done in earlier work with
Kronheimer and Mrowka.

An n-dimensional manifold is a topological space that locally looks like
n-dimensional Euclidean space. Manifolds are important objects to study because
they are ubiquitous: the solution set of k equations in n variables will usually
be an (n-k)-dimensional manifold. The main tools for distinguishing between
four-dimensional manifolds are the Seiberg-Witten and Donaldson invariants.
Thus, understanding the relation between these invariants is crucial to an
understanding of four-dimensional topology. In addition, the conjectures
relating these invariants arise from Witten's work using quantum field theory.
These methods of quantum field theory are not mathematically rigorous, so our
mathematically rigorous proof of Witten's conjecture can be viewed as an
extremely inexpensive form of experimental physics.
