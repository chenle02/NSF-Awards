This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop advanced
materials for the separation and concentration of germanium and gallium from
both acidic and basic ore leaches. The primary objective of the project will be
to develop synthetic routes for grafting polyamines to silica particles
resulting in composite material that provide an excellent platform for
immobilizing metal selective ligands on a matrix is resistant to acids and bases
and elevated temperatures. This should permit germanium and gallium loadings and
usable materials lifetimes that are superior to current technologies. The
development of more efficient means of extracting these metals will result in
the exploitation of germanium and gallium deposits in the United States that
cannot be currently developed due to the limited availability of economically
viable and environmentally benign ore processing protocols
