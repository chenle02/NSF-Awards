Abstract CTS-9632280 A combined modeling and experimental investigation of the
basic mechanisms of consolidation in the Plasma Activated Sintering (PAS)
process will be undetaken, with illustration to a high temperature metal
(tungsten) powder. Special focus will be on understanding the role of the
electric field and particle surface activation on sintering. The phenomena
necessary developing a manufacturing process applicable to the consolidation of
high quality tungsten powders, including the resultant microstructure, will be
analyzed. The computer simulation considers five sintering mechanisms, including
surface and grain boundary diffusion, volume diffusion from the surface and
contact area, and evaporation-condensation. This GOALI (Grant Opportunities for
Academic Liaison with Industry) project will be performed in collaboration with
Teledyne Co. The company will participate to the research effort, provide some
basic materials and equipment, and support summer fellowship in industry for a
graduate student working on the project during the academic year. The results
are expected to develop a scientific foundation applicable to other powders than
tungsten-based. PAS has the ability to consolidate powders in minutes as
compared to hours for conventional sintering, and has particular relevance to
net shape manufacturing. ***
