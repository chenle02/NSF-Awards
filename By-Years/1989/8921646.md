The Marine Technology Society proposes to present to the marine technology
community the papers presented at the international session of the International
Ocean Technology Congress (IOTC) conference in January, 1989. The articles will
be incorporated into a single issue of the Marine Technology Society Journal
designated volume 24, number l to be published in March, 1990. The Journal
distribution is approximately 3,000 copies to members and subscribers throughout
the marine technology community. An additional 100 copies will be provided to
the National Science Foundation for distribution. Fifteen (15) papers were
generated from the session. They address techniques available or required in the
assessment of resources and conditions perquisite to evaluation, exploration and
monitoring of the impact of activities in the ocean environment. Original data
are presented in the papers which advance the state of knowledge in ocean
technology.
