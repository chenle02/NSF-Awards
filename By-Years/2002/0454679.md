This project will support American participants of the conference "Chaos and
Disorder in Mathematics and Physics" taking place on September 18-24 in
Bressanone, Italy. This is an international scholarly meeting devoted to
interactions between various branches of mathematical physics such as dynamical
systems, partial differential equations, probability theory and statistical
physics. Being one of the most important gatherings in mathematical physics in
2005 this conference will attract around 100 researchers from around the world.
By supporting American participants, especially promising young researchers,
attending this meeting this project will play an important role in maintaining
American leadership in the field of mathematical physics.
