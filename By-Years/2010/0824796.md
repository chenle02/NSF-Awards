&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports US-participation in
the "The 3rd SCAR Open Science Conference" to be held in St. Petersburg, Russia
in July 2008. The SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) Conference
is an international meeting covering all aspects of current polar research, and
this conference includes both the Antarctic and Arctic. Recent results and
opportunities for future cooperation are highlighted, which is timely for
projects for the current International Polar Year 2007-2009.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, this workshop promotes
international collaboration, broadens the perspective of U.S. scientists, and
provides an opportunity for the next generation of scientists to interact with
leaders in the field. This award also provides support for applicants from
underrepresented groups, as well as early career scientists and students.
Outcomes have societal relevance in understanding global climate change, and the
opening day's plenary session will bring the meeting to the attention of the
media and general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
