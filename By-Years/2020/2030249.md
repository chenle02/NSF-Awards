This project is helping to lay the foundation for more efficient and secure
access to wireless spectrum while protecting essential existing uses of that
spectrum. This access is critical to meet the demands from both legacy and
emerging wireless applications, that have potential benefits across society. To
this end, we are developing novel sensors, algorithmic solutions, models and
architecture for future Data-Aware Spectrum Access Systems (DASASs) that will
extend the current state-of-the-art to enable date driven solutions for spectrum
access. Other impacts of this project include outreach to K-12 education,
training and mentoring students including undergraduates and under-represented
minorities, and developing new courses related to the proposed
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The envisioned system will leverage extensive
low-cost sensing to support spectrum sharing across different frequency bands at
different timescales for a rich set of different use cases including static and
mobile users, active and passive spectrum utilization, and planned versus random
uses. We are taking a multidisciplinary approach to design this system
including: developing low cost spectrum sensors that utilize novel low-power
distributed algorithms; understanding how to efficiently integrate and query the
data obtained from these algorithms with other sources (e.g., weather, spatial
density of demands) and use it to predictively trigger algorithms for spectrum
allocation decisions; developing new and scalable spectrum allocation algorithms
that use the acquired data to manage a wide range of users of the spectrum while
accounting for market competition; and ensuring that the resulting system can
leverage the available data to be secure against malicious attackers and
unintentional user behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
