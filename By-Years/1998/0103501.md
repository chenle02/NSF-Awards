&lt;br/&gt;Jarvis Christian College, ``the college with the personal touch and
where &lt;br/&gt;dreams come true,'' proposes an aggressive and comprehensive
model Historically &lt;br/&gt;Black College and Universities Undergraduate
Program (HBCU-UP), engaging a &lt;br/&gt;community of academic partners working
together to significantly increase minority &lt;br/&gt;participation and access
to science careers. The Program goal is to develop, &lt;br/&gt;implement,
evaluate and institutionalize a program that will achieve and sustain a
&lt;br/&gt;high quality and competitive science, mathematics, engineering and
technology &lt;br/&gt;(SMET) education program. The comprehensive program
proposed for Jarvis &lt;br/&gt;emphasizes the following four elements: Pre-
College Outreach Programs; &lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate Student Scholars; Faculty
Development Opportunities; and &lt;br/&gt;Curriculum, Equipment and Laboratory
Development. The specific objectives are: &lt;br/&gt;(1) to implement a summer
enhancement and skills development summer workshop &lt;br/&gt;for rising high
school students who have demonstrated an interest and aptitude in &lt;br/&gt;the
science areas that will ensure that 80% of the participants will complete the
&lt;br/&gt;twelfth grade and enroll in college as a SMET major; (2) to implement
a summer &lt;br/&gt;``bridge'' program for students entering Jarvis in the Fall
that will impact 90% &lt;br/&gt;success rate during the first year; (3) to
develop an implement a Scholars program &lt;br/&gt;customized to achieve 90%
undergraduate retention and graduation rates and &lt;br/&gt;result in at least
70% enrollment in graduate or professional SMET programs; (4)to
&lt;br/&gt;develop and implement a comprehensive faculty development program,
develop &lt;br/&gt;new curricular offerings and expand existing courses for
improvement and (5) to &lt;br/&gt;increase diversity and the number of SMET
majors by 20% annually. &lt;br/&gt;All proposed activities support the mission
of the National Science &lt;br/&gt;Foundation, ``to provide access to quality
science education for all students'', and &lt;br/&gt;the mission of Jarvis
Christian College, ``to provide a quality education to increase &lt;br/&gt;the
competitiveness of its students in post-baccalaureate efforts.'' The extensive
&lt;br/&gt;evaluation process and the involvement of the total college community
and the &lt;br/&gt;community partners will insure its success. This proposed
Jarvis Program &lt;br/&gt;represents the model for ``Creating Windows of
Opportunity for Success in the &lt;br/&gt;SMET areas.'' &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
