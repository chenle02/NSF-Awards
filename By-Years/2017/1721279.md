Research relies on access to carefully archived data, and critical tools,
including visualizations, analytic models,and computer code. The Science of
Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) program has reached a juncture in the
production of research output. This project builds a central repository where
the products from SciSIP's publicly funded research are available to be
accessed, appreciated and augmented. Promoting the generation and availability
of publicly funded data and research tools is a key way to accomplish the
mission of the SciSIP program, which is to produce and provide high quality,
policy-relevant research to policymakers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
builds a platform that publicizes SciSIP research and makes data, tools and code
available for download. The objective is to facilitate scholarly exchanges
between SciSIP award recipients and foster intellectual exchange among funded
researchers of the SciSIP program and policy practitioners.
