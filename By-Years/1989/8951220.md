A micro-computer based laboratory is established in the Psychology Department of
Bowdoin College to enhance undergraduate's understanding of basic principles of
scientific research and their specific applications in psychology. Five micro-
computers and the hardware and software necessary to interface them with other
laboratory equipment (e.g., slide projectors, taperecorders) are being acquired.
The computers are used to control stimulus presentation and to collect responses
in studies conducted by students at three levels of expertise: (1) Students in
the introductory course use the computers to obtain "hands on" research
experience by conducting simple experiments that are coordinated with material
covered in lectures. (2) Students in each of the Department's three experimental
laboratory courses (Cognition, Language, and Research in Social Behavior) use
the computers to conduct an original, full-scale experiment that the students
design and carry out as a group. (3) Students doing senior honors projects and
other independent research projects use the laboratory equipment in their
advanced, original research projects. Use of the new equipment allows an
increase in the amount, quality, and variety of psychological research conducted
by students at Bowdoin. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal
amount of funds.
