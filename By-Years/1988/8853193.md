The aim of this project is to deal effectively with the most common complaint
about engineering graduates; their lack of communication skills. Traditional
public speaking and technical writing courses, although extremely valuable, are
not solving the problem. The written, oral and graphic communication skills of
engineering students at Clemson University are being improved through the
Effective Technical Communications (ETC) program which has the following
objectives: 1. Integrate technical communication exercises throughout the
engineering curriculum 2. Provide students with a condensed manual for written,
oral and graphic communications. 3. Provide modern equipment and techniques to
aid preparation and feedback. 4. Use communication exercises to enhance learning
of the technical material being presented. Planning began in 1982, and a team of
Engineering and English faculty completed the Effective Technical Communications
Manual 1986. An alumnus provided a $1.0 million endowment of a joint
English/Engineering chair in technical communications, the first such chair in
the nation. A pilot project involving 160 students began in Fall 1986, and
expanded to 300 students in Spring 1987. Selected technical courses include
written, oral and graphical exercises which are dual graded by engineering and
english faculty. In Fall 1987, the program was expanded to several courses
throughout the College of Engineering, and more that 600 students are involved.
In order to fully integrate the ETC program into the curriculum and serve the
3300 students in the College of Engineering, a special facility for preparing
written, oral and graphical communication materials will be necessary. The
facility will contain computers, laser printers, video equipment, and graphic
display/printers to enable students and faculty to utilize the latest techniques
in a technical communications. The ETC concept has been presented at several
national meetings and has generated inquires from more that 40 institutions. It
is a unique approach to a major problem.
