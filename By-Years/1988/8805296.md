The goal of this research is threefold: (1) to demonstrate the first
application of some recently developed fluorescence techniques for measuring
rates of specific surface binding reactions on intact biological membranes; (2)
to develop new optical systems for selective detection, bleaching or quenching
of surface fluorescence; and (3) to understand how specific and nonspecific
surface binding kinetic rates and possible surface diffusion may regulate
reaction speeds or molecular structures at membranes. Numerous biochemical
processes such as the binding of hormones to cell surface receptors, the
triggering of blood coagulation and the assembly/disassembly of submembrane
cytoskeletal structures occur at membrane surfaces. The proximity of the surface
can greatly affect these reactions, for example, by speeding or slowing
diffusion and by changing local concentrations and orientation. Fluorescence
techniques will be refined and used to answer specific outstanding questions
about the dynamic behavior of molecules embedded in or adsorbed to membranes.***
