The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of
Chemistry supports the research efforts of Professor Pradip K. Mascharak of the
University of California Santa Cruz in studying metal nitrosyl complexes as
exogenous NO donors that are activated with light. Such photoactive nitrosyl
complexes are employed to deliver NO to chemical, biological and cellular
targets on demand. Density functional theory (DFT) and TD-DFT calculations are
used in the smart design of metal (Fe, Mn, and Ru) nitrosyls. These
computational techniques are used to fine tune the ligand design so that the
complexes are sensitive to near infrared light (which is better for photodynamic
therapy). The nitrosyl-dye conjugates are used as "trackable NO donors" in
tracing NO delivery in cellular targets (malignant sites) and monitoring NO-
induced apoptosis (programmed cell death). In order to make the various
nitrosyls suitable for site-specific delivery of NO, the group incorporates the
metal complexes into different polymer matrices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitric
oxide (NO) is recognized as a key mediator in a variety of physiological and
pathological pathways such as blood pressure regulation, immune response,
neurotransmission, and cellular apoptosis. Typical systemic NO drugs (such as
glyceryl trinitrate) cannot be used for site-specific NO delivery because of the
inexorability of NO release from NO donors. The drug goes everywhere in the body
and NO is released via various enzymatic and non-enzymatic (such as pH and
temperature) pathways. Light, on the other hand, can control NO release from
proper NO donors in a cellular environment. This research project provides
insight into the design and synthesis of metal complexes that release NO in
response to specific stimuli (light). This goal-oriented project provides an
excellent opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students to participate in
research at the interface of chemistry and biology.
