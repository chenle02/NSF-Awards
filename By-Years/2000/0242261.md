The objective of this study is to explore buoyant decompression melting as a
mechanism for oceanic intraplate volcanism. 3D models will be used to explore
buoyant melting in 3D, the statistics of populations of volcanoes that nucleate
from small random initial disturbances in a broad, plate-scale mantle upwelling,
and the effects of shearing due to plate motion.
