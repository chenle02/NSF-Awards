Robinson&lt;br/&gt;1312419&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his
colleagues use asymptotic methods from stochastic analysis to provide a
comprehensive study of large investors in derivatives markets. The specific
goals are first to identify characteristics of both the investor and the market
that endogenously lead to large holdings, and second to determine the effects of
large positions on pricing, price impact, portfolio optimization, and risk
management. Because large positions induce extreme sensitivity to rare
unexpected events, the theory of Large Deviations is well suited for this
analysis. In particular, using Large Deviations in conjunction with utility-
based theory on optimal position sizes, the investigator studies when, if ever,
a risk-averse agent acting in an incomplete market should take a large position
in a non-traded risky asset. Regarding the issue of pricing and hedging, it is
well known that in incomplete markets investor preferences affect the price at
which one is willing to buy a claim. Typically, closed-form expressions for
utility based prices are unavailable and some approximation is necessary.
Existing approximations are only valid for small position sizes and thus large
holdings approximations provide a natural counterpart. In addition to
determining asymptotic prices, the investigator identifies the key components of
the investor's utility that drive such prices. Lastly, examples show that large
positions arise in conjunction with asymptotically complete markets: the
investigator thus seeks to extend this notion beyond the current one, which
focuses on weak convergence of asset price laws, to a more natural notion in
terms of the asymptotic ability to hedge. Once extended, questions regarding
continuity with respect to market completeness are
considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; From a rigorous mathematical perspective, the
investigator seeks to understand the rapid growth in over-the-counter
derivatives markets during the previous two decades. Given the complexity of
many of these products, it is not clear why a bank, or some other financial
institution, would wish to take on a large position in a claim, especially given
the lack of perfect hedging strategies or liquid markets. The investigator thus
studies when, if ever, a financial institution should own a significant notional
amount of a derivative contract. Additionally, given such a position, the
investigator aims to determine the impacts in terms of pricing, hedging, and
over-all risk that a financial institution faces.
