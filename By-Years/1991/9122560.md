Research in pion and electromagnetic physics will be undertaken. In pion
physics, principally at LAMPF, the first unambiguous measurements of the
isovector spin-flip strength at low pion energies and the first thorough
systematic study of the two- nucleon-emission component of pion absorption, as
well as systematic measurements of the total pion absorption cross sections will
be provided. Development efforts on the Clamshell spectrometer, the Scruncher,
and BGO ball facilities at LAMPF will be continued. The use of the LAMPF BGO
ball with the Mainz electron accelerator will be pursued to study hadron
production from deep inelastic electron scattering. Development efforts for a
detailed study of the pion beta decay process at PSI will continue, leading to
the first measurements with the device. Work on the design and construction of
the focal plane for the CEBAF photon tagger will continue. This activity is
related to an eta meson photoproduction experiment and a measurement of
photofission cross sections, both using the tagger.
