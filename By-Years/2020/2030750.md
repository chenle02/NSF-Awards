With vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic still months-to-years away, current
treatments for infected patients focus on anti-viral drugs. However, like many
viruses that cause serious morbidity and mortality, coronaviruses can mutate and
develop drug resistance. Effective treatment may require the availability of
multiple effective drugs. Thousands of drug candidates are available, but a
current bottleneck is drug testing, which entails virus growth in cell cultures,
a labor intensive, low sensitivity, and time-consuming process that can take up
to a week to perform. ThIs EAGER project exploits microscopic fluid flows in
cell and virus cultures to enhance sensitivity and speed, potentially reducing
test times to one day. The project aims to identify best conditions for testing
of drugs against the COVID-19 virus, which will expand opportunities to
effectively treat infected patients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gold standard for
testing anti-viral drugs is the plaque assay, which gives direct measures of
drug effect on the production and spread of infectious virus particles in the
cell culture. However, the plaque assay is labor-intensive, limited in
sensitivity for drug testing, and it can take a week to perform. As an
alternative, a team with expertise in virology and fluid dynamics will advance a
faster, more sensitive assay. The approach exploits flow-enhanced infection
spread and automated quantitative imaging, which they will optimize for
coronavirus drug testing. The technology exploits microscale flows that sweep
across infected cells, enhancing the spread of infection; in cell-culture wells,
radial flows spontaneously arise from enhanced evaporative cooling at the fluid
surface near the center of the each well, driving natural convection. The
project may enable a 10-to100-fold higher sensitivity in one-tenth the time for
testing drug candidates against COVID-19. Such accelerated testing could help
efficiently identify drugs that significantly reduce morbidity and mortality
from the ongoing pandemic and its possible re-
emergence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
