This is an investigation of a novel membrane reactor in which carbon monoxide
and hydrogen are catalytically converted into methanol. This is an important
reaction, for example, in the conversion of syngas to liquids. It is proposed
that under conditions of strong adsorption of the methanol on the membrane
surface, for a small enough pore size through the membrane, a surface diffusion
mechanism may dominate transport through the membrane and give a higher
permeability of methanol than one or more of the reactants. This expedited award
will allow the investigator to search for conditions under which methanol is
selectively passed by a ceramic membrane. A major economic impediment to more
widespread use of the technology to produce renewable fuels is that the
equilibrium constant is very small, resulting in very small conversions of
carbon monoxide to methanol per pass. To use a membrane reactor to improve
conversions by selectively removing methanol from the reaction mixture,
conditions must be found under which a ceramic membrane will selectively pass
the reaction product, methanol, out of the reactor, thus resulting in much
higher yields and much better economics.
