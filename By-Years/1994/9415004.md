9415004 Keyvan According to the NRC Regulatory Guide 1.133, any reactor licensed
since 1978 must have systems to detect loose parts and components with reactor
vessels and primary coolant systems. Early detection of loose parts in light
water reactors is important from both safety and economic point of view. Early
detection of loose parts can prevent extended outages, reduce downtime for
repair of damage caused by undetected parts, and could provide an indication of
degradation of reactor internals. The result of this research will provide a
methodology to better utilize acoustic signature for diagnostic purposes. In
case of nuclear plants, this will have significant positive impact on safety,
economic, and plant life extension for aging plants. The result of this research
will have two major positive impacts: 1) Effective acoustic signature analysis
for general diagnostic monitoring purpose, 2) Advancement of the loose part
monitoring process, which will in turn minimize operator error. ***
