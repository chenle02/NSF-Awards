Carbon-based fullerene compounds are being investigated by a range of physical
characterization techniques. These include electrical and microwave transport
measurements, magnetic susceptibility measurements and structural investigations
using synchrotron radiation. These measurements will enhance fundamental
understanding of the physical and structural features that underlie the
interesting superconducting and magnetic properties of these materials.
