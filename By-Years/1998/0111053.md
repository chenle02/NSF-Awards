The purpose of this investigation will be to determine the structural basis for
the maturation chemistry and fluorescent properties of three newly discovered
green fluorescent protein homologies (Fps) which emit red light (drFP583),
yellow light (zFP538) or are colored but not fluorescent (asFP595). The
objective is to discover the unique chemistry and three dimensional
configurations that lead to the fluorescence of these molecules. On the basis of
the understanding gained form this work, in the long term the properties of
these proteins will be improved for use as light emitting research tools for the
study of the development and dynamic behavior of living creatures on both the
subcellular and whole organism levels.

The general approach will include crystallographic, physicochemical and directed
mutagenesis studies. The relationships between the primary amino acid sequences
and the tertiary and quaternary structures will be determined by high resolution
X-ray crystallography. The roles of specific side chains in the maturation
chemistry will be determined by directed mutagenesis and analysis of the light
absorption and emission properties of the variants. Selected mutants will be
made in order to optimize emission color, state of oligomerization and molecular
response to external condition for use as visual indicators of solution
conditions (e.g. pH) in real time in living cells. The end result will be to
provide the research community with tools that report the timing of gene
expression, localization of gene products, and changes in cellular chemistry in
a noninvasive manner. For the most part, graduate students will gain training in
a number of interdisciplinary areas as this work proceeds.
