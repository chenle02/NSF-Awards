9555733 McCord Women's Images of Science (WISE) will provide undergraduate girls
and women with hands-on experiences in processes that demonstrate how scientists
and engineers make images of subatomic structures of various materials. The
students will learn with technology as opposed to learning about technology in
the areas of chemistry, biology, physics, and materials science imaging.
Participants will have the opportunity to construct accurate internal models of
atomic structures using active, hands-on interfaces as opposed to looking at
pictures or manipulating computer models. The lab activities will use household
and everyday objects that move the participant from the macro- to the micro- and
finally to the subatomic size range, instilling confidence in her ability to
measure, infer, and model these complex structures. Future science teachers,
middle- and high school teachers, and community college and university faculty
will gain experience, producing materials for their courses and having
opportunities to mentor young women and engage in peer dialog. Hands-on
experiences using technically sophisticated equipment will help students and K-
1 2 teachers learn more about the structure of matter. Participants in this
project will use telescopes, microscopes, and electron microscopes to examine
household items. Students and teachers will gain confidence in their ability to
measure and make subatomic models of these everyday objects. . . .
