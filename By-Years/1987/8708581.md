This proposal is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry,
broadly defined. During a ten week period between 1 June 1987 and 31 August
1987, five faculty members from colleges and universities that do not offer the
PhD degree in chemistry will carry out collaborative research in analytical
chemistry with faculty members from the Department of Chemistry of the
University of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK). Research participants from the
undergraduate institutions will be selected from applicants who respond to UTK's
announcement of the summer research program. This activity is analogous to the
support of undergraduate institution faculty through Research Opportunity Awards
(ROAs). In this case, however, participating faculty from the undergraduate
institutions will not have necessarily prearranged their summer research
activities with particular UTK faculty members. Rather, they will establish
their collaborative arrangements after they have had an opportunity to consider
fully all of the research programs of the host institution participating
faculty. In addition to the research activities of this program, UTK faculty and
scientists from nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory will present a series of
tutorials covering current resarch tools and topics that constitute modern
chemical analysis. Also, representatives from Federal and private sector funding
agencies that have strong commitments to the support of quality research
programs in undergraduate institutions will address the participants and
describe mechanisms whereby such support can be competitively sought. There is
strong indication that this type of activity can contribute significantly to the
infrastructure of the participants' home institutions as well as to the
infrastructure of the subdiscipline of analytical and surface chemistry.
