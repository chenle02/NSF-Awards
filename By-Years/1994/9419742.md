We request funds for growth chambers and a mass spectrometer to conduct isotopic
tracer studies of ecosystem processes. In variety of ecosystems including arctic
tundra, California grassland, tropical forests, and temperate and tropical
agricultural systems, we will be using 15N and 13C to study a carbon and
nitrogen fluxes through ecosystems. The research emphasizes the mechanisms of
interaction between carbon and micro-organisms, and the controls over trace gas
fluxes which are involved in greenhouse warming and climate change.
