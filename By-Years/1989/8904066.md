NMR spectroscopy can provide unique information about the changes in
concentration of metabolites in vivo and the structure of proteins in solution.
Interpretation of the large, multi- dimensional datasets produced by such
studies requires first the detection and quantification of peaks in individual
spectra. As new, sophisticated experimental techniques are developed, the
difficulties of peak quantificaition are providing major obstacles to efficient
data analysis. Standard methods of quantifying NMR spectra rely heavily on
manual input and do not address the all important questions of operator bias or
variable accuracy of parameter estimates. This project will develop practical
and reliable algorithms which can perform a thorough statistical analysis within
a reasonable timescale. The new algorithms will be based upon an approach which
has proved extremely successful in treating 1-D data with low s:n peaks and
variable baseline (PIQABLE). Different types of 1-D spectra, chemical shift
imaging (CSI) data, and both J-correlated and distance correlated 2-D H spectra
will be considered. By providing the right tools for quantitative analysis, this
study will make significant and unique contributions to interpreting multi-
nuclear in vivo spectra from extracts, cells or intact tissues, and
investigating the molecular structure of proteins in solution.
