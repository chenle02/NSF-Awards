This project is incorporating the computer algebra software Maple into the
existing calculus III, IV, and ordinary differential equations sequence. Eight
student compuers, two faculty computers, a color printer, a laptop and projector
for the classroom, and Maple software are being installed. The lecture structure
of the existing courses is also being altered to include laboratory components
and the standard syllabi of these courses are being altered where appropriate to
reflect Maple's influence.
