This is a study of structural determinants of race-sex labor market segregation
and earnings. It will analyze differences between race and gender groups in
their distribution across industrial and occupational segments and in the
rewards they received from these positions, using census data from 1980 and
1990. The work has three chief goals. First, it will describe the linkage of
rewards and allocation differentials, using an earnings decomposition analysis
which explicitly models the impact of the differential distribution of race-sex
groups across labor market positions. This structural decomposition measures the
extent to which earnings gaps among race-sex groups can be attributed to: (1)
group mean differences in characteristics; (2) group differences in returns to
characteristics, and (3) group differences in their distributions across work
positions that have varying rewards. The second goal is to assess the linkage of
allocation and rewards differentials using a causal model of their determinants
and their inter-relationship. A two-stage model will be used to test hypotheses
drawn from an integration of segmented market theory and race-sex queue theory.
Predictors include structural contexts and conditions of work, aspects of sex
and race-stereotyped work situations, and the population redistribution of the
work force across positions. The third objective is to update and disseminate
improved measures of contemporary industrial structure. %%% This project will
lead to an improved understanding of how race and gender affect the utilization
and financial reward of human capital in the United States. For example, it will
help us understand the extent to which the concentration of blacks and women in
low-paying jobs affects the average incomes of these groups, in contrast with
the underpayment of these groups in the same jobs held by whites and males. In
addition, the research will clarify the extent to which both individuals and the
nation suffer from the under-utilizatio n of the skills and abilities of many
Americans.
