Variegated and multifaceted shapes fill our world. Currently, there is no
universally accepted vocabulary for shape analysis which inhibits the emergence
and deployment of shape comparison technologies. This project draws its
inspiration from an old idea usually attributed to Christiaan Huygens: when
waves (usually represented as complex exponentials) emanate orthogonally from
each point on the shape boundary, they travel in open space until they meet
other waves emanating from different shape boundary locations. Each point in
space is then "owned" by a wavefront thereby giving rise to the complex wave
representation (CWR) of shape. When shape alignment is required (usually as part
of a larger shape recognition goal), the CWRs of the two shapes can be more
robustly aligned than the original shapes, since in the CWR, every point in
space (in a bounded region) now carries an imprint of the shape. Shape analysis
often raises the need for performing shape statistics: shape averages (usually
referred to as shape atlases) and deviations from the mean are required. Shape
statistics carried out in the CWR are arguably simpler since the vocabulary
shifts to averages and standard deviations of frequencies (of the waves in the
shape representation) which is rather straightforward. The significance of this
work lies in the introduction of complex wave representations into the shape
analysis lexicon. This research is expected to impact all areas of shape
representation and analysis: the matching, registration, indexing and
recognition of shapes with open source code dissemination facilitating re-use
and vertical integration.
