This research will characterize the structural forms, substrate specificities,
enzyme reaction kinetics, and catalytic mechanisms of action of a group of
extracellular lignin peroxidases produced by ligninolytic Streptomyces species.
It is also intended to express and amplify expression of the lignin-induced
peroxidase of Streptomyces viridosporus by gene cloning in order to better
define the role of this lignin oxidizing enzyme in lignin degradation and
solubilization. The lignin-induced peroxidase gene of S. viridosporus will also
be compared for sequence homologies with the lignin peroxidase gene of
Phanerochaete chrysosporium using gene probes. This research will increase
scientific understanding of how plant residues are decomposed by microorganisms.
Ultimately, the knowledge gained will lead to the development of economically
viable technologies by which plant residues can be used to produce useful
chemicals biologically, and to new technologies for carrying out industrial
processes such as paper and chemical production using less energy and producing
less toxic chemical wastes as by-products. In turn, the research can, therefore,
lead to a less energy intensive industry in the United States, which will help
to reduce our dependence on the burning of fossil fuels, a major source of the
carbon dioxide which is creating the greenhouse effect and undesirable warming
of the Earth.
