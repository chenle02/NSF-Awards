NSF Proposal: ATM-9631219 Title: "Open-path FTIR Measurement of Biomass Burning
Emissions" PI: Robert Yokelson, University of Montana, Department of Chemistry
Abstract Biomass burning injects significant amounts of trace gases into the
regional and global atmosphere. Most of the chemical species emitted by biomass
fires are sufficiently reactive and are not well-mixed in the atmosphere. In
addition, fire emissions and emissions-processing of smoke plumes vary
considerably at different stages of biomass combustion within a single fire
event, and also, for distinct types of biomass vegetation. This project focuses
on emissions characterization of smoke using an open path fourier transform
infrared instrument (OP-FTIR) to measure trace gas chemical species. The OP-FTIR
spectroscopic instrument will operate in the fire research laboratory at the
University of Montana and will measure gaseous products from fuel-specific
biomass fires. The instrument will be modified and tested for deployment on
aircraft platforms and for ground-based studies of large-scale biomass fires.
The OP-FTIR spectroscopic measurement technique will improve emissions estimates
of trace gases due to biomass fires, and will expand the range of chemical
compounds that are identified and measured in smoke. ATM-9631219
