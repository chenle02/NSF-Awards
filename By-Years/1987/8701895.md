This research program consists of a number of research projects generally
connected to the central theme of multi- phase flow and material science.
Specific projects conducted by the six faculty members involved include
sedimentation of solid spheres in a viscous fluid, hydrodynamics dispersion and
inertial effects in sedimentation, phase transition in solids, self-diffusion
and bulk diffusion of Brownian particles, computational method for flows with
suspended particles, etc. The research results are expected to find applications
in air and water pollution problems, blood flow problems and oil extraction and
purification problems.
