This project explores the preservation of the Hamiltonian structure of Vlasov-
Maxwell equations in a numerical method. The fundamental aspects of applying
spectral type methods to infinite dimensional Hamiltonian systems so that the
resulting semi-discrete (continuous in time) system exactly preserves the system
Hamiltonian and some other conservation laws are being investigated. A
functional approximation operator is defined to map the true infinite
dimensional phase space to a finite dimensional numerical approximation, and an
imbedding operator is defined to map this numerical phase space back to the
exact phase space. Together these operators allow the Poisson bracket on the
infinite dimensional phase space to be transferred to the numerical phase space;
Hamiltonian dynamics can then be defined on the numerical phase space using a
numerical approximation to the exact Hamiltonian. The resulting finite
dimensional Hamiltonian system represents a semi-discrete numerical method that
exactly conserves the system energy. Conditions necessary for the numerical
conservation of Casimirs and momenta are also being derived. These techniques
are also being extended to Hamiltonian systems which are not isolated and allow
general boundary conditions. The application of these techniques to the Vlasov-
Maxwell equations will allow numerical plasma kinetic theory models which
exactly conserve energy, particles and momentum, even at a finite expansion in
space, velocity and time.
