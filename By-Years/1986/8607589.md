Equipment regarded as essential to the fundamental understanding of the
interactions among recombinant DNA molecules, host cells, and bioreactor
operating conditions is purchased. To conduct research on these interactions, it
is important to possess the capability for constructing the recombinant DNA
molecules of interest and for studying cells which harbor these recombinant DNA
molecules of interest and for studying cells which harbor these recombinant DNA
molecules (plasmids). This equipment will be empolyed in several research
projects, including the genetic engineering of subtrate utilization
capabilities, studies on the secretion of cloned-gene products from genetically
altered cells, investigations of plasmid stability and copy number control, and
research on the induction kinetics and efficiencies of regulated promoters. In
each of these projects, plasmids not presently available need to be constructed.
