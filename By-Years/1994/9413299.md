9413299 Garvine This two-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in
coastal oceanography between two research teams led by Richard W. Garvine,
University of Delaware, and A.E. Hill at the School of Ocean Sciences,
University of Wales. The objective of the research is to directly observe, using
free-drifting buoys, the flow regime of baroclinic gyres (or spirals) in shelf
seas which form in spring/summer each year. These gyres are produced in
topographical depressions by differing amounts of tidal mixing between the
shallow edges and deep center of the depressions. Though a newly discovered
phenomenon, seasonal baroclinic gyres appear to have important ecological
consequences for dispersal of contaminants in coastal waters, on retention of
planktonic larvae, and on the nature of shelf sea circulation. The researchers
will conduct joint field observations of seasonal baroclinic gyres off the coast
of Scotland and then apply a series of modeling studies to the observational
data. The United Kingdom will provide ship time on the research vessel RRS
Challenger. By combining the modeling capabilities and observational resources
of the two research groups, especially in satellite-tracked drifters, the
researchers will obtain optimal coverage and resolution of shelf sea
circulation.
