This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
from the University of California-Davis. The student will study the night
markets in Taiwan, a local institution of street markets providing inexpensive
prepared foods and consumer items to urban residents. The project will study the
history of the markets and the role of government regulations on their behavior,
as well as the meaning of the markets in the lives of urban residents. It is a
study in the "informal economy" of a dynamic and productive society. Methods
include surveys of the markets, intensive interviews with marketers on their
life histories, examination of historical documents, and survey interviews with
marketers and customers. This project is important because the informal sector
of developing economies is not well understood, and this case study of a dynamic
informal market institution in a growing economy will help build theory on how
to achieve and sustain economic development while providing a high level of
consumer service to urban residents.
