With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professors Seiichi P.
Matsuda, Ronald J. Parry and colleagues from the Department of Chemistry at
William Marsh Rice University will upgrade a 200 and a 500 MHz NMR
spectrometers, both of which will have solid state capabilities. The instrument
will be used to support research activities such as: 1) studies of the structure
and reactivity of transition metals in organic chemistry; 2) analysis of the
structures of complex nano and composite materials; 3) use of NMR techniques to
understand and manage the Earth's carbon cycle; 4) biosynthetic studies of
biologically active natural products; 5) investigations of graphene nanoribbons
and derivatives; and 6) analysis of organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solids and in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic/inorganic chemistry, materials and biochemistry.
