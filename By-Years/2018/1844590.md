This research activity is an interagency agreement between NSF and the
Department of Energy to support the NSF's National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR). The Cooperative Agreement to analyze variability, change and
predictability in the earth System (CATALYST)represents a sustained commitment
by the Department of Energy and the University Corporation for Atmospheric
Research (UCAR) to perform foundational research toward advancing a robust
understanding of modes of variability and change using models, observations and
process studies. Fundamental science themes maintain continuity with the
previous cooperative agreements, and include assessment of externally forced
changes in the earth system over multiple time and spatial scales, advancing
understanding of predictability and variability, and enhancement of fundamental
process understanding.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
