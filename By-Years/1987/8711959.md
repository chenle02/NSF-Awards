A microchannel plate delay line X-ray detector system will be developed. These
detectors will have high accuracy, high resolution, large area, and large count
rate capability. The detectors would be ideal for measurements on protein
crystals with very large unit cells, and will be well suited for multiwavelength
anomalous dispersion measurements. The detector will consist of a thin X-ray
scintillator, a semi- transparent photocathode, a pair of microchannel plates,
and orthogonal delay line anodes. Delay line readout of large size microchannel
plates will be studied, and different plates will be compared. The detector
system, once developed, will enhance efforts in structural biology.
