The goal of this project is to bring together expertise in geometrical
modeling, numerical analysis, large scale computing, and scientific
visualization applied to problems in medicine---computational interactively
investigate bioelectric fields and provide the ability to design bioelectric
devices. Every year, 500,000 people die suddenly due to abnormalities in their
heart's electrical system (cardiac arrhythmias) and/or coronary artery disease.
Traditional electrograms (ECGs) show damage that already has occurred in the
heart; consequently physicians currently treat many life- threatening disorders
of the heart's rhythm after they occur. This project seeks to equip physicians
with a noninvasive and accurate means of determining the changes within the
heart's electrical system that signal the onset of disease much earlier and
allow them to treat the disease prior to significant damage to the heart. To
accommodate efficient design and optimization, a computational steering package
is developed which allows the user to design bioelectric devices and measure
their effectiveness in an interactive graphical environment. Using interactive
graphical input devices, engineers are able to design devices, place them
directly into the computer model, and automatically change parameters and
boundary conditions as well as the mesh discretization level needed for an
accurate finite element solution. Instead of the typical simulation mode --
manually setting input parameters, computing results, storing data off to disk,
visualizing the results via a separate visualization package, then starting
again at the beginning -- software is developed to ``close the loop'' and allow
the visualization to help guide (steer) the design and computation phases of the
simulation. Not only are specific results on bioelectric field problems
significant, but this general approach is applicable to many other engineering
and scientific problems, and the computational infrastructure developed is
broadly useful to many other researchers.
