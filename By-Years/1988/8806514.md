This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program concerns
development and application of methods for carrying out calculations on
dynamical chemical processes. In particular, three body chemical reactions, both
gas phase and recombination on surfaces, and low energy collisions of atoms and
molecules with surfaces will be studied. New computational algorithms utilizing
multi-dimensional discrete variable representations will be developed for the
above studies. Other applications will include the description of vibration-
rotation states of polyatomic molecules, isomerization, photodissociation
dynamics, three body chemical reactions, and mixed quantum and "bath" stochastic
or classical dynamics.
