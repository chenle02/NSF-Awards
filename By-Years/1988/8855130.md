The Oregon Museum of Science and industry will conduct a summer program where
20 students will participate as members of one of two research teams, working
alongside professional researchers: (1) The Paleontological Research Team,
directed by paleobotanist, Dr. Steven Manchester will collect Eocene fossils
from lake deposits near Hancock and compare them to lake deposits found at other
sites in the Northwest. (2) The High Desert Stream Ecology Research Team will
systematically sample water temperatures, species composition and diversity of
fish, invertebrates and streamside vegetation in tributaries of the John Day
River under the direction of Dr. Hiram W. Li, fishery biologist, and Judy Li and
Dr. Gary Lamberti, aquatic entomologists. Both research teams will Hancock Field
Station as a base of operations from July 10 until August 25, 1989. Laboratories
at Oregon State University and facilities of the Burke Museum of Natural History
at the University of Washington will also be used. Activities will expose
students to the methods, philosophy, and ethical issues relevant to
paleontology, aquatic biology and related fields. Participants from both teams
will present a seminar for one another on their research. Each participant will
conduct an independent project.
