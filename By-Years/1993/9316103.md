9316103 Molnar This project involves a multi-disciplinary study of
intracontinental deformation in the Tien Shan mountains in Kyrgystan and
Khazakhstan which is aimed at testing the connection or degree of coupling
between the brittle upper crustal deformation and mantle dynamics. To this end
the principal investigators plan to collect data on both the kinematics of the
upper crust and the deep structure. Both instantaneous (earthquake and GPS
measurements) and Cenozoic deformation will be constrained to compare with lower
crust and upper mantle structure (from seismic and magnetotelluric
measurements). The principal investigators have decided to adopt a phased
approach to the study in order to answer some preliminary questions about field
conditions and data availability which might have a bearing on the design of the
full experiment. The first phase will consist of a combined field trip/workshop
in the summer of 1994. Information gathered during this workshop/field trip will
be valuable in its own right and will be invaluable in the design of future
studies of this region. ***
