One of the major goals of the undergraduate laboratory curriculum is to
graduate physics majors who are familiar with modern instrumentation and
computer interfacing of this instrumentation so that they are prepared to enter
a modern industrial or academic research laboratory. Students are required to
take a course in computer control and computer acquisition and analysis of data.
Modern instrumentation is required in the advanced undergraduate laboratory so
that we may build on the training students have received in this course. This
project funds the second stage of an upgrading of the advanced undergraduate
laboratory. It adds two contemporary, condensed-matter experiments with
computer-interfaced instrumentation: the two-dimensional integer quantum Hall
effect and the Josephson effects. The instrumentation includes a packaged 5
Tesla magnet with a computer controlled power supply, a dewar with a level
detector, and associated instrumentation and equipment. Information on
experiments set up under this project and their evaluation and student response
to them can be disseminated and can include a presentation of the 2D Hall effect
and a dual instructor/student manual.
