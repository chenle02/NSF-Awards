This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is in the
general area of of analytical and surface chemistry. It builds upon the
successes realized during the conduct of the Phase 1 project. The long range
scientific goals of this research are to develop methods of analysis of real
world samples, to make improvements in the instrumentation, and to determine the
limits of instrument performance using well characterized test samples. Neutron
activation of elements produces radionuclides. Characteristic gamma-rays
associated with the radionuclide disintegrations can be measured with germanium
detectors. Secondary electrons produced at the surface of a thin sample as a
beta-particle exits the sample can be accelerated and imaged. When these gamma-
rays and beta-particles are detected in coincidence, the gamma-ray answers the
question "what" and the secondary electron answers the question "where" for an
individual radionuclide disintegration. This information can be organized into
element maps and local area gamma-rays spectra. %%% This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will continue the efforts initially
started during the Phase 1 project. An important goal of the SBIR Program is the
ultimate conversion of NSF-supported research into technological innovation and
commercial application.
