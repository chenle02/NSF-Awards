This project aims to help with the preparation of three of the projected five
volumes of the New Flora of Chile and a database of Chilean plants. This is a
cooperative project among the University of Concepcion, Chile, the Missouri
Botanical Garden, The Ohio State University, the University of Reading, England,
and the University of Munich. More the 50 international specialists in various
plant groups are already participating in this project. The finished work will
be the first complete modern Flora for any country in South America, and will
stimulate both basic and applied research in Chile and other parts of South
America, as well as serving as an important reference for ongoing work in other
countries. This Flora will also allow informed management of Chile's natural
resources, and with the database will serve as test model for preparation of
other country-wide Floras. About 49% of the native flora of Chile is endemic to
that country, a high proportion more typical of oceanic islands than continental
areas. This highly unusual native flora is not will known, but at the same time
is under severe pressure from habitat destruction in response to economic
pressures, particularly export logging and agriculture. Study and management of
the cooperation is necessary to allow Chile to complete an inventory of its
flora in the time available.
