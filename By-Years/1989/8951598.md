This project provides the chemistry department at the College of St. Thomas
with a Fourier Transform Infrred (FTIR) spectrometer that improves laboratory
instruction in Chemistry (for non-science majors), Organic Chemistry,
Instrumental Methoda, Physical Chemistry, and Advanced Organic Chemistry.
Integration of FTIR methods into the laboratory curriculum inhances the student
understanding of (a) the fundamentals of FTIR, (b) the utilitazation of FTIR for
qualitative and quantitative analysis of chemical systems, (c) how a pwerful and
sensitive analytical provides a wide range of applications in science, and (d)
how the capabilities of an instrumental method are significantly enhanced when
interfaced with microcomputer. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an
equal amount of funds.
