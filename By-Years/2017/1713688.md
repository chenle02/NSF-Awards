The broader impact/commercial potential of this technology is to advance the
performance of the common bandage with low-cost production of a bandage that
actively facilitates wound healing. The typical bandage wound dressing provides
physical protection, but does not actively participate in wound healing.
Additives that might actively facilitate wound healing can add prohibitive cost
to an inexpensive device. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), are sulfated
polysaccharides that are ubiquitously present in the extracellular matrix of
mammals. GAGs have been shown to facilitate wound healing, but because of the
high cost of animal extraction, they are not used in low cost wound healing
applications. The proposed technology utilizes sulfated cellulose as low cost
GAG-mimics. The low cost of these mimics allows them to be used in bandages that
will reduce healing time and reduce scaring. These GAG-mimics may also be useful
in reducing the costs of more complex devices such as dermal regenerations,
constructs for burn wounds, and dressings for decubitus ulcers, and diabetic
wounds.

This I-CORPS project is based on results of research designed to investigate the
use of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) mimics in the development of tissue engineering
scaffolds as extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics for cartilage regeneration. GAGs
are present in nearly every tissue in the body, and they play an important role
in stabilizing important cell signaling proteins and presenting those signal
molecules to cell receptors. Sulfated cellulose based GAG mimics were identified
based on the similarity in molecular structure between the native GAGs and the
sulfated cellulose. It was demonstrated that the biological activity of sulfated
cellulose mimicked the biological activity of native GAGs.
