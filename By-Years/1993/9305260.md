9305260 BASS, Jay D. This is a program of measuring acoustic velocities and,
hence, elastic moduli of minerals and high-pressure silicates of geophysical
interest by Brillouin light scattering experiments. The main thrust will be
measurement of velocities and elastic moduli at high pressures in diamond cells,
and at high temperatures. The high P - T studies will emphasize minerals which
are important to the Earths mantle. These experiments will yield the pressure
and temperature derivatives of elastic properties, and will allow the properties
of mineral assemblages to be calculated for actual conditions within the Earth
with much greater confidence.
