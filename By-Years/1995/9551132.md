Laboratory for Upper Division Mathematics Classes The mathematics faculty of the
University of Redlands is converting its Pre-Calculus, Probability Theory,
Mathematical Statistics, Numerical Analysis, College Geometry, and Number Theory
courses from lecture courses to laboratory courses featuring discovery-based
learning. A new course, Introduction to Mathematical Modeling, also uses a
discovery-based approach. The primary discovery tool for each of these courses
is the computer. This projects equips each of the classrooms in which these
courses are taught with one PowerMacintosh 7100/66AV computer for each two
students. The Redlands project reflects its faculty's belief, shared by
mathematics educators nationwide, that students learn best by actively
discovering and exploring mathematical concepts. The computer allows students to
visualize and explore complex models and data sets not tractable using more
traditional algebraic or analytic approaches.
