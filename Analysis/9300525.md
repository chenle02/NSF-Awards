MacCluer will continue her research on several problems which lie at the
interface of operator theory and function theory, involving composition
operators on analytic function spaces. Identification of the spectrum of a
composition operator acting on a Hilbert space of analytic functions on the unit
ball in C^n will be of particular concern. Ross will study the invariant
subspaces of Bergman spaces on certain slit domains and investigate the
relationship between the geometry of the slit and the behavior of the functions
near the slit. Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the
infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices. In particular, when restricted
to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has the usual linear properties,
and thus can be represented by a matrix. The central problem in operator theory
is to classify operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of
associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the underlying space.
Operator theory underlies much of mathematics, and many of the applications of
mathematics to other sciences.
