Boston Museum of Science seeks funds from the National Science Foundation fort
the development of a group of interactive exhibits and educational programs that
will comprise the Museum's permanent TESTING THE THEORY activity center. The
project is part of a new approach to exhibits that aims to make the experiences
available to visitors closer to the actual process of scientific discovery.
Visitors will carry out experiments in fields ranging from chemistry and
cognitive psychology, to statistics, optics, and materials science. The focus
will be on promoting specific experimental skills and scientific habits of mind,
and on encouraging the transfer of these skills to everyday activities. The
exhibit techniques developed during the prototyping and production of TESTING
THE THEORY are expected to be of importance to science museums and others
concerned with increasing science literacy. ***
