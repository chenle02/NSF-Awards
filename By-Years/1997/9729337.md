The award supports a seminar with a special focus on Multimedia Technologies for
Collaborative Design and Manufacturing. The workshop will focus on the
multimedia-based information technologies and collaborative tools in design,
manufacturing processes, service/maintenance, and infrastructure. The objectives
of this special seminar are to: (1) understand the impact of information
technologies and collaborative tools for product development; and (2) develop
new system concepts on integrated design, manufacturing, and maintenance/service
system framework for improved research direction and intellectually integrated
research activities. The outcomes of the workshop could provide the research
community with very valuable information about opportunities and directions of
integrated design, manufacturing, maintenance/service engineering.
