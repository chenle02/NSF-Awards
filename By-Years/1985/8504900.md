Surveying and mapping principles are basic sciences of measurements for numerous
engineering disciplines. Considerable studies have been made in the ability to
collect, store, analyze, disseminate, and graphically display large amounts of
land-related data. This project will investigate the various applications and
additional research areas which will increase and enhance the use of land
information systems by the civil engineering research community, local
governments, and private industry. The workshop participants will study the
evolving technology in the broadest sense to determine the current use and the
needed future research solutions. The proceedings will be of great benefit to
the country at large.
