This workshop proposal is of high importance to raise awareness of latest
advances in breast cancer research and advance more integrated research across
disciplines and among interested individuals in this field such as medicine,
engineering, and nano-technology. The PIs are well qualified to plan and
implement this workshop at a high level of proficiency and professionalism.
&lt;br/&gt;The plan for the workshop is well organized and thought of including
guest speakers, and activities with keynote speakers. This would be more
rigorous than the current plan. The workshop outcomes are very comprehensive and
well presented, with evaluation plan to cover outcomes as well as integrating
diverse research ideas and approaches to advance breast cancer research.
