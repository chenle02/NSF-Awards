With the rise of complexity of the modern state, it has become increasingly
obvious that better methods of administration are needed. Not only must the
bureaucracy become more efficient, but the implications of government policies
must be analyzed. In contrast to the practice in the United States where
decisions on policy and the use of social sciences in reaching these decisions
have been made on an ad hoc basis, several European countries have given the
scientific study of government administration and policy enactment a special
position. France, for example, has established a special academy for the study
of administration. France's current socialist prime minister and his immediate
conservative predecessor along with a large proportion of their cabinets are
graduates of this academy. In Germany, a special science called the "sciences of
state" (Staatswissenschaften) was established to address the administrative
problems of the modern state. This science has no counterpart elsewhere and
includes aspects of economics, statistics, politics, public administration,
public law, public finance, agriculture, forestry, mining, and "technology."
This grouping of disciplines originated in the 18th century as a curriculum to
train state officials in the administration and reform of society. Dr.
Lindenfeld will trace what happened in the 19th century as these disciplines
became re-defined with changing political and economic conditions. In order to
carry out this study, he will analyze published sources (journals, textbooks,
monographs), comprehensively survey listings of "Staatswissenschaften" in German
university catalogs between 1820 and 1914, examine ministerial and university
archives, and look at individual correspondence of leading proponents of the
field. The results will provide several case studies on the value of such a
practically oriented field for the organization and operation of a modern state
and provide a valuable contrast to the American "system" of ad hoc reforms of
administration. This study will also contribute to our knowledge of German
history where the issue of German attitudes towards modernization and modernity
is still debated.
