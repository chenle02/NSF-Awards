An accurate and continuous chronology does not exist for the loess and tephra
overlying the 140ka-old Old Crow tephra and underlying the oldest C-14 dated (ca
35ka) beds in central Alaska. The relevant stratigraphic units (Goldstream
Formation and equivalent loess, and underlying upper Gold Hill Loess) are
dominantly loess with interbedded discontinuous tephra and some organic layers.
The lack of accurate deposition ages for these sediments in the time period ca.
30-140ka makes interpretation of the local and regional paleoenvironmental and
paleontological records ambiguous. This proposal therefore seeks to develop the
first firm chronology for these sediments in this time range by
thermoluminescence (TL) dating of the widespread loess and occasional
interbedded tephra from 5 sites near Fairbanks. Additional laboratory equipment
is also requested to permit the efficient execution of this and other TL dating
projects in this laboratory. This research will demonstrate the reliability of
TL dating and obtain TL dates of Holocene and Wisconsin loess and tephra in a
key geologic area of Alaska.
