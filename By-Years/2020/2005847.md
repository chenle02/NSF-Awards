This award supports participation in a series of three weekend conferences in
arithmetic geometry and number theory over three years (tentatively scheduled at
the University of Illinois at Chicago, November 7-8, 2020; the University of
Michigan, October 9-10, 2021; and the Ohio State University, October 22-23,
2022). This series, titled "Midwest Arithmetic Geometry and Number Theory Series
(MAGNTS)" aims to bring together the researchers of the Midwest universities at
various career stages. More information about the 2019 conference can be found
at magnts.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each conference will have several
components. Two mini-courses (approximately three hours each) by established
researchers in number theory or arithmetic geometry will be followed by two
research presentations (one hour each) by mid-career researchers in areas
related to the mini-courses. The participants will get a chance to present their
own research during a poster session, and there will be a career panel featuring
people from various career paths, including academia, industry, and government
positions. Through this setup, the conferences aim to expose the participants to
cutting-edge research areas, as well as to provide an opportunity to explore
various career options while networking with others of similar mathematical
backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
