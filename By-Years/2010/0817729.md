Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of mind and intelligence. Since
its birth around 1960, cognitive science has produced an extensive body of
principles, representations, and algorithms, as well as many successful
applications. This research discipline is advancing rapidly in much of the
world, with some surprising exceptions, including China. A workshop will be held
in China to report and discuss cognitive science research on topics ranging from
cellular circuitry to computational cognition. The workshop has several related
aims: (1) promote interchanges within and between countries across multiple sub-
disciplines of cognitive science that investigate cognition at different levels
and using different tools, (2) disseminate quantitative methods, successes, and
the interdisciplinary nature of cognitive science, and (3) establish channels
for collaborative research and initiate exchange programs for training the next
generation of cognitive scientists. This will be the first workshop/conference
on cognitive science in China that brings researchers from a broad spectrum of
distinct but connected sub-disciplines together to seek cross-disciplinary
interactions and collaborations and joint training programs for graduate
students.
