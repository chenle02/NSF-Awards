9604398 Estelle The long-term goal of the proposed work is to understand plant
growth and development as they are regulated by the hormone, auxin.
Specifically, the work focuses on auxin transport mechanisms and the regulation
of auxin movement through the plant. A large number of Arabidopsis mutants with
defective or altered auxin distribution and transport characteristics are
available. The proposal is based on the order of mutants at different points in
the transport process, as revealed by altered responses to inhibitors of auxin
transport - several mutants will be characterized beyond the effects they have
on cell, tissue, and organ morphology and development. The proposed experiments
include biochemical studies to gauge auxin binding, and measurements of auxin
(IAA) transport and distribution. Also included is the analysis of known auxin-
regulated genes in the mutants. Finally, the microscopic analysis of the
expression of several of the transcripts and proteins that have been mutated
will be analyzed and additional genes will be cloned. The proposed work
represents a large body of work - the goals are selected to provide a complete
picture of the movement of auxin from the shoot meristem to root cells in
plants.
