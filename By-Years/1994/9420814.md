This project involves a summer institute in comparative anthropological
research. The institutes will be supported for 3 years at the Claremont college
in California. Building upon a previous 3-year series of summer institutes, the
purpose is to teach the state-of-the-art in comparative and cross-cultural
research to professional academic anthropologists and other social scientists.
Issues to be taught include primary data comparisons, within-region versus
world-wide comparative research designs, and comparisons where the historical
period varies versus comparisons within one time. Preference is given to
applicants with the Ph.D. who teach research methods to graduate students or
undergraduates in the US. This institute is an important resource for advancing
our technical capacity to study and explain the variation in culture in the
world.
