9501212 Baneyx This project is on research to evaluate methods to facilitate the
production of aggregation-prone recombinant proteins in soluble form in E, coli.
This project includes studies to determine: (1) the effect of global
deregulation of the heat-shock response using two different mutations; (2) the
role of the ibp gene products on aggregation and whether they serve as
chaperones; and (3) any synergistic effects of the various mutations. In
addition to this research activity, the investigator will enhance education by
developing a new course in advanced biotechnology. Also, the investigator has
recently developed a textbook for use in genetic engineering laboratory courses.
