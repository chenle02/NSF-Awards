9422896 Arnold This Small Grant for Exploratory Research award will develop and
implement several new physical mapping algorithms on parallel computing
architectures. Ordering clones from a genomic library into physical maps of
whole chromosomes present a central computational/statistical problem in
genetics and is providing fundamental insights into development, gene
organization, chromosome structure, and recombination. This team will
investigate several strategies for parallelization of these algorithms (i.e.,
random costs, neural networks, simulated annealing) on various parallel
architechtures in order to (i) improve map quality, (ii) develop new
computational intensive tools for assessing map reliability by bootstrap
resampling, and (iii) assess the benefits of using a parallel computing device
as a network server for constructing physical maps. ***
