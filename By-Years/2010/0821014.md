0821014&lt;br/&gt;Murray&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant will support acquisition of quadrupole
detection inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (quad-ICP-MS) and an ion
chromatograph to support research in low temperature environmental geochemistry.
The instruments will a support a range of faculty and student research at the
University of Michigan ? Dearborn, a non-Ph.D. granting institution, with a
central theme on investigation of industrial pollutant heavy metal contamination
of water, soils and sediments in the Detroit metropolitan area. Examples include
studies of particle size affinity and redox sensitivity of mineral-trace metal
interactions in regional industry impacted rivers; studies of trace metal source
and concentrations in local precipitation; and investigation of trace metal-
plant interactions in order to evaluate the bioremedial potential of various
plant species. The equipment will support an M.S. and undergraduate program in
Environmental Science with a focus on urban surface and groundwater trace metal
geochemistry and bioremediation strategies. UM-D is currently funded by NSF/GEO
for K-12 outreach to the diverse student body in the Detroit metro region. The
instruments to be acquired will complement that program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
