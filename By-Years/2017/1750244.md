Many drugs are molecules that target proteins. This project will establish an
approach to create leads for new drugs by identifying molecules that will
inhibit the target protein, then identifying enzymes that can produce this
inhibitor. The initial targets will be relevant to the treatment of diabetes,
obesity, and cancer. The technology developed in this project will accelerate
the rate and lower the cost of drug development by enabling the rapid discovery
and biological synthesis of the drug molecule. A summer biotechnology training
program for high school students currently underrepresented in STEM will
contribute to the development of a highly-skilled workforce, and a core facility
for teaching and research on inhibitor identification and production will
further enhance drug development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project represents a
significant departure from contemporary efforts to use microbial systems for the
synthesis of clinically approved drugs and their precursors. We will carry out a
detailed study of the molecular basis and thermodynamic origin of affinity and
activity. The structure-affinity and structure-activity relationships formulated
will be exploited to develop experimental and computational methods for the
evolution of high-affinity leads. This will result in a general framework for
assessing the structural limits of functional compatibility between enzymes
(i.e., their ability to synthesize, functionalize, and/or bind similar
molecules), and for working within those limits to build new inhibitors. The
ultimate goal is to validate the approach of screening metabolic pathways to
produce molecules with targeted biological activities rather than targeted
structures. If successful, this project could yield a general and low-cost
approach for using synthetic biology to replace synthetic chemistry in lead
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
