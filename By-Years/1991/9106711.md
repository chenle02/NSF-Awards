Shelah's classification theory assigns to each "classifiable" structure a
system of homogeneous combinatorial geometries, represented by regular types.
One of the fundamental ideas of geometric stability theory is a trichotomy
between geometries of combinatorial, linear, and geometric type. A satisfying
structure theory exists in the linear domain, for the geometries themselves and
the structures they coordinatize. The regular types of the third type are very
poorly understood; until recently they were believed to consist entirely of
algebraic geometry objects (in finite rank), but a series of constructions has
shown the class to be much larger. The research undertaken here will attempt to
create a map of the nonlinear strongly minimal sets. One goal is Cherlin's
conjecture, that aleph-one- categorical groups are simple algebraic groups over
algebraically closed fields. In another direction, there are indications that
the geometric trichotomy is valid beyond the existing borders of stability
theory. The investigator hopes to extend these borders, creating a theory of
forking, regular types, and the parallel of the linear theory, for a class of
structures that includes all the classical geometries (projective, unitary,
orthogonal, symplectic) among its (linear) regular types. This would have
applications to pseudo-finite structures and possible interactions with finite
group theory. One of the remarkable things about this research area is that it
shows that a great deal of information about algebraic structures can be
obtained from intensive study of the mathematical language in which one deals
with them. Shelah, Hrushovski, and others have pushed this model-theoretic
approach much further in recent years than most people previously thought
possible.
