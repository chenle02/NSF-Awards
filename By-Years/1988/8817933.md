This research will rely heavily on the use of (supercomputer) numerical as well
as analytic techniques to study the properties of homogeneous and inhomogeneous
superconductors. The theoretical techniques include: Quantum Monte Carlo
simulations, renormalization group theory, dynamical systems theory, many body
theory, path integral methods and any other theoretical approach that may be
deemed necessary to unravel the physics of interest. The problems to be
considered motivate and are motivated directly by experimental findings in low
and high temperature superconductors. Specifically, the effects of quantum zero
point fluctuations, magnetic fields, dissipation and disorder in arrays of
ultrasmall superconductor networks. Also, we propose to carry out a direct
comparison of the physical sources of metastability in the magnetic properties
predicted to appear in artificially fabricated random arrays of Josephson
junctions and those found in the novel high temperature oxide superconductors.
The physics that will emerge from the work proposed here could have an impact in
the understanding of the submicron structures that promise to lead to a new type
of quantum effect electronic devices.
