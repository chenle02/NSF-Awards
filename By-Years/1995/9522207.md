9522207 Bernat This award provides infrastructure support for a program designed
to substantially increase the number of minorities, particularly Hispanics, who
complete degree programs in the areas of computer and information science and
engineering. It involves both the Computer Science and Computer Engineering
Departments at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). The project is built
around the concept of Affinity Groups, groups which are centered about a
research area and which involve both graduate and undergraduate students and one
or two faculty members at the center of each group. Within the groups, emphasis
is on developing social and communication skills as well as on research and
technical skills. A strong evaluation component is built into the project. It is
anticipated that the structure developed has the potential to become a model for
the success of minority students at a wide range of similar urban, commuter
institutions. ***
