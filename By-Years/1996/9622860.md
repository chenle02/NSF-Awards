Dixon's formulation for simultaneously eliminating several variables from a
system of multivariate polynomial equations will be investigated. Solving
polynomials equations and identifying conditions on parameters under which the
equations have common solutions are fundamental problems in symbolic
computations which arise almost everywhere. Polynomials are used to model many
phenomena - particularly in robotics, kinematics, computer vision, solid
modeling, graphics, chemical equilibrium and other engineering, CAD-CAM design,
etc. Dixon's formulation directly generalizes Bezout-Cayley's formulation of a
resultant for eliminating a single variable. Dixon resultants have not been
extensively investigated apparently because they presumably got overshadowed by
Macaulay's formulation of resultants for simultaneously eliminating several
variables. Implementations of Dixon resultants, Macaulay resultants and sparse
resultants have revealed that Dixon resultants are more efficient to compute in
practice. Dixon resultants will be analyzed with a particular emphasis on
studying the relationship of the size and structure of the Dixon matrix to the
input polynomial system. ***
