This starter grant award to the University of California at Irvine supports the
research of Professor Patrick J. Farmer. The theme of the research is the
synthesis and study of oriented bimetallic complexes to illucidate the mechanism
of long distance electron transfer. In systems of bimetallic complexes of
nickel, copper, and cobalt featuring tetra-amine ligands, the relative angle
between two equivalent metal sites can be changed and the rates of electron
exchange between sites in mixed-valence oxidation states measured, allowing the
contributions of connectivity, orientation, and distance to intersite
communication to be compared. The research will advance the fundamental
understanding of the mode of transmission of electrons over relatively long
distances. The use of tetra-amine ligands in the formation of metal-based linear
polymers could lead to materials with unusual optical and magnetic properties.
