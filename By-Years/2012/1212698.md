Advancements in mathematical models, numerical algorithms and computing
capabilities have brought many complex non-linear problems in science and
engineering closer to understanding through simulations. The increased
resolution and modeling fidelity comes with an increase in the complexity of
developing and managing advanced simulations software. A key factor in effective
utilization of HPC resources for simulation is the availability of
sophisticated, scalable, and robust community codes. Because of their
complexity, the development of such codes demands interdisciplinary, long-term
collaborative efforts by teams of experts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will
fund a workshop to develop ideas on how to widen the user base on the high-end
HPC platforms through the use of community codes and an integrated computing
approach to science. Such a workshop on community codes is timely in view of the
extraordinary challenges faced by computational scientists in planning and
preparing for the next generation computing platforms. The workshop will address
topics including; understanding what it takes to develop successful community
codes; practical and effective software engineering for scientific codes;
interdisciplinary interactions in integrated science computing; and data
management and analysis for scientific simulations.
