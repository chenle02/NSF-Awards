This program at Colorado State University has a REU site focussed around the
CSU-CHILL radar facility. The CSU-CHILL radar facility is an advanced 10 cm
wavelength polarimetric Doppler radar designed for remote sensing. This provides
summer employment for students following the junior year. This is followed by a
six credit design project that enables these students to continue working with
the radar and to formulate topics depending on their interests. At the end of
the project, students are required to write a formal report and present their
results in a seminar series. The participation of several faculty and the CSU-
CHILL staff enables the students to acquire a strong theoretical background
while participating in team-oriented or individual radar related projects.
