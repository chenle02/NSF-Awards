The broader impacts/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will lead to
identification of customer segments and delineation of the value proposition for
introducing novel technologies to capture and convert carbon dioxide (CO2) to
value-added products bearing inorganic carbonates. The use of alkaline
industrial residues as a feedstock to the process will lead to the recycling and
reuse of these materials and reduce the waste that needs to be landfilled.
Multiple customer segments and industrial sectors including CO2 emitters and
generators of alkaline industrial residues are expected to benefit from the
implementation of this technology. Through the NSF I-Corps Program, the team
will identify the immediate need for this technology and the economic advantages
that their technology will bring to U.S. manufacturing.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will result in significant insights
into existing chemical and manufacturing processes for CO2 capture, conversion,
and waste utilization. The technical challenges in existing processes,
associated economics, and knowledge gaps in implementing novel processes for CO2
capture and utilization will be identified and discussed. The technology on
which this project is based involves reacting alkaline industrial and mining
residues and anthropogenic CO2 to produce value-added carbonate materials. These
measurements occur at 25-75Â°C and involve the chemical solvents for CO2 capture.
Preliminary research results show that high conversion of CO2 to calcium- and
magnesium carbonates is achieved with internal chemical recycling of the
solvent. In an alternative iteration, this approach can be used to chemically
regenerate the solvent while producing useful products as opposed to thermal
regeneration of the solvent. The morphologies of these carbonates can be tuned
for specific applications including construction or filler
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
