Abstract 96-04684 PI: Joseph F. Labuz, University of Minnesota "Behavior of Rock
in Multi-Axial States of Stress" This CONACyT award supports a collaborative
research project planned between faculty at the University of Minnesota and the
Engineering Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The
project will combine analytical modeling from Mexico and experimental testing
and field monitoring from Minnesota. The project is associated with work
currently underway under NSF grant CMS-9532061 entitled "Assessing the Onset of
Failure Through Acoustic Emissions." The research involves multi-axial
compression testing of soft rock-like materials, establishing the peak and post-
peak behavior and shear strength parameters, and using acoustic emission
techniques to monitor an excavation likely to develop failure or progressive
failure during construction. A novel piece of equipment, the University of
Minnesota Plane-Strain Apparatus will be used in the testing. ****
