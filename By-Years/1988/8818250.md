This objective of this proposal is to develop a strain measurement technique of
the order of light wavelength or smaller for nanomechanic research. Advances in
this new discipline of nanomechanics, which relates to solid mechanics at the
nanometer scale, are considered essential for achieving break-through in
designing engineered materials. This proposal addresses the need for an
experimental technique to measure deformations at submicrometers at cryogenic
through elevated temperatures. The desired submicrometer resolution will be
achieved by the use of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) which will record
the motion of submicron fiducial marks on the specimen. Difficulties are
envisioned in developing markers which can withstand the operating temperature.
