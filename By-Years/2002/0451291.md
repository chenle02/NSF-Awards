This project will acquire seismic data and piston cores to support IODP proposal
626, which focuses on Cenozoic climate change as elucidated by a paleo-
Equatorial transect in the Pacific. The research is collaborative with a NERC
UK-IODP to researchers at Cardiff University and University of Southampton. The
proposed work focuses on the identification of drillsites through standard
marine seismic surveying with a short streamer, integration of seismic
reflection data with existing data, interpolation of important stratigraphic
interfaces over large regions of the Pacific, and inversion of data to constrain
equatorial Pacific biogenic sedimentation during the Oligocene and Miocene
transitions. Broader impacts include fostering of international collaboration on
an IODP site survey project and inclusion of undergraduates in shipboard and
shorebased research.
