This project is developing materials to enable high school students to learn
and apply macroeconomic concepts through participation in six instructional
simulation games. Each simulation game will be designed so that students will
make a series of decisions. The consequences resulting from the decisions will
be data for students to use in testing hypotheses. Predicting, acting upon,
observing, and evaluating consequences will increase students' understanding of
critical macroeconomic phenomena. The instructional simulation games will focus
on the following topics: aggregate demand; aggregate supply; the interaction of
aggregate supply and demand with resulting consequences such as recession,
unemployment, and inflation; monetary policy and the Federal REserve System;
fiscal policy; and economic growth. Given the scarcity of macroeconomic
instructional materials for high school economics, this project will provide
much-needed assistance to economics teachers. //
