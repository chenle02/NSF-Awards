A central question in development of the brain is how precise sets of
functional connections are made between particular groups of nerve cells. Model
systems to study this question often involve a well-defined sensory organ and
the target areas in the cortex of the brain which receive those signals. Correct
central connectivity has been suggested to depend on having normal sensory
experience during development; with deprivation, there often are physiological
and biochemical changes in the target neurons in sensory cortex. This study uses
the tactile whiskers of rodents and their characteristic "barrel fields" of
target nerve cells in the cortex as a model with the addition of clear
anatomical organization. The whiskers are easily trimmed at different times to
provide a painless and easily reversible form of sensory deprivation in a local
area. Physiological, biochemical and anatomical techniques will be used to find
out how deprivation- induced changes in activity of a particular
neurotransmitter molecule (GABA) may provide a mechanism for changing the
relative levels of inhibition versus excitation during development and
establishment of normal connections. Results from this novel model system will
have an important impact on sensory neuroscience as well as developmental
neuroscience.
