This project is concerned with the study of verbally prime p.i. algebras. These
algebras are basic building blocks in the theory of T-ideals. The principal
investigator will study the structure of generic models, embedding theorems, and
applications of invariant theory. This research is in the general area of
noncommutative ring theory. In particular, it is concerned with a class of rings
which satisfy a polynomial equation. This area, with the discovery of
combinatorial theorems that provide insight into the structure theory of the
algebra, has become an exciting topic of current research in ring theory with
implications for representation theory.
