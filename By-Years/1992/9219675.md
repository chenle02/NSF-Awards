This research is a collaboration between investigators at Washington
University, Saint Louis, Missouri, and North Carolina State University, Raleigh,
North Carolina. The funding will support a passive seismic experiment utilizing
the PASSCAL portable seismic equipment, managed by the IRIS university
consortium, in the Tonga, Fiji, and Vanuatu regions. Earthquakes occurring
throughout the world will be recorded to study the structure of subducting slabs
using phases converted at the upper slab interface, dispersion of phases
traveling up the slab, and comparison of travel times between phases traveling
inside and outside of the slab. The structure of the back arc basin will be
studied utilizing regional earthquakes and SKS splitting from teleseisms. This
study will improve information about the source processes of deep earthquakes in
the most active deep seismic zone in the world, as well as provide better
constraints on the tectonics of the deep slab, shallow trench and back-arc basin
regions.
