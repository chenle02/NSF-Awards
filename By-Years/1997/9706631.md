9706631 Giedd The objective of this education program is to enhance the Master's
Degree in Materials Science at Southwest Missouri State University. It is a
response to the new requirements articulated by industries and by government to
reinvent education for the challenges of a highly competitive, world wide
economy. The mission is to educate individuals so that they can efficiently
perform the tasks which make companies competitive in a rapidly changing high-
technology world. This program will facilitate the process of collaboration with
the materials manufacturing industries in our region. The students are provided
experiences in using complex industrial equipment and techniques in order to
minimize the change between academic preparation and industrial employment.
Workshops are planned for employers on computer instrumentation and control
systems needed for industrial modernization. The majority of the student body at
Southwest Missouri State University consists of first generation college
students who will benefit greatly from this applied approach to education, where
high technology skills will be added to their core theoretical knowledge. Most
of these students have a strong desire to witness theory applied to "real world"
applications. The graduates will have the ability to work in the commercial and
industrial laboratories which require practical experience in high-tech
materials synthesis, preparation and characterization. This education grant is
funded through the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division
of Materials Research. %%% This grant promotes novel opportunities for students
to prepare for academic, industrial, government and non- traditional roles (such
as communication, business, leadership, ethics, mentoring) and assists in
integration of research and training with curricula. ***
