High speed logic is an essential component of modern computer and digital
systems. This project proposes to explore the application of a new class of
negative differential resistance (NDR) devices to digital design. Several new
types of devices such as resonant tunneling diodes, CHINTS and other devices
exhibit high switching speeds and negative differential resistance (NDR). The
NDR characteristics have found applications in oscillators and microwave power
sources but the use of these devices for digital applications has been explored
so far. Our preliminary results indicate that these devices could be used to
build high speed arithmetic circuits with picosecond delays, almost an order of
magnitude faster than any other known semiconductor circuits.
