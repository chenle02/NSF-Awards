The proposed research will continue an investigation of Poincare-invariant
light-front models. Applications will include the nucleon-nucleon problem,
including various pion and rho-meson exchanges, as well as excitation of the
Delta resonance, and a calculation of the electromagnetic properties of the
deuteron. Earlier work will be continued on the study of light-front dynamics
and manifestly covariant formulations of strong-interaction dynamics. ***
