9726580 Meagher The evolutionary basis of flower-size variation in insect
pollinated species has been an area of active interest and investigation in
recent years. Results from our studies of the dioecious plant Silene latifolia
suggest that specific changes in cell DNA content are related to flower-size
evolution. The first major objective of this study is to determine the nature of
the genetic changes associated with genome-size variation. In order to gain
further insight into genetic mechanisms underlying flower size, we plan to
measure the magnitude of the relationship between changes in DNA content at
specific sites on chromosomes to changes in flower size. Results from this part
of the study will establish the precise physical relationship between these
characters. Our second objective of the proposed study is to determine the
generality of this relationship between flower size and genome size by expanding
our survey to include species from other sections of the genus Silene. Results
from this work will help to determine the relationship between non-coding DNA
and evolution of morphological characters. From a classical viewpoint, variation
in morphological characters is thought to be based on variation at genetic loci
that code for specific proteins. Our work is looking at morphological variation
in a different way, and we aim to demonstrate that non-coding DNA is important
in morphological evolution. This work also has applied implications as well.
There is a growing interest in identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) in
plant and animal breeding for purposes of targeting efforts for stock
improvement. An underlying assumption in such efforts is that QTL will be based
on coding genes that could ultimately be manipulated through breeding or genetic
engineering. Our work would suggest that QTL could in fact be based on
alternative forms of DNA variation that would require different strategies for
alteration and development.
