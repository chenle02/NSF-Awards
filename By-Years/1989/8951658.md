A 16-foot radio telescope operating at 1.4 GHz, with associated receivers,
steering mount, data acquisition, and computer equipment will be constructed.
The overall instrument will be used in a required, new laboratory course for
astronomy majors, which will also involve infrared and optical instrumentation.
With this radio telescope, students will be able to determine the motion of
hydrogen gas in the dish of our Galaxy; detect periodic signals from a rotating
neutron star, and make maps of strong radio sources like the Sun and the radio
galaxy Cygnus A. Laboratory work performed by the students will also be aimed at
their understanding of radio equipment and analog and digital signal processing.
Cornell University is contributing to the cost of constructing the radio
telescope.
