the mining, minerals and fuels industries. The program encompasses a wide
spectrum of approaches from membranes and solvent extraction to separation
methods based on molecular recognition or biotechnology. The meeting will help
to make American firms more globally competitive and is timely with the present
focus on renewing the industrial and civil infrastructure. Broad impact is
expected with potential benefit to several industrial sectors and the general
public through addressing environmental processin problems.
