The Mississippian Antler basin is a well known but poorly understood
sedimentary system. It has been called a foreland, but the geometry and timning
of the orogeny that formed the basin have been the subject of diverse
speculation. Preliminary work has revealed new stratigraphic detail and several
features that are anomalous for a foreland: synorogenic deformation is mild and
poorly preserved, deformation took place as several discrete events that caused
uplift, the basin was wide and shallow, the foreland was long-lived but the
sedimentary section is not thick, and the sedimentary sequences are mostly
transgressive. Current foreland basin models are defined by the type of
associated orogency, and basin stratigraphy reflects ongoing tectonism. The
stratigraphy of the Antler system provides an excellent test of these foreland
basin models, because it differs from most foreland systems described to date.
This project will emphasize detailed sedimentology of newly recognized
stratigraphic sequences, mapping of sedimentary facies, and analysis of
synorogenic deformation. The results will be applied to existing models of
foreland evolution in order to expand foreland basin models.
