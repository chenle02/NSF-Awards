The University of Guam Marine Laboratory is one of four U.S. tropical marine
laboratories and is the only such facility in the tropical oceanic Pacific. It
is located in the most diverse biogeographic region of any U.S. marine
laboratory. The Laboratory supports the research of 7 full-time faculty, as well
as numerous graduate students and visiting investigators. With the closing of
the Mid-Pacific Research Laboratory at Enewetak, the addition of new faculty at
the Guam Marine Laboratory and the establishment of new collaborative programs
with the University of Hawaii, the University of the Ryukyus, and other
institutions, the demands on the existing facility for support of
multidisciplinary and collaborative research programs have increased. This
project will provide funds for replacement of the facility's seawater system and
improvements to allow access to the facility by the handicapped. The
enhancements of the facility will enable the Laboratory to better support both
existing and developing research programs.
