The vascular system of plants is a network of tubes that functions much like the
veins and arteries of animals. However, in plants, vascular cells also are
important for structural support, and form during the development of all plant
organs. The goal of this research is to learn more about how the vascular system
in plants forms, and how it can be manipulated to increase plant productivity.
Both biochemical and genetic approaches will be used to find genes that are
important for making the different types of cells that form the vascular system,
with the goal of identifying genes that can be manipulated to increase the
amount and quality of the vasculature in plants. These genes can then be used to
help develop crops that can withstand extreme conditions. In the 1960s, the
vigor of standard cereal crops such as rice and wheat were limiting for food
production. The creation of new varieties that were shorter and did not fall
over as easily led to increased production of grains and averted a major food
crisis. Today, as the citizens of the world face climate change with its more
volatile weather, an understanding of how the vasculature forms is needed so
that they can be manipulated to alter the strength and function of stems and
other plant organs in extreme and volatile environments. Undergraduate positions
supported by this award will be filled by Arizona students from low-income
backgrounds. Teachers from local high schools will be supported through this
award to develop lesson plans about plant genomics and biotechnology for their
high school classes.
