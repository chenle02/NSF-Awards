The Research Training Group (RTG) in Number Theory and Arithmetic Geometry at UC
Berkeley will establish a number of activities involving researchers at all
career stages ranging from undergraduates to senior faculty. The guiding aim is
to create a research group based approach to the training of students and
postdocs, enabling them to take full advantage of the wide expertise and
experience of each other and the senior faculty, and to provide access for
undergraduates to the research of the group and to mentor students planning to
pursue related advanced degrees. The RTG will provide a unifying structure for
the development of researchers and to foster collaborations. Activities of the
RTG include research workshops, new research seminars, undergraduate
conferences, and undergraduate mentoring.

The research expertise of the faculty affiliated with the RTG covers a wide
range of topics in number theory and arithmetic geometry, as well as several
related fields such as algebraic geometry, representation theory, and logic. The
research conducted as part of this award will include work on automorphic forms,
Arakelov geometry, Shimura varieties, Langlands correspondence, p-adic
cohomology theories, motives, algebraic dynamics, and log geometry. The project
activities will integrate the many research activities of the participants into
a coherent research group fostering further collaborations and more extensive
training.
