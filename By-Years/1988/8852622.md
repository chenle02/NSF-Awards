The aim of this project is to strengthen manufacturing processes and product
design education in mechanical engineering schools in the United States.
Manufacturing processes are typically taught without significant laboratory
experience, are taught apart from product design, and do not integrate well
other key disciplines such as stress analysis, materials selection, and
component and product design. This project will provide students with an
experimental course which integrates mechanical design principles with
manufacturing processing principles in a structured analytical and experimental
format, following a design for manufacturability concept. The laboratory
sequence requires CAD, CAM and data acquisition software, that is microcomputer
based, a milling machine that can be externally controlled, digitally controlled
testing machine, state-of-the-art process monitoring equipment including a video
digitizing imaging system and tooling dynamometry, and testing instrumentation.
All equipment selected is capable of interfacing with PC's to provide for an
integrated approach of analysis, control and monitoring throughout the sequence.
