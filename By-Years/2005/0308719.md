Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0308719&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Gordana Matic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Georgia Topology Conference
is an annual conference that has&lt;br/&gt;been organized by several generations
of topologists at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Georgia for over forty years. The
conference has&lt;br/&gt;focused on many areas of topology including hyperbolic
geometry,&lt;br/&gt;laminations, foliations, 4-manifolds, 3-manifold
invariants,&lt;br/&gt;symplectic topology and contact topology. The conference
has&lt;br/&gt;always featured emerging areas of research in
topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology can be viewed as the study of the
structure and shape of&lt;br/&gt;the space we live in. As such there are deep
relationships&lt;br/&gt;between topology, geometry, and physics. It is this
diversity of&lt;br/&gt;approaches to central problems that has always energized
research&lt;br/&gt;in topology. We encourage and fund participation by members
of&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups. Our participants and organizers
have&lt;br/&gt;included many women. Typically our conferences feature a
few&lt;br/&gt;senior researchers and a large group of young researchers,
mostly&lt;br/&gt;recent Ph.D.'s and some graduate students. This format, with
its&lt;br/&gt;attention to emerging areas of research, helps this
conference&lt;br/&gt;play a significant role in both disseminating the newest
research&lt;br/&gt;and preparing graduate students and postdocs for a
successful&lt;br/&gt;research career in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;
