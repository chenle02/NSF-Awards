This proposal will extend on-going experimental work on the degradation of
p-nitrophenolic wastes by an enriched Pseudomonas strain. A unique membrane
reactor is to be developed that immobilizes the cells and provides for multi-
phase processing. Such a reactor can isolate the active biomass from a waste
stream while permitting transport of the toxicant to the biomass, and allows the
maintenance of optimal culture conditions for maximum degradative activity. The
effects of immobilization on cell physiology and gene expression will be
addressed as a function of system operating conditions.
