The Cornell University REU program in the Department of Agricultural and
Biological Engineering is focussed on porous media flow and biokinetic
processes. Both topics are of great interest to agricultural and biological
engineering students. Activities in composting organic materials and flow paths
and associated biodegradation in field soils are planned. The program is divided
into a summer and academic year program. An environment where learning and
sharing of experiences is encouraged is provided. The learning will occur during
formal seminars and informal meetings between fellows, professors and their
research group. During the summer program, fellows will be housed together and
dinners are shared with various members of the research team.
