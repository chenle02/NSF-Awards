This research deals with atmospheric dynamics and ozone transport in the
southern hemisphere. A new hypothesis to explain the quasi-stationary wavenumber
1 pattern of the ozone maximum that surrounds the Antarctic ozone hole is being
studied. This so-called "ozone croissant" lasts from May to November and
exhibits a longitudinal preference for an elongated maximum centered south of
Australia. The hypothesis here is that the longitudinal distribution of this
feature is controlled by the outflow from the Tibetan high southeastward into
the equatorial Indian Ocean and into the southern hemisphere subtropical
westerly jet. The evaluation of this hypothesis has an observational and a
modeling component. The structure and time evolution of the meteorological
features will be documented and the University of Wisconsin Non-Hydrostatic
Modeling System will be used for transport studies initialized with
3-dimensional ozone fields.

This project has the potential to improve knowledge of ozone variability in the
Southern Hemisphere. It thus has implications for important environmental policy
decisions.
