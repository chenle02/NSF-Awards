This project involves the development of an integrated laboratory facility to
enhance the instruction of students in the areas of analysis, design, and
management of telecommunication systems and computer networks. The facility
consists of three interconnected laboratories: Telecommunication Systems
Laboratory; Digital Signal Processing Laboratory (Video, Speech, Image, and Data
Compression); and Broadband Laboratory (ATM, SMDS, Frame Relay, and ISDN). The
facility enhances student instruction in two critical ways: (1) By incorporating
computer-aided design and engineering (CAD/CAE) in all affected courses and (2)
by providing hands-on experience in real networks, technologies, and
instrumentation through the Telecommunications Education Research Network. *
