Analysis of Linear and Nonlinear Wave Equations: regularity, asymptotics and
blowup.

Abstract of Proposed Research Jacob K Sterbenz

This project is to investigate a variety of problems involving both the
regularity and the long time behavior of solutions of linear and non-linear wave
equations. The fundamental goal is to understand the asymptotic behavior of such
systems in a wide range of contexts, from local phenomena such as the
spontaneous formation of singularities, to delicate dispersive properties which
take place over infinite space-time scales. The main themes of recent research
in this area has been critical regularity results for geometric wave equations,
blowup phenomena for such equations in critical dimensions, and the asymptotic
stability of key linear and non-linear models. This is a very active field of
current research. Effective strategies and techniques which yield insight into
these problems will have non-trivial overlap with many other areas of classical
and modern mathematics such as spectral and scattering theory, differential
geometry, real variable methods of harmonic analysis, and the construction and
implementation of numerical simulations.

These systems arise as models of many different problems in physics, including
the underlying classical field theories of electro-magnetism, nonlinear
elasticity, the equations of linearized gravitational radiation, quantum
mechanics and quantum field theory. The mathematical issues to be studied here
all are related to the basic question of describing the dynamical properties of
linear and nonlinear physical systems. Progress on the mathematical analysis of
these problems should lead to a much better understanding, as well as prediction
and perhaps control, of these physical phenomena.
