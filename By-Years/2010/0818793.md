The objective of this project is to understand the role of jasmonic acid (JA)
signaling in plants. JA regulates many important aspects of plant biology,
including defense against biotic and abiotic stresses, growth and reproductive
development. JA signaling also plays an important role in the plant during
infection by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. For example, plant
mutants that are impaired for JA signaling are not easily infected by P.
syringae. To gain a better understanding of how JA responses are regulated, it
is important to identify and characterize components that control JA signaling
in the plant. This project seeks elucidate a branch of the JA signaling pathway
governed by the JIN1/MYC2 transcription factor. The JIN1/MYC2-dependent branch
of JA signaling is of particular interest, as the investigators have
demonstrated that disease susceptibility to P. syringae requires the activity of
JIN1/MYC2. A combination of molecular, biochemical and genetic approaches will
be used to identify and characterize additional components of the
JIN1/MYC2-dependent JA signaling pathway in A. thaliana, and to investigate
their roles in regulating JA signaling and disease susceptibility to P.
syringae. These studies should yield improved understanding of JA signal
transduction and mechanisms leading to disease susceptibility in plants, and may
ultimately lead to the development of improved strategies for controlling plant
stress and disease in agricultural systems. The project will provide stimulating
and valuable research and educational opportunities for high school,
undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students. In summers a local high
school student will join the research group to work on experiments related to
this project. Additionally, a local high school teacher will collaborate with
the group to develop experimental modules involving JA signaling mutants to
bring hands-on plant biology and genetics into high school classrooms.
