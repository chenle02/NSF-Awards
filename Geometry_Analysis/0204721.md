DMS-0204721 R. Schoen, H. Bray, J. Isenberg, N. Kapouleas

This award provides partial support for active research mathematicians to attend
a program in general relativity to be held at Stanford University and the
American Institute of Mathematics in the spring quarter (April 1-June 7) of
2002. The main topic of the conference concerns aspects of the Cauchy problem
for the Einstein equations, and it will include researchers with expertise in
differential geometry, nonlinear hyperbolic PDE, and relativity theory. There
will be approximately 50 total visitors averaging two weeks each during the
period of the workshop together with a few people for longer periods. Focus
periods on specific subtopics will be arranged. The program will include regular
talks, lecture series on particular papers and topics, and open problem
sessions. In addition, we will create a web site for the program which will give
a detailed look at open problems, relevant literature, background references,
and links to preprints and reprints. Further information will be linked from
http://math.stanford.edu and http://www.aimath.org
