Professor Greg M. Swain of Michigan State University is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to study
the physical, chemical, electrical, optical and electrochemical properties of
optically transparent diamond and diamond-like carbon thin-film electrodes and
explore their application in UV/Vis and IR transmission spectroelectrochemical
measurements. The electrochemical properties of the electrodes will be tailored
through control of their deposition conditions, and characterized by
conductivity-probe atomic force microscopy, scanning electrochemical microscopy,
and other surface characterization techniques. Transmission
spectroelectrochemical methods in the UV/Vis and IR will be used to investigate
the electrode reaction mechanism of redox-active neuropharmacological agents,
and low frequency IR spectroelectrochemical method will be used for the study of
redox-linked metal-ligand modes in metalloproteins and enzymes. Graduate and
undergraduate students will be trained in analytical chemistry,
electrochemistry, materials science, optical spectroscopy, and
spectroelectrochemistry. Students from underrepresented minorities will be
involved in this research through the local NOBCChE chapter.
