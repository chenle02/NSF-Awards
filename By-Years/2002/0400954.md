This project will primarily involve work in two areas. Mitchell has recently
answered a longstanding question of Shelah concerning the approachability ideal
at the second uncountable cardinal, and the first area of research will further
exploit these new techniques to better understand this ideal and other questions
about closed unbounded sets. A major aim will be to extend these ideas to the
successor of a singular cardinal. The second area of research is in inner model
theory, where Mitchell will attempt to better understand the situation just
below a Woodin cardinal and at very large cardinals where no core model is
presently known to exist.

These questions concern the basic structure of the universe of sets. The
approachability ideal was defined by Shelah for use in his analysis of singular
cardinals, such as the first infinite cardinal number which has infinitely many
smaller infinite cardinals below it. The structure at such cardinals is much
more difficult than the structure at regular cardinals, and the planned research
could contribute significantly to its understanding. Much research in set theory
studies different the different possible forms that the universe of sets might
take. It has been shown that, under appropriate assumptions, the "core model"
provides an invariant skeleton which shared by all of these possible universes,
and from which they derive much of their structure. The work on inner models
will aim at an understanding of exceptional cases where this skeleton is not yet
know to exist.
