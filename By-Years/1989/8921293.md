This renewal proposal requests continuing support to complete a study of
synthesis, single crystal growth, sample preparation and measurement techniques
to investigate features of phase transitions by delicate compositional
alterations, and to complete a theoretical framework describing the nature of
the Verwey transition in magnetite.
