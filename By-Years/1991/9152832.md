We plan to improve our curriculum in biology by expanding and improving
laboratory exercises in plant cell culture in our Botany and Introductory
Biology courses, and by including them in a new course, Biotechnology in Theory
and Practice.This year, we made a modest beginning in Botany by culturing
African violet leaf tissue, growing callus tissue from hypocotyls of sterile
Brassica rapa seedlings, and making vacuole preparations from flower petal
cells. We are excited about the outcome of the B. rapa exercise, and are
developing additional plant culture exercises from it. Students enjoyed working
with B. rapa because the seedlings and callus tissue grew so fast. They also
enjoyed isolating the large, colorful vacuoles from flower petals. The vacuoles
gave them a new way to study the effects of hyper- and hypotonic solutions.Now
we want to incorporate more sophisticated manipulations of plant cultures, such
as shoot culture and morphogenesis, and for that we will need the controlled
light and temperature conditions provided by growth chambers. We also need to
maintain suspension cultures of plant cells for protoplast isolation, cloning of
single cells, and nutrition. experiments, and for those we need gyrotary shaker.
