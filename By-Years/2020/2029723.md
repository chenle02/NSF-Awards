The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the COVID-19 global pandemic.
Recently, transfusions of plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients has shown some
efficacy in treatment. This is due to antibodies in the donor plasma that
recognize the SARS-CoV-2 virus, boosting the recipientâ€™s immune system to better
fight COVID-19. By mixing donor plasma with magnetic particles coated with
molecules that can capture these therapeutic antibodies, we will magnetically
extract, purify and concentrate these antibodies for use in COVID-19 treatment.
This technology can potentially be extended to other diseases as well.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
proposes to develop chemical conjugation strategies and novel magnet arrays
capable of isolating large amounts of therapeutic antibody from each unit of
plasma. This strategy introduces the potential to harvest large amounts of
therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from a single recovered COVID-19 patient,
enabling treatment of multiple patients from the plasma of one convalescent
patient. The antibody-depleted plasma can be returned to the donor, enabling
multiple plasma donations without the requirement of permanently removing plasma
from the donor. In addition, access to purified antibodies should enable scaling
of the therapeutic dose, potentially conferring longer immunity or inducing a
more robust immune response in the patient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
