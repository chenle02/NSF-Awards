CCR-0133502&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Delphin: Functional Programming in Logical
Frameworks&lt;br/&gt;Carsten Schuermann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data structures
such as lists, trees, graphs, arrays along with&lt;br/&gt;operations on them are
one of the most studied concepts in computer&lt;br/&gt;science and supported by
most modern programming languages. Theorems,&lt;br/&gt;proofs, and derivations
on the other hand have elegant representations&lt;br/&gt;in expressive logical
frameworks but lead in general to complicated,&lt;br/&gt;convoluted, and
ultimately unreliable encodings even in modern&lt;br/&gt;programming
languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Delphin project engages in
fundamental research on how to&lt;br/&gt;bring together the computational
features of programming languages&lt;br/&gt;with the representational features
of logical frameworks. In Delphin&lt;br/&gt;programmers can write automated
theorem provers, interpreters, and&lt;br/&gt;compilers with elegant and compact
data objects representing typing&lt;br/&gt;derivations (for compilers), proofs
(for proof carrying code), and&lt;br/&gt;computation traces (for abstract
machines). The proposed project&lt;br/&gt;employs techniques from higher-order
theories, dependent types,&lt;br/&gt;meta-logical frameworks, and functional
programming languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delphin will shed some light on the
epistemological tension between&lt;br/&gt;abstract concepts and their
representations; and it will provide&lt;br/&gt;answers concerning their
manipulation. Moreover, it will open up new&lt;br/&gt;research areas of how to
incorporate logical framework technology into&lt;br/&gt;other mainstream
programming languages such as Java and C#.
