The PI's research is centered on functional analytic aspects of harmonic
analysis. This project is devoted to understanding real-Hardy spaces and the
Littlewood-Paley theory in the noncommutative setting. The PI will apply the
results to operator algebra/noncommutative geometry as well as to classical
analysis. One of the goals is to understand Fourier multipliers on
noncommutative groups. It requires a combination of different tools from Hp
theory, operator space theory, and noncommutative Lp-spaces. A major challenge
is to find noncommutative techniques replacing the use of certain crucial
geometric properties of Euclidean spaces. The PI's work on operator-valued Hardy
spaces took an initial step in the direction of the proposed research. The
proposed project will provide a theoretical counterpart of the recent work by
Pisier/Xu, Junge, and Junge/Xu of noncommutative martingales and will complement
Arveson's work on noncommutative analytic-Hardy spaces. It will also improve the
understanding of the semigroups of (completely) positive operators on von
Neumann algebras.

Quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle allow for many
noncommutative generalizations (=quantization) of classical mathematical
theories following Von Neumann and Murray's pioneering work on noncommutative
integration theory. Very interesting new phenomena and difficulties arise in the
effort of adopting classical concepts to the noncommutative framework. For
example, using the language of von Neumann algebras, it is now possible to talk
about the expected exit time for a noncommutative domain although we can never
see the "points" of this domain. This project will continue this long term
quantization effort and will explore and strengthen the deep links between
different branches of mathematics and physics. In turn, it will make valuable
contributions to prediction theories, H-infinity control, signal and image
processing, statistics, and quantum mechanics as well.
