The objective of this research is to develop general methods that automatically
discover original and useful knowledge from historical or experimental data.
Learning discriminants and descriptors associated with patterns extracted from
the data is a central issue in data mining. The project will develop techniques
to do this. The results will be experimentally evaluated. In addition, an
integrated data mining performance system will be developed.
