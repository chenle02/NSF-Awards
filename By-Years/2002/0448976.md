This research program targets the synthesis of heteroatom-containing convex
polycycles. A synthetic procedure for the alpha-substitution of azatriquinanes
will be developed, and the properties and applications of resultant chiral
azatriquinane-based acids, nucleophiles, and ligands will be investigated.
Novel, fused tricyclic 10-pi aromatic systems derived from azatriquinacenes will
be prepared and analyzed. Solid-state dimerization of azatriquinacene
derivatives will yield diazadodecahedranes. These syntheses will be complemented
by total syntheses of heterododecahedranes and advanced fragments thereof and of
B- and P-heterotriquinane systems. These studies provide students with broad
experience in organic synthesis, coordination chemistry, crystallography, and
issues in chirality, aromaticity, and nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
the support of this CAREER award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program, Professor Mark Mascal, of the Department of Chemistry at the University
of California at Davis, is exploring the synthesis and properties of molecules
that envelop a volume of space, whether concave, hemispherical, or completely
closed-shell bodies. Such molecules, perhaps most widely recognizable as the
"fullerenes" ("Bucky balls"), represent both objects of enduring fascination in
the chemical sciences and materials with potentially broad technological
applications. This project serves as an excellent training ground for students
in fundamental research. The project also targets a number of other developments
regarding recruitment and training in the chemical sciences through enhancing
the research relevance of laboratory courses, developing a modern industrial
chemistry graduate course, promoting undergraduate research, and devising novel
approaches to course assessment by student participation in the examining
process, as well as providing popular outreach to regional community colleges
and K-12 institutions.
