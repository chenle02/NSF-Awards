This award will support the participation of 11 undergraduate students each
year in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program offered by
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO. Each student
participant will spend ten weeks engaged in developmental biology research under
the direction a faculty mentor of his/her choice, selected from among ca. 40
faculty members who have active, well-funded research programs and who study
developmental mechanisms in a wide variety of experimental systems. To permit
students to view their research projects in a broader context, five types of
supplemental activities will be provided: (i) a beginning-of-the-summer retreat
at a state park, where participants will meet with each other, explore the issue
of research ethics, and become introduced to the study of developmental biology;
(ii) workshops dealing with important model organisms, methods, and paradigms in
contemporary developmental biology research; (iii) faculty seminars designed
specifically for the students; (iv) participation in a student developmental
biology journal club; and (v) and end-of-the-summer research symposium at which
students will make presentations summarizing their research accomplishments.
Opportunities for frequent, informal social interactions will also be provided.
This award will foster the continued education and training of individuals who
will be part of the next generation of basic researchers in the developmental
biology.
