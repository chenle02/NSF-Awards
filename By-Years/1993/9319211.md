9319211 Poon This proposal requests for a research program on the study of the
basic and applied aspects of scanning holography and 3-D image coding. The
projects is a continuation of the principal investigator's previous work along
the line of real-time holographic recording technique using optical heterodyne
scanning. Briefly, in the technique, two optical beams of different temporal
frequencies are use to scan an object to extract the holographic information for
the object. In the present proposed research we investigate and compare the
coherent, partial coherent and incoherent nature of the scanning holographic
information reduction techniques, 3-D coding and multiple-exposure holography
are explored and extended to multiple holographic information of the object
simultaneously. Advantages of multiple-beam scanning includes real-time
operation and large multiplexing capability. The integration of an electron-
beam-addressed spatial light modulator for coherent reconstruction with the
scanning holographic recording system also is investigated in the context of
real time holography in video rate. The results of the proposed work could lead
to better 3-D information processing and coding such as in the areas of real-
time 3-D image processing, microscopy, data storage and acquisition and optical
remote sensing.
