The great Tohoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011 has reminded us of the hazards
to life and property that attend such events, and of the need for a focused
scientific effort to understand both their causes and effects. Cascadia, which
extends from northern California to southern British Columbia, will be the site
of a future great earthquake that will affect a number of large metropolitan
centers, including Seattle and Portland. The Cascadia Initiative is an effort to
gain a better understanding of seismicity in the region that includes the
deployment of an array of instruments both onshore and offshore. Several
ancillary studies are also planned or under way; one such study is a
sophisticated 3D (three dimensional) seismic survey to be carried out off the
coast of Washington. The suite of 2D seismic profiles that will be acquired by
this project will provide essential data for planning and carrying out the 3D
survey. The chief broader impact of this study is the very high societal
relevance of gaining an improved understanding of the seismic risk in this
region.
