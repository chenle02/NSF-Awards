The focus of this research is to develop synthetic methodology using the
dihapto-complexation of transition metals to arenes to generate synthons for the
assembly of functionalized polycyclics. The use of rhenium, tungsten and
molybdenum will be explored and attempts will be made to make this
dearomatization methodology catalytic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal
award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research of Dr. W. Dean Harman in the Department of Chemistry at the University
of Virginia. Professor Harman will focus his work on developing methods for
activation and functionalization of aromatic molecules. Selective binding of
arenes or polyaromatics to transition metals enhances the reactivity of the
aromatic systems towards electrophiles and affords reactive intermediates that
can be used for the development of subsequent stereoselective chemistry. Broader
impacts are strong in the area of training for both undergraduate and graduate
students and the work has significant implications for the pharmaceutical
industry. &lt;br/&gt;
