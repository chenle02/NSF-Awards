Dr. W. Todd Wipke and other members of the Chemistry Department at the
University of California at Santa Cruz are being supported to continue a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period
1997-99, eleven undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively
engaged in basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry
and biochemistry. Topics include mechanisms of structure and function in
biological systems, computer modeling, photochemical energy, and natural
products chemistry. Each student conducts a research program from literature
research, laboratory experimentation, seminar participation, research paper
writing, and oral seminar presentation. Recruitment efforts focus on California
and nearby states, with participants accepted from a national pool.
