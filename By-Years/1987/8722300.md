The Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California at San
Diego has requested several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed
in a pool of shared use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in
association with the four research vessels operated by the institution. A
substantial part of the ships' operating schedules during 1988 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ships and of the institution to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -Towing boom for an
seismic profiling system airgun array, -Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler for
continuous measurements of subsurface circulation features, -Autoanalyzer for
making precision measurements of several chemical parameters, -A CTD for
obtaining detailed profiles of seawater conductivity and temperature as a
function of depth, -an echosounder for display of seafloor profiles, and -a
control system for a seismic airgun array. The Univrsity of California is cost
sharing in the acquisition of this equipment. The instrumentation described
above will increase the capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored
research and engineering projects.
