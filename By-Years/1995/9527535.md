Abstract: EEC-9527535, Colorado State University, PI-Dr. Kenneth Reardon: This
award provides funding to Colorado State University for support of a Combined
Research Curriculum Development Program entitled, "Bioremediation Technology in
the Engineering Curriculum: A Module Based Multimedia Approach." The CRCD
program emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting research advances in
important technology areas into the upper level undergraduate and graduate
engineering curricula and stimulates faculty researchers to place renewed, equal
value on quality education and curriculum development. This three year program
will integrate bioremediation technology concepts into undergraduate and
graduate engineering courses via eight modules containing laboratory, video,
mini lecture, and/or case study components. The content of these modules will be
enhanced by inclusion of closely related research being performed by the
curriculum development team and by field experience provided by a panel of
practicing bioremediation engineers.
