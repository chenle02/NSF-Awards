9404747 This renewal grant involves research on solvable models for statistical
mechanics and quantum field theory. Work will be done on extending research on
the excitations and the completeness rules to the full phase diagram of the
three-state chiral Potts model. It will be determined how the excitation
spectrum of the ferromagnetic and massively superintegrable cases, which have
strikingly different features, actually join together in a smooth fashion. The
manner in which the level crossing phenomena of the massless incommensurate
phase allows for the systems to continuously go from the ferromagnetic case to
the antiferromagnetic case will be studied. Investigations of the fermionic sum
representations of characters will be extended by finding the representations
for the twisted affine and super algebras. %%% This theoretical research is at
the interface between condensed matter physics, mathematical physics and applied
mathematics. Using powerful mathematical techniques, connections between quantum
field theory and statistical mechanics will be utilized to understand the
properties of various condensed matter systems at a fundamental level.
