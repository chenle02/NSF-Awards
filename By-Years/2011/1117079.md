One of the major concerns that practitioners have about theoretical machine
learning is the focus on distributions where the attributes are independent: in
other words, knowing one attribute gives no information about any others. As an
example, while it is plausible that height and eye color are independent, it is
much less believable that height and weight are independent. Thus, the output
given by any algorithm that is based on the assumption that the attributes of a
person (such as height and weight) are independent cannot be trusted. The goal
of this project is to extend what we know about the theory of such problems
while removing some of the mathematically convenient assumptions such as
independence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tools used focus on discrete Fourier
analysis, but involve many other techniques from mathematics such as functional
analysis and representation theory of finite groups. One recurring technique is
the application of the "noise sensitivity" method, which quantifies the
complexity of a function based on how similar the value of the function is on
some input to the values of that input's neighbors. In many cases, the goal is
to show that the Fourier spectrum of certain classes of functions is
predictable; often, this predictability is a key component of algorithms for
machine learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader goal of this project is to
discover new connections between mathematics and computer science with a special
focus on questions motivated by machine learning. Answers to the underlying
questions would be useful to theoreticians and could lead to better applied
machine learning algorithms. Also, the mathematical questions raised are
interesting independently of the machine learning connection. The problems
considered in this project will provide an invigorating research opportunity for
undergraduate and Master's students.
