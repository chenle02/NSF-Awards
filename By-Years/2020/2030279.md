A critical aspect of controlling the current COVID-19 outbreaks is early and
fast detection of the infected population. Current methods for detecting the
novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 typically require a laboratory and use
expensive equipment and reagents. These requirements limit the number of tests
that can be performed nationwide. In this project, the research team aims to
develop an alternative diagnostic approach that directly detects the viral RNA
without any amplification, labeling, or the use of enzymes. The assay requires
minimal steps and uses a compact, bufferless gel cartridge system that can be
deployed in a clinical setting. Beyond the current COVID-19 outbreak, this
sensing platform can also apply to other existing or emerging viruses.

This work aims to develop a nanoswitch assay sensitive enough to detect clinical
levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA within 1 hour. Once the viral RNA is extracted
from a sample, the RNA is fragmented and mixed with the DNA-based nanoswitches.
Hybridization of a viral RNA fragment of a specific sequence with a nanoswitch
induces a conformational change of the engineered DNA strand from its linear
"off" state to a looped "on" state. After separation of the target-bound looped
form from the linear nanoswitches by electrophoresis in a gel cartridge system,
the viral load is quantified from the intensity of the looped (on) nanoswitches
in a gel image.
