This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will examine the
feasibility of culturing naturally occurring bacterial consortium that exist in
coal seams. These bacteria generate the bulk of the 450 million cubic feet of
methane now being recovered daily from coal seams in the Powder River Basin of
Wyoming. However, only indirect studies have thus far been carried out on the
character, environment, and activity of these organisms. Isolating the bacterial
consortium will allow development of methods to detect critical parameters for
biogenesis in the field and to determine conditions under which this biogenesis
may be optimized.

The commercial application of this project is in detection of new methane rich
coal seams and in enhancement of methane production from existing coal seams.
