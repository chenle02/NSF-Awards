9321370 Smocovitis One of the most significant but least understood events in
the recent history of science is the evolutionary synthesis which developed
around the time of World War II. Under this grant, Dr. Smocovitis is
investigating how the synthesis might best be seen in the context of the
emerging discipline of evolutionary biology--the area of biology which is
frequently thought to be the "central organizing principle" or "central
metaphor" of the modern biological sciences. This process of discipline
formation in turn took place within larger efforts to unify the biological
sciences in this period. Dr. Smocovitis has organized this study in several
parts. One component involves examination of the merging discipline in the
context of positivist efforts to unify knowledge. She is examining the question
to what extent, and exactly how, the "architects" of the evolutionary synthesis
inherited and accommodated these global efforts to unify knowledge. She is also
documenting how positivist epistemology shaped their vision of legitimate
science through methodological concerns such as the adoption of experimental
methodologies, choice of study organism, and the application of quantitative
methods to the historical science of evolution. Another component of the study
involves a look at the emerging discipline itself through the organizational and
institutional efforts to unify and legitimate evolutionary studies in the US.
The final component of this study is an examination of political, ethical, and
national concerns of the interwar period such as the desire to formulate a
meaningful evolutionary world view. This project promises not only to shed light
on this significant episode in the history of western science, but will also
make transparent the historically rooted, context-bound, and humanistic features
of scientific knowledge. ***
