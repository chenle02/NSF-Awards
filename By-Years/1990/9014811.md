The Supercomputer Computations Research Institute of Florida State University
will host the physics conference Lattice '90 in Tallahassee during 8-12 October
1990. This annual conference has rotated between the U.S. and Europe for the
past six years, and is the main international conference for lattice field
theory. In lattice field theory, one attempts to understand theoretically the
strong nuclear interactions of the elementary particles by making an
approximation in which the continuum of space is replaced by a discrete lattice
of points. Topics that will be extensively discussed at this conference include
lattice computations of the masses of strongly-interacting particles, the
potential between quarks, weak nuclear processes, the phase transition in which
quarks become free, and new developments in algorithms and special purpose
machines. The annual Lattice conference regularly draws about 200 of the most
outstanding researchers in the field, and provides them with an important
opportunity to exchange ideas in an area of research which has become a major
component of theoretical elementary particle physics.
