9510732 Gilbert The objective of this research is to obtain evidence for G4
tetraplex DNA in vivo; more specifically, on meiotically paired chromosomes.
Biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that this novel form of DNA exists in
vivo as a structural intermediate for several cellular processes including
meiosis, telomere functioning, and G-rich sequence mediated recombination. The
yeast gene KEMI encodes a G4-DNA dependent nuclease. A homozygous deletion of
this gene blocks yeast cells at meiosis I, where homologous chromosomes are
paired but fail to resolve, supporting the hypothesis that G4-DNA is involved in
meiotic chromosome pairing. Naked chromosomes will be isolated from meiotically
blocked (kem1() yeast cells and their DNA will be visualized and examined by a
light microscopy, and by CHEF gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting in
comparison with chromosomes from wild type cells. Chromosomes from keml( mutant
cells blocked in meiosis I should exhibit higher-order structural changes
including retarded mobility in CHEF gels, and tetrameric (4N) complexes of DNA
from homologous chromosomes joined at multiple points. This research will shed
new light on meiotic chromosome pairing by demonstrating DNA-DNA interaction
consistent with G4-DNA pairing in vivo, and will establish the foundation to
investigate other cellular processes in which this tetraplex DNA might be
involved, such as telomere functioning and recombination. %%% The objective of
