College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of
the experiments that are planned today for optimizing the concentration of media
ingredients for the fermentation of a product involves the use of either
factorial experiments (basic or fractional) or mixture design of experiments.
These methods all have their advantages and disadvantages, but are not well
suited for efficiently finding optimal concentrations when a large number of
variables are involved. This project aims at developing an experimental design
that would provide a tool to scientists to study the influence of a large number
of input variables on a set of given output variables. The design would not only
provide information on the interactions between the variables but will provide a
combinatorial characterization of where the influence of ingredients is maximum
on the output variables. This design can be helpful to bioengineers in academia
and industries alike and the design can be used for processes involving all
types of organisms including both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research activities proposed in this proposal will give the undergraduate
students of Dowling College a chance to complement their learning with research
experience. This will help develop graduates that are well grounded in both the
theoretical and research aspect of the subject. The nature of the research is
interdisciplinary and integrates mathematical techniques of optimization and
design of experiments into biotechnology applications.
