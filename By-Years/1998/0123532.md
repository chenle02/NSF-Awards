The goal of this project is to contribute to the development of a national
science and engineering academic workforce that includes the full participation
of women in all levels of faculty and academic administration, particularly at
the senior academic ranks, through the transformation of institutional
practices, policies, climate and culture. The Georgia Institute of Technology
(Georgia Tech) proposes an integrated approach&lt;br/&gt;to institutional
factors that will support the full participation and advancement
of&lt;br/&gt;women, and provide a model of best practices, in academic science
and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;Georgia Tech will build upon previous activities and
momentum for the advancement of women. The Georgia Tech ADVANCE team includes:
the Provost and the Deans, faculty, and campus leaders from four cooperating
Colleges: Computing, Engineering, Sciences, and Ivan Allen College, representing
a full range of science and engineering fields. &lt;br/&gt;Through this project,
Georgia Tech will emphasize organizational features and factors that shape
outcomes for women in science and engineering, and will clarify
and&lt;br/&gt;portray the ways in which resources, processes of evaluation,
organizational culture&lt;br/&gt;and climate, including leadership, and family
policies affect the full participation&lt;br/&gt;and advancement of women by
field, career-stage, and family/parental status. In&lt;br/&gt;doing so, they
will address critical transitions to senior status, and the meaning of
full&lt;br/&gt;participation in academic science and engineering.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed activities include1) creating an inter-college
network of termed professorships that promotes the goals of ADVANCE; 2)
institutionalizing a formal training process for committees involved in tenure
and promotion; 3) collecting and using resource-allocation data for equity and
development of best practices; 4) holding annual retreats of women faculty,
provost, deans, and school chairs to review and refine goals and progress; and
5) strengthening and extending the scope and impact of family-friendly
practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE
Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the
participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the
increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and
engineering careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
