This award will support the participation of graduate students and postdocs in
the ?Eleventh Riviere-Fabes Symposium on Analysis and PDE? that will be held at
the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities from April 11 to April 13, 2008.

This annual conference celebrates the mathematical legacy of Nestor M. Riviere
and Eugene B. Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially
in the field of partial differential equations. The 2008 program will feature
two principle speakers (Alberto Bressan and Igor Rodnianski), each of whom will
give two lectures, and a number of one-hour talks delivered primarily by
mathematicians in the early stages of their careers (e.g., Camillo De Lellis,
Fengbo Hang, Monica Visan). The conference program affords ample time for
informal discussion among participants.
