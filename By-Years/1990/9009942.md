This is a post-event investigation project to learn engineering lessons from
the Loma Prieta earthquake (October 1989). The objective of this project is two-
fold: to evaluate the performance of reinforced concrete buildings and to
assess, through earthquake data analysis, the current vulnerability evaluation
methods. Most specifically the document ATC-14 which provides recommended
methodologies for rapid assessment of life-safety level of performance of
buildings will be evaluated. The tasks undertaken in this investigation are: (a)
collection and organization of structural performance data, (b) analysis and
evaluation of structural vulnerability in the ATC-14 format, and (c) evaluation
of the ATC-14. The project will provide a rational verification with field data
and improvements of structural safety evaluation methodology.
