Abstract for award DMS-0701053 of Ulmer

Dr. Ulmer proposes to work on three projects related to ranks of abelian
varieties and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture over towers of function
fields. In the first project he plans to exhibit non-abelian towers of function
fields over which certain L-functions have zeroes of arbitrarily large order at
the critical point; this builds on his recent work demonstrating the analogous
result in abelian towers. In the second project, he plans to investigate general
criteria which guarantee that Jacobians of curves satisfy the conjecture of
Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer in every layer of a tower of function fields; again
this extends his recent work. In the third project, Dr. Ulmer will try to extend
recent results which allow one to show that certain abelian varieties have
bounded ranks in the layers of a tower of function fields. All three of these
projects currently involve students or post-docs and there is ample scope for
their continued contribution.

Dr. Ulmer works in Arithmetical Algebraic Geometry, an area of fundamental
mathematics whose motivating questions are about solving systems of polynomial
equations with integers or rational numbers. The field is curiosity-driven and
was once thought to be without application. However, it is now known to be
crucial to many modern technologies which affect our everyday lives, such as
coding theory and cryptography. CD and DVD players, mobile telephones, and
secure internet communication all rely on mathematics originally created in the
pursuit of questions in arithmetical algebraic geometry. The field has deep
connections to other areas of mathematics such as algebra, geometry, analysis,
and topology, as well as mysterious links to other areas of science such as
quantum field theory. Dr. Ulmer hopes to shed light on the connections between
numbers, shapes, and calculus through his research on elliptic curves and
L-functions. His work in this area also provides the basis for many education,
outreach, and training activities in which he is engaged.
