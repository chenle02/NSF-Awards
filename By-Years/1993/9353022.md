residential Young Scholars projects in life sciences for forty students entering
grades 10 through 12. Student experiences will include classroom lectures, field
research, career counseling and laboratory exercises. The University of
Mississippi Biological Field Station will serve as an outdoor laboratory for
research on freshwater wetlands. Students will gain research experience by
touring ongoing research projects at the field station. In-depth instruction on
freshwater ecosystems will be provided by university faculty. Additional field
trips to the National Forest Hydrology Laboratory, National Sedimentation
Laboratory and Sardis Reservoir Dam are also provided. The follow up activities,
which include data collection, research projects and classroom presentations,
complete the project. ***
