In order to gain more information about the band offset in the strained layer
InxGa1-xAs/GaAs system we propose a detailed systematic study of the
photoreflectance spectra from a series of well characterized single quantum well
structures with different physical parameters, i.e., well width, strain and In
composition (x). In single quantum wells additional information about band
offsets can be obtained since light-hole transitions will only be observed when
the conduction band offset, Qc~&lt;0.5. This is a collaborative effort between
Brooklyn College and ETDL, Ft. Monmouth. Photoreflectance measurements will be
carried out at Brooklyn College. The heterostructures will be fabricated by
molecular beam epitaxy at ETDL, Ft. Monmouth. In addition certain
characterization procedures such as high- resolution transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) to determine well width and Raman scattering to evaluate x and
e will be carried out at Ft. Monmouth. To date there has been little systematic
work on well characterized samples of this system.
