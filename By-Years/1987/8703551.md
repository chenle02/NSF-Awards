In this project Professor Mele will study the electronic and structural
properties of conjugated polymers and other condensed matter systems in reduced
dimensions. They will emphasize the importance of commensurability effects for
the physical properties of polymers. Although these effects are generally
recognized to be quite weak in conventional conducting polymers, Dr. Mele feels
that these effects may dominate the physics of the polyanilines (and other
similar "doped" structures). Also studied will be the appearance of a
"topological" phase in the adiabadic evolution of a general class of quantum
(and classical) systems. Situations in which this topological phase plays a
demonstrable role in the physics of the coupled electronic phonon systems, which
appear in various condensed matter contexts, will be sought.
