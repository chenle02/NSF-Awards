During 8 weeks in the summer, 12 students will work on open research problems,
satisfactory solution of which would involve results publishable in standard
journals. SUMaR has established a track-record of identifying such problems,
which nevertheless are accessible to undergraduates. Problems are offered in
areas including number theory, analysis, PDEs, quantum computing, and
mathematical modeling. All project mentors have established (and except for
postdoctoral fellows, well-established) programs of research related to the
proposed undergraduate research projects. The vast majority including the PI and
co-PI have extensive experience in mentoring undergraduate research, and those
lacking this will be mentored in mentoring by the PI and co-PI.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Besides research, the project will involve student participants in a
variety of mathematical and professional development activities - including math
subject GRE preparation; introduction to computational, typesetting, and
presentation software commonly used in mathematics; a talk about how to prepare
effective talks for different audiences; a panel on graduate school in
mathematics; a panel on NSF graduate scholarships and semester long off-campus
programs; and social activities, many joint with other REUs. Each year, half of
the participants will be female, half will be either minority, students who
started out at a community college, or students belonging to another group
identified by the McNair program (first generation in college or economically
disadvantaged background). Outreach to veterans of the U.S. Armed Services will
be made through the grantee institution's Office of Veterans Affairs. Efforts
will be made to select students from small regional public and private colleges
without a graduate or Ph.D. program in mathematics.
