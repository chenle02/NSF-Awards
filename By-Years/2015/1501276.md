Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superfluidity in liquid helium has
fascinated condensed matter physicists for a century and remains a topic of
great interest even today. This behavior is an example of a macroscopic quantum
effect similar to the superconducting behavior that occurs in some materials. In
liquid helium this macroscopic quantum behavior manifests itself in many
fascinating ways one of which is the disappearance of the viscosity exhibited by
normal liquids. This leads to many interesting phenomena such as the appearance
of long lived quantum vortex lines. This project will make use of the newly
developed x-ray free electron laser at the Linac Coherent Light Source to
explore the hydrodynamics of feely suspended helium droplets. The new insights
this research will produce will help in our understanding of the effects of
vortices on systems ranging from superconductors to neutron stars. In addition,
the tools that will be developed during this project will be of great benefit to
materials scientists developing new
nanomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will explore quantum rotation in 4-He droplets to bring new physical
insights into quantum hydrodynamics at the meso-scale. In particular, this study
will: (i) contribute to the description of rotating quantum droplets across the
available angular momentum - angular velocity phase space and determine if the
rotating superfluid and classical droplets belong to the same families of
shapes; (ii) provide stationary shapes and configurations of vortices (N =
1-200) in a droplet, which remain unstudied experimentally or theoretically;
(iii) reveal the effect of vortex mass on their dynamics by studying vortices
decorated with Xe clusters; and (iv) elucidate quantum rotation at extreme
vorticity, up to a factor of about 100000 higher than attained in bulk
experiments, providing access to unexplored regimes of rotational excitation in
quantum liquids. Single-shot femtosecond X-ray coherent diffractive imaging at
the Linac Coherent Light Source free electron laser coupled with new image
reconstruction algorithms will be used to reconstruct real space images of the
shape of the droplets and the location of vortices within the droplet.
