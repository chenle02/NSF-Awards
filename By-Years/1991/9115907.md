The Johnson-Sealink will be used to examine a section of the SE Atlantic
continental margin where active aquifer discharge and its effect can be
established. The processes by which this and other processes may erode the
margin and produce its morphology will be studied as well as whether the coral
bioherms are karst pinnacles rather than actual bioherms. In the process, the
stratigraphy of the Florida-Hatteras slope will be refined.
