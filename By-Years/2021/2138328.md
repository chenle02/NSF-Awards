The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves
increasing the applications of data collection robots using a hybrid system that
can both roll and fly. A hybrid system allows for greater mobility and
significantly extends operating time, enabling longer missions and accessibility
to areas where application of current robotic platforms is limited. One
potential application is in crop inspection in agriculture. In such settings, a
hybrid system could inspect crops both aerially and at the ground level to
detect problems early and thereby increase yields while simultaneously saving
resource and labor costs. Other possible inspection applications include mapping
the progress of construction projects to identify design discrepancies, scanning
for structural integrity flaws in power plants and turbines, and assisting in
reconnaissance or search and rescue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project
further develops a hybrid rolling/flying robotic platform. The system is
comprised of a multi-rotor drone system mounted inside a stabilizing unit
surrounded by a spherical shell. The system saves significant energy by rolling
on the ground and switching to flying to negotiate obstacles or rough surfaces.
The system is equipped with a control algorithm that allows it to navigate
specified trajectories and also incorporates a real-time algorithm that selects
the optimal path in terms of energy consumption, feasibility, and safety. This
algorithm then autonomously selects the best mode (rolling or flying) according
to the operational environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
