The proposed project consists of two parts. The central theme of the first part
is a conjecture, which can roughly be stated as follows: the class of groups
admitting a non-elementary and "reasonably proper" action on a hyperbolic space
is the same for any reasonable interpretation of the phrase "reasonably proper";
moreover, it coincides with the class of groups with non-degenerate
hyperbolically embedded subgroups introduced by Dahmani, Guirardel, and the PI.
The second part of the proposal is devoted to a more detailed study of groups
with hyperbolically embedded subgroups. In particular, the PI plans to study
questions related to rigidity, small cancellation theory, and applications of
the general theory to groups acting on trees, one-relator groups, graph
products, and fundamental groups of 3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
general goal of the project is to better understand the scope and limitations of
geometric methods based on negative curvature in group theory. As a first step
towards this goal, the PI proposes to analyze various negative curvature
phenomena of algebraic, geometric, dynamical, and analytic nature occurring in
different branches of group theory. This analysis is expected to lead to new
general results with possible applications in group theory, 3-dimensional
geometry, the theory of operator algebras, and other branches of mathematics.
