9402056 Routbort Support is requested for the graduate students' participation
at the conference "Plastic Deformation of Ceramics" to be held at Snowbird,
Utah, August 7-12, 1994. At this meeting there will be a world renowned
scientist over viewing the field of high strength ceramics and some important
issues related to those e.g. creeping, deformation, superplasticity and many
more important structural ceramics problems. The conference seeks support from
NSF at the level of $10,000 for the students' participation. %%% Structural and
light weight Ceramics are some of the important issues of the near future. There
are several structural and mechanical properties understandings which are needed
before those can be used in some practical areas. This conference discusses the
advances in this field and concludes the needs and future research directions in
this area. ***
