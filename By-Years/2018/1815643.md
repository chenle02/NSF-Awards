Many critical online services are turning to cloud infrastructure to meet
scalability demands. In order to sustain cloud computing growth, it is necessary
to scale the computational capacity, and improve the energy efficiency, of data
centers. Modern data centers increasingly integrate accelerators, such as
Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), with traditional CPUs to provide
unprecedented parallelism and order-of-magnitude improvement to computational
throughput. In order to manage software workloads and hardware resources at
cloud-scale, data centers are increasingly being virtualized to provide ease of
software and hardware management. However, existing energy efficiency techniques
are not well-suited for virtualization technology and heterogeneous hardware.
This project provides fundamental insights and solutions towards achieving
energy-efficient computing for emerging virtualized heterogeneous data centers.
This project has wide-reaching benefits for the computational engines behind
many workloads of national interest, such as weather forecasting and machine
learning. Results of this research are being integrated into the existing
undergraduate and graduate courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research consists
of three main thrusts: 1) development of heterogeneous benchmarks to evaluate
server energy profile and metrics to quantify heterogeneous server energy
proportionality in order to investigate the implications of virtualization and
heterogeneous architectures, 2) development of software support for container
live migration and performance-aware migration strategies to minimize live
migration overhead, 3) development of management techniques to maximize energy
proportionality of heterogeneous CPU and multi-accelerator systems, such as
dynamic load balancing and automatic runtime task
migration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
