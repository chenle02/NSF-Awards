Tectonic Rotation of the Makah Formation&lt;br/&gt;Donald Prothero

College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Makah Formation
in the northwest Olympic Peninsula is one of the thickest and most complete
deep-marine Eocene-Oligocene sequences in coastal Washington, consisting of
about 2800 meters of thin-bedded siltstones and turbidite sandstones that lie in
a northwest-trending linear belt along the northwestern corner of the Olympic
Peninsula. It yields Refugian (late Eocene) benthic foraminifera in the lower
half, and Zemorrian (Oligocene) foraminifera in the upper half. Based on PI's
magnetostratigraphic calibration of these benthic foraminiferal stages in the
Lincoln Creek Formation of Washington and the Keasey and Alsea Formations of
Oregon, he is confident that magnetic sections in the Makah Formation can be
confidently correlated to the global time scale. Such correlations will aid in
our understanding of the major climatic changes occurring during the Eocene-
Oligocene transition. In addition, the Makah Formation yields some of the oldest
fossil baleen whales known from the Pacific Rim, and dating of these specimens
is important to hypotheses about whale evolution. Over 57 paleomagnetic sites
from the type section of the Makah Formation at Baada Point were analyzed and
yield a stable primary remanence with both normal and reversed polarities, which
passed a reversal test. Finally, PI's preliminary sampling of the Makah
Formation shows that the rocks have undergone about 30 degrees of post-Oligocene
counterclockwise rotation. This conflict with earlier paleomagnetic results
showing that many of the Eocene-Oligocene sedimentary units in the Olympics have
clockwise tectonic rotations; however, these results are consistent with recent
work nearby showing counterclockwise rotations. Further paleomagnetic analyses
of the Makah Formation would improve our understanding of the complex tectonics
of this region.&lt;br/&gt;
