This Chemistry Division award provides continued support for a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry Department, Bowling
Green University, directed by Dr. John R. Cable. Twelve students will
participate in a 10-week summer program over the next three years. The research
focus is on the photochemical sciences, ranging from photomedicine to three-
dimensional imaging. Students will learn the fundamentals of photophysics and
photochemistry in a unified short course format. Other features of the program
include a visit to a leading pharmaceutical company where students will be
exposed to the industrial aspects of chemical research and career options in
industry. Research results will be reported in seminars and through a joint
poster session with other REU sites in the region.
