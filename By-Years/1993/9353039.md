9353039 Sturgeon The Satellite Educational Resources Consortium (SERC) is the
developing and implementing a multifaceted series of interactive student
resources and teacher material for middle school mathematics classes. They are
designed for use in either the second semester of seventh grade or the first
semester of eighth grade. The integrated package includes video programs (108 in
number, each twenty minutes in length), on-going small-=group telephone
conferences, and on-line computer networking for teachers. Emphasis is placed on
problem solving and the materials anchored in real world situations. The units
are built around interdisciplinary topics which include sailing, the music
industry, architecture and sports, the airline industry, math in motion, oceans
and atmosphere, medicine and health, photography, and the natural world. Each
unit includes an exploration from among the following mathematical areas:
patterns and functions; computation and estimation; algebra; statistics;
probability; geometry; and measurement.
