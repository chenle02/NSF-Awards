This project provides opportunities for students to implement visually
realistic, interactive, graphics projects and/or to experiment with parallel
computing concepts. A laboratory is established that enables students to gain
experience with modern computer graphics applications that allow two types of
projects to be implemented: (1) advanced rendering via ray- tracing and (2)
hierarchical graphics applications using SunPHIGS, and allows students to study
parallel computing by implementing their own parallel versions of serial
algorithms. The laboratory consists of a network of four SUN Workstations with
supporting software.
