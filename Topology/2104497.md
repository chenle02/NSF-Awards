Inspired by physics, mathematics has successfully provided the background and
language for most of the sophisticated areas of modern physics. This project
aims to create new algebraic and geometric tools to formulate ideas and methods
of quantum physics in a precise mathematical way. Specifically, the theory of
quantum groups associated with Lie algebras has been widely and productively
used in low-dimensional topology, and in particular, with the creation of
quantum invariants. Within this context, the Principal Investigator (PI) and his
collaborators have offered new systematic strategies to define re-normalized
quantum invariants arising from non-semi-simple categories. The focus of this
grant is to develop a framework for many of the quantum invariants coming from
both semi-simple and non-semi-simple categories. The unique properties of such a
framework opens the door to new research avenues in algebra, topology, geometry,
mathematical physics, and related areas of mathematics. The broader impacts of
this grant address two main categories: mentoring and outreach. Throughout the
project, the PI will advise graduate students and postdocs on projects related
to the main objectives of the grant. The PI has co-organized many conferences
and a workshop and will continue such outreach with the aim of developing
communication and collaborative research with other mathematicians, as well as
fostering broader applications of the work of this grant.

This grant considers four types of invariants arising from non-semi-simple
categories: Hennings, Kuperberg, Reshetikhin-Turaev re-normalized Quantum
Invariants (RQIs) and Turaev-Viro RQIs. All of these invariants have unique
features and strengths. In particular, Hennings and Kuperberg invariants are
defined using the structure of Hopf algebras (and thus have many examples) but
have certain vanishings which do not allow extensions to full TQFTs; the RQIs
are quite powerful and their definitions are based on representation theory
making their existence for some significant examples elusive. This project will
generalize and re-normalize both Hennings and Kuperberg invariants and show that
the new invariants lead to TQFTs with additional data (overcoming the vanishing
obstruction). Furthermore, the PI will construct a general framework which
relates the Hennings and Kuperberg type invariants to the previously defined
Reshetikhin-Turaev and Turaev-Viro RQIs, allowing a unification of the strengths
of all four invariants. The PI will use this framework to advance and draw
connections with Chern-Simons theory with complex (super) groups and Levin-Wen
models.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
