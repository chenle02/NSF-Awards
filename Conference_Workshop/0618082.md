This award provides partial support for the Midwest Topology Seminar, a regional
topology conference that has met approximately three times a year for almost
forty years. This conference series brings together topologists from across the
midwest and across the various subfields of topology, providing a forum for new
results and trends in topology. Sites for past and future meetings include
Indiana University, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, Northern
Illinois University, Northwestern University, Ohio State University, Purdue
University, Purdue University Calumet, University of Chicago, University of
Illinois at Chicago, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of
Kentucky, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, University of Notre
Dame, University of Wisconsin, Wayne State University, and Western Michigan
University. More information on past meetings can be found at

Topology is a core subject in mathematics with important applications to the
rest of mathematics and to other sciences. This award will primarily support
travel expenses for graduate students, recent PhDs, and other active research
mathematicians with limited means of support. In addition, it will allow the
conference to bring in speakers from outside the geographic area to interact
with the midwest topologists and to speak about the latest developments in the
field in other regions.
