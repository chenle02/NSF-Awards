The progressive algorithms will be developed specifically for two applications
-- the transfer. The algorithms are developed using hierarchical descriptions of
the geometric and property input combined with incremental finite area, Monte
Carlo, and hybrid methods for calculating interreflections and implemented on a
stand alone graphics workstation. Because they are developed to produce accurate
radiant transfer solutions, the algorithms will potentially be applicable in
other fields involving radiant transfer as computer vision and remote sensing.
Progressive refinement algorithms such as those developed in this research
program will serve as examples for the development of future engineering
algorithms which are specifically designed to provide continuous graphical
output.
