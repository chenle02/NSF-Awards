PRIMER-Tropical Bioprospecting Venture (PRIMER-TBV) educates primarily Hispanic
high school/college educators in biotechnology within a tropical scenario, using
a research-based, entrepreneurial approach for the search of new products.
PRIMER-TBV is located at the Center for Excellence in Advanced Technology (CETA
by its Spanish acronym) of the Universidad del Turabo (UT), which is located
within a major hub for the global pharmaceutical industry (Barceloneta, PR).
CETA operates as a specialized UT Center with a community college format that
offers associate degrees in high demand industries such as biotechnology. The
advisory board for this project is composed of individuals from existing ATE
biotechnology projects and centers such as Bio-Link, area biotechnology
industries, and university researchers. The participating high school teachers
learn and practice fundamental biotechnology; college faculty develop materials
and exemplary approaches for technical education; and university/industry
partners serve as mentors while employing ATE-developed materials adapted from
existing ATE projects, and materials specifically developed for this project.
Approximately 4,800 pre-college and 480 technical students are directly
benefiting from the professional development of participating educators.
