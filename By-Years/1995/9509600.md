MCB 9509600 Linda Hansen The purpose of this research project is to characterize
cell cycle progression in hepatocytes cultured on the extracellular protein
fibronectin on the cell attachment sequence, arg-gly-asp, found within
fibronectin. At different points in the cell cycle cells, particularly
hepatocytes, will alter their preference as to the binding site within the
extracellular matrix. By identifying which receptors are involved in adhesion,
and the point at which cell cycle progression diverges on these substrates it
will be possible to design future studies into defining the exact signaling
mechanisms involved in extracellular matrix mediated growth control. %%% The
project will investigate the mechanism by which cells adhere to a substrate and
how the substrate regulates the rate at which cells divide. ***
