The broader impact / commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in
enabling practical, long-term monitoring of environments, using sound, such as
in livestock production, industrial settings, elder care, and
surveillance/military applications. While consumer voice-activated digital
assistants have driven transformation in consumer electronics, this work has
potential to drive a parallel transformation for non-voice auditory data by
significantly reducing the human effort and computational resources required to
analyze new environments. In agriculture, this type of acoustic monitoring could
result in a better understanding of animal well-being, more consistent and
humane treatment of animals, and better overall outcomes. For industrial and
surveillance applications, it could facilitate prevention of and rapid response
to problems or threats.

This I-Corps project is based on technology that learns what normal conditions
sound like for an environment, then highlights when potentially abnormal events
or conditions occur. If desired, these abnormal conditions can be tagged to
enable the system to distinguish between different known conditions. This
technology has been developed and tested extensively over the past six years
within the context of monitoring poultry production facilities. In many
environments ranging from a few birds to tens of thousands of birds, it has
proven effective in highlighting anomalous conditions such as the presence of
disease, excessive heat, human intrusions, lighting changes, and abnormal
equipment noise. The technology uses proprietary sparse coding based algorithms
that are computationally efficient enough to run on edge hardware.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
