The principal investigator will study crystal-melt reaction products common in
many hybrid rocks, and he will apply the results to two volcanic systems in an
attempt to explain where-how-when magma mixing occurred. In general, this work
will be useful in unraveling the mixing histories of both plutonic and volcanic
igneous rocks.
