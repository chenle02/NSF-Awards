Professor Austin Long, University of Arizona and Prof. G. E. Kocharov, Head of
Astrophysics, A. O. Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute, Leningrad, are organizing
a workshop on paleoastrophysics to discuss origin of cosmic rays and
periodicities in their intensities as well as relationships between cosmic-ray
intensity and climate. This workshop will be an intense introduction to a long
term collaborative project between the two institutions. This project fulfills
the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
researchers in the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary efforts and
capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the field of
basic scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality
of benefit.
