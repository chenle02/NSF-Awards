9406656 Bullesbach Structurally related proteo-hormones of the insulin family
consist of the parent hormone insulin, the hormone of pregnancy relaxin, and
invertebrate developmental factors (i.e, bombyxin, isolated from the brains of
the silk worm) and growth factors (i,e., molluscan insulin-related peptide,
isolated from the pond snail). The wide variety of biological functions inherent
in essentially the same three-dimensional structure implies that the biological
function of this family of proteins depends primarily on the side chain
distribution. It is the ultimate aim of this proposal to find the surface
features that are crucial for the diverse biological functions of the insulin
family of hormones. The initial step of this investigation involves the chemical
synthesis of these factors and of defined analogs. The syntheses are based upon
a novel approach, the site directed disulfide-bond formation, which has been
highly successful in the synthesis of insulin-like structures. Investigation of
the physical chemical and biological properties of the analogs by comparison
with natural factors will give insight into the structure-function relationships
within this important family of hormones. The long-term goal of these studies is
a better understanding of the mode of action of hormones and the subsequent
design and synthesis of mimetics. Such mimetics of hormones involved in
invertebrate maturation may improve our ability to control insects by
environmentally acceptable means, i.e., by suppressing or arresting the
development of a specific pest. ***
