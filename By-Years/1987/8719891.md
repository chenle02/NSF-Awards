This is an award for collection, description, and analysis of orally produced
poetry in the following languages: Finnish, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian,
Serbocroation, Swedish, Icelandic, and Faroese. The purpose of the project is to
test the hypothesis that the suprasegmental system of a language is crystallized
in the metric structure of its traditional poetry. This project follows up
previous work by the PI and will provide a large, systematically collected
cross-linguistic corpus for future work with metrics as well as evidence
relevant to the hypothesis in question.
