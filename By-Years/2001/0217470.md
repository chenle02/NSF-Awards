This dissertation research project is an ethnographic analysis of the ethical
and aesthetic commitments of free software computer hackers. It addresses the
following questions: 1) How do free software hacker practices, legal codes, and
social values reconfigure normative meanings of scientific knowledge, property,
and creativity? 2) How do hackers' ethical commitments result from the interplay
between their particular technical and aesthetic practices and the wider socio-
economic and legal conditions that shape their&lt;br/&gt;activities? 3) What is
materially and symbolically at stake in differing conceptions of knowledge
production and protection? The free software movement, whose goal is to make
software and its source code legally available, challenges the legal
privatization of software production. Free software is developed by thousands of
volunteer hackers. Working collectively over the Internet, they hold legal, open
access to information indispensable to their craft, understood as a social
practice and expressive activity fusing technological innovation with artistic
creation. This research combines ethnographic and document-analysis research by
following one software project and participation in a range of forums and
conferences in the Bay Area. The researcher asks how knowledge, property, and
creativity are reconceived by hackers, and she seeks to understand how their
aims and practices emerged from specific institutional conditions at a
particular historical moment.&lt;br/&gt;
