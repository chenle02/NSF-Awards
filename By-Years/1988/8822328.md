This project focuses on designing and evaluating an Object Flow Computer for
large database applications. The main features of this parallel system are (a)
the direct support of an object-oriented semantic association model, which can
model complex data more explicitly than existing data models; (b) the use of a
two-phase query processing technique, which can drastically reduce the amount of
data to be transferred among parallel processors; (c) the use of a vertical
fragmentation model based on semantic properties of data, which increases the
degree of concurrency and minimizes unnecessary data transfers; and (d) the
integration of a number of software and hardware techniques to solve very large
database management problems. Research is carried out on analyzing the cost-
performance tradeoffs in designing object-oriented processing functions in
hardware and software. An object-oriented database management system possesses
many desirable features, which include data abstraction, inheritance,
polymorphism, information hiding, and uniform treatment of data and meta-data.
The extension of object-oriented database management systems with semantic
modeling holds great promise in supporting advanced application, such as
CAD/CAM, CASE, and office automation. However, many of the essential techniques
and their implementation in hardware and software are not well understood. This
project addresses the design tradeoffs subject to technological and application
requirements from an analytical and experimental points of view. Results
developed will lead to more efficient and faster object-oriented database
management systems.
