Investigators associated with the Galileo Project will perform research leading
to the development of advanced interferometric receivers of gravitational
radiation. The research is intended to be useful eventually for advanced
detectors to be used at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
currently under construction. Three areas will be emphasized: 1) table-top
interferometer studies; 2) high power laser development and laser noise
reduction; and 3) suspension systems, thermal noise and interferometer control.
