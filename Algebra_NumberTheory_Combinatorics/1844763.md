One way to study complicated objects in mathematics is to compute simpler
invariants of the object, which provide information about the object. Objects
associated to sets of polynomial equations, called algebraic varieties, are
fundamental in many areas of mathematics and model numerous real-world
phenomena. This project studies invariants arising from algebraic varieties,
especially how certain invariants are distributed when considering large
families of them. For example, if the invariant is an integer, one may ask how
likely the invariant is, say, zero for a "random" object. Such results then
translate into a better understanding of the solutions of the given polynomial
equations. Along with the research proposed, the PI will organize a range of
outreach activities, including after-school and weekend activities for school-
age girls, workshops for graduate students, and regional workshops for students
and postdocs.

The research in this project is at the intersection of algebraic and analytic
number theory, algebraic geometry, and representation theory, and focuses on
distributions of arithmetic statistics. One may ask for not only theoretical
results but also heuristic predictions, as well as computational data to predict
or verify conjectures. The PI will study all three aspects--theoretical results,
heuristics, and data--concerning questions about class groups of number fields,
ranks of elliptic curves, and other invariants of algebro-geometric objects. The
PI intends to use methods from classical algebraic geometry, Lie theory, random
matrix theory, and sieve techniques from analytic number theory to pursue the
proposed research.
