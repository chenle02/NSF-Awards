This award facilitates scientific research using the large, new, computational
resource named Blue Waters being developed by IBM and scheduled to be deployed
at the University of Illinois in 2011. It provides travel funds to support
technical coordination between the principal investigators, the Blue Waters
project team and the vendor technical team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
involves the porting of two established chemistry code suites, GAMESS and
NWChem, to Blue Waters and preparing them for simulations in the general areas
of (i) the molecular dynamics of water, (ii) aerosols in the atmosphere, (iii)
dendrimer-ligand binding. The award will enable the project team to test
whether, for these three types of science problem, the numerical codes can scale
to a sufficient fraction of Blue Waters that it becomes reasonable to pursue
them on Blue Waters or whether it would be more cost-effective to address these
scientific challenges on more general computing
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target problems involve the simulation of a
cluster of 64 water molecules in order to study the structure and properties of
liquid water; the simulation of aerosol clusters such as a nitric acid molecule
and five or more water molecules, to determine the critical cluster size,
chemical properties, condensation and evaporation rates, and compositions
required to start droplet condensation; and a simulation of dendrimer-ligand
binding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A better understanding of the detailed behavior
of water at the molecular level and of the formation of atmospheric aerosol
condensation nuclei will find application in a number of areas of science and
engineering. GAMESS and NWChem are used by a number of research groups so
porting them to Blue Waters may make it possible for other researchers to take
advantage of this resource. The project team is led by a member of a demographic
group that is under-represented in the chemical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;
