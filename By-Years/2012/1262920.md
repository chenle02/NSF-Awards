This award provides support for seven students per year to participate in a
summer research program in Biophysics at the University of Michigan. The site
will provide incoming students with an interdisciplinary research experience at
the intersection of chemistry, physics, mathematics and the life sciences. Since
Biophysics is intellectually extremely diverse, the aim is not only to provide
research experience in a subfield of the discipline, but also provide an
overview of state-of the-art research in the field, and the experimental methods
and techniques that are commonly used. Therefore, the research experience is
constructed to have two components: 1) the students will be assigned to the labs
that match their interest and that are run by experienced researchers to
participate in innovative scientific exploration, 2) the REU students will be
allowed (at their own choosing with the advice of their research mentor) to
participate in hands-on exploration of biophysical methods and techniques
(HEBMAT) that will introduce them to various modern experimental and
computational research techniques. Thus, upon completion of the program the
students will have gained exciting research experience and will have acquired a
biophysical toolkit making them more successful and competitive in the
scientific and academic environment. This core experience will be augmented by
weekly research seminars and workshops, plus opportunities for social
interactions, which will often be coordinated with other summer undergraduate
research programs to broaden the students' integration into our scientific and
professional communities. This award is funded by the Division of Physics and
the Division of Chemistry within NSF.
