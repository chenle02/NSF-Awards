The award for "High-Performance Network Connectivity for the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln" is made under the high performance connections category of
DNCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides
support for interconnecting UNL's ATM-based campus network infrastructure to the
Very High-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) via the Great Plains network, a
high-performance regional network dedicated to supporting the research needs of
Great Plains universities. In addition to supporting meritorious research at the
University of Nebraska, the high performance connection to the vBNS will permit
the University to contribute more effectively to the Internet2 project as well
as participate with NCSA in PACI. The award will partially fund the installation
and operation of a DS-3 circuit from the Great Plains network gigapop in Kansas
City to a vBNS connection point in Chicago over a two-year period. Research
projects in the areas of earth systems science, inverse electrocardiography,
image understanding (image analysis), mobile IP and cryptography expect to make
use of the high-performance network partially supported by this award.
Collaborating institutions on these projects include the USGS/EROS Data Center,
the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the USDA/Natural Resources
Conservation Service, the USDA/Forest Service, NASA, the University of South
Carolina, Creighton University, South Dakota State University, Western Michigan
University, Kansas State University, Ben-Gurion University (Israel), the Salk
Research Institute, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Argonne National
Laboratory and various U.S. Air Force Laboratories. This award will allow the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln to expand its collaborative efforts.
