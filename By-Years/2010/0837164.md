Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is
addressing the learning of mechatronics in engineering technology through hands-
on experience in the laboratory and through internships. It is enhancing six
existing courses in electrical and mechanical engineering technology; developing
two new mechatronics engineering technology courses; and establishing one new
mechatronics laboratory facility to provide hands-on experience in designing,
controlling, and integrating packaging machinery systems. In doing this it is
incorporating experiential learning to make the courses more beneficial,
practical, and appealing to students. The investigators are partnering with
local industries, which are donating new equipment and hiring a substantial
number of interns from this program. Formative and summative evaluations, under
the direction of an experienced evaluator, are being performed at appropriate
times for assessment of curricular materials, objectives, outcomes, student
learning, experiential learning, and overall impact of the grant. The
dissemination plan includes conference presentations, journal publications,
participation in industry trade shows, and industrial publications. Broader
impacts include the dissemination of the materials, efforts to recruit minority
students into the program, a focus on making the laboratory material gender
neutral, and providing graduates that meet the needs of local
industries.&lt;br/&gt;
