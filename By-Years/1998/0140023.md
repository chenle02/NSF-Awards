Proposal title : Nonlinear Dispersive Equations.

In recent years there has been a significant progress on the study of
qualitative behavior of solution to nonlinear dispersive systems. The relation
between dispersive and nonlinear effects has motivated several remarkable works.
Among them one finds sharp local and global wellposedness theories under minimal
regularity assumptions on the data, precise blow up results as well as ill-
posedness ones. As a consequence our understanding of several phenomena in
nature is now more complete. The principal investigator will focus on several
representative problems connected with partial differential equations arising in
wave propagation and fluid mechanics.

The wave propagation in diverse mediums and the interaction of different kind
of waves can be modeled by complicated systems of partial differential
equations. These systems involve many variables which depends of the particular
physical setting of the problem. In many cases, these systems are too
complicated to be treated with reasonable accuracy, thus one has to consider
approximated models. The validity of these approximations is essential to
further study of the physical phenomenon. One has to give precise conditions
under which the qualitative behavior of the solution of these approximated
models captures the features of the physical setting. It is here where the
theoretical study of these solutions become essential. Thus, one starts with
special solutions and its properties, stability, long time behavior, ill-
posedness, etc. In situations where these theoretical results are unavailable
one needs to start the study with appropriate numerical simulations.
