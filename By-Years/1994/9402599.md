9402599 Gidley An interdisciplinary research program will be undertaken that
combines the well known defect sensitivity of positron techniques with state-of-
the-art positron beam technology in order to detect and image the early stages
of microstructural damage in a wide range of engineering materials where
traditional techniques are not adequate. The inability to characterize defect
evolution on the nanometer size scale represents a major missing link in the
fundamental knowledge of the synthesis-to-failure life cycle of many engineering
materials. If materials scientist can measure the microstructural evolution of
damage from synthesis to failure they will be greatly facilitated in improving
such material properties as strength and durability, wear and corrosion
resistance, environmental compatibility, and fabrication cost effectiveness. ***
