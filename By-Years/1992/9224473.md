This research combines experimental measurements of reaction kinetics in
titanium aluminide-based intermetallic alloys with detailed quantitative
transmission electron microscopy to study massive phase transformations. Changes
in atomic configuration occurring during phase transformation are examined and
the associated kinetic, thermodynamic, and crystallographic features are
explored. Novel experimental techniques incorporating a computer interfaced for
control and high speed data acquisition provide in situ measurements of K and
electrical resistivity. Controlled gas quenching permits variation in cooling
rate. The experimental measurements are incorporated in quantitative
thermodynamic models to establish mechanisms of interface migration. %%% New
alloys based on the titanium aluminide alloy system are of great importance for
applications in high temperature aerospace systems because of their unique
combinations of properties. Design of these alloys depends on understanding the
phase transformations and phase equilibria that control mechanical properties.
