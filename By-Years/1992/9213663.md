This grant will be used to support attendance of approximately ten US scientists
from academia and research institutes at a four day conference on Catalytic
Combustion at Chernogolovka (former Soviet Union) in September, 1992. The main
purpose of this conference is the sharing of US and Russian ideas on this topic,
in which the Russians have made numerous significant advances. The Russian hosts
will pay all local expenses for the participants, with the NSF support being
used to help defray travel expenses of the US participants. This workshop will
provide an opportunity for establishment of productive collaborations with
likely significant impact on future US research in the area of catalytic
combustion, an important technological process as regards energy utilization and
pollution control. Direct contact with Russian scientists, who have considerable
achievements in this area, is anticipated to have beneficial effects in
revitalizing US research and development in the field of catalytic combustion
via provision of unique insights into this process.
