In the physical-analytical sequence at Georgia State University, improvements
are being made in studies on solution phenomena and thermodynamic analyses, and
high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) is now the primary technique in the
chromatography area. Automated thermal and pH titration systems connected to
personal computers are being used by students to explore, in a biological
context, the thermodynamic and analytical aspects of proton transfer and metal
ion binding. Titrations with hundreds or even thousands of data points can be
performed on small volumes, thus allowing use of costly biological samples and
performance of up to ten times more experiments than at present. Students are
using HPLC to perform separations of optically active components, establish the
molecular weight distribution for sonicated DNA samples and amylose mixtures,
explore the analytical capabilities of chromatography and determine the
detection limits for a particular component in an analgesic. Extensive data for
several biological systems will be combined with the latest mathematical
treatments to provide physical parameters and their associated errors for each
system studied, and in some cases test the validity of chemical models. The
institution is contributing to this project and amount equal to the NSF funds.
