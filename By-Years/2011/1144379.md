Abstract - Ebert (FODAVA II Workshop)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Society, as well as
the science and engineering communities, is experiencing unprecedented growth in
our capability to generate and access data. Turning this data deluge into
usable, actionable information is a challenging, necessary task that is crucial
to effective decision making, scientific discovery, and engineering advances.
This growing need led to the development of the field of visual analytics. Key
findings over the past years have illustrated that collaboration and interaction
are key components that complete the integrated computational-human decision
making loop. This occurs at many levels from individual manipulation of data
representation to interactive cognitive discovery combined with automated
analysis, to coordinative and collective interactive analysis among groups of
individuals. Therefore, a research agenda for the "science of interaction" is
needed that will support ubiquitous and collaborative analysis and discovery
utilizing new, transparent interaction tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
workshop will help define the research topics within this Science of Interaction
for data and visual analytics. The workshop will gather leading researchers from
the variety of disciplines that underpin this new topic. Focal topics will be
(1) ubiquitous, embodied interaction; (2) capturing user intent to guide the
analytical process; (3) knowledge-based interfaces based on visual cognition and
machine reasoning; (4) effective collaboration and collaboration tools; (5)
principals of design, perception, and usability; and (6) composability and
integration of tools. The main outcome of the workshop will be the workshop
report defining a research roadmap for the Science of Interaction for Visual and
Data Analytics, as well as a summary paper to be submitted to IEEE Computer
Graphics and Applications? Visualization Viewpoints or IEEE Computer magazine.
