The applicant's research program, in general, involves elucidating the
relationship between molecular structure and material property by using
molecular orbital theory to obtain interaction potentials, and statistical
mechanical/molecular dynamics simulations to describe larger scale interactions
of molecular assemblies. The results will be applied to polymer/metal adhesion,
selective separations mediated by complexation, sorption and transport in
zeolites and alkane activation on transition metal surfaces.
