The proposed research consists of 3 main items. The first item aims to make use
of the noncommutative geometry framework in order to reformulate the index
formula in CR and contact geometry. It also fits nicely with the long term
program of Fefferman and Stein and others aiming to relate the subelliptic
analysis of the Kohn-Rossi to the CR geometry of the underlying manifold.
Moreover, it has some overlap with recent work of Epstein-Melrose-Mendoza. This
project has two natural follow-ups. One in collaboration with Henri Moscovici
dealing with an index formula for strictly pseudoconvex domains relating the
subelliptic analysis of the dbar-Neuman problem with the geometry of the domain
and its boundary. The other one aims to study Lorentzian manifolds with
Fefferman metric from a noncommutative geometric viewpoint, hence is a first
step towards a general noncommutative geometric study of Lorentzian manifolds.
The second item is a joint project with George Marinescu and deals with
obtaining CR analogues of the holomorphic Morse inequalities of Demailly in
order to get embedding theorems for CR and complex manifolds. The last item
proposes to to develop a geometrically adapted hypoelliptic calculus on
equiregular Carnot-Carath\'eodory manifolds in order to be able to make use of
the noncommutative geometry framework in this setting and to solve the Yamabe
problem on contact quaternionic manifolds.

The broader impact of this proposal is at two levels. The first level is within
mathematics but outside the scope of noncommutative geometry which is the
primary field of the PI. On the one hand, it is proposed to make use of the
framework of Connes' noncommutative geometry for solving geometric problems
related to CR, contact and complex manifolds. On the other hand, the
pseudodifferential tools of the part (iii) of this proposal will provide a
powerful tool for studying hypoelliptic PDE's. The second level is that of other
sciences. First, at illustrated by its part on Lorentzian geometry this proposal
aims to contribute to the compelling program of unifying quantum mechanics and
gravity, hence should contribute to a better understanding of the Universe.
Second, hypoelliptic PDE's arise in many fields of science, for example physics,
engineering, finance, and robotics. Therefore developing tools for studying
hypoelliptic PDE's should help making progress in these fields.
