This award is in support of a large international conference on validity issues
in assessment with a focus on validity in use (i.e., in practice by educators
and policymakers rather than researchers). There is a special focus on
innovations in assessment across the world with the notion that the US can learn
from these exemplars. The principle problems in validity of assessments lie in
the application and use of the assessments rather than in the tests themselves.
These problems have been ignored by stakeholders in the assessment industry and
research community to the detriment of the use of assessments in policy and
decision making. Two highly regarded organizations are working together in
sponsoring this conference---Teachers College and the Educational Testing
Service (ETS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge generated from
this conference will be disseminated through a published edited volume and
through a series of "e-flyers" written in user-friendly language and intended
for practitioners and policymakers.
