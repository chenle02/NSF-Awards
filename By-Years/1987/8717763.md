Salts of alkali metal anions (alkalides) or trapped electrons (electrides) will
be synthesized as homogeneous thin films by vapor deposition and as
microcrystalline films by solvent evaporation. The optical properties will be
studied by transmission spectra, reflectance spectra (from single crystals) and
fluorescence spectra. Electron energy loss spectra in a field emission scanning
transmission electron microscope will be measured. The conductivity and
photoconductivity of thin films will be determined in the vapor deposition
apparatus. Photoelectron emission and thermionic electron emission will be
studied by using both specialized equipment and the vapor deposition system. The
study of the optical and electronic properties of alkalides, electrides and
mixed systems should permit determination of the nature of electron.electron
interactions in a crystalline solid with weakly trapped electrons, the factors
which lead to electron spin pairing, and the nature of the metal.non metal
transition in a crystalline analog of metal.ammonia solutions. The weak binding
of electrons in electrides leads to thermionic emission and photoelectron
emission in the near infrared. Extension of these studies might lead to the
development of an infrared photoelectron emitter.
