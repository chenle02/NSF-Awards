This award will provide support for a broad program of observations to be made
with the Palomar and Keck telescopes in order to use the absorption lines in the
spectra of quasars to study the evolution of intergalactic clouds and the
interstellar gas in galaxies from their origin to the present epoch. Very high
resolution spectra will be obtained of a sample of very distant quasars in order
to make detailed studies of the absorption spectra produced by the light from
these quasars passing through intervening galaxies and intergalactic clouds. The
results from these studies will be used to study the physical nature of these
clouds. The Principal Investigator is regarded as a world authority on this
subject.
