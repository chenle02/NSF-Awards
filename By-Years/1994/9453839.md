9453839 Gal-OR This research will develop several theoretical models aimed at
understanding the state of the health care market. The models are developed to
capture the more realistic features of the health care market, including those
measures that are proposed by the Health Care Reform Task Force. The health care
market consists of patients, providers, insurance companies, "limited provider
plans", such as HMO's and PPO's, and government agencies. Given this complexity,
the study is designed to pay particular attention to institutional details. One
part of the study examines the extent to which the provider focuses on quality
versus price competition with other providers. Another part examines the
implications of the reimbursement rules and the malpractice law upon the choice
of a particular treatment that is selected by the provider. The last part
relates to the design of an optimal reimbursement rule aimed at inducing the
provider to allocate appropriate resources to improved quality and improved
efficiency in delivering the service to patients. This study is important
because it examines different dimensions of the decisions that could be made by
health care providers. Moreover, this framework makes it possible to evaluate
the implications of various proposals that are currently being considered and to
predict how the decision- making process efffects health care costs, the quality
of care provided to patients, and the size of the uninsured population.
