While fabricating techniques for organic matrix composites are well defined,
progress in processing of MMC has been hindered by high chemical reactivity and
poor wettability between the reinforcements and the matrix. The object of the
research program is to develop an alternative solution to these drawbacks
associated with existing technologies for fabricating metal matrix composites,
including their high costs. This objective will be achieved by completing a
series of detailed studies involving the use os spray atomization, injection,and
deposition of various types of metal matrix composites. The proposed research
will encompass experimental as well as computational approaches.
