The 2003 IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols will be held
November 4 in Atlanta, Georgia. This conference is one of the top conferences in
the networking field, and the only one that focuses specifically on aspects of
communication protocols -- one of the most important topics in networking today.
Funds are requested to support approximately 10 graduate (PhD) students to
attend ICNP, with the goal of increasing opportunities for future researchers to
make contacts and interact with those doing cutting-edge research. The target
"market" for this support is students who would not otherwise be able to attend
the conference, but who nevertheless should benefit from doing so--especially
students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:
students who receive awards will benefit from the opportunity to meet and
interact with many other researchers in a favorable setting, and from seeing
research presentations that relate to their own research, or may inspire them to
try a new direction. The research community and society benefit from the
resulting improvement of students in the pipeline, and everybody benefits from
increased diversity of participants attending the conference.
