9527833 Casper Under models that predict long-term changes in global climate,
semi-desert regions are expected to become even drier. The purpose of this study
is to predict how natural populations of plants in these regions will respond to
drought conditions. Most ecological studies of water use in plants have focused
on anatomical or physiological adaptations that allow particular species to
occupy dry habitats. There has been little effort to determine how populations
and communities will respond to temporal changes in water availability. To do
this, we need to understand how drought affects individuals depending on their
size, developmental stage, or associations with other plants. The investigators
will experimentally reduce the amount of rainfall received by natural
populations of the semi-desert herbaceous perennial Cryptantha flava by erecting
temporary shelters during spring rainstorms. The study is based on data
collected during a natural drought year indicating that larger plants are more
severely affected by drought than smaller plants. Comparisions will be made of
survival, growth and flowering of individuals of different sizes and in
different microhabitats, under shrubs or in the open, both in areas where water
has been reduced and in areas receiving natural rainfall. These demographic data
will be supplemented by measurements of water use, leaf nitrogen content, and
photosynthesis. These sorts of measurements will help to determine why
individuals respond to changes in water availability as they do. The
experimental reduction in water will be repeated spatially and in two different
years. Demographic and physiological measurements will be taken on the same
individuals in the year before drought, the drought year, and the year
afterwards. This replication of the experiment is important because natural
variation in rainfall is likely to occur during the experiment. The study should
also lead to identification of lingering effects that extend beyond the drought
year itself.
