Support is sought to upgrade climatological/meteorological laboratory facilities
in the Department of Geography at Michigan State University (MSU). The requested
equipment will improve the student-to-computer ratio in the dedicated
instructional laboratory. Computer-based exercises used in the introductory and
survey courses will be made possible with the proposed equipment. Students will
have access to all of the UNIX-based UNIDATA software packages and instructors
will be able to tap into community curriculum using the UNIDATA software. These
improved computer facilities will be available for climatological research,
particularly in the areas of graduate student and unfunded research.
