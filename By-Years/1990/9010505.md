This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of bioelectrochemistry. Professor Heller will study the fundamental
aspects of electron transfer by enzyme immobilized biosensors. This research
will use synthetic strategies developed by Professor Heller's group to prepare
novel enzyme systems that have electrically conductive redox couples attached
within the fabric of the enzymes. Electrochemical methods will be used to
evaluate the electron transfer properties of these modified enzymes while
immobilized on electrode surfaces. This research will have relevance to the
development of new analytical biosensors for use in a range of problems areas.
