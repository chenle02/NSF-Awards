9418812 Anandan This three-year award will support U.S.-U.K. cooperative
research in theoretical physics between Jeeva Anandan of the University of South
Carolina and Roger Penrose of the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford.
The objective of their research is to study a possible connection between
quantum mechanics and gravity. They will investigate unsolved problems in
quantum state reduction using quantum gravity, and will study the incorporation
of gravity into the geometry of quantum theory in Hilbert space. Theoretical and
experimental implications of quantum state reduction in superconductors and
molecular interferometry experiments will also be investigated. Dr. Anandan
brings to this collaboration his expertise in quantum geometry, foundations of
quantum theory, general relativity, and their relationship to each other. This
is complemented by the considerable experience and expertise of Dr. Penrose in
general relativity and the geometry of space-time and quantum gravity. The
project will advance understanding of the relationship between gravity and
quantum mechanics and will have important applications in subfields in physics,
astronomy, and chemistry. ***
