This project will provide shipboard scientific support equipment for the
research vessel ALPHA HELIX, an NSF-owned ship operated by the University of
Alaska, Institute of Marine Science, and dedicated to use in support of ocean
science research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides
funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of
ocean science research. This Program provides support for such items as deck
equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific
instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication
equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and
scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats
for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project
Director, Thomas D. Smith is fully qualified to direct this project having had
considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of
shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to replace two ten
year old life rafts, the bridge echo sounder a VHF radio, an outboard motor, a
de-watering pump, a self-contained breathing apparatus, and upgrade a science
refrigeration system.
