Dr. Montfort is studying the similarities and differences between how engineers
and engineering students categorize what they know. Existing research in the
fields of conceptual change and personal epistemology show that learning and the
application of what is learned both depend on the ways in which the new
knowledge is organized. This work utilizes the construct of domains as a means
to investigate the organizations of participants' knowledge at a meaningful
grain size. In this investigation practicing engineers are asked to describe the
domains of knowledge applied to real multi-disciplinary projects they have been
engaged in. Students are also interviewed about the domains of knowledge
involved in these projects. Thematic analysis based on an interactional approach
to personal epistemology provides a means to compare the domains of knowing
between the engineers and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it has not
been firmly established yet, existing research suggests that students' domains
of knowing do more to interfere with the application of their knowledge than to
facilitate it. In other words, the way students organize what they know may be
interfering with how able they are to apply it. Where an experienced engineer
might see a cohesive domain of knowledge -- such as "process engineering" for
example -- engineering students may instead see an arbitrary grouping of
otherwise dissimilar skills and ideas. Previous research emphasizes how students
struggle to learn the concepts of engineering, and treats the application of
that knowledge as a separate (if closely related) problem. This work develops a
potentially transformative new way of looking at it by focusing on the
organization processes that control both how something is learned and how it is
applied.
