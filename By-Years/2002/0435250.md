In addition to the traffic growth in the Internet, new applications and services
are imposing a large variety of requirements. At the same time, the emergence of
network applications on video, audio, business services, and other data ser-
vices is creating an imminent demand for integration of most traffic with de-
fined quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Examples of emerging network re-
quirements are directly related to reliability, recoverability, and security.
Al-though most of these requirements have kindled research interests in recent
years, it is still unclear how to integrate them for next generation networks.
To manage the increasing variety of QoS requirements, this research project pro-
poses a new service model concept, called service vector, as a solution for pro-
viding QoS support for a large variety of traffic classes. This concept is
expected to help achieving the following objectives: a) robust differentiated
service model capable of supporting fine QoS granularity; b) scalability; c)
satisfaction of the users' customized end-to-end requirements; d) improved
network operator revenue; e) higher utilization of the current Diffserv network
model. The com-plexity and feasibility of service vectors for the next
generation networks is in-vestigated, and the impact on router architectures and
deployment issues are considered for the implementation of service vectors in
new-generation and de-ployed routers.
