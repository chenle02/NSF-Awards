OCE93-14357 Williams The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will undertake an
Ocean Sciences Instrumentation development project to develop a low-cost,
modular 3-D acoustic current meter for moored, upper ocean measure- ments. The
development will be accomplished in incremental steps building from the existing
Benthic Acoustic Stress Sensor (BASS); through a single sensor cable suspended
instrument; to a self- contained flux meter configuration; and finally to a
modular, expendable velocity sensor. At each step, the prototype will be tested
in an experimental program. The self-contained flux meter will be tested in
DOE's Ocean Margin Program, and the modular velocity sensor will be tested as a
Richardson number float in association with a separate NSF project. During at
sea testing, an acoustic vorticity meter will be deployed to measure the shear
and turbulence associated with 3-D coherent motions of the Langmuir type. Each
prototype including the vorticity meter, will be tow or tank tested to determine
its flow distortion, wake obstruction, vortex shedding and compass response.
Measurement of flow is a first order task in ocean studies, yet except for
several specialized studies such as turbulence in boundary layer flows, one
depends on two axis velocity measurements from expensive (as opposed to
expendable) current meters for this flow determination. There are now three
general research areas where 3-D current meters are needed: in near surface
measurements where coherent 3-D motions are present and where surface and
internal waves produce significant vertical flow; in transport studies where the
product of vector flow with a scalar quantity must be averaged over time and
depth and perhaps across a section; and in vorticity resolving arrays for
determining shear in the presence of wave motions. The most promising
transitions to a 3-D solution today are acoustic techniques and this project
builds upon experience with an acoustic vector veloc imeter to address each of
these tasks.
