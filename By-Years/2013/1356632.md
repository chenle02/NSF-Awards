The University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) is providing training and financial
support for 20 academically talented, but financially challenged students in
Caribbean natural resource conservation and management in its Masters of Marine
and Environmental Science (MMES) program. The MMES program is responding to a
demonstrated need for professional training in this region with serious threats
to its natural resources and whose economic viability is closely tied to the
state of the local environment. UVI students and the U.S. Virgin Islands
population are comprised predominantly of groups underrepresented in STEM
related fields. Many individuals in these groups find that financing education
to the level of Masters of Science impossible and therefore move into other
careers. UVI is helping to fill the need for professionals with understanding of
Caribbean natural resource conservation and management by recruiting students
from under-represented groups and providing financial support, academic
tutoring, faculty mentors, and funding for research and travel to professional
meetings. The intellectual merit of UVI's S-STEM project is based in the MMES
program's success in involving students from under-represented groups early in
locally-relevant research and developing novel approaches to the conservation of
the natural resources of the Caribbean. This project has broad impacts within
the territory and beyond through its training of a diverse cadre of future
scientists who will ultimately be stewards of the natural resources of the
Virgin Islands and similar environments around the world.
