This proposal is a planning grant to develop a research program which probes the
mechanisms by which cyclometalation takes place. Issues to be addressed include
how the C-H bond approaches the metal atom, how the metal center prepares itself
for subsequent insertion into the C-H bond, whether the mechanism involves an
unsaturated metal site, how steric effects determine which C-H bond participates
in the reaction, and whether there is a difference between intermolecular and
intramolecular mechanisms. Chromium and tungsten phosphines and arsines will be
studied. Reactions will also be studied by flash photolysis to detemine whether
thermal and excited state reactions proceed by the same mechanisms. %%% This is
a planning grant to investigate the mechanism of a very widespread type of
reaction -- cyclometalation. The reaction is of considerable commercial
importance and a better understanding of it would be important to many
industrial processes.
