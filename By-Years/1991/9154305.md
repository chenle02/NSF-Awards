MIT is conducting a two-week summer workshop for college and university physics
faculty to exchange ideas and designs for advanced pedagogical experiments in
modern physics and to study the experiments currently in use in the MIT Junior
Physics Laboratory (the third-year course in experimental physics required for
MIT physics majors) for the purpose of evaluating them for possible reproduction
and use in similar courses at their home institutions. The MIT Junior Lab
experiments are designed for students who have completed an introductory course
in modern physics and are taking concurrently an introductory course in quantum
mechanics. The experiments provide hands-on experience with the phenomena of
particle, nuclear, atomic, condensed matter, statistical, and astro-physics. The
summer workshop will assist in the national effort to improve the quality of
undergraduate physics education. This project responds to a suggestion, put
forward at the Santa Fe Workshop on Undergraduate Curriculum Development (June
1-3, 1990), that universities with excellent advanced undergraduate laboratory
courses should organize summer workshops like the current one.
