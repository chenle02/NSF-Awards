AST-0307706&lt;br/&gt;Tully&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge of the process of galaxy
formation is fundamental to a proper understanding of our origins. Theory
predicts that for each big galaxy, there should be many little galaxies, but
this abundance is not found. Is the theory wrong, or are small galaxies somehow
concealed or suppressed? Current observations are not good enough, notably
because any effects are likely to depend on environment. This project will
dedicate considerable time to looking very hard in regions of varying galaxy
density, to try to establish whether there really is a conflict with model
predictions and whether there are any "signatures" which might identify the
governing physical mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This survey is made possible
by new wide-field electronic cameras on large telescopes, as well as the
availability of optical spectroscopic and radio wavelength facilities for
follow-up observations. The principal investigator has preferential access to
the telescopes and will be able to devote the necessary observing time to
establishing the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function and its dependence
on environment, much more accurately than is known
today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether there is agreement or disagreement, this
project will advance our understanding of a fundamental property of the
Universe, and will have a far-reaching influence. The researcher will pass the
results on to the general public through his continuing outreach and educational
activities.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
