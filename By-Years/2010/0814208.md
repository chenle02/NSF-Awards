What is lost when a language dies? How does each of the world's myriad
&lt;br/&gt;languages reflect a unique way of expressing human experience? As
linguistic diversity diminishes rapidly in the modern world, the documentation
and study of endangered languages becomes ever more pressing. With support from
the National Science Foundation, Dr. Timothy J. Thornes will work to preserve,
through intensive documentation via video and audio recordings, the Northern
Paiute language of the Great Basin region of western North America. His work
with some of the eldest and most fluent speakers and with teachers and students
of the language includes an ongoing exploration of how to make field work
relevant to the academic community as well as to the communities whose languages
are being lost. This study will provide insight into how this highly endangered
language with many complex features fits into a typology of the world's
languages. The project will expand the amount of quality materials for use by
the indigenous communities in their linguistic and cultural preservation
efforts. As North American Tribes, and endangered language communities
generally, begin to take stock of what is lost as speakers age, linguists and
anthropologists are also taking stock of the contribution each language makes to
our understanding of this most intimate expression of cultural
identity.&lt;br/&gt;
