The use of differential forms and algebraic topology have become indispensible
in theoretical physics. Application of this mathematical formalism to boundary
value problems of Maxwell's equations results in a clear articulation of
topolocial problems in engineering electronmagnetics and gives general
relationships between vector fields and lumped parameters. The calculation of
three dimensional electromagnetic fields on the largest of computers is a
challenging research area which also benefits from this mathematical formalism.
This research will extend the state of computational engineering in this area by
investigating o the implementation of algorithms which automatically find "cuts"
for magnetic scalar potentials in multiply connected current free regions; o the
practical use of variational principles which yield first order Euler- Lagrange
equations of the magnetic field, thereby avoiding the use of a vector potential;
o the algebraic topology of "Heegard Splitting of three dimensional homology
spheres" in order to develop algorithms for handling topological aspects of
three dimensional eddy current problems where a magnetic scalar potential is
used in current free regions.
