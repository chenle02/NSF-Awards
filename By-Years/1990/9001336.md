The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project between Dr. Leon
Chua of the University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. Tamas Roska of the
Hungarian Academy of Sciences' Computer and Automation Research Institute is to
investigate mixed-mode nonlinear computing structures. Efforts will include
three areas of emphasis: 1) determining the qualitative relationships between
analog and digital realizations of canonical nonlinear information processing
architectures; 2) simulating the quantitative problems of nonlinear programming
circuits and cellular neural networks; and 3) furthering functional design of a
mixed-mode nonlinear processing element to exploit analog dynamics and logical
decisions. Results are expected to extend nonlinear circuit theory and may lead
to a better undertanding of the operational limits of existing digitally-
realized networks and new nonlinear analog and mixed-mode computing. This
project in computer science fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
