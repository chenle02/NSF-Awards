Abstract ATM-9416296 Kaufman, Darrell Utah State University Title: SGER:
Feasibility Study: Coring Last Interglacial Deposits, Bristol Bay, Alaska The
aim of this research is to test the feasibility of obtaining a long (ca. 40 M)
sediment core from the northeastern coast of Bristol Bay, a tidal estuary in
southwestern Alaska. The service of a drill rig designed for coring, but
untested for paleoenvironmental and geochronological applications will be
contracted for this effort. Recovered core material will be analyzed for
paleomagnetic, tephrostratigraphic, and physical properties. The core site near
Dillingham is adjacent to well-studied coastal- bluff exposures, where the age
of sediments appears to be exceptionally well constrained. By extending the
stratigraphic record into the subsurface, the core will be used to test the age
assignment. Most importantly, sediments dating to the last interglaciation
should be found at relatively shallow depth and the Old Crow tephra (ca. 140 ka)
below that. Well-dated stratigraphic records of the last interglaciation are
rare in northern North America, yet are critically needed for testing climate
models under warmer-than-present conditions and for comparison with other long-
term paleoclimate records, including the new Greenland ice cores.
