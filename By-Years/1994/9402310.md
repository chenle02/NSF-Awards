The proposed work is to study the mesoscale transport and energization of
ionospheric plasmas on auroral flux tubes primarily with the Generalized
SemiKinetic (GSK) techniques developed in recent years at UAH. This hybrid ion-
incell/generalized electron fluid approach has demonstrated unique capabilities
for treating, over mesoscale (several RE), the transport of ionospheric plasma
under the influence of such effects as instability-driven microprocesses and the
combination of magnetospheric plasma- supported potentials and wave heating.
This approach incorporates the self-consistency of processes normally found in
"fluid" models while allowing the detailed study of ion distribution formation
normally restricted to test-particle studies. Using the newly- developed
techniques together with previously developed methods the areas of investigation
will include: the reaction of an auroral flux tube and plasma transport to
auroral electron beams; energetic plasma sheet plasmas and electric currents
with self-consistent ionization; time-dependent wave-driven conic generation;
and synergistic effects of hot plasma-driven potentials and wave fields,
including the development of the potentials themselves. New technical advances
in this research will include: (1) Incorporation of auroral electron beams into
the electrodynamics of the transport description; (2) Development of techniques
for coupling the GSK approach into the lower F and E-region ionosphere, with
specific allowance for self-consistent ionization and outflow generated by these
electron beams; (3) Improved approaches for treating the general electrodynamic
interaction of hot magnetospheric plasmas with the ionospheric outflow; and (4)
Development of improved algorithms for the incorporation of effects of the
Current-Driven Ion Cyclotron Instability (CDICI) into kinetic and generalized
transport models. Finally, interactive comparisons of the results with auroral
ion distribution function measurements from D E-1, Polar, Viking, Akebono, Freja
and other spacecraft are proposed.
