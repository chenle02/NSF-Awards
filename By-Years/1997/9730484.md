Funds are provided to complete a suite of laboratory analyses on partially
lithified sediments retrieved during ODP drilling. The objective of the study is
to constrain the changes in physical properties of sediments above, below and
within major fault zones and to integrate these data with seismic reflection
data to understand the mechanics and dynamics and enhance our ability to
interpret seismic data in various settings.
