This award provides partial support for a US electromagnetic (EM) geophysics
community-wide workshop. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together
academia, industry, and federal agencies to develop a coherent, coordinated plan
to insure a strong EM geophysics future. The workshop will address recent
concerns and set strategies to meet current and future research and workforce
demands for more highly trained EM geophysicists in the US. EM techniques are in
the forefront of geophysics in addressing many of today?s pressing societal
concerns such as energy and mineral resources, monitoring environmental
problems, and investigating near-surface regions of potential natural and man-
made hazards.

The funds ($20,000) will be used to partially cover travel, living expenses, and
incidentals for ~ 30-35 invited participants. These funds will be augmented by
industry support to complete the estimated cost to hold the workshop. The
workshop will be held at the University of California, Berkeley Faculty Club in
March, 2009.
