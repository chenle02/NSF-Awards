This action provides the base support for research during the initial year of
the Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) Award. The 5-year continuing project,
initiated in FY 90, will focus on the development of theoretical bases and
earthquake engineering applications of stochastic processes. Two major topics of
study will be pursued. (1) Stochastic Modeling of Plane Sources - Instead of
traditional model treating the seismic dislocation source as points along a
geological fault, a more refined and realistic plane model will be developed. A
continous source region is divided into a finite number of point dislocation
sources characterized by multiple correlated Poisson random processes. The near
field ground motions will be simulated by combining the deterministic wave
propagation model and the random seismic source model. (2) Sensitivity Analysis
of Earthquake Response of Structures - The measure of the sensitivity for a
structural system is defined by what is called a sensitivity function, which is
a scaler for the variation of a single parameter in a single-output system; a
vector for variations of multiple parameters in a single- output system; or a
rectangular matrix for variations of multiple parameters in a multiple-output
system. The sensitivity with respect to the time domain variations of mass,
stiffness and damping at the same time also will be investigated. The
sensitivity will be calculated from a set of sensitivity equations obtained from
the governing differential equations. For more complicated cases where multiple
outputs are considered, numerical computation and simulation techniques will be
used. Unlike the time domain analysis, the response sensitivity in the frequency
domain is independent of the input signals. Four measures of sensitivity,
namely, the Bode, Horowitz, comparison sensitivity functions and Root
sensitivities will be examined. These sensitivity analyses will be used to
evaluate the performance of the control of earthquake excited structures.
