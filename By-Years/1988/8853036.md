This award to Indiana University's Department of Geology is made in response to
a proposal submitted to the National Science Foundation's Instrumentation and
Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will provide one-half of the funds
needed to acquire a portable seismograph. The University is committed to
matching the NSF contribution for this equipment. The acquisition of the
seismograph will allow the department to design a set of laboratory and field
exercises for an introductory geophysics course intended to teach field methods
in seismic mapping and analytical techniques for processing and interpreting
seismic refraction and reflection measurements.
