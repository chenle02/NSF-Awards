Deficiencies exist in current practices in collection and dissemination of
strong ground motion and building response data. This project aims at applying
modern technology to provide an inexpensive and efficient medium for the data
base management of such earthquake records. The research team of the University
of Illinois and U.S. Geological Survey and Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory
will collect all existing accelerogram data recorded free-field, as well as, on
structures. These data will be uniformly processed, recorded on compact disks
and distributed to all interested users. This will provide an extremely valuable
research data base at a very low cost and which is accessible with a
minicomputer.
