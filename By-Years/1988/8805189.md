Eugenio Calabi and his colleagues will continue organizing the annual Geometry
Festivals. These will be held at the universities of North Carolina and Maryland
and at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Over the past three
years these meetings have attracted top class geometers from a wide region. They
provide an excellent setting for discussion of current research problems and for
the initiation of collaborative projects.
