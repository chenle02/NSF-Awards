The PI proposes study, using a number of state-of-the-art experimental
techniques, a long-standing-but still inadequately understood-problem of fluid
mechanics and heat transfer. Annular flow, in which vapor flows through the
center of a tube surrounded by a thin film of liquid on the wall, is the
dominant flow condition in many heat exchanger applications involving
evaporation or condensation. The results could lead to improved models for flows
in power, refrigeration and air-conditioning systems, with less reliance on
empirical data gathered over a narrow range of operating conditions. An
educational development plan includes non-traditional approaches to the therm-
fluids cycle of the undergraduate curriculum, as well as incorporation of
research results into upper level courses in multiphase flow and convective heat
transfer.
