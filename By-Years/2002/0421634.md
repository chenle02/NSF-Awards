The genome of tomato (Solanum lycopersicon) contains approximately 950 million
base pairs of DNA, more than 75% of which is densely packed and largely devoid
of genes. The majority of genes are found in long contiguous stretches of gene-
rich DNA located on the distal portions of each chromosome arm. In this project,
we will lay the foundation for the sequencing of the gene-rich regions of all 12
tomato chromosomes by an international consortium as part of the Solanaceae
Genomics Project or "SOL" (http://www.sgn.cornell.edu/solanaceae-project/).

The project will generate sequences from a sheared tomato DNA library to gain
more insight into the structure of the tomato genome, and sequence 400,000
Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) ends to generate a sequence connector
database. In addition, 20 carefully chosen BACs from the 5 US chromosomes will
be fully sequenced. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis will be
performed with about 50 selected BACs to further define the gene-rich regions in
tomato.

The Solanaceae Genome Network (SGN, http://www.sgn.cornell.edu/), a relational
database and website devoted to the genomics of solanaceous species, will be
expanded to accommodate and incorporate all of the sequencing, annotation and
mapping information generated from this project.
