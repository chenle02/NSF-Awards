This Early Grant for Exploratory Research seeks to investigate the viability of
a knowledge-rich, joint-learning approach to coreference resolution, with the
ultimate goal of advancing the state of the art in coreference resolution. Given
recent advances in research on lexical semantics and discourse, and the
development of large-scale lexical databases, the first objective of this grant
is to investigate whether existing language technologies are mature enough to
accurately extract semantic, discourse, and world knowledge from structured and
unstructured data so that learning-based coreference systems can be
significantly improved when such knowledge is employed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An
assumption underlying the first objective is the use of a pipeline system
architecture, where sophisticated linguistic information from various sources is
computed prior to coreference resolution. While a pipeline architecture is
popularly-used in coreference research, the errors made by the upstream
components may propagate to the coreference component and adversely affect its
performance. To address this problem, the second objective of this grant is to
explore an approach in which multiple tasks in the pipeline are learned in a
joint fashion. While most research on joint learning for language processing
focuses on two tasks, this work seeks to take the challenge involved in joint
learning to the next level by simultaneously learning a large number of tasks in
semantics, discourse, and information extraction, which can all benefit from
their interactions with each other and with coreference in the learning process.
