This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at the
University of Alabama in Huntsville in the summer of 2012 on the topic of small
deviation probabilities. The principal speaker will be Professor Wenbo Li from
the University of Delaware. This award will support 25 participants at different
stages of their careers.

The conference has three main technical goals: to systematically study the
existing techniques and applications related to small deviation probabilities,
to develop new methods of estimating small deviation probabilities for Gaussian
and related random processes, and to reformulate and investigate problems in
other areas of mathematics from the point of view of small deviation
probabilities. The conference aims to engage participants from a wide variety of
disciplines, including mathematics, engineering, finance, and economics, in a
discussion of this timely topic and to attract new researchers and students to
the field.
