This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures
and programs. Women and students from underrepresented minorities within the
electrical and computer engineering programs are being especially targeted for
support. Electrical and computer engineering are the least diverse of all of the
engineering programs, and this project will serve as a national model for
improving recruitment and persistence for students from underrepresented groups
in these fields. The scholars are participating in a wide variety of
professional development activities as well as one-on-one faculty mentoring.
Features of the program include well-structured academic advising, establishment
of social networks, study skills and strategies workshops, and role model
seminars. The results from the project are being rigorously evaluated through
both qualitative and quantitative measures.
