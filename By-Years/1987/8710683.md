The moss, Funaria hygrometrica, is an excellent model system in which to study
the control of cell division during plant development. Biochemical and
ultrastructure studies during bud initiation have implicated the membrane
associated calcium as a second messenger and the involvement of the cytoskeleton
in the ordered events leading to bud formation. Dr. Mary McCauley will continue
these studies in Dr. Peter Hepler's laboratory with the following approaches. 1.
Examination of cytoskeletal organization under both normal developmental
conditions and experimentally-manipulated conditions of Ca-stimulation or
inhibition using immunofluorescent and fluorescent labelling of tubulin and
actin in situ and, when warranted, a freeze fixation, freeze substitution method
of electron microscopic preparation; 2. analysis of membrane distribution and
relationships during both normal and calcium-modulated development, with
particular emphasis on the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum and any
interconnections between the two; 3. ultrastructrual localization of calcium
during cytokinin-induced bud initiation using an oxalate- precipitation, freeze-
substitution procedure, followed by electron microprobe x-ray analysis; Cell
division during reproduction of a plant must be a series of events which lead to
the progeny cell. This work will help to illuminate those events and the order
in which they occur.
