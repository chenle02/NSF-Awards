This project will deploy an array of 14 three-component ocean- bottom
seismometers to record earthquakes for a period of about eight weeks at two
sites along the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The objectives are to: (1) locate
the hypocenters of earthquakes within the median valley; (2) conduct source
mechanism studies of located earthquakes; (3) invert P and S wave travel time
and attenuation differences; and (4) define the relationships among earthquakes
locations and source characteristics, and structural heterogeneity to segment
length, median valley width, axial topographic relief and mantle Bouguer
anomaly.
