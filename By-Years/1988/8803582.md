This proposal concentrates on new phenomena in liquid crystals, (LC's) and this
is the strength of the effort. The research concerns the mechanical properties
of nematics formed from long chain rigid or semi-rigid polymers and includes a
newly recognized large class of liquid crystal based on molecular aggregates
which form colloidal ordered phases. The latter exhibit properties intermediate
among those of polymers, rigid rods, and detergent micelles.
