Energy-efficiency is vital for pervasive computing. Small,
mobile&lt;br/&gt;computers such as handhelds are battery powered. They must
carefully&lt;br/&gt;manage their limited energy supply in order to run
demanding&lt;br/&gt;applications for long periods of time. Pervasive computers
are also&lt;br/&gt;increasingly well-connected to the Internet by wireless
networks.&lt;br/&gt;However, connectivity is costly: communication is a large
and growing&lt;br/&gt;portion of their power budgets. Current data access
mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;exacerbate the problem---they substantially increase the
energy cost&lt;br/&gt;of communication because they are optimized for
performance, not&lt;br/&gt;energy-efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
investigates how to build energy-efficient distributed&lt;br/&gt;file systems
for pervasive computing. The first step is building&lt;br/&gt;measurement
infrastructure that precisely captures the communication,&lt;br/&gt;storage, and
computation costs of data access. The next step is&lt;br/&gt;characterizing the
energy usage of existing distributed file systems&lt;br/&gt;and identifying
characteristics that increase energy-efficiency. The&lt;br/&gt;final step is
building a new, energy-efficient file system that&lt;br/&gt;enables pervasive
computers to maintain connectivity without&lt;br/&gt;compromising battery
lifetime. This research thus allows pervasive&lt;br/&gt;computing devices to be
incorporated into everyday activities. For&lt;br/&gt;example, all-day battery
life is essential for projects that deeply&lt;br/&gt;integrate handheld
computers into classroom activity.&lt;br/&gt;
