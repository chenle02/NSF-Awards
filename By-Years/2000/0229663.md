Ryan&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0229663&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will define the
roles of the mantle wedge and subducting slab in generating volcanic arc lavas
using B-Be-Li abundances and Li isotopes. The main scientific goal of the
project is to better constrain the geochemical variability of sub-arc mantle
regions, and the origins of that variation. Two different but comparable
subduction systems will be studied: the Trans-Mexican Volcanic belt (TMVB) and
the more vigorously subducting and B-enriched Guatemala segment of the Central
American arc. These systems have low B/Be ratios and abundant off-axis
volcanism, and offer the opportunity to assess the role of the mantle and
constrain effects of crustal assimilation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
will be conducted in two phases: 1) an undergraduate summer research experience,
where students from the University of South Florida and other participating
institutions measure B-Be-Li elemental abundances in lavas from these suites,
and 2) MS/PhD student research on the Li isotope systematics of lavas from the
TMVB, Guatemala, and key intraplate volcanic sites. This work plan will train a
cadre of undergraduate and graduate students in the use of geochemistry as a
tool in the study of volcanic arcs. &lt;br/&gt;
