Abstract 9531589 Miller The REU Site at the University of Michigan-Dearborn is
established to perform applied research in the areas of machine vision, OCR,
address block recognition, pattern recognition, and image processing. Up to ten
students will be selected for this program annually. The students will work
closely with a faculty advisor in the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering at UM-D. The research facilities at UM-D available for this project
includes the Image Analysis Laboratory, Machine Vision Research Laboratory,
Signal Processing Laboratory and the Engineering Computer Facilities.
