9731188 CARIGNAN This proposal requests support for shipboard scientific support
equipment for the research SAVANNAH to be operated by the Skidaway Institute of
Oceanography, and dedicated to use in support of ocean science research. The
Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment
deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. This
Program provides support for such items as deck equipment including winch
systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational
equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point
the location of research sites, communication equipment including radio
transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data
communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting
scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project Director, Steven J.
Carignan is fully qualified to direct this project having had considerable
experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard
equipment. This project will assist the institution in the outfitting of the R/V
SAVANNAH which will replace the R/V BLUE in 1999. The R/V SAVANNAH is being
built with institution funds. NSF funds will be used to acquire an A-Frame, a
J-Frame, a CTD winch, a workboat and several safety related items. ***
