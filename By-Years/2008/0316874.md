When bacteria are exposed to harsh environmental conditions, they often respond
by forming spores that enable them to survive until conditions become more
favorable for growth. This project studies the sporulation process in the Gram-
negative bacterial species, Myxococcus xanthus. In response to starvation, M.
xanthus cells aggregate and form multi-cellular, spore-filled fruiting bodies.
As cells aggregate and form spores, they begin to communicate with one another,
a process essential for the formation of fruiting bodies. The goal of this
research is to identify proteins that are important in the sporulation process.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis will be used to identify M. xanthus proteins
that are expressed at relatively high levels in the spore cells compared to non-
spore cells (vegetative cells). Once differentially expressed proteins are
identified, the genes responsible for making these proteins will be
characterized by mutational analysis. For the mutational studies, M. xanthus
strains carrying inactivated copies of potential spore genes will be tested to
see what sporulation defects, if any, occur when vegetative cells are exposed to
starvation. By using a combination of proteomic and mutational analyses, the
researchers will begin to unravel the molecular pathways of spore formation in
M. xanthus. Spore formation is a concern in such diverse areas as food safety,
bioterrorism, and infectious disease, and a better understanding of the
biological process of spore formation is clearly important. There is little
information available about spore formation in Gram-negative species, although
the process is more well-studied for the Gram-positive species. Minority
students will be actively recruited for this project, which will involve both
undergraduate and graduate students. The students will receive valuable training
in proteomics and genetics.
