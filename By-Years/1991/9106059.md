The Institute for Algebra and Combinatorics at the University of California,
Santa Barbara will purchase equipment which will be dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
research projects, including in particular: numerical solution of partial
differential equations, algebraic geometry and three manifolds, polynomial
invariants and the combinatorial classification of knots and links, and three-
dimensional incompressible swirling flows.
