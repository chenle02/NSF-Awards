Pinto 9501634 This award is made under the auspices of the NSF Faculty Early
Career Development (CAREER) program. As a CAREER awardee the investigator is
expected to pursue an active education plan in addition to his scientific
research project. Supernovae are the largest (well-observed) explosions in
astrophysics. They act as laboratories for the study of hydrodynamics, are the
dominant driver of galactic chemical evolution and, if used with careful
corrections, may be used as large-scale cosmic distance indicators. Pinto will
improve his supernova atmosphere computer code, which is used to model spectra
and light curves of supernovae at all energies from gamma rays through the far
infrared. With the improvements the model code will be used for studies in all
of the areas mentioned above. The education component of the planned research
includes teaching several undergraduate and graduate courses, including setting
up a computer laboratory with specialized software for astronomy undergraduates
and non-majors to use in conjunction with their astronomy classes. ***
