This award will support collaborative research in heterocyclic chemistry between
Dr. Albert Padwa, Emory University, and Dr. Christopher Moody, Imperial College
of Science, London, England. The objective of the project is the development of
a general, broadly applicable method for the synthesis of novel heterocyclic
systems. Emphasis will be placed on the use of a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition
chemistry for the construction of a variety of interesting heterocycles. Among
the reactions to be studies are cycloaddi- tions of carbonyl ylides, azomthine
ylides and thicarbonyl ylides. The project will focus on using the rhodium
catalyzed reaction of diazo carbonyl compounds as a method for generating a
variety of 1,3-dipoles. The project will benefit from the complementary
expertise of the two investigators. The area of proposed research is of
paramount importance in the pharmaceutical industry, as well as in the areas of
agricultural and photographic chemicals. The joint effort of these two
researchers is likely to make a fundamental contribution to the above fields.
