Remote sensing with electromagnetic waves represents an area of research that
can result in significant societal benefits as well as present an excellent
domain for electrical engineering research. The problems associated with the
interaction of electromagnetic energy and clouds, rain, vegetation, soil, and
minerals have not been solved and need more research activity. A firm,
theoretical set of models is developed to explain the data that experimentalists
are trying to collect. At this time no good model exists that can help people
searching for more information concerning the environment.
