Established software approaches in mapping and matching of a large collection of
multimodality cross-subject data is becoming a bottleneck for the overall work
stream and hindering progress in understanding and utilization of large-scale
data for scienti√ûc discovery. In many scenarios, intrinsic geometric structures
embedded in 3D imaging of real-world objects are very effective in mapping
individual objects for interpretation of their similarity and disparity. But
recent computational techniques are still focused on the extraction and
measurement of geometric and physical properties in a single dataset. Global
modeling of geometric data and assessment of patterns and relationships of
related information within and across large individual datasets are under-
explored. A rigorous computational framework that tightly couples geometric
mapping and matching is of great importance to accomplish integrative analysis
of a variety of underlying relationships in features of contained in large-scale
image datasets and advance 3D imaging informatics substantially. This EAGER
proposal focuses on potentially transformative research ideas and approaches in
Riemannian geometry mapping and geometric diffusion, which are tightly coupled
together to establish the accurate mapping and matching across a large number of
subjects
