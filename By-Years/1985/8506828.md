An artificial intelligence (AI) workstation is purchased for use in the newly
established Engineering Expert Systems Lab. The acquisition of such equipment
will considerably enhance the research efforts of a large number of faculty
involved in the development of expert systems, primarily in the areas of
mechanical design and manufacturing. Development of such systems involves the
use of symbolic languages, such as LISP and PROLOG, but the architecture of
general purpose computers is not suitable for such languages. Additional
hardware is needed for fast symbolic and logical processing, as well as
additional local memory, to increase efficiency. AI workstations fulfill these
needs and thus reduce considerably the development time for expert systems.
