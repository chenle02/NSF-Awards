This proposal is funded to generate high-resolution records of SST and SSS along
a latitudinal transect containing high resolution cores in the western tropical
Pacific and from speleothems from deep caves from northeastern India and eastern
China. The two records will be correlated to test the temporal and spatial
pattern of millennial scale climate variability pertaining to atmospheric
convection and/or the position of the ITCZ. From this analysis ENSO mode d
magnitude can be reconstructed.
