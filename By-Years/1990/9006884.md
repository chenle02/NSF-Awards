The objective of the research is to evaluate the impact of shared database and
automated planning tools on cost and performance of design organizations under
different management models. This study will produce the following specific
outcomes: (1) A family of models which predict design process cost dependence on
product mix and incorporate cost factors reflecting shared design and automated
planning methods. (2) A case study of design organization and cost at a major
electronics manufacturer which validates these models under conditions of known
management structure and known design methods for a real product family. (3)
Refined scenarios for integration of shared database and automated planning
tools under two alternative management models: separate design and manufacturing
functional groups, and joint design and manufacturing working groups. (4) An
analytical evaluation of the scenarios and a critical review by industrial
participants. (5) Consolidation and dissemination of results through reports,
seminars, and conference presentations. (6) A Workshop on Management of Design.
