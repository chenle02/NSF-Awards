This proposal requests funding to design an integrated, portable neurovisual
assessment system with the following capabilities: 1) custom software with user-
friendly script language to program independent and multiple, simultaneous
visual stimuli to the left and right eye for non-engineers, 2) simultaneous eye
movement and sensory neuro-electrical activity quantification from visual
stimuli, and 3) data analysis algorithms to determine potential physiological
measurements or biomarkers that are sensitive and specific in identifying
neurological and visual deficits. This transformative project will enable basic
and clinical research scientists to assess neuro-visual functions in normal and
impaired populations. This system will be integrated into the PIs' undergraduate
and graduate courses. It will enable about 200 students annually to train in
imperative skills needed in the growing Biomedical Engineering field (e.g.
collect and analyze physiological data). It will be used for tours to introduce
over 350 4th to 12th grade students annually to Engineering and Mathematics. The
first application of this project will be to evaluate biomarkers to aid in the
diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).
