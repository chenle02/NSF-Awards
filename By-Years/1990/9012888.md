The investigator proposes to develop a project to examine the effect of chronic
exposure to low-level concentrations of pesticides and their interaction with
other environmental factors on the growth, reproduction and respiration of
marine and freshwater crustaceans. Of particular interest would be the combined
effect of pesticides and environmental factors such as temperature, salinity and
pH on the common shore shrimp, Palaemonetes vulgaris; the freshwater flea,
Daphnia pulex and the scud, Gammarus pseudolimnaeus. The compounds to be
investigated include representatives of two major classes of insecticides: the
organosphosphate malathion, and the carbamate aldicarb, as well as the triazine
herbicide atrazine. Short term bioessays will be conducted to determine the
minimal concentration for each substance that will affect the reproduction,
morphology and respiration of the organisms. Although short term effects will be
documented, the primary interest of the investigation is to study the long-term
effect on the organisms resulting from continuous exposure to low-level
concentrations of pesticides in combination with other factors.
