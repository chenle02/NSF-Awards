This award provides funding for the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics
(JINA). The Institute acts as a broad forum for a collaborative and synergistic
approach in addressing two fundamental problems posed in Nuclear Astrophysics,
The Origin of the Elements and the fate of matter at the extreme conditions of
Neutron Star Laboratories. JINA involves scientists from three universities, the
University of Chicago, Michigan State University and the University of Notre
Dame, in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory, the SciDAC Center at
the University of California at Santa Cruz and the University of Arizona, and
the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California at Santa
Barbara. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The JINA collaboration represents a spectrum of
nuclear astrophysics experimentalists, modelers, and observers who focus their
research programs on two fundamental research components and related problems.
The first research component focuses on the laboratory and computational aspects
of the associated nucleosynthesis processes. The second research component is
focused on exploring the rapid nucleosynthesis during the thermonuclear runaways
in the outer atmosphere of accreting neutron stars and the fate of their ashes
in the deeper layers of the neutron star crust. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;JINA will
organize an extensive series of workshops and exchanges of visitors as well as
students with leading groups and institutes in all relevant fields in the US and
worldwide. This allows JINA to address the open questions in nuclear
astrophysics in a cross-disciplinary, coherent approach and to solve the
relevant astrophysical and nuclear problems simultaneously. For nuclear
astrophysics, such an approach is essential, as various aspects of the field are
connected in complex and sometimes unexpected ways. A key element in JINA is an
interdisciplinary educational program. Exchange of junior researchers between
the associated institutions is a key in overcoming traditional field boundaries.
An extensive outreach program addresses the public and helps to attract young
people to pursue a career in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-
funded by the Physics Division and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in
the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
