The proposed work creates human language resources to stimulate research in
three important areas: (a) automatic language identification-- the problem of
identifying the language being spoken; (b) robust speech recognition-- the
problem of recognizing speech from different microphones, communication
channels, and environmental conditions; and (c) speaker recognition-- the
problem of identifying a speaker based on his or her voice characteristics. To
support research in automatic language identification, over two minutes of
speech from 300 speakers in each of twenty two language is being collected. To
support research in robust recognition, about two minutes of cellular speech
from several thousand speakers is being collected. To support research in
speaker recognition, twelve hundred speakers are providing speech samples during
ten telephone calls over a two year period. For each corpus, the speech is
annotated orthographically, and a portion of each corpus is transcribed
phonetically. A critical need for annotated speech corpora is met by this work:
to stimulate research in three important areas of human language technology,
leading to secure access to the information highway by any person who speaks a
language.
