CBET- 0848013&lt;br/&gt;Wooldridge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
support for graduate-student travel to the 6th US National Combustion Meeting,
organized by the Central States Section of the Combustion Institute. The meeting
will be hosted by the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor MI from 17-20 May
2009. NSF funds are targeted to increase the participation of graduate students
at the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1999, the three United States sections
of the international Combustion Institute - Eastern States, Central States, and
Western States - initiated a biennial series of national meetings on combustion.
These meetings have been highly successful, based on the attendance and the
number of presentations. Consequently, this biennial event has gained a
prominent stature and become the premier national conference in fundamental and
applied combustion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will consist of three
days of primarily contributed presentations organized in multiple parallel
sessions each day. (Typically, there are six parallel sessions or more.) The
contributed presentations will include both podium and poster presentations. A
few invited speakers will also present each day. Information about the
availability of travel support to graduate students will be provided in all the
meeting announcements and on appropriate websites. In addition, an announcement
about the availability of travel support will be mailed to members of the
Combustion Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combustion research is a multi-
disciplinary field encompassing diverse disciplines in engineering and science.
Society relies on combustion for power generation, transportation, and
manufacturing. This conference allows combustion-focused researchers to exchange
ideas in a stimulating technical forum. Policymakers will also be in attendance
to participate in the exchange of information. The intellectual merit of this
activity arises from the participation of combustion experts from across the
United States and from various countries, dissemination of their technical
findings, their communications with students, and their visions of future
research directions.
