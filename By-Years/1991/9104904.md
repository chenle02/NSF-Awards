This award partially supports the 1991 Gordon Research Conference on Statistics
in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. The award will supplement funding
provided by the special fund of the Summer Gordon Research Conference to provide
travel and subsistence expenses for the scientists who will be speakers and
discussants. The 1991 Gordon Research Conference will involve leading
statisticians, chemists, and chemical engineers from industry, government, and
universities and from other countries. The presentation and discussion will
focus on innovative research ideas in applied statistics used in the analysis of
chemical phenomena.
