9420986 Dyer There is circumstantial evidence that plants absorb certain
compounds secreted by herbivores (e.g.,in saliva) and use these as cues for
initiation of compensatory growth or induced defenses. If this view is correct,
it has important implication for understanding the dynamics of plant animal
interactions. However, to date there is no convincing direct evidence that this
is occurring. This project is establishing definitively whether carbon-based
compounds secreted by insect herbivores enter plant tissues during or after
herbivory. This project utilizes the Lawrence Livermore National Lab's
accelerator mass spectrometry to estimate the carbon mass from herbivore
regurgitates entering 14C-depleted experimental plants. This research will
improve our understanding of the dynamics of plant-herbivore interactions. The
results will have potential application to pest control in agriculture and
forestry.
