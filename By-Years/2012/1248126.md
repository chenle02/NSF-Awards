This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on the
development of carbon nanotube ultrafiltration (CNT-UF) membranes with high flux
and uniform pore size. Carbon nanotubes are known to enhance flux in membranes
for water and gas applications. Initial studies have shown that we can produce
membranes with higher flux and better selectivity than commercial UF membranes.
It is anticipated that the CNT-UF membranes developed in this project will have
significantly higher flux than current commercial membranes, achieve good
natural organic matter rejection, and have excellent chemical resistance. This
project enables fabrication and optimization of high performance CNT-UF
membranes. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that
carbon nanotube ultrafiltration membranes with higher flux and improved
rejection will result in energy and cost savings in a broad set of applications.
Applications include but are not limited to treatment of surface water for
potable water production, pretreatment for seawater desalination using reverse
osmosis, municipal and industrial wastewater reclamation and a variety of other
industrial processes. More efficient desalination, water reclamation, and reuse
will reduce water scarcity. Improved ultrafiltration technology will reduce
strain on water resources and aid in securing a supply of fresh drinking water
worldwide.
