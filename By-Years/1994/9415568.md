9415568 EGLINGTON This ancient, and potentially refractory material is
particularly difficult to quantify, and represents an unknown ("hidden")
component of the total organic carbon (TOC) in marine sediments. The reason for
the paucity of information lies in the difficulty in making direct measurements
of this elusive carbon pool. Kerogen, the dominant fraction of organic carbon in
sedimentary rocks is difficult to characterize, being inert and lacking
structural characteristicity. The PI proposes to use the fact that weathered
carbon will, by definition, have an infinite radiocarbon age (i.e. "14C-dead")
to determine its significance in marine sediments. Specifically, the PI will
radiocarbon date individual sedimentary organic compounds in order to establish
discrete ages for different OC pools. The overall objectives of the proposed
project are to: 1.) Determine the age distribution of co-deposited sedimentary
organic matter, 2.) Assess the proportion of weathered (14C-dead) organic carbon
in recent marine sediments.
