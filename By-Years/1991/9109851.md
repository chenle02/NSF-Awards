A crucial step in the sense of smell is that where odorous compounds first bind
to the ciliary membranes of the receptor cells in the nose. Biochemical research
has revealed many of the steps in this transduction, by which the binding of a
molecule is converted into a nerve signal carried to the brain. However it is
not yet clear exactly where and how the important binding proteins are localized
in the membrane, nor when during development these proteins become incorporated
to function properly. This project uses a variety of biochemical tagging
techniques along with electron microscopy to reveal where and when during
development several important classes of olfactory transduction proteins are
expressed in the ciliary membranes. These results will be correlated with the
developmental timing of known electrophysiological and other cellular changes,
to test predictions about the relation of membrane structures to function. The
findings will have an impact on chemosensory research, and on general
neuroscience because of the similarity of olfactory binding processes to cell-
cell communication.
