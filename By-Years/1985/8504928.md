This research focuses on manipulator control techniques for improved
performance, and a method to enable manipulators to be more easily programmed
off-line. The research topics for improving manipulator performance are:
implementation of a time-optimal control algorithm, development of a control
scheme which will eliminate manipulator vibrations due to lumped-parameter
flexibilities, and development of a model-referenced adaptive control scheme.
This research will improve the manner in which manipulators are programmed. An
algorithm will be developed for large motion trajectory planning which will give
the minimum-time, collision-free path through a workspace containing obstacles.
For each of these topics, effort will be made to ensure that the algorithms can
be implemented in software and hardware using state-of-the-art electronics and
parallel processing techniques. Experimental test apparatuses will be used to
test the algorithms whenever possible.
