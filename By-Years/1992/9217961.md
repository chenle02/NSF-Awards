The effective temperatures, surface gravities, luminosities and masses of white
dwarfs and stars which are approaching the white dwarf stage of evolution will
be measured. These parameters will permit tests of the interior structure of
white dwarfs, allow better interpretation of x-ray and ultraviolet observations
of these stars and test our understanding of physical processes in these stars.
Similar observations of hot subdwarfs will yield space densities for such stars.
Faint, red main sequence stars will be observed to obtain basic parameters and
determine the lower mass limit for stars. Chromospheric activity and the
dynamical properties of the lowest mass stars will also be analyzed.
