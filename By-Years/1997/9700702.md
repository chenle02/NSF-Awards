EEC-9700702 Abstract The award provides funding to the University of Notre Dame
under the direction of Dr. Michael M. Stanisic, for the support of a Combined
Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, "Vision-Based Control of
Dextrous Manipulators in High Precision Tasks." This project will develop a
four-course sequence for upper-level undergraduate and entry-level graduate
students at the University of Notre Dame. The sequence will teach students about
the design and control of a new class of dextrous manipulators, capable of
manufacturing tasks which are prohibitively difficult or costly to achieve with
existing technology. The capstone course in the sequence involves students
programming a dextrous manipulatory to perform such manufacturing tasks, tasks
drawn from an Industrial Advisory Panel, which is a key element of this project.
The research aspect of the proposal extends the technologies involved,
developing a new type of singularity-free manipulator, as well as extending the
calibration-free, vision-based control algorithm to an easily used "point-and-
click" means of task programming.
