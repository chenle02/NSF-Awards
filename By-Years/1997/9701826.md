9701826 A four-year program of research and education is proposed, covering a
range of topics connected by a common concern with OBJECTS and concentrating in
two major areas: (1) development of STATIC TYPE SYSTEMS for object-oriented
languages and (2) study of CONCURRENT and DISTRIBUTED OBJECTS. Specific goals
include: comparison and consolidation of different type-theoretic models of
objects; investigation of the key mechanism of "polymorphic update" of
structured data; development of useful partial type reconstruction techniques
for languages with subtyping and polymorphism; investigation of the role of
parametric polymorphism in modular reasoning about concurrent systems; and the
study of type systems capable of ensuring various forms of noninterference
between concurrent activities. An important research vehicle is the experimental
programming language Pict, a testbed for statically typed concurrent programming
using objects, based directly on Milner's pi-calculus. Teaching projects focus
on the development of the programming languages area at Indiana University;
major goals include a new core course on Type Systems and a course on avant-
garde "web languages." ***
