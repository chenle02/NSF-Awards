The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a widely-distributed
species, occupying marine and freshwater ecosystems throughout the northern
hemisphere. Widely distributed species are exposed to variable environmental
conditions across their ranges, including variation in local predation. Learning
to use sensory cues from the surrounding environment can greatly enhance
predator avoidance, and can be an evolutionary adaptation to variation in
predation. Embryonic and juvenile stickleback are at risk from a variety of
predators, and therefore could benefit from use of environmental signals to
learn and avoid local predators. Olfactory cues, such as odors released in a
predator's waste, provide reliable information about a predator's diet and could
be readily used by stickleback embryos and fry to learn predators. Examination
of the post-hatching response of stickleback conditioned to predator odors as
embryos versus unconditioned individuals demonstrated that under laboratory
condition embryos do learn. This learning has a significant effect on post-
hatching response to predator odors, as well as affecting subsequent learning
opportunities. The aim of this study is to address whether the embryonic
learning demonstrated in the laboratory is relevant in nature. The results of
this research have important conservation implications, as learning is likely to
play a critical role in allowing prey to recognize novel threats. Novel
predators (typically sport fish) are regularly introduced to lakes containing
stickleback and this poses an elevated risk to predator-na√Øve stickleback. This
project has already involved several undergraduate research assistants, and will
provide opportunities for additional graduate (Masters and Doctoral) and
undergraduate students to gain experience in the laboratory and field, helping
them develop their own research projects.
