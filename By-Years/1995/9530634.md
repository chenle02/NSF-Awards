9530634 Ruoff This research project will extend the static pressure range on
molecular solids to above 460 GPa - from 230 GPa - and will provide a study of
new forms of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen as well as alkali hydrides. The
objective is to make and study solid atomic metallic hydrogen, oxygen and
nitrogen. The study of hydrides has the intent of learning more about the nature
of the hydride ion. X-ray diffraction and optical studies, Raman, absorption,
and reflection spectroscopy will be used. Microminiaturization will be
emphasized with diamond anvil tips reduced to 20 micrometers and initial sample
hole diameters in the refractory gasket material of 6 micrometers. %%% This
research project plans to make solid atomic metallic hydrogen that has been
predicted to be a high temperature superconductor. Solid atomic metals of oxygen
and nitrogen are also planned to be formed during this project. The intent is to
provide a strong fundamental basis for the understanding of these unique new
metals. To achieve these goals this project plans to double the pressure range
to which molecular solids have been studied to reach 460 GPa (or 4.6 Mbar or 4.6
million atmospheres) which is greater than the pressure at the earth's core. An
objective of this research is to determine whether metallic hydrogen can persist
at atmospheric pressure. If this objective is met there may follow some unique
applications. ***
