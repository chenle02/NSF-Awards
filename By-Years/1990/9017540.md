In this project the P.I.'s will continue development of a spatial interpolation
technique using arbitrary functions for separating tidal currents from lower-
frequency currents in shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data.
The techniques will be further tested by applying them to data sets obtained in
the region of the Amazon River outflow during the AMAzon Suspended SEDiment
Study (AMASSEDS) and in the region of the California Current during the Shelf
MIxed Layer Experiment (SMILE).
