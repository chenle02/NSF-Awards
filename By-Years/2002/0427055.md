This award was made on a proposal submitted to the Division of Materials
Research under the Information Technology Research solicitation NSF-04-012.
Research activities covered by this award fall under the National Priority Area,
"Advances in Science and Engineering," and the Technical Focus Area, "Innovation
in Computational Modeling or Simulation in Research." This award supports the
development of algorithms and advanced electronic structure codes based on
density functional theory for modeling complex materials. The PI will also use
the tools to study in detail relationships among the properties of bulk
materials with surfaces and interfaces. Modeling tools developed in this project
can be applied to the study of many materials systems, processes, phenomena and
structure, including: surfaces and interfaces, scanning probe microscopy
analysis, photoexcitation processes, catalysis, and solid state battery
materials. &lt;br/&gt;Simulation methods and codes developed under this award
will be shared with the international computational materials physics community.
This award also supports international collaborations in code development for
materials modeling and simulation, and training students in computational
techniques. There are proven mechanisms to support students in joint degree
programs involving the Physics and Computer Science Departments at Wake Forest
University that have fostered collaborations between these departments in the
past.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
