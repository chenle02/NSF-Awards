9414103 Casey This award provides partial (50%) funding for the acquisition of a
scanning probe microscope system that will be installed and operated in the
Department of Land, Air and Water Resources at the University of California,
Davis. The institution is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for
the acquisition of the equipment. The microscope system will be used primarily
to examine, at the molecular level, the surface of minerals at the water-mineral
interface in order to study the mechanisms and rates of dissolution-
precipitation-adsorption processes in the natural environment. ***
