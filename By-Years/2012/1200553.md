This project deals with Jacobi matrices and more general difference operators
with some absolutely continuous spectrum and related dynamical properties of
such operators. The dynamical systems that are induced by the shift map are
relevant when one is interested in the absolutely continuous spectrum, and then
maps implemented by Toda flows deserve special attention because they preserve
the structural properties of such sytems. The project will pursue this approach
and give a prominent role to Toda maps in the study of the absolutely continuous
spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical questions that will be studied
in this project are related to several classical areas of pure mathematics;
however, they derive their main motivation from the theory of quantum mechanics.
More specifically, they are directly related to questions about the long time
behavior of a quantum particle (say, an electron). The rigorous mathematical
investigation of such issues often leads to a clearer and more secure
understanding of basic mechanisms and subtle effects in the quantum world.
