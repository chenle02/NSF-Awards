The American Mathematical Society will undertake a project called e-math, whose
purpose will be to provide and electronic environment tailored to the needs of
mathematicians in their research and educational activities. It is planned to
give them easy electronic access to each other, to a set of databases, and to
specialized software available for specific machines and applications. This
project will utilize current and projected technological advances, and will
exploit networking and collaboration environments as they emerge.
