Bacteria can be modified, through synthetic biology approaches, to function as
biological computers. They can be programmed with DNA sequences, interact
naturally with other cells and the environment, power themselves from food
sources, and respond to directed evolution. Biological computing is not yet
widespread, and this project will develop second-generation bacterial computers
capable of addressing mathematical problems in graph theory, probability, theory
of computation, and artificial intelligence. The project will identify problems
that are scalable and generalizable, develop a system of classifying the
bacterial computational complexity of mathematical problems, and construct
mathematical models and computer simulations to assess the design feasibility of
new bacterial computer programming languages. Proven and novel bacterial
computing mechanisms will be used to program bacterial computers to solve the
selected mathematical problems.

Broader Impacts. This project will provide multidisciplinary education and
research training for undergraduate students (including members of groups under-
represented in science) at the interface of mathematics, synthetic biology and
computer science. Students will pose research questions, develop testable
hypotheses, collect and analyze data, and communicate results through
publications and at scientific meetings.

This project is supported jointly by the Networks and Regulation and
Mathematical Biology Programs.
