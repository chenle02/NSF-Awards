9424059 Walker The Vassar College REU site will undertake a multidisciplinary
biogeochemical investigation of contaminant distribution, transport and toxic
effects in a small urbanized watershed in Poughkeepsie, NY. Once the magnitude
and spatial distribution of contamination has been assessed, specific
investigations of toxicity, contaminant transport and speciation will be
undertaken with the ultimate goal of creating predictive models of the fate and
effects of contaminants in the watershed. Toxicity experiments will be performed
in controlled, benchtop settings with in situ monitoring of element levels and
speciation. Transport studies will include detailed field investigations of the
spatial relationships of element distributions, identification of important
solid and colloidal phases in both stream sediment and water column, and
laboratory studies of element partitioning between phases. The project will
engage fourteen undergraduates and six high school teachers over two years.
Participation will help both students and teachers realize the importance of
interdisciplinary approaches to the study of environmental questions, and the
advantages of a "team effort" in formulating a more complete understanding of
the problem.
