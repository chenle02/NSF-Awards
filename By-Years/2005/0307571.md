PROPOSAL NO: AST 0307571 PI: Heidi Newberg INSTITUTION: Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute

Dr. Newberg and collaborators will use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) to map the outer parts of the Milky Way Galaxy more completely than has
yet been possible. Using statistical photometric parallaxes, the collaboration
will map the spatial distribution of halo stars at distances of 1.5 to 100
kiloparsecs from the sun. Their analysis of the full SDSS dataset will allow
them to identify substructure, and determine the dynamics and chemical
composition of stars in these tidal streams from spectral analysis. These
studies will help to determine the number and sizes of merger events that
occurred to form the halo of the Galaxy. The dynamics of the tidal streams will
help understand the spatial distribution of dark matter in the Galaxy.

The results from this research will be distributed to the international research
community through publications, delivered to undergraduate students through
course lectures and disseminated to the general public through public lectures
and press articles. The award supports a graduate student and an undergraduate
student, who will also be encouraged to make presentations in local K-12
schools. The data mining activities are part of a broader, interdisciplinary
effort in data science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
