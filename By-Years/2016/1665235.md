The project will investigate human factors in network security. The security of
network systems relies on proper protection from not only known vulnerabilities,
but also new vulnerabilities resulting from unexpected human behavior. The
project will directly address a user's situational behavior and its consequence
on network security. It engages in the challenges of modeling decision-making
process and integrating it in the human-network interaction. If the user's
behavior can be predicted and its impact on network vulnerability can be
estimated, the network manager can effectively close vulnerabilities and avoid
grave security breaches. This will change the view of a network as a static
infrastructure and security holes as design flaws of the infrastructure, and it
will regard humans as an integral factor in network security.

The project involves theoretical and experimental study from behavioral science
and research methodology from computer science and statistics in modeling the
decision-making process. It uses the model to predict user behavior when the
user's psychological state and network variables have changed, which would
greatly assist the network manager to attain an up-to-date assessment of network
vulnerability. The work includes three thrusts: 1) a theoretical framework for
studying human cyber behavior, 2) experimental study on human subjects in a
cyber environment, and 3) comprehensive human-network system-level vulnerability
analysis. The major outcome of this project is an integrated framework to
include human factors in network vulnerability analysis.
