Educational Development Center's proposed project, Improving Urban Middle
School Science, is a multidisciplinary science program for the seventh and
eighth grade that is targeted to the needs of early adolescents in urban
environments. Modules integrate scientific concepts and understandings from the
physical, human and health, life, and earth sciences within the context of
science, society, and technology problems. This project will build on the
conceptual framework and pedagogical strategies, school district partnerships,
teacher training design, and assessment and publishing partnerships established
through the NSF-funded Improving Urban Elementary Science Project currently
under development at EDC and Sunburst Communications. School districts and
teachers in Boston, Cleveland, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore, and
Montgomery County, Maryland will collaborate fully in the development effort and
field-testing. Operation SMART, a research and development project of the Girls
Clubs of America, will consult on informal science education strategies which
are particularly responsive to urban youth and which will complement the
curriculum. The materials will be reviewed for scientific accuracy and
pedagogical soundness by a distinguished advisory panel, while field-testing and
evaluation will be conducted by the Boston College Center for the Study of
Testing, Evaluation, and Educational Policy (CSTEEP). Sunburst Communications,
Inc. will publish the final product and field test materials, contribute to a
Teacher Development Fund, and provide technical assistance throughout the
project to ensure marketability of the proposed modules.
