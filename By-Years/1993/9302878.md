The notion of term rewriting was conceived in the late sixties starting from a
seminal paper by Knuth and Bendix. It later evolved into a powerful tool
bridging between programming languages and logic in computer science. In
addition to extensive theoretical results, it has been applied to symbolic and
algebraic computation, automated deduction, programming languages and compiler
optimization, termination and correctness of programs, grammars, lambda and
combinatory calculi, and has been the catalyst in the inception of constraint
solving and unification theory. In recent years studies have also been initiated
in using rewriting as a model for concurrency, as well as a viable solution to
combining functional and logic programming paradigms. Due to the popularity of
the subject, there has been an increase in graduate students studying in areas
related to term rewriting. This grant is to defray cost of participation for
about fifteen U.S. computer science graduate students.
