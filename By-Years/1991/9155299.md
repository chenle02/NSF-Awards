This proposal describes a collaborative effort to provide instruction and on-
going support in the use of introductory biotechnology classroom materials to
St. Louis city and county teachers of grades 6-8. Key components of the plan
include the training of 96 lead teachers (CADRE teams) who will have extensive
presentation skills for adult instruction and the use of a telecommunications
network to reach an additional 200 classroom teachers per year for a total of
600 over the course of the project. These classroom teachers will meet at
different sites in groups of about 20/site for instruction via telecommunication
and on-site support from CADRE teams. This leadership project is appropriate for
the Teacher Enhancement Program because of its potential to reach a large number
of classroom teachers in a very cost-effective yet substantive way, and because
it is a collaborative effort of an educational consortium (MSEC), school
districts, universities and local industry. Non-NSF cost-sharing is
approximately 60% of the amount requested from NSF.
