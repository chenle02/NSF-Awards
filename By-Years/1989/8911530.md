This is a study of chemical changes in foraminifera shells from the Miocene
epoch and rom the Tertiary/Cretaceous boundary layer. Specifically, the
investigator will determine the cadmium to calcium ratio in Miocene benthic
foraminifera from the Indian, North Atlantic, and Antarctic Circumpolar Oceans;
the Cd/Ca ratio in benthic foraminifera from marine sections across the K/T
boundary; and the feasibility of modifying methodology to measure Cd/Ca ratios
in planktonic foraminifera and fine fraction calcium carbonate. The results will
yield insights into paleoceanic circulation patterns and into paleoceanic trace
metal and nutrient inventories during the Miocene and across the K/T boundary.
