The proposal plans to connect Fond du Lac to the University of Minnesota at
Duluth and then to the Abilene Network. Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College
(FLTCC) has excellent existing computing facilities for a community college and
is able to leverage their facilities and projects jointly with the University of
Minnesota. The connection will be used to enable ongoing collaborations with the
forestry institute and the University of Minnesota.
