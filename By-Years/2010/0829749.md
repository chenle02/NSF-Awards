EMT: Biomimetic Self-Assembly of Functional Nanostructures for Computing and
Communications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The properties of DNA, particularly its
capacity for reliable and programmable molecular recognition, have led to the
birth of the field of DNA-based nanotechnology. Recent experimental successes in
DNA-guided self-assembly include the ordering of matter with unprecedented
accuracy and parallelism, nano-scale organization of metal particles and
proteins, along with fabrication of highly conductive metallic nanowires. The
proposed project focuses on the use of complex, self-assembled DNA
superstructures based on DNA ?tiles? as templates for the fabrication of
programmable nanoscale electronic and plasmonic components and wiring. This
research will impact nanoelectronics and nanophotonics research with potentially
profound implications for the future of computation. This project fits very well
with the stated goals of the EMT program especially in its mandate ?to enable
radical innovations in... computing and communication systems through the
support of projects that capitalize upon research opportunities at the
intersection of computing and biological systems, nanoscale science and
engineering?.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
