The Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) will carry out a
small one-time award program to encourage collaborative activities in global
change research among scientists and institutions of the IAI member countries.
The Small Grants Program (SGP) will be the foundation of a second phase of IAI
programmatic development, leading to the establishment of new long term research
networks that will succeed the current Collaborative Research Network, supported
in part by a separate NSF grant. High priority has been given in this selection
to high-quality science and the participation of new/young scientists from IAI
member countries.&lt;br/&gt;After an open call and a merit-based peer-review the
IAI has selected the following activities:&lt;br/&gt;--A. Research (10
awards):&lt;br/&gt;1. Esteban Jobbagy, ARGENTINA: "Climate and Land Use Controls
on Ecosystem Functioning: Understanding Processes and Developing Tools for a
Sustainable Use of Temperate Ecosystems" (Other Countries: Uruguay and USA)
