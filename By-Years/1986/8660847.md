Screening and isolation of microorganisms accounts for much of the efforts in
industrial microbiology. For example, screening for enzyme inhibitors of
microbial origin has recently led to more than 50 novel compounds, some of which
are in clinical use or clinical trial for the treatment of hypertension, rapid
screening technique could speed up the identification of novel and new
biological compounds. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop an
automated cellular electrode system for screening and monitoring purposes.
Construction of a working cellular electrode system using a disk of immobilized
mammalian cells attached to an oxygen electrode is an immediate objective of
this proposal. Two such electrodes with different cell lines can possibly be
used to detect a substance toxic to one of the cell lines by differential oxygen
sensing measurements. Phase I research will focus on developing magnetically
sensitized immobilized cellular disks, and then magnetically coupling these
disks to an appropriate electrode. If these initial studies look encouraging,
further research in engineering design and software development of the screening
system is planned for phase II. The PIs are considered to be very capable of
carrying out the proposed research project and I recommend funding according to
the budget submitted with this proposal.
