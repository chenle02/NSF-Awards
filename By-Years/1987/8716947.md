This action would provide funds for the principal investigator from the
University of Michigan, Flint to collaborate with physicists from six other
institutions on an experiment at Fermilab (E672). The goal of the experiment is
to study the reaction products from high energy collisions between mesons and
nuclei. The reaction products will be selected for study only if they contain
pairs of muons. The goal is to test predictions of the currently accepted theory
of the strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics. The award is made under the
"Research Opportunities for Women" Program.
