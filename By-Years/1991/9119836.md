1Professor Karplus is jointly supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program and the Biophysics Program to perform
theoretical studies related to biomolecular chemistry. The research is directed
at the use of theoretical methods to increase our understanding of the
structure, dynamics and function of biologically interesting molecules. The
methods to be used include ab initio and semiempirical quantum mechanical
calculations and molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. Particular
emphasis will be placed on the role of solvent in biological systems. Specific
problems to be addressed include: 1) solvation effects on internal molecular
potentials; 2) ion transport through the gramacidin channel; and 3) reactions in
the gas phase, in solution, and in enzymes. %%% State-of-the-art computer
simulations of the dynamical behavior of biological molecules such as enzymes
have provided valuable insights regarding the structure and function of these
important and facinating chemical catalysts. This fundamental research has
important implications in understanding biological function, and has a long
range impact in the area of human health and disease. Professor Karplus
continues to follow a program of research aimed at elucidating biological
function through computer simulations.
