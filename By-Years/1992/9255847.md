This project will support the dissemination of curricular developments in
engineering by establishing workshops at three A.S.E.E. regional meetings to be
attended by engineering faculty from two and four-year institutions in each
region. Successful projects will be presented by principal investigators in an
interactive format under the A.S.E.E. auspices. Evaluating of the workshops with
respect to their effectiveness in promoting curricular change will be carried
out by the A.S.E.E. over the six month period following the regional meetings.
Results of the project will be published in A.S.E.E. publications.
