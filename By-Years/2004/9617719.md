The production of phytoplankton in the ocean is know to be limited under some
circumstances by the amount of iron (and perhaps other trace metals) available
to them. Not every chemical form of these trace metals can be utilized by these
organisms. Since the most important of these from a biological standpoint is
iron, which readily forms colloids in seawater, it is important from marine
ecological and geochemical perspectives to understand how available colloidal is
to the phytoplankton and how iron and other trace metals move into and out of
the colloidal phase. In this project, the principal investigators will undertake
a study of iron and six other biologically active trace metals in the waters of
the continental shelf of central California. Using a relatively new technique
called cross-flow filtration, the distribution of iron and the other trace
metals in dissolved and colloidal phases (different size classes) will be
examined. In particular the biological availability of iron and other trace
metals in the colloidal phases will be investigated by running shipboard
incubations and also by in situ comparisons of colloid-metal distributions and
plankton production in the water column.
