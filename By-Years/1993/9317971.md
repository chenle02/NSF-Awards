9317971 Cohen Current scientific and resource policy problems revolve around the
spatial dynamics of ecosystems and landscapes. For example, global climate
change will not be equal everywhere and the responses of ecosystems to it depend
in their distribution relative important spatial components include seed
dispersal, which determines migration of plant species across the landscape, and
habitat structure for birds which disperse those seeds. Until recently,
computational tools for analyzing spatial dynamics have been lacking. Recent
developments in supercomputers and video display technology make the interfacing
of population, ecosystem, and landscape models feasible, thus providing
solutions to large-scale ecological problems. We propose to incorporate
mechanisms of seed dispersal and bird habitat suitability into an existing
forest ecosystem model, develop visualization techniques for two and three
dimensional display of simulated landscapes, and further develop mathematical
techniques for analyzing model output. This work takes advantage of the new
power in supercomputing and will develop tools for use on parallel
architecture's. Software will be made available through Internet, workshops,
etc. This award is being jointly supported by programs in Ecosystems Studies and
Computational Biology.
