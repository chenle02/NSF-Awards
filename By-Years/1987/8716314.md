In this project, the investigators will carry out a high-quality hydrographic
section along with Acoustic Doppler Current Profiling across the Atlantic Ocean
along 8 deg N. This section will complement an intensive deep float deployment
to be carried out by other investigators. Geostrophic shear from the CTD data,
together with the float trajectories, will be used to extrapolate the velocity
field away from the float-derived level of known motion to obtain the top-to-
bottom, basin-wide absolute velocity field. Measurements of salinity, oxygen,
and nutrient distributions will allow interpretation of the velocity field in
terms of source water masses. Acoustic Doppler Current Profiles of the upper few
hundred meters, coupled with GPS navigation, will provide additional information
on the absolute velocity field, and will also be used to distinguish between
geostrophic and ageostrophic (Ekman) shear on large space-scales in the upper
ocean. Scientific issues to be addressed by the study include the fluxes of heat
and freshwater and the transport and dynamics of deep water masses.
