This project, which is partially supported by a fund transfer to USGS, will
collate magnetometer data collected over the past 33 years (since the IGY) at 27
different sites in Antarctica. The purposes of the investigation are: 1.. .To
search for a response of the ionospheric E.region current system to the
development of the annual ozone hole. This is expected since the ozone controls
stratospheric warming and consequently the thermal expansion of the atmosphere,
which has a strong effect on upper atmospheric currents;. H. 2.. .To establish
hemispherical differences in magnetic field variation behavior;. H. 3.. .To
evaluate the equivalent south polar region current systems for geomagneticly
quiet days; and. H. 4.. .To determine the upper.mantle Earth electrical
conductivity profile beneath the antarctic continent.. H.
