This award will support a seminar, "Fracture, Form, and Fractals," organized
jointly by Prof. Charles Sammis of the University of Southern California, and
Prof. Masanori Saito of the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan. Participants
will meet at Lake Arrowhead, CA, on September 24-27, 1989, to exchange
information and ideas on the subject of the application of fractal geometry, in
which identical forms are repeated on various size scales, to research into
geological fracture. Observations of fractal geometry have recently been
quantified and incorporated into mathematical models for such tectonic processes
as earthquakes, and into descriptions of the internal structure of fault zones.
However, many fundamental questions regarding the physics of the failure process
which produces fractal fracture patterns, the significance of the fractal
dimension scale, and upper and lower fractal limits, remain. Considering the
large amount of recent research on these questions in both the U.S. and Japan,
and the importance of this research to geology in general and earthquake
prediction in particular, this meeting is timely and likely to have important
impact.
