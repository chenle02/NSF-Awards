The main purpose of the grant is to bring scientists together at the American
Water Resources Association "Cold Regions Hydrologic Symposium", to be held in
Fairbanks, Alaska, in July 1986, to develop an agenda on cold regions'
hydrologic research needs with emphasis on related hazards, e.g., ice jams,
glacier dammed-lakes, outburst floods, snow melt flooding, snow-packed soils,
etc.
