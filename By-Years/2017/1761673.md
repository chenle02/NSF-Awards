Hurricanes Harvey and Irma were large, highly impactful, weather events.  In
particular, Harvey was a unique storm event that exceeded all previously
recorded storms in terms of precipitation. Information that helps the research
community understand such events better will enable better forecasting
techniques and designs of critical facilities design that can better withstand
severe weather events.The objective of this project is to collect, document and
archive data from hurricanes Harvey and Irma within HydroShare, a data service
provided by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic
Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) that supports the sharing and publication of a broad
class of hydrologic data and models. This data will serve as a key resource for
understanding how such large and sustained flooding and rainfall events could
have occurred, and how critical infrastructures should be designed. Further,
HydroShare is used by over 130 institutions, and having the information related
to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma centrally available will have allow research
related to these events to be more easily conducted, as well as facilitate
creative and unanticipated use of this data.
