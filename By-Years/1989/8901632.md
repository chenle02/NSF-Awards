This is a two.year collaboration research project between Dr. Robert Adams,
Baylor University and Professors Zhu Ge.ling and Zhang Shao.Zhen, North west
Teacher's College. This proposal plans to use new bio.technological and mass
spectroscopic methods to compare >Juniperus> species collected from the U. S.
and China. No comparison of this type has been made using micro.and
macro.molecular data. New insights derived from this study can advance the
understanding of this species and provide useful information on the efficieny of
using these new methods in the analysis of >Juniperus> DNA.
