9313700 Gordon This project is the analysis of the data set obtained as part of
an integrated research program into the oceanographic structure of the western
Weddell Sea. The field work was carried out from an ice camp jointly occupied by
U.S. and Russian scientists from February to June 1992. The principal
investigator's work was the lead project in the research program and concerned
the large-scale oceanographic circulation and the variability of the Weddell Sea
boundary current, and how these affect and are affected by the regional water
mass formation and modification processes. The Weddell Sea may be divided into
three regions on the basis of the energy exchange mode. The warm regime occurs
in the east where the intrusion of warm circumpolar deep water keeps the water
temperature near +1 deg C. The cold regime occurs in the center, where deep
water is overlain by a thick near freezing mixed layer. In both regions however
enough heat is seasonally carried to the sea ice to melt it completely. In the
western region, the sea ice cover does not melt, and the expected thermodynamic
processes are different. Hydrographic data, coupled with the current meter
observations and chemical tracer experiments, as well as turbulent flux measure-
ments, and sea ice dynamics that were part of the field work have already
provided a unique picture of the Weddell Sea continental slope processes. ***
