The objective of the proposed work is to study the effect of the extracellular
reducing environment on the intracellular reduction state and to see how it
affects the flow of metabolites. The intracellular reduction state will be
measured using culture fluorescence. In general, NAD(P)H levels are known to
regulate the particular pathway that is chosen over others in a multi-product
fermentation and there is evidence that the extracellular redox potential
affects the NAD(P)H level within cells. It is hoped to exploit this phenomenon
to control cells at a given intracellular reduction state and thus direct
metabolic flow to one product in preference to others. The external redox
potential will be controlled by two different methods, one physical and the
other chemical. In addition to a better fundamental understanding of how NAD(P)H
levels affect end-product formation, this study will help develop redox
potential and culture fluorescence as online metabolic state sensors that will
lead to novel bioreactor operating strategies for product optimization.
