This project deals with a broad range of topics in and around topology, from
algebraic K-theory, studied by Swan, to knot theory, studied by Orr. The central
foci are homotopy theory and high-dimensional manifold theory. Hopkins and
Devinatz study the global structure of stable homotopy theory. Stover studies
the structure of unstable homotopy theory. May and Liulevicius study a variety
of topics in equivariant algebraic topology. Rothenberg and Weinberger study
group actions on manifolds and related areas of geometric topology. Madsen,
visiting from Denmark, will continue joint work with Rothenberg on finite group
actions. Four advanced graduate students are also engaged in related research
under faculty direction.
