The proposed research is the first laboratory study of the electron-ion hybrid
instability driven by a shear in the cross- field ion drift. The objectives are
to (1) excite the EIH mode in the two parameter regimes assoicated with their
laoratory device, (2) determine the dependence of the frequency and wave vector
spectra on shear parameters, (3) characterize the ion heating induced by EIH
waves and its saturation mechanism, and (4) to determine the influence of
introducing a second ion species, positively and negatively charges, on items 2
and 3. These experiments are relevant to the interpretation of the dynamically
intense geomagnetic activity that arises at the edges of auoral arcs and in
black aurora.
