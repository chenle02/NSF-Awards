9509312 Cole Throughout western North America the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex
occidentalis, is one of the dominant animal species; it is an important
component of the desert landscape. The goal of the current research is to
determine how the density and distribution of these organisms are regulated. Two
possible mechanisms influence population density: the availability of recruits
and the availability of food and space for the colonies. These two need not be
mutually exclusive. Both the availability of food and space and the numbers of
recruits will be experimentally modified to measure the effect on population
density. The experimental studies on the regulation of population density and
colony distribution will be combined with measurement of temporal and spatial
variation in the patterns of recruitment to extend the understanding of local
processes to large geographical scales. Pogonomyrmex occidentalis is the primary
disperser of seeds in a fragile ecosystem subject to multiple uses. By
determining the factors that govern the population size and distribution in this
important species, this research may elucidate the mechanisms that govern range
quality and habitat preservation.
