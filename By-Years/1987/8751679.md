This project proposes a partnership among San Diego County Schools, the
University of California at San Diego, Research Centers, and industry to improve
the quality of science instruction at the elementary (k-6) school level. The
program will span a three year period and encompass a five week on-campus summer
institute during each year of the program as well as a series of 8 meetings
during the academic school year. Year One of the program will emphasize the Life
Sciences, Year Two Earth and Environmental Sciences, and Year Three the Physical
Sciences. An attempt will be made to integrate all science content areas with
each other and with reading and mathematics. The major goal of the project is to
educate 100 Resource/Mentor teachers who will return to their schools and
provide inservice programs in science content and methodology. Commitments to
participate in the program have been received from 27 school districts. This
project is of particular interest to the Teacher Enhancement Program in that it
is county-wide and involves all segments of the community in a cooperative
effort to begin improving the system at the elementary level.
