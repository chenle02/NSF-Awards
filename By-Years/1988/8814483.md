This award will support cooperative research between Prof. W.S. Reeburgh of the
University of Alaska, and Dr. David T. Heggie of the Australian Bureau of
Mineral Resources, Geology, and Geophysics, Canberra, Australia. The
investigators will participate in a joint geochemical/geophysical research
cruise on the northwest shelf of Australia, aboard the vessel RIG SEISMIC.
Measurements of water column and sediment methane concentrations and carbon
isotope ratios will be made with the intention of determining whether the
hydrocarbons observed are modern, or are related to the presence of petroleum
under the sea. The northwest shelf of Australia is known to have petroleum
potential. Measurements in this environment will extend the U.S. investigator's
previous experience in Alaskan and Black Sea waters, and the earlier joint
studies of the U.S. and Australian investigators in methane geochemistry. This
research is aimed at understanding the geochemical and microbiological controls
on anaerobic methane oxidation, and the role this process plays in the global
methane budget, which could play an important role in atmospheric warming.
