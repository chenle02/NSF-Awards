A Siemens P4 X-ray diffractometer equipped with low-temperature capabilities
will be acquired for the research and teaching program at Delaware State
University using funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program. The
research areas to be studyied are: 1) inorganic and organometallic compounds,
mineral physics, and materials science. Specifically, topics to be studied
include: structure-reactivity relationships in organic molecular crystals,
antiviral applications of oxometallic complexes, and the high pressure phases of
mantle minerals using hot-pressing techniques. A X-ray diffractometer will low
temperature capabilities will be utilized in the study of structure-reactivity
relationships in organic molecular crystals, antiviral applications of
oxometallic complexes, and the high pressure phases of mantle minerals.
