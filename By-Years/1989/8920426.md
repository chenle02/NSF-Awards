Higher device production rate while manufacturing the same high quality product,
is a goal of the microelectronics industry. The principal investigators have
developed a novel concept of programmed rate chemical vapor deposition (PRCVD),
as a method to enhance device throughput and film properties in low pressure
chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) on patterned semiconductor wafers. In PRCVD,
process conditions are varied with time to compensate for the increase in
instantaneous feature aspect ratio as deposition proceeds. This should result in
a larger average deposition rate than for constant rate chemical vapor
deposition (CRCVD). The objective of this research is to experimentally validate
the concept of PRCVD for four representative chemical vapor deposition
chemistries of current industrial interest: (1) silicon dioxide deposition from
tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), (2) silicon dioxide deposition from
silane/oxygen mixtures, (3) aluminum deposition from triisobutylaluminum (TIBA)
and (4) tungsten silicide deposition from tungsten hexafluoride/
dichlororosilane mixtures. These reaction systems exhibit markedly different
deposition rate dependence on temperature and reactant partial pressures, and
thus provide a comprehensive test of the PRCVD concept. Films will be deposited
in a cold wall, single wafer microreactor over silicon based patterned
substrates. Deposited films will be characterized to determine if PRVCD produces
films which posses the same critical properties as CRCVD films. Successful
completion of this research will provide a methodology for commercial
implementation of PRCVD, which could increase device throughput and decrease
production costs.
