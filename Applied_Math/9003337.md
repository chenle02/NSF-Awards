The principal investigators continue studies of nonlinear partial differential
equations. The present investigations include symmetry-breaking for solutions of
nonlinear wave equations, solutions of semilinear equations with finite symmetry
groups, conformal metrics on the two-dimensional sphere, radially symmetric
solutions of Einstein-Yang-Mills equations, shock wave problems, and certain
problems of topology. These mathematical questions capture features of a variety
of physical problems. For instance, questions addressed in the Einstein-Yang-
Mills studies have implications for the importance of quantum effects in forming
black holes. Many problems in mathematical biology, physics, and geometry have
solutions that show certain patterns or symmetries. Symmetry-breaking indicates
changes in the character of the solutions as parameters of the problems change.
