Dr. Robert Hynes (Louisiana State University) will undertake an extensive
imaging and spectroscopic survey to identify optical counterparts of X-ray
sources detected by the Galactic Bulge Survey of the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
Much of the sample is expected to be low-mass X-ray binaries; these are systems
in which a neutron star or a black hole is stripping material from a nearby
companion. The project will greatly increase the sample of X-ray binary systems
with known properties. Some of these may be eclipsing systems, which would
provide important estimates of neutron star and black hole masses. In addition,
the data from this project will test models of the formation of low-mass X-ray
binaries in different stellar populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data from this
survey will form the core of a Ph.D. dissertation, and will be distributed to
the community for future follow-up surveys at several wavelengths. The research
will also provide undergraduate students with direct research experience.
