Three emerging technologies provide unique opportunities for denser cities
throughout the developed world: vehicle sharing, electric vehicles, and
autonomous systems. Bringing these technologies close together can help enable
joint mobility-on-demand and urban-logistics services. This project focuses on
the co-development of design and algorithms to enable new concepts that will
serve this purpose. The Persuasive Electric Vehicle (PEV) is a tricycle
navigating in the bike lanes. The PEV can autonomously drive itself to its next
customer; it can also deliver packages to its customers who order goods online.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the algorithmic front, the project will investigate (i)
provably-safe algorithms for autonomous navigation in bike lanes, and (ii)
algorithms for high-performance routing and rebalancing for joint mobility on
demand and urban logistics. On the design front, the project will investigate
(i) the vehicle-level designs that can best embrace the relevant CPS
technologies, and (ii) the system-level designs and urban planning practices
that can help enable the PEV concept. The PIs will collaborate with the City of
Boston and participate in the Global City Teams Challenge, where they will
demonstrate the PEV concept and its potential impact on future smart cities.
