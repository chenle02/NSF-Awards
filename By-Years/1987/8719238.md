This award will enable Dr. S. George Walters and some of his colleagues at the
Rutgers University-Industry Cooperative Research Center for Ceramics to study
the feasibility and design of a linkage between selected researchers in the
Center and a group of researchers and organizations in Sweden who, with the
Americans, are interested in pre-competitive research in ceramics. Several
Swedish representatives from the potential member organizations will also study
the conditions needed for the linkage, and three joint meetings will be held in
the U.S. and Sweden to integrate the findings of the study. The joint study
group will document the interests, needs, and requirements of the potential
participants and will design an organization and operational plan for the
international cooperation. The proposed collaborative research network of U.S.
and Swedish researchers has advantages for both countries. The Rutgers Center is
strong in ceramics and fiber whisker research, including sol-gel. The Swedish
scientists are skilled in sintering, hot isostatic pressing, and slip casting.
The linkage will strengthen research in both countries and will give the
participants access to new ideas, new technologies, and additional capable
researchers more quickly than without this formal cooperative arrangement.
