This award supports the participation of US-based researchers in the workshop
"Representations and Characters: Revisiting the Works of Harish Chandra and
André Weil — A satellite conference of the Virtual ICM 2022" held July 1-15,
2022 at the Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the National University of
Singapore. This workshop is a satellite conference of the virtual 2022
International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) for Section 7 (Lie Theory and
Generalizations). Several invited speakers will be delivering their ICM lectures
at the meeting. The ICM Emmy Noether Lecture will also be delivered at this
meeting. The objectives of this workshop are to present and discuss the latest
research results in representation theory, one of the fundamental branches of
mathematics, as well as their interactions and applications in other domains,
such as number theory, analysis, mathematical physics. It will provide
participants the opportunity to share points of view and ideas and to begin or
strengthen collaborations. It will also give graduate students and early-career
researchers the opportunity to interact with experts in the field.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific focus of the workshop is the theory of
representations of reductive groups over local fields. The workshop will put
special emphasis on characters and matrix coefficients, in connection with the
recent developments of representation theory, especially those related to the
theta correspondence for the Weil representation and those related to general
branching problems for representations. The conference webpage is
