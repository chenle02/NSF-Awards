This award provides funding for a 3 year standard award to support a Research
Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at Georgia Institute
of Technology (GA Tech) entitled, "RET Site: National Nanotechnology
Infrastructure Network (NNIN)", under the direction of Dr. Nancy Healy.

This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site is a renewal of
a successful RET Site program hosted by the National Nanotechnology
Infrastructure Network (NNIN) with the lead at Georgia Institute of Technology
and partners at Harvard University, Howard University, Pennsylvania State
University, and the University of California Santa Barbara. This site will
provide a total of 45 in-service, grades 6-12 science teachers from local school
districts (15 per year for 3 years) an opportunity to engage in high-quality,
hands-on research in state-of-the-art nanotechnology facilities at NNIN sites
for 6 weeks during the summer with 2 weeks of follow-up activities throughout
the year. The objectives of the program are to assist science teachers in
understanding and communicating the importance of using inquiry-based methods to
solve problems by doing research in nanotechnology; establish a long-term
mentorship support group of teachers who will become advocates for STEM and
nanotechnology education and careers; nurture a mentorship community between
professors, graduate student mentors, and science teachers in high-need school
districts; and build a library of classroom activities for the classroom.
