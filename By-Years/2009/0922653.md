This award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program will be used to
purchase four significant instruments to support a new core imaging facility at
Haverford College, a selective liberal arts college with a diverse student body.
The new instruments funded by this grant are a transmission electron microscope,
a scanning electron microscope, a confocal microscope, and a fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) system. This facility will serve the research and
educational missions of the Biology Department and will also be an important
resource for faculty and students in the Physics and Chemistry Departments.
These instruments will significantly enhance the research capabilities of the
faculty, most with external funding to support their research programs. Since
the focus of the Haverford Biology Department is in cell and molecular biology,
access to these imaging tools will benefit research projects in areas such as
biomaterials research, nanotechnology, developmental biology and embryogenesis,
neurobiology, immunology, and stem cell biology. Notably, the faculty
collaborate frequently in their research, bringing together skills and expertise
to develop synergies that advance science in new directions and serving as role
models in students' training. Students are immersed in the process of doing
science, fostering their ability to think broadly and from interdisciplinary
perspectives. Students will use these instruments for their course work and
their senior thesis projects, and will also develop state-of-the-art skills that
will be helpful in for a career path in STEM (science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics).
