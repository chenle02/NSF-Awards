Our Department of Marine, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences proposes to initiate
a new field course on Margarita Island, Venezuela for the benefit of
undergraduates in all three of our disciplines, including students form other
campuses nationally. This course would address the physical environment, unlike
the many biologically-oriented field courses which are offered at tropical
research stations. Logistical support would come from a marine institute,
Fundacion La Salle de Ciencias Naturales, which has 300 employees on Magarita
Island. This institute collects data in all three disciplines and presently
supports five of our graduate students. Most of the field equipment needed for
the proposed course already is available. The remaining equipment would be
provided under the terms of this proposal, e.g. grab samplers and peat corers,
an S4 meter for marine currents, and several meteorological instruments. Much of
this course would be devoted to interrelationships among marine, tectonic, and
atmospheric processes. To our knowledge, this inter-disciplinary approach would
be unique among tropical field courses.
