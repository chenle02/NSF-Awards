This project will model the Laki volcanic eruption in Iceland in 1783-1784 in
order to assess the impact of high latitude eruptions on the climate system.
Historical data are sufficiently detailed to permit an estimate of the radiative
forcing arising from the eruption with a high degree of confidence. Estimates of
gaseous and particulate emissions will be fed to an atmospheric circulation
model and its results compared with observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opportunity to explore the impact of volcanic
eruptions on the polar troposphere has wide-ranging benefits to the scientific
community and public alike, since the Arctic is extremely sensitive to even
small changes in climate, whether they are natural or anthropogenic in
origin.&lt;br/&gt;
