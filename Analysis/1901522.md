Traditionally, mathematics studies precise solutions: one has for example an
equation with an unknown quantity 'x', and wants to know precisely which
value(s) of x make it true. Often in the real world, good approximate solutions
will always be very close to precise solutions, and are therefore just as good
for practical purposes. However, sometimes very good approximate solutions to a
problem can exist without there being any actual solution at all: for example,
this is a fundamental phenomenon in parts of semi-conductor physics that are
closely related to the 'K-theoretic' methods used in this project. The ideas of
finding approximate solutions to problems and seeing what can be done with them
versus precise solutions permeate these research projects. The PI will continue
his own research in these directions, as well as mentor and advise junior
researchers, disseminate the results of this to the broader community.

The methods used, and problems studied, in this project come from operator
algebras (a branch of mathematics motivated by quantum physics), group theory
(the study of symmetry), and K-theory (a way of measuring "twistedness"
phenomena in geometry). The PI will study fundamental classification problems in
the theory of operator algebras by first solving approximate versions; this uses
intrinsically low-dimensional phenomena in the structure of such objects, as
recently revealed by other researchers. In contrast, the PI intends to study
high-dimensional obstructions to the existence of approximate solutions to
systems of matrix-equations governed by symmetry groups. Finally, the PI intends
to study the surprising analytic phenomena that come up around the failure of
exactness, and the connections of this to geometry.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
