Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive
institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate
degrees in STEM and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening
STEM education and research. The project at Central State University seeks to
build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-
American students in STEM disciplines. The institution seeks to address low
first year retention and persistence in the STEM areas. Central State University
recognizes that the need to improve learning practices must be addressed. To
address the issue of high unemployment levels for veterans in the state of Ohio,
Central State University will increase educational opportunities for veterans in
STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to improve
retention and persistence rates by adopting evidence-based strategies to
include: enhancement of the university's cyber-infrastructure for "anytime,
anywhere, anyone learning"; development and assessment of innovative teaching
and learning techniques in STEM curricula; enhancement of undergraduate student
research experiences; faculty professional development in effective STEM
teaching pedagogy and research; and the creation of new approaches to
recruitment and retention of undergraduate STEM students. Through the evaluation
plan, the impact of infusion of cyber-pedagogy and integration of experiential
learning on traditional students and veterans will be studied and disseminated.
