9601585 Lambropoulos This Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) award is to
partially support the acquisition of a nanoindenter/nanoscratcher that will be
used to study near-surface material properties. A Highly interdisciplinary group
of researchers will use this equipment to study a wide range of topics including
mechanical properties, densification of silica, scratch testing of glasses,
interfacial surface energies, cohesive forces in particles and thin polymer
films. There is a significant educational and training component in the research
activities that will use this equipment including short courses for local
industry. ***
