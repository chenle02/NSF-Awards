0328599 Narang Eurcaryotic cells usually move by crawling in response to an
external concentration gradient. The goal of this work is to understand the
mechanism of directional sensing, the phenomenon that allows cells to "read" the
gradient and take the first step of crawling motion, namely extension and a
protusion. Though many signal transduction pathways involved in directional
sensing have been discovered over the past 5 years, the manner in which the
pathways interact to produce accurate and sensitive directional sensing is still
unknown. The PI has formulated the first mechanistic mathematical model that
integrates the pathways and predicts dynamics that are consistent with the
existing experimental data. The PI proposes to develop a firm understanding of
the directional sensing mechanisms in eurcaryotic cell motion. The main
components are: 1) Application of a novel microfluidic device for generating
stable chemo-attractant gradients and 2) Application of state-of-the-art imaging
techniques to rigorously test the validity of the PI's model and competing
models. The techniques include fluorescence microscopy and Fluorescence
Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). The goal of this SGER is to initiate
experimental tests of the model, specifically to identify the signal
transduction mechanisms that amplify shallow chemo-attractant gradients into
polarized phosphoinositide distributions.

Understanding the mechanisms of cell movement has broad impact in areas of
medicine in which cell migration plays an important role, e.g., cancer
metastasis, wound healing, inflammation response, and embryo development.
