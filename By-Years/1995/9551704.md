(ILI-IP): The Electronic Workbook Increasing the mathematics computer laboratory
facilities at Florida Atlantic University enables the department to accommodate
an interactive approach to learning calculus using electronic workbooks.
Recently developed software--Scientific WorkPlace, from TCI Software Research--
makes it possible for students to produce and modify high quality text, and to
access powerful mathematical tools, including graphing and Symbolic processing,
within the same environment. The current calculus course is taught from texts
developed by the Harvard calculus project. The faculty are developing electronic
material, in the form of Scientific WorkPlace documents, which are used in
conjunction with these texts. Putting a high-class word processor at the
students' disposal is intended to improve their expository skills. By providing
a symbolic processor that understands ordinary mathematical notation makes it
easier for students to relate textbook mathematics to computer mathematics.
