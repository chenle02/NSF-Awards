The proposal describes several projects related to algorithmic and asymptotic
aspects of group theory:&lt;br/&gt; * Constructing finitely presented groups
with "transcendental" properties (in particular, finitely presented infinite
torsion groups).&lt;br/&gt; * Complexity of residually finite groups.&lt;br/&gt;
* Asymptotic and Burnside properties of group actions of maximal
growth&lt;br/&gt; * Asymptotic cones of finitely presented groups.&lt;br/&gt; *
Asymptotic properties of amenable groups.&lt;br/&gt;These topics are intimately
related. For example, Higman embeddings and S-machines are going to be used to
construct finitely presented torsion groups and in the study of complexity of
the word problem in groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern group theory is a very
fast developing area of mathematics that accumulates methods from geometry,
combinatorics, logic and computer science. Our proposal describes projects that
are require methods and ideas from all these areas. In particular, constructing
a finitely presented infinite torsion group (which is one of the outstanding
problems in group theory) will require constructing a suitable kind of Turing
machine (called S-machines) and adapting methods from geometric group theory to
find suitable quotients of groups simulating these machines. Another idea coming
from geometry (and due mostly to Gromov) is the idea of an asymptotic cone of a
group. We are going to study asymptotic cones to discover algebraic and
algorithmic properties of groups.
