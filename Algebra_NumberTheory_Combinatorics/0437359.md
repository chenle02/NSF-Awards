Abstract:

This CAREER award supports research on the combinatorial structures of Schubert
varieties, primarily by studying their singularities. Schubert varieties are
fascinating geometrical objects which lie at the intersection of several fields
of mathematics; their study began with the classical works in projective
geometry of the nineteen century. Better understanding of these structures would
have impact in algebraic geometry, combinatorics and representation theory.
Outside of mathematics, these results may have applications in theoretical
physics, computer graphics, and the study of Bucky balls (Carbon-60 molecules).
A further goal of this proposal is to explore the changing roll of computers in
mathematics. Computer verification and computer proofs play a central role in
characterizing properties of Schubert varieties by pattern avoidance.

An important aspect of this proposal is its educational component. Mathematics
education and research are intrinsically linked - research brings out the
creativity and drive needed to learn new mathematical concepts. In particular,
undergraduate students enjoy the challenge of facing unsolved problems. However,
due to the nature of mathematics research, finding "good" undergraduate research
problems is difficult. Computer verified proofs and computer experimentation are
particularly well suited to the skills and knowledge of undergraduates while
also of interest to graduate students and more senior researchers. Therefore,
this line of research has been incorporated into the education portion of the
proposal through a new course and undergraduate research projects.
