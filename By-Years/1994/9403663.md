9403663 Gusfled This grant is for the partial support of the conference on
"Combinatorial Pattern Matching (CPM)", to be held at the Asilomar conference
center, Monterey California, June 5-8, 1994. Combinatorial pattern Matching
addresses issues of searching and matching of strings and more complicated
patterns such as trees, regular expressions, extended expressions. It also
addresses issues such as the discovery of unknown pattern in strings and the
reconstruction of strings from partial pattern information. The goal of the
field is to derive nontrivial combinatorial properties for such structures and
then to exploit these properties in order to achieve superior performances for
the corresponding computational problems. The conference focuses on original
work in all areas related to combinatorial pattern matching and sequence
analysis, both theoretical and applied. Areas include, but are not limited to,
string algorithms, pattern recognition, applications to molecular and
evolutionary biology, text searching, information retrieval, symbolic computing
and data compression. *** v s t Õ K M $ $ $ ( F / V V Õ / 1 Courier Symbol &
