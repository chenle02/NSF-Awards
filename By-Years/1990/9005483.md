This proposal is for support of theoretical studies aimed at retrieving
thermodynamic data for F- and Cl- endmember micas, amphiboles and other phases
for use in deciphering the behavior of F and Cl in reacting hydrothermal
systems. These studies will enable constraints to be placed on the speciation
and total halide contents of hydrothermal fluids based on known compositions of
silicate minerals. In addition, it will be possible to predict how F and Cl
partitioned between minerals and aqueous fluids during water-rock interactions
and whether this partitioning is important in the generation of F-rich ore
deposits. The most important aspects of this work are the retrieval of the
thermodynamic properties of fluoride and chloride end-member minerals from
published experimental studies, and the application of these results to geologic
problems. The scope of the research will be limited to these aspects.
