This project is developing a dual purpose food safety laboratory which combines
biotechnology student training facilities with compliance free-for-service
testing. A new biotechnology Associates of Science degree and certificate
programs with emphasis in Food Safety Testing educates both prospective and
incumbent workers. Recruiting materials and activities are prepared to target
three student populations: high school, adult learners who want to change
careers, and incumbent workers. High school students are being targeted with two
week Summer Academies. To ensure that pre- and in-service high school teachers
are up to date with existing and changing techniques and knowledge in this
industry, they are invited to attend semi-annual workshops and are mentored by
community college faculty. The laboratory facilities are also being used by
community college faculty who are supervising students on independent research
projects.
