This project will investigate the use of time-of-flight design techniques in the
design of optical computers. This is a new design approach that takes advantage
of the absence of capacitive and inductive effects, giving optical interconnects
an advantage over electrical one in high-speed digital systems. As a result,
propagation delays can be precisely controlled in optical interconnects and
logic, thus mitigating problems such as clock skew. This feature of optics
motivates a new method of digital design, where latches used to synchronize
signals are removed. To synchronize signals at logic gates, the designer instead
relies on adjustments of signal propagation delays. Clock gating is used to
eliminate residual timing uncertainty which would cause phase drift in feedback
loops. This new scheme eliminates latch overhead and allows deep pipelining at
the gate level.
