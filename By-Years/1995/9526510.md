9526510 Wine This project addresses the subject of sources and sinks of
atmospheric nitrous oxide. This species is the dominant source of ozone-
destroying nitric oxide radicals in the stratosphere. Furthermore, it is a
greenhouse gas, and its concentration has been increasing. The current belief is
that nitrous oxide has no natural sources other than microbiological activity in
the ground and oceans, and its destruction is solely by photodissociation and
reaction with excited atomic oxygen in the upper atmosphere. However, current
estimates of sources and sinks suggest the existence of a currently unrecognized
source. Furthermore, recent measurements of the isotopic composition of
atmospheric nitrous oxide cannot be explained by accepted sources. Laboratory
experiments will be performed in this project to investigate the potential
formation of nitrous oxide from the reactions of electronically excited nitrogen
dioxide and hydroxyl radicals with molecular nitrogen in the presence of oxygen.
Chemical kinetics modeling studies will investigate why nitrous oxide is
efficiently formed upon UV illumination of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture without
ozone added, but not in a mixture of all three. These calculations will provide
guidance for future experimental investigation of the issue of nitrous oxide
production and destruction. ***
