The PI will examine algorithm design issues in the areas of parallel
computation, pattern matching, coordinated robot arm motion and nonlinear
electrical circuit theory. In particular: 1) the parallelization of tree-
structured computations and their applications; 2) an investigation of mesh
architecture with a primary focus on developing methods for translating PRAM
algorithms to meshes; 3) developing efficient algorithms for various forms of
convolutions, for constructing suffix trees of trees, and for pattern matching
in trees; 4) the development of efficient algorithms for coordinated motion of
robot arms; and 5) the design of polynomial-time algorithms for the steady-state
and transient analysis of several classes of nonlinear electrical circuits.
