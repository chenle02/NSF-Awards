This action is to support the air fare costs of U.S. invited participants to an
international symposium to be held in Cambridge England. State-of-the-art
lectures will be held on: 1) neuroanatomical basis of brain-gut interactions; 2)
extrinsic innervation of the gut; 3) afferent and efferent modulation of gut
function; and 4) pathophysiology of brain-gut interactions. This symposium
offers a forum for interaction of some of the most brilliant investigators in
this field from all over the world. The sharing of ideas on this subject may
lead to new experimental approaches to topics such as gastrointestinal
malfunction as well as hormones and autonomic behaviors.
