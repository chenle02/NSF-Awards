This research will concentrate on problems connected with a semi-simple,
simply-connected algebraic group G over a field k, the Borel subgroup B of G and
a Schubert variety in the flag variety G/B. The P.I. has developed a standard
monomial theory as a generalization of the classical Hodge-Young standard
monomial theory. The following specific problems will be considered. Determine
the multiplicity of a singular point on a Schubert variety. Write down the
equations of the conormal bundle of a Schubert variety. Study the variety XY =
YX = 0 where X and Y are matrices. Develope a standard monomial theory for a Kac
group associated to an indecomposable, symmetrizable, generalized Cartan matrix
of affine type. This research is in algebraic geometry, the study of the
geometric objects (varieties) arising as solutions of systems of polynomial
equations. The P.I. considers very concrete varieties and asks for very
explicit, combinatorial answers to them. The types of varieties she considers
are very important and the type of answers she seeks are widely applicable. Very
important results will come out of this research.
