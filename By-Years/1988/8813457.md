This award supports cooperative research in the origin of ore deposits to be
conducted by Ian Lange of the University of Montana and Roman Tejada, Chief
Geologist of the Compania Minera in Lima, Peru. They will study the San Vicente
zinc-lead deposit which occurs in shallow water-deposited Triassic carbonate
shelf rocks. Preliminary data support a model of hydrothermal replacement of
laminated carbonate-evaporites. This will be tested, first by reconnaissance and
detailed mapping jointly by Lange and his Peruvian host. Subsequent work will
analyze petrographically the samples collected from the mineralized horizons of
the mine and from adjacent deposits and wall rock carbonates. This work, through
a better understanding of the depositional environment and mechanisms of
formation will help the Peruvians in exploration and extension of ore bodies
essential for their economy. It will also help the U.S. in studies of other
rythmite-type deposits such as Mississippi Valley Zn-Pb and Pb-Zn-Ag-Ba deposits
just below the sea water-sediment interface.
