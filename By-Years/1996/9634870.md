9634870 Soboyejo The proposed research will integrate micromechanics and
materials science concepts to develop synergistically toughened NiAl composites
that consist of coated alumina bridging fibers and partially stabilized zirconia
particles. The concept of synergistic toughening of NiAl is a novel method of
utilizing what is known about martensitic transformation and fiber reinforced
composites to design new advanced material with optimal toughness. The proposed
work is multidisciplinary and collaboration with NASA Lewis strengthens the
proposal and facilitates the production of the proposed synergistically
toughened NiAl materials. The proposed work is high risk but if successful it
will generate fundamental understanding of the synergy between transformation
and bridging as operative toughening mechanisms in composites. ***
