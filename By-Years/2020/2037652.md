NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Microelectronics have continued to push the limits of
miniaturization in efforts to improve performance. Improvements in device
performance have been enabled by the introduction of new materials within the
current microelectronics architecture but gains may not continue and new
paradigms for devices are needed. In addition to improved performance, improved
energy efficiency is an important factor in newer generations of devices. In
order to develop a more energy-efficient electronics platform, spintronics,
based on the manipulation of electron spin (not charge), has been identified as
a promising alternative to present day charge-based microelectronics. Of
particular interest are spintronics based on pure spin current where power
dissipation is minimized because the movement of charge is minimized. This
project addresses the challenge of identifying and developing a new class of
materials for efficient spin current propagation and detection. One class of
promising materials is based on metal oxide thin films of CaIrO3 and PdCoO2. The
research involves the design, synthesis, and characterization of these thin
films. Additional research activities include the training of undergraduate and
graduate researchers, including underrepresented minorities, who are likely to
find future employment in the information technology sector.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This integrated research and education
program is focused on the development of a new class of conductors with high
spin orbit coupling and high carrier mobility in 4d and 5d transition metal
oxide thin films. Research activities include unique approaches to exploiting
non-equilibrium processes to stabilize epitaxial iridate and Pd based oxide
films. Synthesis of these films will be complemented with structural,
electronic, and magnetic characterization of the films themselves and subsequent
fabrication and characterization of spin current-based heterostructures composed
of these films. This research is timely as it exploits recent development of
iridate films and the recent increased understanding of spin current transport.
These studies provide an avenue to large spin-to charge and charge-to-spin
conversion necessary for spin current control and may enable a new type of spin
current based microelectronics. Education aspects of this project include the
training of education opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and
the development of an apprenticeship and modular materials physics curricular
program for local high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
