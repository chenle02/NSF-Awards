Ultrasonic imaging and assessment techniques are becoming more and more
important in medicine, non-destructive evaluation, anti-submarine warfare,
robotics, and industrial processing. This grant provides funds for a conference
on the applications of computers and digital processing in sonic and ultrasonic
imaging and flow measurements. In recent years, much of the processing of
ultrasonic data has been performed by computer manipulation of acquired data.
Many new techniques have been originated by the relevant scientific community.
This conference provides a much needed opportunity for exchanging new ideas in
this rapidly moving field.
