Dr. Millane will continue to explore and extend x-ray analysis of oriented
fibers as a means of obtaining atomic details of molecular structures and
molecular interactions. Thereby it is hoped that a better understanding will be
developed of how many biologically and industrially important polymers achieve
their useful properties. He has already developed and made extensive use of
linked-atom least-squares technology to augment sparse diffraction data with
stereochemical information. He plans to continue to improve the quality and
reproducibility of the x-ray intensity data using objective algorithms,
particularly profile fitting. Theory and algorithms for calculating diffracted
intensities from disordered specimens, use of intensity statistics, and use of
molecular graphics will be explored. Efforts to improve fiber diffraction
technology will be both motivated and disciplined by being coupled to analyses
of biologically significant and industrially useful polymers including xanthan
and its variants, DNAs, xyloglucans and "Kevlar", and studies of synergistic
interactions between polysaccharides.
