*** 9629076 Mukherjee This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
will develop a next-generation Computer Aided Design (CAD) software package for
three-dimensional (3D) stress analysis and optimal shape design of solid
structural components. Although use of CAD is quite common, the currently used
finite element method (FEM) based approach has serious shortcomings. The primary
obstacle is the need to discretize (mesh) the entire domain of the 3D body into
(volume) finite elements. This task, which cannot be reliably and efficiently
automated for bodies of complex shape, becomes particularly onerous during
optimal shape design where the shape of the body changes during successive
design iterations and, therefore, the body must be remeshed during each
iteration. Also, volume discretization is not naturally compatible with either
solid modeling or with shape design algorithms. This project uses an entirely
new computational engine - the boundary contour method (BCM). This approach only
requires meshing of the bounding surface of a body and numerical evaluation of
regular line integrals for 3D problems. Therefore, automatic meshing, both
initially and between design iterations, becomes straightforward and the need to
evaluate only regular 1D integrals makes the process very efficient. Also, the
BCM approach, being surface based, is naturally compatible with both solid
modeling and shape design algorithms. The feasibility of the BCM approach, for
stress and sensitivity analysis in 3D linear elasticity, has been demonstrated
in the Phase I project. The primary research tasks in Phase II, in addition to
further code development and testing, are (a) coupling of the code with
optimization software in order to carry out shape optimization, (b) adaptive
meshing - both initially and during each design iteration and (c) development of
a parallel version of the code for operation on a network of desk-top computers.
If the research is successful, the resulting package is expected to be a
significant advance in CAD technology. It should help to blur the current
artificial and costly distinction between analysis and design engineers, greatly
reduce product time to market and product development cost, and should be in
great demand throughout the industrial sector. ***
