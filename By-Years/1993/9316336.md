9316336 Evans The PI will perform experiments to measure the change of porosity
and permeability with time in rocks saturated with water at high temperature and
pressure. Cracked rock samples will be saturated with fluid and heated to
400-600 C at various combinations of fluid and confining pressure. Permeability
will be measured before, during and after the hydrothermal treatments. Extensive
microstructural analyses will be performed to understand the changes of
microstructure and pore geometry that occur, including measurements of mean
values and distributions of crack length, crack aperture, and orientation. Such
measurements will show the evolution of the pore space, and can be compared with
stereological measurements of natural samples and samples that have been
thermally cracked without pore fluids. With a new apparatus he will measure the
evolution of the permeability with time while the samples are under hydrothermal
conditions. Some experiments will also be done with triaxial loading to test the
effects of non-hydrostatic stresses. ****
