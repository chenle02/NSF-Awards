Kin recognition is a fundamental mechanism in animal behavior. Many animal
species, including humans, are able to discriminate between close relatives and
other individuals of the same species, and to behave preferentially to close
relatives. Often, the signals used by animals to make these discriminations are
odors, but only in the honey bee have specific chemical compounds been
identified that enable animals to tell relatives from non- relatives. This
project will provide new information on how these odors are used by honey bees,
will identify additional such odors, and will enhance our understanding of how
the production of odors is inherited. In a practical sense, the project will
suggest new ways to manipulate honey bee colonies so that beekeeping practices
may be improved. The results may prove to be particularly important in
suggesting ways of preventing the African honey bee from disrupting beekeeping
operations.
