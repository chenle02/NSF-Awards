This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), Professor
Vincent J. Catalano and colleagues Ana de Bettencourt-Dias, Jason Shearer, and
Robert S. Sheridan from University of Nevada at Reno will acquire a cyber-
enabled electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer capable of low
temperature measurements. This spectrometer will advance research projects
studying biochemistry of metalloproteins, investigation of weak biomolecular
interactions, transient organic (bi)radicals and carbenes, and development of
lanthanide-based MRI contrast agents and luminescent materials. By cyber-
enabling the spectrometer, it will be available to regional
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An EPR spectrometer yields information on the
molecular and electronic structure of molecules. It may also be used to obtain
information about the lifetimes and identities of free radicals, short-lived
species that are often essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a
variety of chemical reactions. These studies will have an impact in a number of
areas, from chemistry to materials and biological chemistry. This instrument
will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.
