This project will investigate how physiological changes regulate protein-based
inheritance in yeast. Protein-based heritable elements (prions), particularly in
fungi, are novel genetic elements that produce heritable changes in their host
cells without any change in the DNA of their genes. This effect is achieved by
switching between protein conformations (termed isoforms) one of which (the
prion isoform) is able to reproduce itself by inducing other molecules of the
same protein to switch into the same (prion) isoform. This project looks
specifically at how these transitions are aided by another class of proteins,
termed molecular chaperones, whose normal function is to promote correct protein
folding and prevent protein misfolding. Understanding the physiological control
of protein-based inheritance has a potential impact on the industrial use of
yeast and other fungi. The research is integrated with course development,
teaching and mentoring, thus assuring educational benefits in the areas of
genetics, biochemistry and bionanotechnology. The research team includes both
men and women graduate and undergraduate students, and a diverse team will be
deliberately maintained. This project will also help to strengthen research
infrastructure by contributing to the development of interdisciplinary centers
at Georgia Institute of Technology.

The main objective of this project is to uncover the pathway connecting the
protein synthesizing ribosomal machinery to the cellular apparatus of heritable
protein aggregation. The unifying hypothesis is that the ribosome-associated
chaperone complex serves as a sensor of physiological changes and mediates
effects of such changes on heritable protein-based elements (prions). This
provides a new mechanism for physiology and the environment to influence the
hereditary constitution of the cell and organism. The project uses yeast as a
model system and employs a combination of genetic, biochemical and proteomic
techniques, including newly developed approaches for aggregate detection,
potentially applicable beyond yeast.
