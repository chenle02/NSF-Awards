A common dilemma of first-year college chemistry is that the needs of diverse
student populations are not being met by the traditional instructor focused
classroom. At College of DuPage, Oakland Community College, and Oakland
University this diversity includes ethnicity, age distribution, aptitude,
science background, and learning styles. In this project, classroom time is
being used to help students develop conceptual understandings that incorporate
the ability to view phenomena from multiple perspectives. Classroom activities
stress active learning and scientific exploration. Topics and methods are used
that reflect contemporary science integrated with the personal experiences and
interests of students. Interactive-multimedia materials, showing synchronized
multiple representations of chemical species and phenomena, are being developed
and used in classrooms and by groups of students. A sense of ownership of new
materials and commitment to their use is being developed by involving faculty,
from all institutions, in their selection, design, development and evaluation.
Student versions encourage group learning and exploration. Training workshops
are aimed at assisting faculty in implementing the multimedia materials in
manners that promote more active learning environments. Evaluations assess: 1)
changes in classroom pedagogy, 2) achievement gains of students, and 3) changes
in students' attitudes toward science. Project products will be nine multimedia
modules, student versions of each module, training workshops and their support
materials, assessment materials and research analyses of the effectiveness of
all products.
