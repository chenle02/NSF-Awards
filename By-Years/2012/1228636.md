Through MAA's Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics (CUPM), the
MAA has released a Curriculum Guide approximately once every decade. The last
such Guide was released in 2004. CUPM is now developing the next generation of
guidelines and recommendations to help mathematical sciences departments
effectively meet the challenges they face in educating the next generation of
STEM leaders. Students interested in STEM careers have many more choices than
they did twenty years ago. The array of possibilities in course offerings,
standards, and requirements has left many mathematics departments asking for
assistance in designing and innovating mathematical sciences majors for the 21st
century. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To develop the next Guide, CUPM has formed groups
of faculty from diverse institutions to focus on specific courses and program
areas. Focus groups have been convened at national meetings to help shape CUPM's
efforts. Panel discussions at national meetings are being used to solicit
further input. Draft guidelines will be circulated broadly in advance of the
formal release, targeted for early 2015, in order to ensure that the Guide meets
the needs of the mathematical sciences, and broader STEM, communities. In
addition, MAA will organize sessions at national and regional meetings, both
during the development of the Guide and after its release, to provide guidance
to faculty and departments for using the recommendations to improve their
undergraduate mathematics program. NSF's Division of Mathematical Sciences is
providing co-funding, reflecting its interest in improving undergraduate
education in the mathematical sciences.
