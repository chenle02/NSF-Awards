8901607 Sattinger This project concerns the investigation of Hamiltonian
hierachies based on semi-simple Lie algebras viewed as gauge theories of a flat
connection. Flat connections arise in a multitude of problems, such as the self-
dual Yang-Mills equations, and embedding problems in differential geometry. An
approach to extending Sato's infinite dimensional Grassmannian picture of the
Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierachy to the nxn hierarchies is proposed, based on the
solution of the inverse scattering problem for nxn first order systems on the
line. The co-adjoint action for the hierachies is to be investigated from the
point of view gauge transformations and the Riemann-Hilbert factorization
associated with the solution of the inverse scattering problem for nxn systems.
The approach is based on the formulation of the results of scattering theory in
terms of principal bundles, and the "dressing method" of Zakharov and Shabat.
