This proposal is a request to purchase additional copies of the recent High
Energy Physics Advisory Panel subpanel report Quantum Universe. The report has
been so successfully received that additional copies are needed for public
outreach. These copies will be distributed to the general public, to science
policy makers and to the broader scientific community at the annual meeting of
the American Physical Society Division of Particles and Fields in Riverside, CA.

This project is supported by MPS/ Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.
