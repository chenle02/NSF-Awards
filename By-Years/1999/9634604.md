9634604 Taylor Description: The proposed research "Photoinduced Degradation in
Doped Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon (a-SiLH)" is a collaboration in materials
research between Professor Craig Taylor, University of Utah and Professors P.C.
Mathur and R.M. Mahra, University of Delhi. This proposal adds an international
component to Professor Taylor's research on the properties of disordered
semiconductors and thin-film photovaltaic materials. Taylor has made significant
progress in understanding metal chalcogenide glasses as a model system linking
tetrahedrally-coordinated amorphous materials and traditional chalcogenide
glasses. As a logical extension, this proposal will concentrate on photo-induced
degradation and transport properties of n-type doped silicon- sulfur alloys.
Scope: This is a new collaboration linking two university research laboratories
in the US and India. The research seeks to understand metastable defects in
a-Si:H that are crucial for optimum performance of solar cells. The research
combines US expertise on growth, optical and magnetic resonance characterization
and Indian expertise on transport and structural measurements. The research plan
is designed to make progress on ultimately improving the stability of devices
such as thin-film transistors and solar cells. ***
