This project lies at the intersection of dynamics, geometry and topology. The
project aims to study various dynamical questions in hyperbolic geometry and
Teichmuller theory. The main focus will be to continue the study of random walks
on groups acting on hyperbolic space and the mapping class group acting on
Teichmuller space. The goal is to extend further the analogy between the two
situations, specifically to show that the associated harmonic measures on the
boundaries of these spaces share similar properties. Other projects include the
study of dynamical aspects of non-classical interval exchanges and continuation
of the study of translation lengths of pseudo-Anosov maps on the curve complex.
The relationship between dilatations and curve complex translation lengths along
a fibered face for the Thurston norm on the second homology of a fibered
hyperbolic 3-manifold will also be explored.

The theory of surfaces such as the surface of the ball or the donut, is of
fundamental interest across many fields of mathematics. Teichmuller theory is
the study of the possible shapes a surface can assume. The proposal focuses on
these shapes and their interactions with certain transformations of the surface
called mapping classes. The main goal is to explain how the shape evolves under
random transformations. Other projects include understanding the complexity of
the transformations. One measure of complexity is the complexity of curves
obtained on the surface by repeating a transformation. The problems outlined in
the proposal are important in varied fields like geometry, topology and
dynamical systems. It is hoped that the proposal will initiate fruitful
collaborations and offer mentoring opportunities at several levels from
postdoctoral fellows to undergraduate students.
