Proposal #: 93-21493 The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the R/V MOANA WAVE, a 213 foot vessel, which is owned by the Navy and
operated by the University in support of oceanographic research. Instrumentation
requested includes a water sampling rosette system, an ARGOS receiver, two
transmissometers, refubishment of two gyroscopes, a pinger, an altimeter,
computer hardware, and a radioisotope van. The instrumentation requested is
required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the MOANA WAVE during 1994 and
will enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the future.
