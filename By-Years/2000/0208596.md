This research is focused on developing a new, symmetric framework for computer
architecture prediction motivated by the signals approach to data analysis. This
research uses styles of prediction in two dimensions: periodic vs. computational
and local history vs. global history. This is built on top of the principles of
discrete signal analysis. There has been a significant amount of work done on
prediction mechanisms, especially for branch behavior. The initial focus of this
new work will be on value prediction because it is the least well understood
area. However, the framework and methodology are applicable to branch
prediction, dependence prediction, etc. This research will investigate new
prediction schemes using two techniques: analogy between local and global
schemes, and data analysis techniques in the case of a computational predictor.
Global predictors can lose accuracy due to pipeline delays. This research
project will investigate methods for avoiding the delay penalty for global
predictors. The detailed microarchitectural simulation involves a high number of
tradeoffs. A detailed study of predictors in that context is a significant study
that is included in this project. There is also considerable work to be
performed on combining predictors in cost effective and practical ways.
