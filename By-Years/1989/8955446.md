Pomona College will initiate a six-week, residential, Young Scholars project in
Physics and Astronomy for 36 students in grades 11-12. The Summer Science
Program offers advanced secondary students the opportunity to work in an
accelerated, college-level program of mathematics, physics, computer science,
and astronomy. These disciplines are strongly integrated into a course of study
that is centered on a research project: the orbit determination of an asteroid.
The students are involved in the entire research problem: from taking
photographic plates, to making astrometric measurements of reference stars and
asteroids, to final orbit calculations. The Program is national in its scope,
and particularly looks for students in underrepresented groups who are capable
of advanced study and who may pursue careers in science and engineering.
