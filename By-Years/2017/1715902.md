This NSF award provides partial support for the 15th annual Graduate Student
Topology and Geometry Conference, which will be held at Michigan State
University on April 8-April 9, 2017. It is specifically aimed at graduate
students, and many of the talks will be delivered by student participants. The
conference will represent a large body of students in different stages of their
Ph.D., and will provide a venue for students from a diverse collection of
institutions and geographic regions to come together and interact. It aims to
create a highly collaborative environment that will stimulate research and
foster lasting connections between researchers at particularly crucial moments
early in their careers. The conference will also provide a venue for students to
hear about cutting edge research from established senior leaders and early
career faculty. The early career faculty speakers, in particular, will be part
of a panel for the students, intended to help bridge their transition from
graduate school to the forefront of research.

The principal goal for this conference is to give graduate students the
opportunity to present their research. Particular attention will be paid to
ensure that a broad collection of topics are represented, so that rising
generations of mathematicians are aware of the current frontiers of geometry and
topology. To this end, there will be also be talks by distinguished plenary
speakers Mark Behrens (University of Notre Dame), Danny Calegari (University of
Chicago), Karsten Grove (University of Notre Dame) and early career faculty
Renato Ghini Bettiol (University of Pennsylvania), Adam Levine (Princeton
University), Tye Lidman (North Carolina State University), Sara Maloni (Brown
University), Jose Perea (Michigan State University), and Wouter Van Limbeek
(University of Michigan). These will provide the opportunity for early career
researchers to personally engage with experts outside of their home university,
expanding and consolidating the network of mathematical scientists. The
