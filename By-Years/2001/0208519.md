The project will conduct research in the following topics:

The design, implementation and testing of scalable method that uses self-
similarity to cluster numerical data sets.The design, implementation and testing
of a scalable method that uses entropy to cluster categorical data sets, based
on the notion entropy.The design, implementation of testing of a scalable method
of clustering mixed data sets.The research will have an impact on the following
applications.Projective clustering: The project aim to use a combination of a
clustering algorithms and singular value decomposition to discover the
dimensions that are most relevant to each cluster in high dimensional data
set.Tracking clusters in evolving data streams: The methods proposed are
characterized by a concise representation of the clusters that have been found
at a given point, and therefore allow the clustering of continuously incoming
data streams. Labeling data through clustering: The incremental methods
developed in the project to obtain new training data for classification
algorithms.
