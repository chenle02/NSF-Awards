Albright College seeks support to improve the utility systems serving research
in the Merner- Pfeiffer Hall of Science. The advent of research activities
requiring environmental controls has overtaxed the electrical system of the
building. Neither the capacity nor the reliability of the existing electrical
distribution system is commensurate with the needs of modern science.
Appropriate temperature and humidity control equipment will be installed in
laboratories, instrumentation rooms, faculty/student research and research
training areas. A state-of-the-art electronic energy management system will be
installed and integrated with existing systems, and insulation will be added to
the roof and attic of the building. Walk-in refrigeration facilities will be
upgraded. An existing dumbwaiter will be converted to a passenger elevator to
provide handicapped access. The provision of an adequate electrical distribution
system will permit the continued installation and use of new instrumentation,
with appropriate environmental controls. Air conditioning will be installed to
provide an appropriate environment for equipment and researchers. Summer
research opportunities for sophomores and juniors will be offered as well as
provision of in-service training for teachers and special summer modules to
stimulate interest among high school students in the natural sciences.
