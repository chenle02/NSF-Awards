Scientists depend on acquiring new analytical techniques to improve their
research abilities and communicate their findings to the public. This Scholars
Award project provides a researcher with training in quantitative research, geo-
spatial analysis, and data visualization in order to create new tools for
understanding and representing linguistic diversity in multilingual communities.
This project would broaden participation of underrepresented groups in the
sciences by also training undergraduate, graduate, and high school students in
ethnographic, linguistic, and spatial mapping and other visual methods. The data
from the larger project would also be disseminated to policymakers and
educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jonathan Rosa of Stanford University, who
has conducted extensive research on contemporary multilingualism focusing on
U.S. Latina/o communities, will spend a summer month and a semester at the Smith
College Spatial Analysis Lab, where he will obtain the methodological skills
necessary to (1) conduct a long-term project combining quantitative and
qualitative analyses of community multilingualism; (2) create new visualization
tools for linguistic data, including interactive maps, providing a more complex
?view? of linguistic diversity; and (3) train undergraduate and graduate
students, as well as community members, in these new research methodologies. The
project would advance the fields of linguistic anthropology and linguistic by
training the researcher in novel visualization techniques that are on the
leading edge for modeling language in society.
