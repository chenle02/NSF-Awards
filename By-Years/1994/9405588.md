9405588 Jaworski Fatty acid biosynthesis in plants is a primary metabolic
pathway that is necessary to provide the fatty acyl components found in the
lipids of membranes and in vegetable oils. In our laboratory, the discovery of
3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase III (KAS III) activity has led to
new questions about regulation of fatty acid formation. We have shown that KAS
III is the predominant mechanism at the start of fatty acid synthesis, but is it
a required step? To answer this question, we will: (1) analyze the effect of
altered KAS III activity in Arabidopsis thaliana and other plants. KAS III
expression will be both increased and decreased in Arabidopsis with antisence
and sense constructs of its cDNA; (2) attempt to identify other KASs and analyze
their roles in synthesis of medium chain fatty acids; and (3) we will determine
if KAS III is capable of interacting with other enzymes of fatty acid synthase
function under in vivo conditions, using a 'two-hybrid' system to detect
protein-protein interaction. %%% Fatty acid biosynthesis in plants is a primary
metabolic pathway that is necessary to provide the fatty acyl components found
in the lipids of membranes and in vegetable oils. Areas under study are intended
to answer basic questions concerning the regulation and contribution of
individual reactions to this essential pathway. In addition, a study will be
initiated to probe questions concerning the molecular organization of this
pathway. What are the basic reactions of fatty acid biosynthesis in plants and
how are they controlled? It has been demonstrated by this laboratory that a
reaction caused by the enzyme 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase, or KAS
III, is the predominant route for beginning the process of fatty acid synthesis.
But whether this in a required reaction has not been proved. One approach to
find an answer is to study how KAS III operates inside the cell during fatty
acid formation. It appears that many of t he enzymes that are involved in fatty
acid formation group together and form large, operational complexes. As a
result, it is believed that the essential role for KAS III, or other KAS-type
enzymes, in fatty acid formation will become clearer if these enzymes also
associate themselves in the same fatty acid producing enzyme aggregations. ***
