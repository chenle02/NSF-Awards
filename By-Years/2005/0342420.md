Little is currently known as to the nature of light-sensitive dissolved organic
matter in rainwater, despite such matter comprising the majority of carbon
present in precipitation. This Research in Undergraduate Institution (RUI)
project continues a series of studies by these investigators on rainwater
chemistry, with a new and novel focus on the photochemistry of chromophoric
dissolved organic matter (CDOM). This process will be characterized by
quantitatively determining how selected trace metals affect the quantum
efficiency and rate of CDOM photodegradation and photo-bleaching under a variety
of conditions representative of the ambient environment. Results from this study
will increase understanding of atmospheric oxidative capacity, the fate of
dissolved organic matter in rainwater, and biosphere/biota response to climate-
induced changes in incident ultraviolet radiation. New information on the
physical and chemical factors determining the nature, reactivity and fate of
CDOM in rainwater will be especially useful for constraining new generation
climate models. Broader community impacts include bringing highly relevant and
timely climate-related research to the undergraduate classroom at the host
institution, thereby challenging the next generation of young geoscientists with
important and engaging real-world issues and problems.
