*** 9531896 Hatley This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is
to design and prototype a dexterous robotic manipulator for applications such as
minimally invasive surgery. The robotic manipulator will provide surgeons with a
new and more dexterous tool for performing diagnostic and therapeutic
procedures. The project has potential in a wide variety of commercial
applications but especially in minimally invasive surgery, including suturing,
dissection and retraction, in procedures such as removal of gall bladder and
bowel resection. ***
