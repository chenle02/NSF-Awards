The American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) and the Colorado
Alliance for Science will collaborate in the implementation of this three-year
project designed to address math/science needs of three Wisconsin and three
Michigan school districts which have a large (90-100%) Native American
population. Collaboration between elementary and secondary teachers will be
promoted; each local team will consist of three elementary teachers, a Native
American teacher-aide, and one high school teacher. The project, which includes
an annual three-week summer workshop, four inservices, a two-day Leadership
Seminar, and classroom observations and visits, will address the stated and
identified needs of teachers of Native American students as determined through
several needs assessments conducted by AISES over the past six years; these
include the need for hands-on strategies, increased content knowledge, more
American Indian culture in teaching math/science, and more training in
cooperative and discovery learning strategies. This leadership proposal is
appropriate for teacher enhancement because it is designed to enhance the
science knowledge and teaching, and develop leadership skills of teams of
teachers from particularly needy population. Non-NSF cost-sharing is
approximately 4% of the amount requested from NSF.
