Electric fields produced by the thermospheric neutral wind dynamo and
originating in the magnetosphere generate ion drifts that are sampled by polar
orbiting Defense Meteorological Satellite Project (DMSP) satellites F15 and F13.
These data, from the years 2001 and 2002 are assembled and analyzed at four
distinct local times and used to determine the morphology of zonal ion drift as
functions of latitude and magnetic activity. The research product is improved
understanding of a variety of ion-transport phenomena, including traveling
ionospheric disturbances (TIDs), storm-time enhancements of ion densities. In
addition, the coupling of the magnetosphere to the ionosphere is intrinsically
investigated by establishing the low latitude limit to the auroral electric
field as well as its response to magnetic activity. The data mining, archiving,
and correlative analysis is tasked to a female aeronomy graduate student.
