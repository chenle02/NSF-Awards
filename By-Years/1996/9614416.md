Bass 9614416 The PI proposes a research program to measure acoustic velocities
(elastic moduli) of minerals and high-pressure silicates of geophysical interest
by Brillouin light scattering experiments. The main thrust of the work will be
measurement of velocities and elastic moduli at high pressures in the diamond-
anvil cell (DAC), and at high temperatures. These data are important for placing
constraints upon the mineralogy and chemistry of the earth's interior, and the
derivatives of these properties are needed in order to unravel the composition
of the Earth's mantle. Detailed comparisons of results with seismologically
determined velocities for the mantle should yield an improved picture of the
internal structure and composition of the Earth. ***
