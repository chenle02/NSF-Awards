The acquisition of cellular asymmetry (polarity) is essential for generating
cell diversity during eukaryotic development. Intrinsic or extrinsic cues orient
cell polarity, but relatively little is known about how cells translate
polarizing cues to establish and maintain a polarized state. The overall goal of
this project is to advance our understanding of how plant cells become polarized
in response to extrinsic cues. Previous work discovered a receptor-like protein,
PAN1, which is implicated in perception of an extrinsic cue that polarizes cells
during the development of stomata (epidermal pores) in maize leaves. Current
project will build on these earlier findings using genetic, molecular and
biochemical approaches to advance the understanding of mechanisms by which PAN1
promotes cell polarity marked by reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and
re-positioning of the nucleus. Specifically, the project will elucidate the
connections between PAN1 and known regulators of actin polymerization, to
identify a protein shown to be phosphorylated in a PAN1-dependent manner as well
as a second gene, PAN2, which is required for the same processes as PAN1, and to
elucidate the roles of the phosphoprotein and PAN2 in cell polarization. This
work will advance the understanding of fundamental aspects of eukaryotic
development that are misregulated in human diseases, and will also have a
positive impact on science education. A postdoc, a graduate student, and an
undergraduate will receive interdisplinary training through participation in
this project. Project participants will develop and lead hands-on learning
activities related to this project in a public San Diego Middle School. Thus,
this project will contribute to future science and technology capabilities in
the United States.
