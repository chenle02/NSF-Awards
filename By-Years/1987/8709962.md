This Accomplishment Based Renewal Proposal is to continue the analyses of warm-
core ring zooplankton spatial and temporal patterns and to use the extensive
data base on the vertical and horizontal distribution of euphausiid species in
the Northern Atlantic to provide a synthesis of the basin-wide distributions of
individual species and their community structure. This research should provide
new knowledge about the zooplankton species structure of rings and how it
evolves through time. It should also enhance the understanding of the population
dynamics of a number of cold and warm-water species living in the North- western
Atlantic Ocean.
