There are many different factors which affect the development of modern science.
Not only are there the intellectual factors which drive a particular discipline,
but there are also influences of adjacent fields, the philosophical milieu in
which the science is imbedded, and the institutional and social factors which
influence the direction of research, the methods to be used, and the selection
of problems to be addressed. Professor Nye is examining this whole complex of
influences in her study of the development of theoretical chemistry at the turn
of this century. Specifically, she is looking at the interactions between
physics and chemistry in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; the aims of
explanation in the modern physical sciences, especially the nature of chemical
explanation in contrast to explanation in physics; and the emergence in the
twentieth century of a "theoretical chemistry." She is approaching these
problems through both the conceptual history of science and the social history
of science, analyzing explanations and theories in chemical textbooks,
monographs and papers; as well as scientific correspondence and statements on
the aims and methods of chemistry and physics; and records and histories of
laboratories and research schools. As a detailed case study within the larger
project, she is working on a study of aspects of the historical development of
physical organic chemistry with emphasis on France and England from roughly
1880- 1950. This case study compares two distinct research schools, over three
generations, one loosely associated with training in London and Manchester and
the second with education at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris.
