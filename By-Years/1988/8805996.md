Radiation damage in materials has important implications in a number of
applications. The purchase of 137Cs irradiation source and attachments will
allow studies of optical transmission and luminescence, thermally stimulated
discharge current, thermally stimulated polarization current and DC conductivity
on optical glasses and fibers. The source is the initial building block in a
system that will allow "real time" measurement on radiation defects to be done.
