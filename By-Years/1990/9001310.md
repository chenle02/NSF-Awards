This a 4-year project to investigate (1) greenhouse-gas- induced equilibrium
climate change (2) greenhouse-gas-induced transient climate change, and (3)
cloud optical depth feedback. A coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM will be used to
perform several 100 year climate simulations under different C02 radiative
forcing scenarios. This investigation is important because it's successful
completion will help determine whether it is possible to detect the greenhouse
signal in the climate record of the past 100 years, and whether changes in cloud
optical depth act to enhance or diminish global warming.
