*** Vogt The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) will establish an REU
Site under the aegis of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
(LIGO) Project. LIGO, a collaborative effort between Caltech and MIT scientists,
is designed to make broad-band (~10 Hz - 10 kHz) observations of gravitational
waves predicted by General Relativity and generated by a variety of
astrophysical processes, including neutron stars, black holes, supernovae and
other sources yet to be discovered. LIGO is sponsored by the National Science
Foundation, construction is underway at two observatory sites at Hanford,
Washington and Livingston Parish, Louisiana. LIGO offers exceptional
opportunities for involvement of undergraduates in research. LIGO detectors
cover a large number of physics disciplines and tools, including metrology,
optics, lasers, mechanical systems, controls, and electronics. LIGO observations
are concerned with strong- field gravitation and a large spectrum of
astrophysical phenomena, ranging from the Big Bang to neutro-star and black-hole
binaries to neutron-star creation in supernova collapses. But most of all, LIGO
will open a new window onto the universe through the new force medium of
gravitational waves and the information carried by them. The LIGO project has a
large and high caliber scientific staff, which can serve as mentors for the
undergraduate students. The LIGO REU Site will be under the jurisdiction of
Caltech, which has a tradition of excellence in undergraduate science and
engineering education. ***
