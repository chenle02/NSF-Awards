The Canadian Shield is an extensive bedrock plain of low relief that covers the
northern United States and most of Canada. The exposed rocks are among the
oldest on earth and were formed generally at elevated temperatures and
pressures. The topo- graphic shield was formed by a broad uplift of the North
American continent between about 1.6 and 0.5 billion years ago. The cause and
timing of uplift is unknown: the only direct evidence for uplift is the presence
of a 1 billion year erosional hiatus. The objective of this project is to
reconstruct the uplift history of the shield during this erosional hiatus by
measuring the apatite fission track cooling histories of surface samples
collected from the shield in Ontario and adjacent areas. Results are expected to
constrain the timing and rate of uplift which are important clues to the causes
of the widespread uplift.
