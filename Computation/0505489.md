To study noise in the Navier-Stokes equations directly is a formidable task,
and so lower-dimensional reduced models are often sought. The investigators
introduce a new computational framework for the study of high-dimensional
nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations, and apply this to
hydrodynamic problems for which there are well-controlled precision experiments
with which to compare. The main characteristics of the approach are: (1) the
noise is introduced in a physically motivated manner; (2) the stochastic problem
is reduced to a problem for the mean flow and another for its variance; and (3)
an efficient implementation is developed involving state-of-the-art spectral
discretization and stochastic integration numerical techniques.

The equations governing hydrodynamics, the Navier-Stokes equations, have been
known for well over a century and have been successful in describing many
observed physical flows. Nevertheless, the transition to complex flow and
turbulence remains an outstanding challenge; it is not clear what role noise
plays here. The investigators develop a novel framework for studying the effect
of noise on the properties, particularly the stability and transition to
turbulence, of dynamical systems modeling fluid flows. The combined use of
mathematical modeling of stochastic processes, design of numerical algorithms,
computer simulations of physical problems and direct comparison with
experimental observations provides an enriching experience for the students
directly involved in the project. The ideas are also incorporated into existing
and new courses.
