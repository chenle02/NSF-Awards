This US-Hungary mathematics workshop, organized by Dr. Andras Recski of the
Technical University, Budapest, and Dr. Leslie Trotter of Cornell University,
will focus on combinatorial optimization. Participants will address topics in
oriented matroids, the matroidal foundation of linear and guadratic programming,
the first strongly polynomial algorithm for the minimum cost circulation
problem, the matroid matching algorithm, proof of the perfect graph conjecture,
the base reduction algorithm, applications in qualitative analysis of linear
systems and a lower bound on the approximability of volume. Results are expected
to contribute to our fundamental understanding of the theory of combinatorial
optimization and its applications. Funds for the workshop are awarded through
the US-Hungary Joint Fund, Budapest, in accordance with established guidelines.
