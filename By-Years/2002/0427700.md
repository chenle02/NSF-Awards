Proposal Number: CNS-0427700&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: ITR - Large-Scale
Network Simulation for Security and Survivability
Evaluation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: George F.
Riley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Internet routing infrastructure and domain name
infrastructure are huge and highly dynamic systems. Understanding and predicting
the functionality and behavior of these systems is highly complex. As is true in
many cases, detailed modeling and simulation of complex systems can help in
understanding their behavior, both in a predictive mode and in a reactive
environment. With a high quality simulation model of such a system, one can
predict the effect of proposed changes, and can understand causes of prior
failures. Further, one can model disruptive actions in the simulated environment
without affecting deployed systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is
focused on the detailed study and analysis of the behavior of these systems,
using newly developed high-performance simulation tools capable of modeling
networks consisting of hundreds of thousands or millions of network elements. A
large part of the effort will be focused on survivability analysis for these
critical Internet infrastructure services, in the presence of either deliberate
or accidental failures or mis-configurations. If this work succeds, the Internet
will become more resilient to failures and more dependable for end
users.&lt;br/&gt;
