9360430 Williford A new technology is proposed to adjust the velocity of sprays
or jets of solvent, in order to augment the ability of the resulted droplets to
transfer momentum to particulate contamination on surfaces. Submicron
contamination, otherwise difficult to remove is emphasized. Carbon dioxide
sprays will be used in this research as replacements for CFC solvent now being
phased out of use. In addition to meeting environmental demands of the Clear Air
Act of 1990, this replacement technology shows promise of improved performance
and operating economics. The research has application to cleaning of silicon
wafers and semiconductors devices, other cleanroom components, hard drives and
information storage disks, drums for printing engines, and photocopiers. ***
