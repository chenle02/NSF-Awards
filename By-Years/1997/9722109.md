Fully general relativistic numerical calculations of the gravitational radiation
produced by the dynamics of compact objects will be carried out by PI Centrella
in collaboration with senior colleagues. One important class of sources concerns
rapidly rotating stellar cores that have expended their nuclear fuel and are
prevented from undergoing further collapse by centrifugal forces. The
development of the bar instability in such an object will produce gravitational
radiation and may shed enough angular momentum to allow full collapse to a
supernova. In addition, coalescing compact binaries are the main target sources
for the ground-based interferometers. Numerical modeling is needed to calculate
the details of the actual coalescence. In particular, the frequency at which the
stars begin their final plunge, spiralling in faster than they would on purely
point mass trajectories, as well as other details of the coalescence waveforms
and spectra may yield valuable information about neutron star radii and the
nuclear equation of state.
