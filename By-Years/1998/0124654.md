0124654 Marincovich

This Americas Program SGER (Small Grants for Exploratory Research) award will
allow Dr. Louie Marincovich and a group of U.S. and Canadian researchers to
undertake a three-week trip in July 2001, near Bay Fiord in west-central
Ellesmere Island, as a pilot study that will, for the first time, coordinate the
efforts of several specialists to decipher the paleobiogeographic and
paleoclimatic importance of the unique biota of this area. The award will be
jointly supported between the Division of International Programs and the Geology
and Paleontology Program of NSF.

Rocks of the Eureka Sound Group on Ellesmere Island, northern Canada (78-79
degree N latitude), record an unusual time, 50-60 million years ago, when the
high Arctic was home to alligators, giant tortoises, diverse mammals, (including
primates and rhinoceroses), woodlands and vast lowland swamps. Mollusks thrived
on land and in the adjacent warm ocean. Although little-known overall, these
diverse and abundant fossils are the only well-preserved record of the Earth's
early Cenozoic arctic climate, and comprise the northernmost known marine and
terrestrial biota of this age These animals and plants lived in an extinct
environment, combining a warm-temperate climate with an arctic light regime of
bright summers and dark winters. The presence of this diverse and abundant early
Cenozoic marine and terrestrial biota at such high latitudes comprises what may
be the most profound paleontological mystery in the Arctic. Studying the fossil
vertebrates, plants and mollusks will increase our understanding of this rich
biota, refine its age, provide insights into long-severed European-North
American land connections, and decipher the polar expression of the warmest
global climate of the past 65 million years. ***
