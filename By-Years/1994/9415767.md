This award will support the deployment of a resonance lidar at the Poker Flat
Research Range near Fairbanks, Alaska. The lidar will provide measurements of
the arctic middle atmosphere from the upper troposphere to the lower
thermosphere. The lidar employs scattering from molecules, aerosols, and metal
atoms to yield measurements of density, temperature, aerosol backscatter ratio,
and metal density in the stratosphere and mesosphere. The measurements will be
used to address several topics of current research interest: the role of
aerosols in the chemistry of the high latitude stratosphere, the occurrence of
aerosols in the polar mesosphere, the temperature structure of the lower
mesosphere and stratosphere, the structure of the mesospheric metal layers, and
the characteristics of waves and tides in the mesopause region. The lidar
measurements will be complemented by a variety of studies of the atmosphere and
the aurora being conducted at the Poker Flat Research Range.
