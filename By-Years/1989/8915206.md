This project involves the development of algorithms, impossibility results, and
upper and lower bounds on complexity, for problems arising in distributed
computing. Specific areas of distributed consensus, resource allocation, wait-
free computation, static and dynamic network communication, and distributed
database concurrency control and recovery. Issues involving time - for example,
the power of timing- based algorithms - are a particular focus. The work on
algorithms is expected to yield supporting work on formal computation models for
distributed and timing-based systems, and on verification techniques.
