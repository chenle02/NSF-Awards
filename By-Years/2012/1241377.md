The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports the 2012
Electron Donor-Acceptor Interactions Gordon Research Conference and Gordon
Research Seminar, being held at Salve Regina University in Newport, Rhode
Island, from August 4 ? 10, 2012. This conference is a leading venue for
dissemination of research spanning chemistry, biology, physics, and materials
science for which electron and energy transfer processes comprise the conceptual
underpinning for molecular and materials design. This year, the inaugural
session of a Gordon Research Seminar for graduate students and post-doctoral
associates, subtitles "The Role of Fundamental Science in Our Energy Future",
will be held immediately preceding the main GRC meeting. This grant is used for
registration and/or travel fees for U.S. students accepted to attend the GRS, as
well as those attendees who wish to also participate in the GRC.
