This chemistry project (Discipline Code 12), adapted from one at Western
Carolina University, increases student-learning opportunities through the
addition of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICPOES) in
chemistry, environmental science, and environmental engineering. Incorporation
of ICPOES provides students with sufficient analytical capabilities to
facilitate environmental inquiry, equips them with needed technological
understanding, and builds critical scientific skills. Use of ICPOES enhances
student participation in discovery-based experiments in air and water
contamination, metal cycling in wetlands, and sediment studies. ICPOES
facilitates projects such as the determination of Pb and Cd in rivers, and As
and Cr in seafood. In addition, ICPOES promotes undergraduate research in
arsenic speciation in soil and plant material, and the determination of air-
borne metals. Project results are disseminated through pedagogical journals,
online via a website, and at regional and national meetings.
