9520108 Moehle On the morning of 17 January 1995, a strong earthquake shook the
central portion of Japan. At this time, the details of the effects of the
earthquake are unclear. However, the death toll has risen above 5000, and there
is evidence of widespread disruption of the civil infrastructure, including
damage and collapse of thousands of engineered structures. Both geotechnical and
structural issues appear to have contributed to the observed damage. While there
are many differences between the conditions in Japan and those in the United
States, it is clear that this tragic event holds many lessons for U.S.
construction practices. Many of the lessons will be lost unless efforts are made
as soon as possible to gather perishable data. This project provides support
through NSF's SGER award mechanism to assemble a team of researchers from the
United States to travel to the epicentral region, gather data, prepare a written
report, and coordinate with other groups from the United States having similar
missions. The team focus on the following two specific areas: (a) Building
Structures, and (b) Bridge Structures A technical report on the reconnaissance
team's findings will be prepared and distributed.
