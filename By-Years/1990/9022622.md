This project studies ceramic membranes modified by a chemical vapor deposition
technique. The alumina precursor materials from Alcoa are asymmetric, with an
alpha-alumina support and a 5 >m gamma-alumina skin layer. Their minimum pore
dimension (40 >) makes them inappropriate for fine molecular-sieving separations
of small molecules. A series of fluorinated silanes are used to provide
precisely controlled decreases in the sizes of the slit-shaped pores of the skin
layer. The proposed mechanism by which the pore modification process occurs and
its reproducibilty are tested in carefully designed experiments. Studies are
focused on the measurement and modeling of the fundamental transport properties
of these model materials. The detailed morphology of these materials are probed
by gaseous and liquid systems. The data provide new insights and allow testing
theories for analyzing transport phenomena in media with pore sizes approaching
molecular dimensions. The new ceramic membranes should find new applications in
separations of gaseous mixtures.
