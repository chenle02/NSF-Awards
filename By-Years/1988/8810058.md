The proposed research consists of an experimental and theoretical study of the
basic factors that lead to enhanced ductility in materials with limited
dislocation mobility. This is an important problem because many strong
structural materials have low ductilities. The research will deal primarily with
the ordered intermetallic alloys of nickel aluminide and iron aluminide.
Specific points to be investigated are (a) the general aspects of the phenomena,
(b) the fundamental factors controlling the ductility, and (c) the relationship
of cyclic to monotonic deformation. The application of these results to
interfaces in composite materials will also be examined.
