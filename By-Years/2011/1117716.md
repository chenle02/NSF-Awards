To apply machine learning to problems in the physical world, one needs
models/algorithms that are faithful to physics. We consider understanding how
the anatomical structure of the body and ears leads to the remarkable ability to
localize a sound source in a complex and noisy environment that is innate in
most animals and humans. The cues used in localization arise from the process of
the acoustic wave scattering off the complex-shaped listener's body and ears.
Numerically, these changes in the sound spectrum are characterized by the head-
related transfer function (HRTF). Every person's body is unique, and the HRTF is
highly individual. It is possible to measure the HRTF; however, the measurement
requires specialized hardware and is tedious. There has been considerable
interest in convenient methods to obtaining the HRTF. We propose to develop a
framework to perform machine learning to establish a relationship between the
anatomy and HRTF. An HRTF database with 100 subjects, along with their
anthropometric measurements, is available. A novel LMA (Learning of Multiple
Attributes) algorithm will be developed. The key properties of this algorithm
are that it can incorporate physical constraints into the learning and predict
complex structured outputs in continuous spaces. The algorithm will find the
low-dimensional manifold in high-dimensional HRTF space and to map the manifold
structure to anatomical parameters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will
create novel machine learning algorithms that are able to incorporate physics
based constraints, and these will find application in other problems. HRTF
generation from simple body measurements will allow introduction of personalized
spatial audio into fields such as human-computer interaction, consumer
electronics, auditory assistive devices for the vision-impaired, robotics,
entertainment, education, and surveillance. Training of K-16 and graduate
students in the proposed research will add to the nations talent pool.
