NCSA requests funding to conduct a two-week Supercomputer Summer Institute in
June 1988 for 33 young scientists and engineers. The supercomputer manufacturer,
Cray Research Inc., will pay for three of these students, while eight will be
employees of NCSA's industrial partners. NSF will thus support the remaining 22
students. Selection will be made by a panel of NCSA academic staff researchers.
The NCSA facilities will be open 24 hours per day and include advanced
workstations and graphics engines and an Apple Macintosh for each student.
Access wil be provided to the Center's current supercomputer, the Cray XMP-48,
with remote access to a Cray 2 supercomputer with a very large main memory.
Students will be taught the mechanics of using a vector supercomputer and will
also be exposed to lectures from computational scientists and engineers in a
variety of disciplines to broaden the students' research horizons. An award to
NCSA for a 1988 Supercomputer Summer Institute is recommended in the amount of
$42,062.
