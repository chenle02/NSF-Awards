research is to study the seismic structure of the Ontong Java Plateau, the
largest expression of igneous activity of the ocean floor. Four seismic stations
composed of PASSCAL instruments will be deployed for two years on the
Micronesian islands of Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kosrae and Nauru. Earthquake sources in
the Solomon subduction zone will be used to investigate the dispersion of
surface waves over the plateau to measure seismic structure to depths on the
order of 200 km. Concurrently, a number of body wave experiments will be
conducted targeting the structural anisotropy of the crust and upper mantle in
the area. The work is expected to provide answers to such questions as the exact
thickness of the crust, the nature of the deep crust, the structure of the
mantle (lid and underlying low velocity zone) of the plateau, and the extent and
direction of anisotropy in the upper mantle. In turn, these parameters will put
constraints on the environment and mechani sm of emplacement of the plateau in
the Cretaceous. ***
