Although vehicle-to-vehicle communications is often seen as a means of
preventing accidents and improving safety, the resulting vehicular networks may
also prove to be a new and cost-effective way to provide Internet access. This
requires access to spectrum. Policymakers around the world face difficult
questions regarding spectrum access for vehicular networks, including how much
spectrum should be available for non-safety uses of vehicular networks such as
providing Internet access, whether vehicular networks should share spectrum with
other kinds of applications, and if so, what forms of spectrum-sharing are most
appropriate. This project lays the groundwork for research that will inform
these important spectrum policy decisions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers in
this project gather empirical data from an actual vehicular network deployment
consisting of over 900 vehicles that are equipped with Dedicated Short Range
Communications (DSRC) devices, and use that data to construct models of
vehicular networks. This includes data on vehicle movement, signal strength and
propagation, the Internet traffic generated and received by actual users, and
resulting traffic flows. This data forms the basis of a packet-level simulation
constructed using open source NS software. Subsequent research projects will use
those models to quantify both the cost and the benefit of various spectrum
policies, including sharing-among-equals as occurs in typical unlicensed
spectrum bands, and multi-tier spectrum-sharing as has been proposed for the 3.5
GHz band in the United States.
