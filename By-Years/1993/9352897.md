9352897 Santos The Maricopa Mathematics Consortium (M2C)--composed of the
Maricopa County Community College District, the second largest community college
district in the country; Arizona State University, the fifth largest public
university in the United States; and four public school districts in Maricopa
County-- are instituting a two-year project that is resulting in significant
systemic change in the teaching/learning process in precalculus mathematics: the
bridge to calculus. The participating institutions, who serve 235,000 students,
have a long history of cooperation and joint development. This collaborative
effort includes restructuring the curriculum, developing materials to reflect
the changes to be made, and using technology and new pedagogies. Faculty/staff
development is being provided during all phases to build faculty support and
confidence in these new approaches to teaching mathematics (776 faculty). During
the evaluation process, they are examining outcomes at key benchmark points in
the areas of faculty development, student learning, and developmental processes.
A team of administrators, faculty, and staff are providing leadership and
management to the project with support from key individuals who serve on the
National Advisory Committee.
