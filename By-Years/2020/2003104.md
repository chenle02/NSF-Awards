This award is for partial support to hold a 3-day open community workshop from
March 16-18, 2020 at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The theme is "Rock and
Paleomagnetism through Time and Space". The first two days of the workshop will
be focused on science combined with dissemination of essential information about
MagIC and paleomagnetic data. The third day of the workshop will include hands-
on sessions for uploading data; accessing, manipulating and visualizing the data
from both new and existing data sets; for data model discussions; and for
brainstorming on new directions. It will bring together scientists from various
backgrounds, perspectives and subdisciplines using paleomagnetic databases to
solve science problems across Earth sciences. The program and this support will
foster the participation of young scientists, such as post docs and graduate
students, and there is an outreach plan that aims to broaden participation. The
meeting organizers have articulated a code of conduct for the meeting.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop has two overarching goals. First is to update
the community about improvements, modifications, and new resources available for
users of the MagIC paleomagnetic database. These include streamlined approaches
to uploading data, discovering data contributed by others, using online tools
for visualization and analysis, and progress in implementing APIs (application
program interfaces). The organizers also plan to gather feedback for
enhancements to the MagIC database and for improving the interoperability of
MagIC with other databases. The second goal is to engage a multi-disciplinary
group of scientists in the discussion of scientific questions that require
magnetic data to solve problems across fields. Four themes will be allocated a
half day each, and are intimately related to MagIC's core activities, as well as
linking to other areas where researchers have interests in interoperable data
discovery. The research foci are "(1) Paleomagnetism and Improving the
Geological Timescale; (2) Tectonic Applications of Paleomagnetism;(3) Variations
of the Magnetic Field Through Earth's History; (4) Rock and Paleomagnetic
Methods &amp; Instrumentation."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
