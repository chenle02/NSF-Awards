Program synthesis is the process of automatically generating programs that meet
the user's intent. As one of the most central research problems in computer
science and AI, program synthesis is extremely challenging. Recent years have
seen success stories of algorithmic program synthesis in real-life code
generation. Despite the promising progress, modern-day synthesizers can still
only be mastered by experts. One vital problem is that program synthesis has not
been integrated to the traditional software development process that most
regular programmers are familiar with. This project takes a major step toward
lowering the barrier of algorithmic program synthesis for regular programmers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key insight is that the challenging steps in the
current synthesis process can be perceived as part of the synthesis task and
incorporated into the synthesis algorithms. More specifically, this project
develops new synthesis frameworks and algorithms that enable scalable,
quantitative, library-based program synthesis without hand-crafted objective
functions, library models or decomposition strategies. This project aims to make
software development easier for regular programmers by transforming program
synthesizers into more natural and accessible tools. The project also has the
potential to significantly broaden the base of people who can overcome the
programming-related challenges in their own fields. The project will provide
valuable training for graduate students, enable novel pedagogical approaches and
material suitable for compiler-related, synthesis-related and networking-related
courses, and provide new computational thinking assessments and tutorials for
broadening participation of K-12 and undergraduate students for broader
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
