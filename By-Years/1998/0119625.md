The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) is the recipient of
an award for summer internship support. HACU, a national, non-profit
organization, has a long and distinguished record of providing summer internship
opportunities through the organization's National Internship Program (NIP).
Through the NIP academically prepared students throughout the US and Puerto Rico
have received quality internship assignments through various federal government
agencies. Students who participate in the NIP are exposed to various career
options in the Federal sector that serve as a basis in helping them make
informed career choices and solidify career objectives. By partnering with the
Federal government, HACU has been able to successfully place over 2,700
students, representing 27 states and PR, in summer positions since NIP commenced
in 1992. In an effort to continue its collaboration with HACU, the National
Science Foundation, a participating government agency for the last five years,
will offer challenging assignments that will broaden the exposure of
participants pursuing careers in science, mathematics, engineering and
technology (SMET). Internship opportunities create an unique opportunity to
assist in the fulfillment of two core strategies related the goals of NSF's
mission: developing intellectual capital, and integrating research and
education. As a result the Foundation actively participates in strengthening the
infrastructure to achieve excellence in SMET education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
