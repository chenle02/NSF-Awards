9321986 Longo This proposal is a request for support of a continuing program of
research in high energy physics which includes a test of the MAX detector at
Fermilab (T864); analysis and publication of data from previous experiments at
Fermilab (E683), E756, E800); and a search for magnetic monopoles trapped in
matter. T864 is a test for a detector that proposes to look in the very forward
regions of the highest energy collisions for unusual states of the 'quark gluon
condensate'. Hints of events in which all neutral states that appear as large
gaps in the rapidity distributions have been reported in cosmic rays. ***
