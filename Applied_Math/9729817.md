Abstract: 9729817 Robert Finn The focus of this research is the study of
capillarity phenomena of liquid surfaces. Capillarity effects are commonly
observed in the shape of the surface of water or other liquid in a glass. For
narrower containers, such as a test tube or drinking straw, the capillary forces
make the surface of the liquid more curved and lift the liquid up the sides of
the container. Interest is growing in this topic which has applications in areas
as diverse as fluid management in low gravity, semiconductor manufacturing,
behavior of liquids in porous rocks, and many other situations in which surface
forces predominate over gravity. A significant parameter in capillarity
phenomena is the angle that the liquid makes with a solid surface, this angle is
called the contact angle. The angle depends on the liquid and the properties of
the solid surface. The principle investigator has shown that in the presence of
a corner, the height of the capillary surface in the corner depends, in a
discontinuous way, on the relation between the angle of the corner and the
contact angle. One aspect of this research will be applicable to finding new
ways of determining the contact angle. The mathematical questions to be
investigated will require new and as yet untested ideas for their resolution.
The problems are exciting, relating formal mathematics directly to physics and
leading to experimental verification. It is expected that the new results will
display and clarify further exotic behavior of the surfaces.
