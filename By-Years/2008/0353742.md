The Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at South Dakota State University for the summers of 2004-2006. The
site is cofunded by the Biology Directorate. Jihong Cole-Dai is the site's
program director and James Rice is co-principal investigator. Faculty members
from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry will serve as REU mentors to
six students, who will each participate in a ten-week program. The students will
be recruited nationally as well as regionally from South Dakota and states that
neighbor eastern South Dakota. The proposed research projects will include
analytical, environmental, biochemical, physical, materials and organic
chemistry. The program will conduct periodic assessments and comprehensive
assessments at the end of each summer. All participants will engage in a REU
seminar program in the final week.
