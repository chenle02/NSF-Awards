ABSTRACT Dadarlat

Research conducted in the last ten years has revealed unexpected rigidity
properties of noncommutative C*-algebras. Whereas the cohomological invariants
of a space (commutative C*-algebra) will determine the space at most up to
homotopy equivalence, in the class of nuclear simple C*-algebras, the objects
are often determined up to isomorphism by their K-theoretical invariants.
Elliott's conjecture states that, far from being an accident, this is always the
case for the entire class of separable nuclear simple C*-algebras. (Tracial
invariants are needed if the real rank is nonzero.) The proposed research aims
to uncover and explain rigidity properties of nuclear C*-algebras. The basic
idea beyond the classification program is that that the simplicity and the
stable or real rank conditions for a nuclear C*-algebra translate to certain
internal dynamical properties of the algebra which forces a behavior typical to
that of a combinatorial object. The C*-algebra becomes a rigid object built
around its K-theory skeleton. The ramifications of the classification theory
into the structure theory of C*-algebras will be explored with emphasis on
dynamical systems and group C*-algebras. The investigator will analyze the
impact of the recent advances around the Baum-Connes conjecture on the
classification theory with the long term goal of formulating and exploring a
Baum-Connes type conjecture for general nuclear C*-algebras. This is closely
tied with the universal coefficient theorem problem in KK-theory and deformation
theory of C*-algebras. Geometry was developed in an attempt to describe the
ambient physical space. Its history has seen a series of remarkable achievements
from the Euclidian geometry to the non-Euclidian geometries which culminated
with the Riemannian geometry providing a successful model for large-scale
spacetime in general relativity. The noncommutative geometry of Alain Connes is
a far reaching generalization of the Riemannian geometry, well adapted for the
study of a variety of large and small scale structures. The theory can be viewed
as a significant development in the quest of quantizing of mathematics following
the successful quantization of physics. As in quantum physics, the coordinates
in this theory are no longer ordinary numbers but noncommuting operators acting
on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. The ordinary spaces are being replaced
by algebras of operators. The proposed project aims to contribute to the
extensive effort of a community of researchers to extend the mathematics of
commutative spaces to operator algebras.
