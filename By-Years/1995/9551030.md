Through this project, an Engineering Computer Laboratory is being established
and operated by the campus Information Services Department. Because of lab
location and program proximity, chemical engineering and industrial engineering
students are expected to form the bulk of the students using this facility.
During periods when no engineering classes are scheduled, the laboratory is
available for use as an open lab for any student. All chemical and industrial
engineering majors are required to use computers to complete their coursework,
so all Chemical and Engineering students benefit from this project. Current
emphasis on computational access is integrated throughout the curriculum, from
the introductory material through design and engineering applications.
Significant course development in the engineering programs is also occurring as
integrated access to computer technology is available. This laboratory
establishes a platform for the delivery of engineering courses that utilize
computer applications and provide an integrated design experience for all
engineering students.
