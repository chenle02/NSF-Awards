9403672 Siniff A study of the ecology of Antarctic seals will be conducted in
conjunction with a physical oceanography cruise that will take place in the
Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas during February and March 1994. The objectives
of the oceanography and design of the cruise track offers an unparalleled
opportunity to investigate the region's seal populations. A recent international
workshop on Antarctic seals has identified these top level predators as
potentially important in the carbon flux of the Southern Ocean. This workshop
posed questions to address hypotheses regarding the seals' roles in the pack ice
ecosystem. This cruise will help collect data on one of these nine important
research questions: "What are the causes and scale of variation in the
distribution of pack ice seals?" Since the cruise is multidisciplinary in
nature, there will be data collected on oceanographic parameters, as well as
bird abundance which will make possible analyses to give insight into functional
relationships and hence causes of variations in distributional patterns. The
seal studies will collect data on densities and distribution, as well as tissue
samples for genetic comparisons among regions of the Antarctic. ***
