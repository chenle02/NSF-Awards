The project will enhance upper-level undergraduate experiences in molecular
biology in four ways: 1) improve the required Genetics course by increasing
student access to its hands-on recombinant DNA component; 2) initiate a
Molecular Biology Techniques course; 3) engage more students in undergraduate
research; and 4) widen the scope of this research. Students will clone a well-
defined DNA fragment in a plasmid and express it in a vector, construct and
screen a simple gene library using colony lifts and non-radioactive probe
detection systems, PCR amplify a DNA sequence, and sequence DNA. The
improvements are modeled after a NSF-supported Faculty Enhancement biotechnology
course at Boston University which uses E. coli's gene system as a cohesive
framework for these activities. Hands-on laboratories and a wider scope of
undergraduate research activities will open basic science career options to
talented students and improve their successful entry into graduate and
professional programs and the high technology workplace.
