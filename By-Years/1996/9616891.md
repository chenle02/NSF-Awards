Brace 9616891 This project will create a 50 state supreme court data base.
These data will facilitate theoretically focused empirical studies that are
essential to the progress of comparative judicial scholarship generally and
state court research specifically. The data will combine state supreme court
judge votes, case outcomes and case characte4ristics with judge attributes,
institutional procedures and selected state contextual variables. Judicial
scholarship heretofore has examined single states or 50 state studies at very
high levels of aggregation. The result has been a compartmentalization of
findings and a disjunction between micro and macro level explanations of
judicial behavior and outcomes. This project will provide the systematic data
that will hasten the development of theory that connects the law and judges with
their institutional, political, and social contexts. These data will promote
diverse theoretical efforts and rigorous methodological debates. Data will be
archived at the ICPSR and a web page will be constructed to publicize the data
and to facilitate the exchange of useful information among users. %%% This
