This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports the research of Professor John F. Hartwig at Yale University. This work
seeks to uncover unusual reactions and fundamental principles in the chemistry
of metal-boryl and borane complexes by evaluating the chemistry of complexes
with Lewis-acidic ligands. It endeavors to functionalize hydrocarbons with metal
boryl complexes and to synthesize metallocene borane complexes related to
catalytic hydroboration processes. These topics are to serve as case studies in
how the electrophilicity of boryl ligands and borane substrates leads to new
chemistry that has not been observed with more conventional organometallic
systems. Boryl intermediates that interact with hydrocarbons will be
investigated and substituent effects on selectivity will be measured in order to
address how the electrophoricity of covalent ligands affects reactivity. Both
fundamental and practical aspects of the early metal-borane and boryl species
will be studied. The properties that stabilize or enhance the reactivity of
these complexes will be studied with regard to their effects in catalytic
hydroboration. The chiral selectivity of titanocene-catalyzed hydroboration and
the selectivity of single addition to dienes will be studied.
