The Department of Chemistry is establishing an Undergraduate Program in
Computational Chemistry is providing advanced molecular modeling capabilities
enabling undergraduates to explore complex molecular structures and the
structure-function relationships inherent in inter-molecular interactions.
Molecular modeling is becoming an integral part of the junior level organic
chemistry course and the focus of the senior bioorganic course. The facility is
also being used extensively by undergraduates enrolled in quantum chemistry to
examine how the relation between quantum mechanics and molecular structure is
reflected in rotational, vibrational, electronic and magnetic resonance spectra.
