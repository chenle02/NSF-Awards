Dr. Begelman will study the formation and growth of the most massive black holes
in the cosmos. These are the powerhouses for the luminous active nuclei that are
found at the centers of luminous galaxies. The black holes must grow rapidly,
since luminous quasars were already shining less than two billion years after
the Big Bang. With a postdoctoral researcher, he will explore a fairly detailed
picture for how massive black holes could be born. Gas rapidly falling inward
first forms a gravitationally bound core, which is then compressed by the weight
of the outer layers of gas. This structure collapses (due to thermal neutrino
losses) to form a black hole surrounded by an envelope of gas, from which
material continues to fall in. The team will examine the structure of these
objects using one-dimensional stellar evolution calculations, and use the
hydrodynamic code ZEUS to study how the pressure of radiation from material
falling onto the black hole blows away the gas enveloping the black hole.

Dr Begelman plans to prepare a second edition of his 1996 popular book
'Gravity's Fatal Attraction' (with Martin Rees) which will incorporate results
from this research, and write an instructor's guide to make the book useful as a
text for undergraduate survey courses. He will develop a planetarium show on how
black holes shape the growth of galaxies, to be presented to the public and K-12
school groups at U. Colorado's Fiske Planetarium. A postdoctoral researcher will
be trained by participation in the research.
