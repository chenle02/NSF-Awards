9633469 KU Radioactive 26Al (half-life 0.7 My) and 10Be (1.5 My) on the earth
are produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with atoms in the atmosphere and
in the surface of rocks. They enter the ocean chiefly via wet/dry fallout, with
nearly constant proportions primarily reflecting their atmospheric production
ratios. Although these cosmogenic radionuclides and their stable isotopes (9Be
and 27A1) differ in source functions, their pathways in geochemical reservoirs
are linked through the isotopic kinship. Together, these isotopes can be used as
powerful time and process tracers in geophysical studies. Such tracer studies
have become feasible with recent improvements made in the analytical techniques,
particularly the ability to measure 26Al in marine materials. Measurements will
be made of authigenic 10Be/9Be ratios in sediments, concentrations of 10Be,
26Al, and U-unsupported 230Th in sediments, suspended particulate matter and
sediment-trap material, and 10Be and 7Be in sea water. These measurements will
improve our understanding of the factors governing the oceanic 26Al-10Be
fractionation and distribution, and facilitate our use of the sedimentary
signals of 10Be/26Al to trace paleoproductivity, and 26Al/230Th to trace past
variations of cosmic-ray intensity. In addition, 26Al, 10Be and 7Be will be used
to evaluate particle flux variations and particle dynamics in the water column.
