This award will provide two-thirds funding for the development of a stimulated
Brillouin scattering instrumentation system that will use dynamic shock
compression techniques to measure compressional and shear wave seismic
velocities in minerals of the Earth's mantle under mantle conditions of
temperature (up to 3500K) and pressure (up to 130 GPa). The instrument system is
to be developed in the shock pressure laboratory in the Division of Geological
and Planetary Sciences at the California Institute of Technology. Caltech is
committed to providing the remaining one- third funding necessary to carry out
the project. There is a strong need for direct laboratory measurements of
seismic velocities in the materials considered to exist in the Earth's deep
mantle. Such measurements are required for the geological interpretation of
seismic velocity-depth profiles reconstructed from earthquake and other seismic
signals. Current high-pressure technology does not permit such measurements
under conditions of static pressure, and shockwave techniques to be developed in
this project offer the only means of obtaining them.
