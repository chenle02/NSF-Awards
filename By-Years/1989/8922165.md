Title: South Carolina EPSCoR Program: Phase II Abstract Narrative: This South
Carolina EPSCoR two-year continuation award is to bring the State of South
Carolina up to active status with the thirteen current EPSCoR States so that all
seventeen States will compete on an equal basis for Advanced Development Grants
in 1991-92. The South Carolina proposal embraces two research components: 1)
Molecular Genetics, Genome Mapping, and Gene Manipulation, and 2) Program in
Molecular and Population Biology. The total award is for $895,000 and presents a
non-federal "match" of $1,073,000. The proposal was merit reviewed; site visited
and recommended for funding subject to some modifications which were
incorporated in the award submission. The proposal is recommended for funding.
