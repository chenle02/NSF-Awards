This project addresses several robotics research issues. They include generation
of robot dynamics equations of motion using symbolic manipulation software;
control concepts which will increase speed of response, robustness, and ability
to reject disturbances; experimental studies on the relationship of end-effector
stiffness to joint and link flexibilities; and robot simulation using solid
modeling with an emphasis on collision avoidance.
