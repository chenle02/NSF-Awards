This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will produce advances
in document clustering technology. The company's proprietary software transforms
a long list of raw search results into organized hierarchical folders that are
browsed in Windows Explorer style. This software brings into easy view relevant
information that otherwise would remain buried in the search results. It also
enables effortless knowledge discovery: at a glance, a user learns themain
subtopics corresponding to the query. The company has the first document
clusteringtechnology good enough for mass use, in terms of speed, quality of the
clustering, and ease of interaction. The resultant software product will augment
the capabilities of web, enterprise, and database search engines. The market
will include search engine vendors, system integrators and large organizations
in business, academe, and government.
