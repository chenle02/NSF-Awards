9615712 Lyons This grant provides $82,965 as one-half support of the cost of
acquiring an inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES).
An ICP-OES is uniquely suited to the reserach conducted by these PI's on the low
temperature redox geochemistry of organic -rich shales and the redox chemistry
of anoxic waters from the Cariaco Basin on the continental shelf of Venezuela.
ICP-OES has superior capabilities for analyses of the light elements Fe, S and P
in seawater over an ICP-MS do to the decreased sensitivity of an ICP-OES to
matrix effects in samples with high total dissolved salt contents and isobaric
interferences which plague ICP-MS analyses of Fe, S and P. Additional studies
that will utilize the capabilities of the ICP- OES will include, major cation
analysis of groundwaters to trace flow directions and contaminant transport and
geochemical studies of leucogranite petrogenesis. ***
