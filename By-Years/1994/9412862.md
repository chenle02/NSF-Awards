9412862 Vahala A series of systems level experiments of wide-band, lossless,
wavelength converters shall be carried out. These wavelength converters are
based on the principles of four wave mixing in quantum well traveling-wave
amplifiers. The experiments planned include a measurement of the intensity noise
introduced into the converted signal by the conversion process, a single channel
system measurement testing the effect of the converter on bit error rate (BER),
a two channel measurement to study potential channel cross-talk effects caused
by the conversion process, and a feasibility test of semiconductor TWA
wavelength converters for dispersion compensation by way of the spectral
inversion technique. In addition, mixed-strain amplifiers will be investigated
as polarization independent converters. The amplifiers used in this project will
be supplied at no charge by AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories. In addition, a 500MB/sec
bit error rate tester will be donated to the project b AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories (see letter in proposal). ***
