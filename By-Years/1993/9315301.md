The Marine Board of the National Research Council's (NRC) Commission on
Engineering and Technical Systems serves the national interest by providing, as
a result of requests from sponsoring agencies, or on its own initiative,
evaluations and advice concerning ocean developments and uses and the nation's
ability to meet its marine and maritime goals. The board considers questions of
the relation of engineering and technology to coastal and offshore resource
development and operations; to navigation and the commerce of the sea,
waterways, and ports; to related human resources and onshore activities; and
their relation to the establishment and implementation of public policies. The
Board identifies opportunities and needs for new technologies and other
developments and recommends appropriate actions. It stimulates the exchange of
information and cooperative activities, and provides a forum for the national
and international professional community. The activities through which the Board
accomplishes its program are: (1) assessments of the technical capability to
undertake and manage offshore and maritime developments and uses, including the
adequacy of knowledge to support technology development; (2) evaluations of
safety of personnel and of the environment; (3) assistance in the preparation
and assessment of the government's program directed to ocean and maritime
developments and uses; and (4) identification of future opportunities for the
integration of advanced technology into marine or maritime systems and the
influence of technical advances on the establishment and implementation of
public policy.
