A project has been developed which is concerned with the dispersion of particles
in a turbulent shear flow. Single particles of variable size shall be injected
onto the center-line of a turbulent jet; laser light scattering will be used to
measure the position of the particle across a plane of the jet. It is intended
that Lagrangian statistics of particle dispersion be obtained as a function of
the relative time scales for particle motion and for turbulence. A second
project is being developed to study the effect of mixing rates on turbulent
diffusion flames which are confined in a duct. In particular, the formation of
soot and its radiation are of interest in confined diffusion flames. As the
axial pressure gradient is increased, mixing rates are enhanced and the
formation of soot particles may be suppressed. Measurements of soot volume
fraction and velocities will be made in these flows. A third area of interest is
in particle formation in mixing flows. This work is related to condensation in
mixing layers, aerosol nucleation kinetics and possibly material synthesis in
flames. A numerical study is being performed on the effect of mixing on a
condensational aerosol in a mixing layer. An experiment is planned in which
laminar flows containing trace amounts of ammonia and hydrogen chloride form
particles via a relatively slow reaction.
