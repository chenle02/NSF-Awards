The Savannah River Scholars Program (SRSP) is increasing the number, quality and
diversity of students graduating with bachelor degrees in chemistry, computer
science, mathematics and physics. SRSP is offering sixteen scholarships per
year, averaging $5,700 each for four consecutive years to academically talented
and economically disadvantaged students. In addition to financial support, SRSP
students are assigned a faculty mentor and a peer mentor. Undergraduate research
is both encouraged and supported, and SRSP students attend monthly seminars on
STEM research and graduate school and career opportunities. SRSP hosts a Career
Connection panel composed of local industry leaders and alumni in relevant
fields. Recruitment efforts focus on high school seniors planning to major in
chemistry, computer science, mathematics or physics; ASU students enrolled in
gateway STEM courses; part-time students; students showing interest in or
engaged in undergraduate research in the targeted disciplines.
