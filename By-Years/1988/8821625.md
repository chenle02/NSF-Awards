The Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
is a national facility for the utilization of ultra-violet and soft x-ray
synchrotron radiation in scientific investigations. The studies carried out at
SRC impact a number of disciplines including condensed matter physics, atomic
and molecular physics, chemistry, and materials science and engineering, and
other disciplines. SRC is a user oriented facility which accepts proposals from
all qualified investigators. It supports a community of 388 users from 58
university, national, and industrial laboratories. There are 18 beamlines in
operation now, six are under development, and five more are proposed. Included
are two dedicated beamlines in operation, one under development and two more
allocated for the Center for X-ray Lithography. An x-ray microscope using an
undulator as its source is under construction. Research performed at SRC has
proved extremely productive, with recent publications corresponding to 15% of
the world-wide total for the same period. The responsiveness of SRC and its
users to new developments is shown by the 25 recent papers on high-temperature
superconductors, the first submitted in April 1987. The addition of a soft x-ray
beamline, and the improvement of the 1 GeV storage ring operation for higher
currents are planned. The ring improvements will provide more high energy
radiation which are especially important for the x-ray lithography program.
