9321060 Merit, Inc. Aupperle The major project elements for the routing arbiter
include advancement of Internet routing algorithms with respect to scaling and
stability issues, routing information registration and dissemination for the
network service providers serving the Internet, deployment of route servers to
aid in the dissemination and real time maintenance of the global Internet
routing system, and coordination and sharing of technical information in support
of the Internet operations community. A key task for the routing arbiter will be
to enhance the use of new switched services offered by the telecommunications
carriers, sucy as ATM, in place of dedicated point to point technology that is
widely deployed in wide area internets. This proposal is a part of a
collaborative effort with USC. Merit will take the lead responsibility for the
Management and Coordination, Transition, Routing Registry Dababase, Routing
Operations Center (ROC) and GateD software development and collaboration. It
will provide consultation to USC in routing engineering who will take the lead
in research and development. Both the Merit and USC teams will collaborate in
all areas, but Merit will take the lead for operations, for communications with
clients relative to the services provided and for overall coordination.
