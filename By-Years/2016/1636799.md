The proposed work seeks to improve understanding of the dynamics and
thermodynamics of tropical cyclones (TCs), with a specific emphasis on
hurricanes and tropical storms in the Atlantic Ocean basin, specifically within
the upper troposphere/cirrus canopy. The team proposes to elucidate the factors
controlling diurnal pulses in convection within the canopy (and possibly
rainfall within the TC), which is an interesting and relatively new question
within the tropical cyclone research community, and one that may have
interesting implications for TC track and intensity forecasts. The team proposes
to use a hierarchy of numerical models to investigate the sources and
consequences of upper tropospheric stability; especially the use of existing and
under-utilized observations from the NASA Global Hawk and NOAA G-IV. This work
will involve the training of several graduate students; with a goal to recruit
students from underrepresented groups. The societal benefit of this study is
through the potential improvements to hurricane track and intensity forecasts.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study seeks to utilize a large set of airborne
observations and numerical models to study the physics of high clouds associated
with tropical cyclones. The observations comprise under-utilized flight-level
turbulence data from the NOAA G-IV aircraft, dropsondes from the G-IV and the
NASA Global Hawks. This study will describe the distribution of turbulence, low
Richardson number, and multiple tropopause structures in tropical cyclones. The
emphasis will be on differences within and beyond the high clouds and with
respect to time of day. The study will also evaluate daily variations, with
focus on the recently discovered, outward-propagating pulses of high cloudiness.
