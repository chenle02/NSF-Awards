A workshop jointly funded by NASA, NSF, and several other federal agencies will
be held at George Washington University on April 11-12, 1985. This workshop will
summarize present understanding of the fundamental behavior of radar backscatter
from distributed targets (both land and sea), summarize current theoretical and
experimental approaches to modeling, and recommend high-priority areas for
future fundamental research in modeling the behavior of distributed targets for
microwave remote sensing.
