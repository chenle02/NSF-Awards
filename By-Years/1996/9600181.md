9600181 Smith This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project is led by Ross
Smith and Manoranjan Mitra of the University of Nevada Reno in conjunction with
Jorge Rubio Rojas of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. The
two groups will unite their expertise to focus on the problems of contamination
of waters and soils by heavy metals, including radio nuclides, oils, and other
waste, making use of the experience in phytoremediation for heavy metals of the
U.S. group and the use by the Brazilian group of hydrophobic aquatic plants for
removal of oils. Mechanisms contributing to metal ion or oil uptake will be
studied in detail. New floatation techniques centering around variants of tall
column devices will also be expanded. The work takes advantage of overlapping
areas of expertise in the two countries and will contribute significantly to the
development of graduate students who will participate. The support for the
Brazilian team is provided by CNPq as part of a bilateral U.S.-Brazil agreement.
