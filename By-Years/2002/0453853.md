The focus of this research will be to carry out the asymmetric allylation (and
crotylation, cinnamylation, etc.), Friedel-Crafts, and cycloaddition reactions
of aldimines and ketimines using 5-membered ring silanes prepared from chiral
amino alcohols and diamines. Silanes, when constrained in a 5-membered ring by
1,2-diols, aminoalcohols, or diamines possess Lewis acidity sufficient for
efficient yet mild, highly enantioselective organic transformations. Mechanistic
studies designed to elucidate the origin of the effect, and the mechanism of
asymmetric induction will be carried out and the application of the proposed
reactions to selected problems in target-oriented synthesis, such as the
preparation of the marine natural product lepadiformine, will demonstrate the
utility of these reagents.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. James L. Leighton in the Department of Chemistry at Columbia
University. Professor Leighton will focus his work on the discovery and
development of a new family of silicon-containing reagents and catalysts for
asymmetric synthesis. The reagents will be developed within the parameters of
several criteria defined to maximize the practicality and utility of the
reagents. Thus, they will be readily and inexpensively prepared, they will be
isolable and stable to storage, they will be environmentally benign, and their
use will require no extraordinary techniques or procedures. The work has
potential for important broader impact in the pharmaceutical and fines chemicals
industries and the project serves as an excellent setting for the training of
undergraduates and graduate students.
