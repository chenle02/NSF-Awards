This project will address the physical processes responsible for the heating and
wind acceleration in solar coronal holes. To determine which mechanism is
dominant in supplying the wave energy to solar coronal holes, the PI will
calculate the efficiency of generation of Alfven tube waves by large amplitude
acoustic waves existing near the top of the solar convective zone. The
calculated wave energy fluxes will then be compared to those obtained earlier,
and to the total heat input required by observations. These studies will be
important to understanding the principal energy sources for solar coronal holes
and the basic physical processes responsible for creating the heliosphere.***
