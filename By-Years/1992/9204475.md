The principal investigator will study two igneous intrusions within the Bays-of-
Maine complex, using field, microscopic, and analytical techniques. The main
goals of the study are to understand the processes of hybridization, the
physical and chemical interactions between basaltic replenishemnts and
underlying silicic cumulates, and the effect of basalt replenishment on magmatic
compositional history.
