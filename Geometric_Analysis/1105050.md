Mazzeo's proposed research focuses on a number of themes related to geometric
analysis on singular and noncompact spaces. He is studying various types of
curvature equations, both on compact stratified spaces and on complete manifolds
with asymptotically regular geometries, via both elliptic and parabolic methods.
Particular topics here include constant curvature and Einstein metrics with
prescribed singular structure, for example with conic points or edges, or for
certain problems even on stratified spaces of arbitrary depth, and also the
development of Ricci flow techniques on such spaces. He will also conduct
research in several parts of spectral geometry on singular spaces, including the
study of analytic torsion on manifolds with edges and on smooth manifolds
degenerating conically, and on more classical spectral problems on the space of
polygons. Other parts of this project include the analysis of a class of
degenerate parabolic problems on piecewise smooth, e.g. polyhedral, domains,
arising from the Wright-Fisher model in population genetics. He is also
investigating the regularity theory for a nonlinear Dirichlet-to-Neumann
operator which arises in the study of properly embedded minimal surfaces in
hyperbolic space. Finally, he is also analyzing the singular solutions of a
class of semilinear Toda-like elliptic systems, which has direct application to
some newly introduced string field theories.

In general terms, Mazzeo's research is driven by the central tenet that certain
types of singular spaces -- specifically the ones known as stratified spaces --
arise just as naturally as smooth manifolds, which are the most common objects
of study in geometry, and both classes of spaces should be considered as
comparably important. However, the foundations of geometric analysis on singular
spaces are still in a relatively primitive state, and Mazzeo's work is aimed at
developing techniques which are meant to be broadly applicable to many natural
geometric and analytic problems, both linear and nonlinear, on such spaces. This
work is guided by a close examination of many particular problems of recognized
importance, arising from both commonly studied questions in pure mathematics and
from problems emerging at the interface of mathematics and physics. The
expectation is that these natural problems will drive the formulation of the
general theory so as to make it accessible and useful, and in turn, this new set
of techniques should help answer many problems of interest in these established
fields.
