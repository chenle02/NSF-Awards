The visual cortex is a main center of the brain for processing visual input.
From physiological recordings, it is known that part of this area acts as a
"map" of visual space, so that an object in a particular place in the visual
world evokes activity in nerve cells (neurons) in a particular place in the
visual cortex. It remains unclear just how that neural activity in space and
time is related to the perception of an object and its location. This project
utilizes further development of a novel multiple-electrode array to investigate
how highly local stimuli might mimic normal visual signals. Engineering
techniques are developed to interface the array with the brain, and to provide
adequate stimulation in a way to test feasibility for a visual prosthesis for
the blind. Electrophysiological tests will be done to try to correlate
stimulation patterns with thresholds for visual sensation. Results will provide
valuable information on how spatially patterned visual stimuli produce visual
perceptions of objects in the world. This work will have an impact not only on
visual neuroscience, but on clarifying neurobiological principles of coding in
the cortex in general, and on the development of bioengineering visual aids for
the blind.
