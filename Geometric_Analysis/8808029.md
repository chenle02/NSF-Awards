Michael Gage will continue his research on curve shortening problems. These
questions ask for information on the asymptotic behavior of a curve, in the
plane or in a surface, which is evolving according to its curvature. For example
this situation would occur if an elastic curve were allowed to slide in a
surface. The techniques to be applied are a mixture of analysis and geometry.
Many of the problems will find applications in the evolution of vortex filaments
in fluid dynamics and wave fronts in excitable media. Gage's immediate goals are
the study of the curve shortening problem on complete surfaces with bounded
Gauss curvature; the analysis of the curve shortening flow for locally convex
immersed curves; and the analysis of the size of the blow up set for the
curvature. He will also study related flows. In particular these include area
preserving curve shortening processes and higher dimensional analogues in which
curves are replaced by hypersurfaces.
