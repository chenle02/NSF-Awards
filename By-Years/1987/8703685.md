A major effort will be made to understand the molecular details of trp repressor
interaction with, and regulation of, the operators of the three operons this
repressor controls. Structure-function studies will be performed using mutant
repressors. These studies should elucidate the structural requirements of the
tryptophan binding site, the process of dimer formation and the properties of
heterodimers, the role of the amino terminal arm, and the relationship between
the amino acid sequence of helix E, the DNA-recognition sequence of the
repressor, and recognized base pairs in the three operators. In addition, second
site reversion studies will be carried out with various mutant classes to
analyze compensating interactions within the repressor and functional
alterations in different regions of the repressor. Physiological studies will be
continued in an effort to better understand how trp gene regulation occurs in
growing cells. Studies on the evolution of tryptophan synthetase will continue
and will focus on the gene rearrangement and gene fusion that occurred in the
evolution of the single tryptophan synthetase polypeptide of yeast and
Neurospora from the separate polypeptides of bacteria.
