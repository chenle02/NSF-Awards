An award to Professor J. Winicour of Pittsburgh University is recommended to
enable him to develop reliable computational codes for the theoretical analysis
of gravitational radiation expected to be generated from the collision of
neutron stars and the coalescence of black holes. The sought for time profile of
gravitational wave amplitudes from binary black hole systems is important
information for increasing the sensitivity of gravitational antennae by
filtering the signal from the noise.
