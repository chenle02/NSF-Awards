9709996 Weidner This proposal is to continue a collaborative project between
seismologists and mineral physicists. The project's goal is to increase the
understanding of the Earth's upper mantle and transition zone through an
integrated, quantitative analysis of seismological and mineralogical data.
During the first year of this project, the PIs have completed two collaborative
investigations of the fine structure of the 410-km and 660-km phase transitions.
These studies demonstrate that some of the details of these transitions
predicted by the laboratory data (e.g., finite width) can be resolved by seismic
data on frequency-dependent reflection coefficients and triplicated waveforms.
Moreover, it appears that the seismic data can constrain model parameters that
are only poorly determined in the laboratory. In the next phase of research,
they will use a combination of mineralogical and seismological constraints to
derive a new generation of regional upper-mantle models that should eliminate
some inconsistencies evident in their published models. They will also conduct
new seismic experiments to resolve the fine structure of the 410-km, 520-km, and
660-km transitions and use these data to test hypotheses based on refined
mineralogical models. ***
