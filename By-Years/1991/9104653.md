Vibrio fischeri is a marine bacterium that forms a symbiotic relationship in
the light organs of monocentrid fish. A recent finding of the PI reveals that
the bacterium produces a phosphodiesterase (CDPase) for cyclic AMP that is of
unusual activity and specificity, and is periplasmic in location. The
biochemical characteristics, cellular regulation, and functional role of this
activity will be examined by a wide spectrum of analytical approaches, including
gene cloning and replacement methods, in order to assess the possibility of
nucleotide-based biochemical interactions between these symbiotic bacteria and
their hosts.//
