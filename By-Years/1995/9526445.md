EEC-9526445 El-Aasser This award funds a collaborative research effort between
the Industry University Cooperative Research Center at the University of New
Mexico on Microengineered Ceramics and the Industry University Cooperative
Research Center at Lehigh University on Polymer Interfaces. The overall
objective of this collaborative research is to gain a better understanding of
the interfaces between particulates (ceramics at New Mexico and rubber at
Lehigh) and epoxy polymers in order to control the thermal conductivity and
fracture toughness of the resulting composite materials. The University of New
Mexico Center is investigating boron nitride particulate surfaces, and the
Lehigh University Center is investigating the effects of epoxy polymer chemistry
and rubber surface characteristics on the interface between the boron nitride
and rubber particulates and the epoxy resins. The two centers are cooperating in
the processing and characterization of both the particulates and the composites
that are produced. The physical and thermal properties of the composites are
also being evaluated.
