These investigators continue research in basic properties of atomic and
molecular structure and reactions of interest to aeronomy. The work combines
laboratory astrophysics with basic rate process models to provide broadly
applicable methodology for the aeronomy and planetary atmospheres' communities.
The PI will focus on electron excitation and photon absorption properties of
atomic nitrogen, molecular nitrogen, and oxygen. In sum, he will: (1) perform
high resolution absorption measurements to obtain accurate rotationally
dependent electric dipole moments, applied to high resolution emission
measurements for accurate definition of predissociation loss in band
transitions; (2) measure electron excitation cross sections important to
aeronomy, and establish a model structure for oxygen collisional and radiative
systems; (3) establish an experimental setup for measuring atomic nitrogen
electron impact cross sections, with an accompanying atomic model; and (4)
reexamine the ionization-excitation cross sections of molecular nitrogen, and
reconcile with existing accurate photoionization data.
