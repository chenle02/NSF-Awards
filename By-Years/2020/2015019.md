The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to broaden autonomous vehicles (AV) adoption. This project will
customize program analysis for the AV software domain to achieve automated
safety/security compliance verification and enforcement.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project proposes to leverage novel static program analysis and formal
verification techniques along with runtime safety/security enforcement to
complement existing AV software testing with two major technologies to: i)
correct safety compliance issues and enforce user-configurable safety
requirements, ii) detect and mitigate common security vulnerabilities. Given the
input of safety rules or vulnerability patterns, the proposed technology will
provide strong guarantees of zero false negatives in compliance verification.
This means that once compliance of a rule or security property is verified, it
is guaranteed that no violations of that rule or security property exist in the
software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
