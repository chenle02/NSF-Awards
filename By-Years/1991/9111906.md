This award supports a delegation of chemists from U.S. universities to
Czechoslovakia to become acquainted with research activities in chemistry in
Czechoslovak universities and research institutes. The U.S. delegation will
identify areas of mutual research interest which may become the focus for future
cooperation. The delegation will gain first hand experience about the status of
chemistry in Czechoslovakia. Finally, the personal contacts established during
this visit will lead to closer cooperation between U.S. and Czechoslovak
chemists. This is a research planning grant which involves a report to the
Foundation shortly after completion of the trip. The report will be widely
circulated to other government agencies as a means to expedite interactions
between U.S. and Czechoslovak chemists.
