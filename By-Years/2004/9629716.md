9629716 Wade Speciation, the splitting of one species into two, is a basic
process in biology. It occurs when two populations become genetically different
enough that they cannot produce fertile offspring. This project studies the
genetic basis for this reproductive isolation in two species of flour beetles,
Tribolium castaneum and T. freemani, which produce sterile offspring when
crossed. In crosses among different strains of these species, there is variation
in the proportion of offspring that are female and the frequency of deformed
males. Genetic crosses and selection experiments will be used to investigate the
genetic basis for these differences. These experiments address how selective
forces and genetic variation within a species result in enough divergence for
reproductive isolation and speciation. Studying the genetic basis for speciation
is fundamental for understanding the generation of species biodiversity.
