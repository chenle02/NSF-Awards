Abstract 9531691 Castaneda The REU Site program at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham (UAB) will be in structural engineering. Six students will
participate in this program annually. The students will learn methods for
conducting research and build relations with fellow REU peers as well as with
faculty through organized activities. Example research topics include: 1.)
Nonlinear dynamic analyses on steel braced frame power generation facilities,
2.) Damage occurring at newer bridge decks, 3.) Forensic investigation of
collapsed structures due to earthquakes, 4.) Properties of concrete, and 5.)
Instrumentation and remote monitoring of bridge structures.
