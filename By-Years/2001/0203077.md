Interest in a class of new class of liquid crystal materials referred to as
banana liquid crystals is presently very high among the chemistry, physics and
liquid crystal device community. A workshop to be held in the Fall of 2002 will
be hosted by the Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal Materials Research Center, an NSF
MRSEC at the University of Colorado at Boulder to address important and timely
research issues that have recently emerged. This will include discussing and
agreeing on a much needed classification system to replace the existing
convention based on order of discovery. The funds will be used to assist junior
faculty, post-docs, and graduate students to attend and present their own
research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The liquid crystal community continues to have
direct impact on education and the development of new materials for
technological advances of high significance to society. The latter include the
development of novel electro optic devices of high commercial interest.
