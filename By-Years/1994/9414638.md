This project provides supports the Fifth International Conference on Hydrogen
Effects on Material Behavior, scheduled in September 1994 at Jackson, Wyoming.
The only conferences in the United States devoted solely to hydrogen
embrittlement over the last twenty years have been the preceding conferences in
this series in 1973, 1975, 1980 and 1989. Earliest conferences concentrated on
new hydrogen phenomena and efforts to test existing hypothesized mechanisms of
embrittlement. Recent conferences have focused on mechanisms of behavior,
refinements of experimental approaches, and needs for future research to further
understanding. The intent of this conference to provide a clear statement of
progress in understanding problems of hydrogen, including those related to
intermetallic alloys and other new materials; to evaluate the prospects for
corrective or preventive approaches for hydrogen damage and/or embrittlement;
and to identify needs for future research. This conference series has clearly
demonstrated the effectiveness of interaction among university, industry, and
government laboratory scientists and engineers in addressing these problems and
creating a stimulating forum. Materials specialists and designers are concerned
with respect to the behavior of new materials in environments containing sources
of hydrogen.
