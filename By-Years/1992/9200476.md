The ability to expand the research opportunities for undergraduate students to
participate in some of the advanced research laboratories in the Bradley
Department of Electrical Engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University (Virginia Tech) is the basis for this REU site. The summer program is
specifically designed to provide opportunities predominantly to students from
historically black colleges and universities, but not exclude students from
other institutions.
