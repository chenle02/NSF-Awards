9625793 Vesilind This is an award to support research, the objective of which is
to obtain a better understanding than now exists of factors that affect
thickening and dewatering of suspensions of biologically active solids. The
investigator's initial objective is to synthesize a suspension using polystyrene
latex particles to simulate bacteria, alginate to simulate microbial
extracellular polymers, calcium as source of potential bridging cations, and as
yet unknown component to simulate flocculation. Research on biologically active
suspensions of solids has been hampered by their variability. Results of this
research aimed at developing a synthetic equivalent of these suspension has the
potential of significantly improving our understanding of their behavior when
subjected to sedimentation and dewatering. This improved understanding in turn
has the potential for improving the engineering design of new bioreactors
processing systems for treatment of domestic and industrial wastewaters and in
operation of existing systems.
