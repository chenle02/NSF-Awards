&lt;br/&gt;EIA - 0205641&lt;br/&gt;Whaley, Birgitta K. &lt;br/&gt;University of
California-Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Exploration and Control of
Condensed Matter Qubits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advent of
new methods for controlling matter at nanometer length scales creates enormous
opportunities for molecular and information processing. Looking beyond the
present problem of how to extend Moore's law within the existing computational
paradigm, we can see that the ability to fabricate and control at increasingly
small dimension brings with it the potential to generate entirely new
technologies for processing of information. This project explores the
development of a new type of highly parallel processor that takes advantage of
quantum degrees of freedom in solid state nanostructures to process information.
The main focus of the project is the basic science required for realization of
truly scalable quantum logic devices. We address this task with experiments that
explore the physics of several potential solid state realizations of quantum bit
states, and also with theoretical investigations of decoherence, of robust
control, and of efficient schemes for quantum logic that are tailored to the
underlying quantum physics of specific implementations. This project is carried
out by an interdisciplinary group of scientists and engineers, drawn from
computer and engineering science, chemical physics, and solid state physics. The
broader impact of the work is to be disseminated together with educators and
journalists in workshops and public lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
