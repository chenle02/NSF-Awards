The Chemical Catalysis Program supports Professor David Forbes at the University
of South Alabama for a research project that will develop a method of creating
sulfur ylides that are useful in forming carbon-carbon bonds and three-membered
rings. This is a commonly used reaction in organic synthesis but is usually
difficult to get good yields consistently. Professor Forbes has proposed a
process that overcomes this limitation, and has found a way to improve reactions
that have been reported in this area, which could lead to the development of new
processes. Increased understanding of these key processes would provide a new
method of high utility that can be used in a wide range of organic syntheses.
The major goal of the proposal is to render this methodology catalytic in the
sulfide promoter, making the methodology more atom efficient and opening avenues
for chiral catalysis. This research is likely to lead to processes that are of
great value to synthetic chemists and will have a significant impact on the
chemistry community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Chemical
Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation,
Dr. Forbes will perform research that addresses a long-standing problem in the
potentially useful area of organocatalytic synthesis: that of catalytic sulfide-
mediated methylene transfer using non-dangerous chemicals. This versatile and
potentially environmentally benign methodology would have industrial
applications of economic and environmental benefit. Broader impacts involve the
training of undergraduate students in chemistry, outreach to local high school
chemistry teachers through the Alabama Science in Motion (ASIM) Program, and
ongoing collaborations, especially with industry.
