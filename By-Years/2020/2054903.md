A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
intellectual leadership of TCUP institutions so that they can address scientific
or engineering needs or interests, specifically for their tribes or communities,
or broadly for the Nation. The TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers)
strand allows TCUP institutions to capitalize on their investments in STEM
instructional and research capacity. This project aligns directly with that
goal, and will have a direct impact on tribal communities on the Navajo Nation.
Diné College’s Water is Life (Tó éí íná át’é) Center aims to enhance water
security and transform research capacity at the institution.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diné College intends to develop core analytical laboratory
facilities for chemical, molecular, and microbiological and establish a research
database and archive of water and biological samples to support its Water is
Life Center. The center’s central theme extends to ecosystem services within
marshlands and riparian corridors impacting the water system and food resources
relying on the water system. Research in various aspects of this network
includes water quality, microbial diversity, pesticide load, and gene expression
in response to environmental stress. The center aims to develop and test home-
sized, off-grid solar water nanofiltration systems to support communities who
are disproportionately affected by poor water quality. By transforming the
nature of research conducted by the institution, the center seeks to advance
knowledge and provide empirical data, data ownership, and deeper engagement
opportunities students and citizens of the Navajo
Nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
