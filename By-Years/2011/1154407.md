In the "Pathway to Success through Physics Scholarship (PS)2" project, the
Department of Physics at Alabama A&amp;M University (AAMU) is augmenting
educational opportunities and increasing the leadership potential for
underrepresented students majoring in physics. A comprehensive package of
student support, education enrichment, research opportunities, career
exploration, and job placement is offered to participating scholars who are
seeking a B.S. degree in Physics. Other activities include a synergistic
provision of quality classroom and supplementary instruction, STEM-related
workshops and seminars, opportunities for personal growth, and a culture of
connection with peers and faculty. A total of eighty scholarships, each at
$7,000/year per student, for a period of four years, are being awarded to twenty
academically talented but financially challenged
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The (PS)2 project builds on an array of
activities at AAMU that support, on a continuing basis, various avenues to
strengthen academic offerings in STEM disciplines, all in the effort to keep
students interested and motivated in the field of physics. These efforts include
multi-layered mentoring, advising, and performance tracking to ensure student
persistence and progression to degree completion. An important component of the
learning experience involves infusion of the excitement of real world scientific
research, aiming to instill the skills and confidence students need to enter the
STEM workforce. The participants are encouraged to gain experience in performing
research and present findings to a variety of audiences, including dissemination
of their results in local, regional, and national scientific conferences focused
on undergraduate research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this project, AAMU is
broadening the participation of members of socioeconomically underrepresented
groups who enter STEM disciplines. Many of these students are first generation
college students coming from financially challenged environments. The project is
creating a pipeline for recruitment of talented, but financially disadvantaged
students, enabling AAMU to further test its collaborative student support model
for success. Data collected by the project contribute to the body of knowledge
that addresses effective approaches to recruiting, retaining, and successfully
graduating African-American and other minorities in physics.
