This grant supports enhancement of a synchrotron beamline for magnetics research
and education. Development of a new generation of spintronic materials is
occurring and there is a need for facilities targeted to characterize the
relationship between magnetic properties and electronic and physical structures.
This grant addresses this need by leveraging a significant investment in the
existing beamline at the LSU CAMD synchrotron light source. The upgrade will
provide for improved characterization of magnetic materials using circularly
polarized light at energies spanning the L-edges of 3d transition metals. The
upgrade consists of two sets of improvements. First, the current plane-grating
monochromator beamline will be enhanced to allow for the use of tunable,
circularly polarized synchrotron light. Stepper-motor controlled, cooled baffles
will be constructed to extract circularly polarized light from the upper and
lower portions of the orbit. The beamline was designed to accommodate two
gratings, and a new, 300 - 1200 eV, grating will be installed to extend the
current photon energy range. Finally, a triple-reflection polarizer will be
installed beyond the last optical element in the beamline to measure the degree
of light polarization. A second component is a general-purpose user-endstation
to provide for sample preparation, evaporators for in-situ film growth, and
coils for magnetizing samples. Spectroscopy will include total yield
measurements as well as photoemission and provide for inclusion of current LEED
and RHEED instrumentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This enhancement will leverage
investments in a group of magnetic materials researchers from Louisiana,
Nebraska, Alabama's NSF-MINT Center, and Illinois and provide for a simple but
reliable method to characterize a broad range of magnetic materials. The access
provided by the location of this light source, located in an underserved region
of the country, serves the needs of researche&lt;br/&gt;
