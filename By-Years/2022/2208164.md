A defining feature of waves is their ability to carry information over large
distances by propagating without changing their shape. It is this ability that
allow waves to probe and image the human body, the interior of the earth and
engineered structures like bridges and tunnels. Such images can then be turned
into scientific and engineering knowledge that can be used to improve medical
diagnostics and prevent failure of buildings and mechanical devices. In this
project the principal investigator will develop computational simulation tools
that increases our ability to exploit the properties of wave propagation for the
common good. The tools developed in the project can also be used to design
advanced materials that can enable better acoustic, elastic and electromagnetic
components as well as faster and more accurate sensing technologies. Students
will be trained as a part of this work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will
further develop and apply advanced computational methods for solving systems of
partial differential equations modeling wave propagation. The approximation
methods will be designed to be robust and flexible while effectively utilizing
emerging computational architectures. The research will dramatically improve the
WaveHoltz method, a recently discovered idea that enables the use of time domain
methods for wave equations to design frequency domain Helmholtz type solvers.
WaveHoltz is remarkable in that its underlying linear operator corresponds to a
symmetric positive definite matrix and allows a coercive problem to be solved
rather than a highly indefinite Helmholtz problem. The research will analyze and
develop wavefront preconditioners and deflation techniques for preconditioning
WaveHoltz; design implicit and explicit error corrected methods for removing the
temporal error in the WaveHoltz method; and consider multi-frequency versions of
the WaveHoltz method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
