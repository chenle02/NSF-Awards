This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of a computer system to be
installed in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of
California, Berkeley. The University of California is committed to providing the
remaining funds needed. The primary use of the computer system will be in
numerical modeling of convection and flow in the Earth's mantle and related
geodynamic processes.
