ABSTRACT DMS - 0203434.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frank Morgan will study minimal
structures in singular universes: with&lt;br/&gt;conical singularities or with
Lipschitz metrics, for example. He will also&lt;br/&gt;study mathematical models
for soap bubbles clusters and immiscible fluids&lt;br/&gt;"with multiplicities,"
following work of Fleming and White. Methods include&lt;br/&gt;standard and
innovative applications of geometric measure theory,&lt;br/&gt;differentiable
geometry, differential equations, and techniques from the&lt;br/&gt;proof of the
Double Bubble Conjecture. He will supervise related&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate
research, especially on variations on the double bubble&lt;br/&gt;problem in
various ambients and settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The guiding principle of
nature seems to be energy minimization, from the&lt;br/&gt;microstructure of
materials to black holes in the universe. As one of the&lt;br/&gt;simplest
examples, soap bubble clusters seek to minimize surface area.
If&lt;br/&gt;successful, Morgan's study of such problems will enhance our
understanding&lt;br/&gt;of fundamental physical principles, with implications
for the structure of&lt;br/&gt;materials and the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
