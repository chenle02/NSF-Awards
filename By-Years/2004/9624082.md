Infrastructure: System Support for a Hierarchy of Distributed Applications This
award provides infrastructure support for the researchers at the University of
Texas at Austin to conduct the basic and experimental research necessary to
address the problems that lie at the core of the emerging applications.
Specifically, the research proposes projects at three levels: (1) core projects
that will create an infrastructure for storing, accessing, and transporting
large, heterogeneous information objects; (2) exploratory projects that will
develop infrastructure which will facilitate the development of the core
projects; and (3) realistic and ambitious applications from each of the
following three classes. The first class is information retrieval applications,
such as digital libraries. These applications will support browsing of large-
scale, distributed databases of multimedia information. The second class of
applications adds the requirement that the multimedia information be processed,
not simply browsed. Finally, the third class of applications adds the
requirement of real-time interactivity.
