Faculty from a consortium of diverse institutions are adapting, refining, and
implementing approaches to teaching calculus that were developed at Duke
University and by the Core Calculus Consortium, headed by Harvard University.
The first year involves training a select group of about twenty faculty in the
new methods. This core of faculty trains faculty from twelve additional
institutions in the second year and all those involved adapt and implement one
of the new approaches at their home institution.
