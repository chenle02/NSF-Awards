Adding Breadth and Laboratories to the Introductory Computer Science
CoursesThis project develops two modifications to the first two years of the
undergraduate computer science curriculum in response to ACM recommendations.
The first modification broadens the focus of these courses from primarily
software development techniques to consideration of the breadth of the computer
science discipline. The second change blends the use of scheduled, structured
laboratories with the traditional lecture approach. Students are provided
activities that require the concrete manipulation of the concepts discussed in
the lecture portion of the course. Project activities include the development
and class-testing of lecture and text materials to support the "breadth"
approach to content presentation. Materials are also being developed to support
the laboratory portion of the courses. These laboratory exercises are
sufficiently independent of the lecture to allow them to be used with curricular
arrangements other than the one being developed in this project. The project
includes an assessment component that attempts to measure the effectiveness of
the materials developed during the project. Finally, the project will
disseminate the results of the curriculum and materials development phases
through summer workshops, publications, and presentations at professional
meetings.
