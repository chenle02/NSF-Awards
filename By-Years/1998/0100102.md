We propose to study low-energy nuclear reactions, most related to
nuclear&lt;br/&gt;astrophysics, using short-lived secondary beams of 6-He, 8-Li,
7-Be, 8-B,&lt;br/&gt;and other nuclei. These will be used to study nuclear
reactions related to&lt;br/&gt;the apparent deficit of solar neutrinos, and the
"missing mass" problem in&lt;br/&gt;the Universe. The experiments will utilize a
unique UM-developed apparatus&lt;br/&gt;consisting of two large superconducting
magnets and will continue further&lt;br/&gt;technical developments of the
device, which also has applications in other&lt;br/&gt;fields such as nuclear
medicine. Additional related experimental work, as&lt;br/&gt;funding permits,
will be done at the National Superconducting Cyclotron&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory (E.
Lansing, MI), and the Texas AM Cyclotron Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
