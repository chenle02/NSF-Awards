This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will integrate
random, reactive ion etching (RIE) texturing techniques into low-cost, multi-
crystalline (mc) silicon (Si) solar cells. RIE texturing techniques, developed
in Phase I, are distinguished by their low-reflection (1 percent), large area
(200 square centimeters) application, and the ability to control etched
profiles. This texture control has been employed to increase near infrared
absorption in Si by enhanced oblique optical coupling into the substrate. RIE-
texturing techniques have potential application in several fields including low-
cost substrates for surface enhanced Raman scattering and field emission
devices. Phase II will be concerned with conformal emitter formation techniques
uniquely suited to RIE-textured surfaces. These methods will lead to solar cell
manufacturing in a cluster environment with similar chambers for texturing,
emitter formation, and nitride films for surface passivation.

Potential industrial applications are expected in high-efficiency, RIE-textured,
mc-Si solar cells using processes suitable for their respective manufacturing
environments.
