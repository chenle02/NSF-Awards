This award supports a conference entitled From Topology to Computation: Unity
and Diversity in the Mathematical Sciences. The conference will be held from
August 5 to August 9, 1990 on the campus of the University of California at
Berkeley. The conference will be concerned with the following fields:
differential topology, dynamical systems, nonlinear functional analysis,
physical and biological applications, economics, and theory of computation. The
conference has two purposes: (1) to present recent developments in these fields,
and (2) explore the connections between them.
