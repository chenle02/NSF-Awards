Theories of relativistic dissipative fluids will be applied to study situations
of astrophysical and experimental interest. Constraints relating the properties
of fluid stability, causality, and hyperbolicity in these theories can be used
to strengthen existing upper limits on the mass of neutron stars. The behavior
of the theories when applied to a Fermi gas far from equilibrium will be
studied; whether nonlinear effects destroy hyperbolicity in this case will be
determined. These results will then be used to apply the fluid models to the
study of relativistic fluid collisions, ranging from heavy ions to neutron
stars. Present theories of relativistic dissipative superfluids have been shown
to be physically unacceptable, as all equilibrium states within those theories
are unstable. A newly proposed theory which seems (on the surface) to avoid this
problem will be analyzed in detail, and its fundamental properties regarding
stability, causality, and hyperbolicity analyzed. Extreme black holes,
possessing degenerate event horizons and zero surface gravity, are currently
playing a central role in work on black hole thermodynamics and the "information
loss" puzzle of black hole evaporation. Using the methods developed by Anderson,
Hiscock, and Samuel, the quantum effects of vacuum polarization on an extreme
black hole's geometry and thermodynamics will be studied.
