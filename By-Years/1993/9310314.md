9310314 Vashishta We propose to study the structural and dynamical properties of
graphitic tubules by means of computer simulation. The systems to be studied
will include graphitic tubules with different chiral symmetry; coaxial
microtubes with the same or different helical combinations; carbon cages; onion-
like carbon clusters; doughnut-like graphitic tubule ring; and graphitic tubule
arrays. Tight-binding molecular dynamics, used to investigate the structural
stability, mechanical properties at finite temperature, structural
transformations under external stresses-- compressing, stretching and twisting;
the process of crack propagation and fragmentation. In addition, new simulation
techniques and efficient algorithms will be developed and implemented on
parallel architectures.
