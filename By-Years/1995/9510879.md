Karen Lewis University of Pennsylvania SBR-9510879 This proposal will explore an
important puzzle in international finance, namely why domestic residents do not
diversify sufficiently into foreign assets to optimally risk-share. The proposal
consists of three projects. The first project examines consumption comovements
and will test for whether they can be accounted for by non-separabilities in the
utility function. The second project will test whether there are market
restrictions on international risk-sharing by re-examining the consumption
comovements allowing for market restrictions (e.g., foreign exchange
restrictions, defaults or interest arrears on international loans). The third
project will attempt to measure the welfare loss from incomplete international
risk-sharing using data on consumption, equity returns, and capital market
restrictions. The project will result in two new data sets: panel data on
consumption disaggregated by durable/non-durable and tradable/non-tradable and
panel data on various measures of capital market restrictions.
