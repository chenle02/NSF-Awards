Optimization arises naturally in a variety of areas, such as managing wireless
spectrum utilization, efficiently distributing power in the electrical grid, or
solving machine learning problems. The scale of such applications has been
steadily growing, often forcing data to be processed in different physical
locations linked via a communication network. The ensuing computational task is
mediated by distributed optimization algorithms that carefully orchestrate a
combination of local computations and global synchronization with the other
computing nodes. These distributed algorithms are critical in ensuring the
safety, reliability, efficiency, and performance of large-scale systems. This
project aims to develop a systematic approach for analyzing and designing such
distributed algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will view distributed
optimization algorithms as dynamical systems with feedback; decisions made at a
given time affect the state of the system at future times, and therefore affect
future decisions, and so on. The advantage of this viewpoint is that it allows
one to leverage tools and methodology from control theory, which is a well
established engineering discipline used in the design of modern safety-critical
systems such as aircraft, automobiles, and industrial plants. Applying these
sophisticated tools to distributed optimization algorithms will allow us to move
away from conventional incremental design methods and has the potential to be
highly transformative. It will lead to better distributed algorithms, but also
more principled and automated design methods that can allow algorithms to be
directly synthesized and specialized for the task at
hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
