This study plans to investigate energetic costs in the steady free flight of
Drosophila, and how the mechanical stability of 3D flapping flight affects
maneuvering. The PIs will further investigate the trade-off between energetic
demands and maneuverability during insect free flight. A major experimental
advance planned is the application of state of the art data collection and
imaging techniques to track untethered insect flight in 3D and obtain the wing
and body kinematics necessary for aerodynamic analysis. Analysis of many
acquired data sets will allow determination of statistical averages and
deviations in wing stroke parameters corresponding to a given maneuver, vital
for prediction comparisons. Determining the stability criteria for 3D free
flight involves algorithm development and optimization with dynamic models of 3D
flapping flight. The PIs will analyze correlations between optimal solutions
across different species of Drosophilacharacterized by different wing and body
morphologies. Understanding the solutions and maneuvering tricks used by insects
will offer new insights into mechanical designs for flapping flight. This novel
combination of experimental and theoretical techniques will carry out three
focus studies: 1) a comparative study of hovering flight energetics in 12
species of Drosophila, 2) comparative study between wild-type and mutant
insects, and 3) comparative study of control strategies in steady and
maneuvering flight. The PIs plan to make the tracking algorithms and make them
available online through their groups web sites. The PIs will provide a tutorial
to guide the user through the kinematic data extraction process. Wang will
continue to organize mini-symposia on fluid dynamics of locomotion, deliver
public lectures on insect flight, and develop university courses for teaching
mathematical modeling and biofluid dynamics. Cohen will continue to organize the
semiannual New York Complex Matter Workshops and lead a collaboration between
Cornell and the Harlem Children's Zone with the aim of improving science
education at K-12 schools that cater to minority and economically disadvantaged
communities in New York city. The PIs have also been asked to conduct a public
outreach presentation through the Ithaca Light in Winter festival with the aim
of educating the public about the results associated with this work.
