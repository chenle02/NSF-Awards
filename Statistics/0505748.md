ABSTRACT:

PI: Barry, Ronald Award ID: DMS - 0505748 Institution: University of Alaska,
Fairbanks Program: STATISTICS Title: Computational Tools and Theory of
Multivariate Spatial Models

A research group is developing software and theory for hierarchical and
multivariable spatial models. As such models involve unobserved, spatially-
correlated variables, modeling these processes will require the development of
flexible variogram models that will conform to a wide variety of random
processes. These are approached through process-convolution models. The
investigators are considering a variety of special cases, including cokriging,
generalized (hierarchical) spatial models, spatial compositional data and
Poisson process models. They are exploring several computational approaches,
including generalized estimating equations, MCMC and expectation-maximization.
They are also identifying spectral, sparse matrix and other approaches to reduce
the computational burden of the analysis. The software they are developing will
allow researchers in many fields to analyze multivariable spatial models.

Many research projects produce data that is associated with locations on a map.
For instance, an epidemiological study might consist of air pollution
measurements taken at several fixed locations, along with the locations of
households where an occupant was hospitalized with a pollution-related ailment.
In this case the air pollution measurement is a geostatistical variable (it
could, in theory, be measured at any location on the map) and the households are
a point process. Other examples might include multiple geostatistical variables:
for instance, soil nitrogen and soil moisture measured at multiple locations in
an ecological study. Multiple geostatistical variables and point process
variables are special cases of what are called multivariate or hierarchical
spatial models. The investigators are developing the general theory of these
models, and are producing software that can efficiently analyze these models.
Dissemination of the software will allow the development of more sophisticated
models for mapped data in many applied fields.
