This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore the
processing of boron nitride (BN) composites for a wide variety of wear
applications with a focus on aircraft brakes. Significant research has been
performed worldwide to develop greatly improved braking materials at
significantly lower cost. Of the approaches under consideration, a composite
using BN as a matrix appears best in terms of desired cost-performance
characteristics. Phase I will produce stable boron nitride composites from a
unique pre-ceramic polymer (borazine) that allows for simple impregnation. The
oxidative and hydrolytic stability of these composites is greatly improved over
current carbon fiber/carbon (C/C). Based on preliminary testing, a carbon
fiber/carbon-BN matrix displayed a five-fold decrease in wear as compared to
C/C. C/C matrix composites have been used extensively for both military and
commercial aircraft brakes since they were first developed in the mid-1960s and
later optimized in the early 1970s. Problems with such systems include rapid
wear at elevated temperatures leading to frequent replacement. In fact,
commercial airlines consider the maintenance of brakes to be the second most
serious cost problem.
