CAREER: Object Recognition with Hierarchical Models

Object recognition is one of the most important problems in computer vision.
While researchers have worked on this problem for over thirty years, vision
systems are still unable to recognize many common objects in cluttered images.
The PI proposes to address this problem by developing new hierarchical models
and efficient search algorithms for recognition.

Hierarchical models represent objects using parts which are themselves defined
in terms of subparts. Moreover, the subparts may be recursively defined in terms
of smaller components. This hierarchical organization can efficiently encode
important relationships among the components that make up an object. Another
important property of hierarchical models is that components can be shared among
different object models. This is useful for being able to quickly recognize
which of many possible objects are present in an image. It is also important for
learning models from small datasets. Finally, in the most general types of
models the structure of an object may be specified by a grammar instead of being
fixed in advance. The number of parts that make up an object may be variable and
there may be choice among different parts that can go in a particular place. All
of these aspects make hierarchical models incredibly expressive.

Algorithms for object recognition typically search over large spaces encoding
the pose of an object, or over correspondences between model features and
features extracted from an image. The PI will develop efficient optimization
algorithms for solving these problems. This will be accomplished by exploiting
the structure of the search spaces defined by general classes of hierarchical
models.

Broader significance and importance: Object recognition has many important
practical applications, including in robotics, human-computer interaction, image
retrieval, security systems and medical image analysis. Research in object
recognition can also play an important role in our understanding of human
perception and intelligence. The proposed research will draw upon ideas from
diverse areas such as computer vision, theoretical computer science, natural
language understanding and mathematics.
