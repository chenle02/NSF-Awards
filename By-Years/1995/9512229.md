9512229 Peyghambarian This proposal request an electron-beam (e-beam)
lithography system for micro and nanolithography. The system consists of a
modified scanning-electron microscope (SEM) (with the necessary software and
hardware) and will be installed in a clean-room area within the Optical Sciences
Center. The system is required for the fabrication of optoelectronic components,
such as nonlinear gratings, circular grating lasers, photorefractive polymer
waveguides, organic LEDs and laser diode devices, and quantum wire and dot
semiconductor lasers. ***
