This project is concerned with a numerical and analytical investigation of the
dynamics of biological interfaces. Our interest will be directed to lipid
bilayers, which are the basic component of cell membranes. Our aim is to develop
solution methods and to investigate the behavior of the mathematical models
governing the dynamics of these biological interfaces. Mathematically we will be
dealing with a complex free boundary problem. Continuum theory will be used to
model the motion of these interfaces. The dynamics of the liquids surrounding
the interface will be governed by a set of partial differential equations. These
equations will be coupled to a system of partial differential equations along
the interface. A boundary integral numerical method will be used to solve these
complicated three-dimensional free-boundary problems. Recent experimental work
will be used as a guide in selecting our mathematical models. A computational
investigation beyond the parameter ranges of current experimental results will
be done in order to fully understand our models. Several limiting cases will be
investigated analytically using perturbation methods.

The dynamics of biological interfaces is an important and relatively unexplored
field. It is central to cellular activities and especially in vesicle transport
and delivery processes. A number of diseases are related to a malfunction of
vesicle transport in cells; hence the results of this research could lead to new
treatments and drugs. This project will use methods from applied mathematics and
ideas from continuum theory and applied them in a biological setting. The
project is interdisciplinary and hence will enhance the education and
development of the students associated with the project.
