This dissertation research will engage in a comparative study of foodservice
labor in three states. Qualitative data will be collected through in-depth,
semi-structured interviews and participant observation in (1) Louisiana, which
has a strong statewide tradition of scratch cooking in its schools, (2) Rhode
Island, which has almost entirely outsourced its school food programs to
food&lt;br/&gt;service management companies, and (3) Minnesota, which has
recently completed a two-year state-wide program to reskill and retool school
foodservice employees to be able to source, cook, and promote ?real? foods.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study has the potential to inform current school food
reforms in light of the regulatory changes ushered in by the Healthy Hunger Free
Kids Act of 2010. The results of this study will be of value to school food
professionals, state and regional planners, policy analysts, non-profits, labor
unions, and businesses as they sort through priorities and strategies for
improving both school food and local economies. The study will highlight
instances where school food provides both high quality jobs for local residents
and high quality food for children, while still operating under the existing
financial and legal constraints of the NSLP.
