The aim of the proposed work is to extend the use of linear and other network
analysis tools. The addition of logical information in model constraints to
emulate regulatory logic will be pursued. Mixed integer linear programming will
be among the tools employed. Two general approaches will be used. The first
entails encoding a check to see if a flux solution is consistent with the
kinetic and regulatory structure of the network. The second involves
superimposing transcript ratio data from DNA arrays within probabilistic
framework that account for the lack of linearity between transcript level and
gene product activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
