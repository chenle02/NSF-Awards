The academic development of tomorrow's mathematicians require a vision of the
future and a program to achieve that vision. Spelman College has that vision.
The project "Scholars in Mathematics at Spelman (SIMS) will provide a
comprehensive research and academic enrichment program for talented minority
women students. The overall objective of the program is to develop an academic
environment that assures the preparedness of minority women as they pursue
degrees in mathematics at the best graduate schools throughout the country. The
students selected to participate in the program will be mathematics majors that
have demonstrated potential for earning a graduate degree in pure or applied
mathematics. Each student's academic program at Spelman will include enrichment
activities such as participation in a research issues course, supervised
mathematics research, seminar participation, and conference attendance. During
the first year, four students will be selected for the program: two sophomores
and two juniors. Subsequently, two rising sophomores will be selected
immediately following the spring semester each year of the grant. Each student
will engage in at least two years of research experience with faculty advisors
culminating in a written thesis. Two summer research experiences will include at
least one internship at an off-campus research facility or university.
