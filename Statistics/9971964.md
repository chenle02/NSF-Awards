DMS 9971964 Estimation from Dynamical Systems and Individual Sequences Andrew B.
Nobel, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill

ABSTRACT: The advent of modern computing and the recent interest in chaos have
focussed increasing attention on deterministic systems that exhibit random
behavior. Statistical analysis of such systems is often complicated by the fact
that measurements of their behavior can exhibit very long-range dependence. The
Principal Investigator is studying non-parametric estimation from ergodic
processes and individual sequences, with particular emphasis on processes and
sequences that arise from measurement of a dynamical system. He is developing
and proving the consistency of schemes for the following problems: (i)
estimating the map generating a given discrete time dynamical system; (ii)
estimating the stationary density and Lyapunov exponents of a dynamical system;
and (iii) density and regression estimation from individual sequences.

In addition, the P.I. is seeking to characterize deterministic sequences and to
estimate their induced transformations.

The advent of modern computing and recent scientific interest in chaos have
focussed increasing attention on physical systems that are governed by
deterministic laws, but exhibit erratic or unpredictable behavior that is
characteristic of random phenomena. Dynamical systems of this sort have found
application in such diverse areas as medical diagnostics and weather prediction.
The Principal Investigator (P.I.) is developing statistical methods that can be
used estimate the underlying properties of a dynamical system from observations
of the system as it evolves in time. This is important if one wishes to predict
or control the future behavior of the system. The P.I. is developing methods to
estimate the rule that dictates the evolution of the system over a single unit
of time. He is also developing methods to assess the sensitivity of the system
to its initial conditions: if the system is started off in two very similar
states, how different will it look later? The P.I. is seeking methods that will
be effective for a wide variety of systems, including those whose measurements
exhibit dependence over very long time scales.
