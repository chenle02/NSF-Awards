9708618 Hager This award will provide partial funding (67%) for the upgrade and
installation of GPS receivers in the Tien Shan Mountain region in support of
research to measure and explain the growth of these tectonically active
mountains in terms of deep Earth processes. The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology is committed to providing the remaining funds. The Principal
Investigator and co-Principal Investigators from the MIT Department of Earth,
Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences are collaborating on this project with a
multidisciplinary team of scientists from Kyrgyztan, Kazakstan, and Russia. The
project is supported internationally, and the U.S. is shared between NSF and
NASA. ***
