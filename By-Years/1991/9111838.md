The School of Electrical Engineering at Cornell University will purchase a
Nd:YAG laser under this NSF Engineering Research Equipment Grant which will be
dedicated to support engineering research. The Nd:YAG laser will be installed in
a central electro-optics laboratory, and will be used for the following research
projects: ultrafast pulse generation for electro-optical device
characterization; pumping a tunable color center laser beat frequency generator
for frequency characterization of electro-optic devices; exploring new color
center defects for possible lasing based on F+2 - like defects in KF and NaF;
and exploring lasing in transition-metal-ion bearing crystals such as Cr3+ and
Ti3+ doped Forsterite, sapphire, and other likely hosts. Using diffusion, thin-
film growth, and ion-implantation, we will explore the feasibility of quickly
making and evaluating new optical materials for lasing. The fundamental output
line at 1.6 um of the requested Nd:YAG laser will provide the pump source for
most of these systems. The second harmonic at 0.532 um will be used to explore
the spectroscopy of energy transfer in solids.
