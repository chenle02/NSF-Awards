9610331 Gray The Boston Research Data Center is now in its third year of
operation with 15 research projects underway or due to start soon. Located at
the Census Bureau's Boston regional office, the BRDC provides researchers in the
Boston area with access to a variety of confidential Census datasets in a secure
setting. The data would otherwise be available only at Census Bureau offices in
Maryland, which would severely limit the ability of Boston researchers to
participate. Most of the projects at the BRDC use plant-level Census data on
manufacturing industries, linked in some cases to other Census datasets. Several
of the projects address environmental issues, using data from EPA and a Census
survey on pollution abatement costs. These researchers have formed an
"environmental group", with regular meetings to pool information and discuss
reassert strategies. future research projects are likely in these areas, but one
of the strengths of the BRDC is that it can provide access to a wide range of
Census data. BRDC projects have already examined agricultural sharecropping, the
earned income tax credit, and human resource policies. The additional two years
of support will provide the time necessary to implement a plan for permanent
funding of the BRDC, combining institutional support from the Boston Federal
Reserve with laboratory fees from supported research projects. ??
