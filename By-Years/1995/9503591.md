This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is a
continuation of efforts in laboratory automation and robotics. Professor Frank
A. Settle and his students at the Virginia Military Institute have designed a
fully automated system for the colorimetric analysis of ortho-phosphate. They
will expand this system to incorporate the analysis of transition metal analytes
using automated flow injection analysis (FIA). Selected metal analytes will be
treated with a chelating reagent to form a highly colored water insoluble
dithiozone derivative whose absorbance is proportional to the metal analyte
concentration. Prof. Settle will use surfactant chemistry to solubilize the
reaction products and eliminate the need for solvent extraction. A full
laboratory information management system (LIMS) will be developed for this
assay, which incorporate the use of a Zymark BenchMate robot for sample handling
and reagent preparation. Professors Settle and Sienerth will supervise a 10 week
summer research experience for undergraduate students, in addition to
supervising selected research students during the academic year. These students
will be trained in quality control and method validation procedures, computer
interfacing and programming, software development, and analytical
instrumentation and chemical methods. An active laboratory information
management system (LIMS) has been developed for control of two independent
automated procedures for the colorimetric analysis of metal analytes. This
system incorporates facilities for control of a Zymark robot for reagent and
sample preparation, validation and calibration of the equipment and methods
using `Good Automated Laboratory Practice` guidelines, and data storage,
manipulation, and final report presentation. The research program described will
provide a rich training ground for undergraduate students and provide them with
the laboratory and computer skills demanded in `real world` industrial
applications.
