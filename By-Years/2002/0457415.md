"Funding request to help fund the PiTP Summer School ?Introduction to LHC
Physics? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prospects in Theoretical Physics (PiTP) is an
intensive two-week summer program designed for graduate students considering a
career in theoretical physics. First held by the School of Natural Sciences at
the Institute for Advanced Study in the summer of 2002, the PiTP program is
designed to provide lecture courses and informal sessions on the latest advances
and open questions in various areas of theoretical physics. One of the goals of
the program is to help the physics community train the next generation of
scholars in theoretical physics. A special effort is made to reach out to women
and minorities, as well as to graduate students in small universities who
typically do not have the same opportunities and access to leaders in the field
as graduate students in large research institutions. PiTP 2005 will be an
introduction to LHC physics, intended for graduate students. The course is
specifically designed to introduce Collider phenomenology to theorists -
including string theorists - who are not specialists in this subject. The goal
is to help young physicists prepare for the physics that will emerge from the
LHC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
