The Underwater Vehicles Laboratory of the M.I.T. Sea Grant College Program will
purchase equipment to enhance the communication, navigation, sensor and control
capabilities of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The equipment will be
used for research and development of AUVs as oceanographic research platforms.
Six missions have been chosen to direct this effort. They include the
investigation of plate tectonics and spreading centers through the study of the
Earth's magnetic field in the Atlantic Ridge and the Antarctic, the search for
cold-seeps in Monterey Bay, the study of the algae pilayella littoralis, the
development of geophysical navigation methods, and the mechanics of Arctic ice.
Work on a test-bed AUV at the MIT Underwater Vehicles Laboratory has
demonstrated the feasibility of such a vehicle. The availability of this
equipment will facilitate the laboratory's long range plan to provide these AUVs
for use as research tools.
