Nature provides remarkable examples of the use of patterning on micro and
nanometer length scales to tailor adhesive behavior for specific environments.
An exciting example that has just recently been understood after a century of
inquiry is the gecko. Its feet are covered with a hierarchical hair-like
structure that spans micro and nanometer scales. At the end, millions of
spatulae, each on the order of 200-500 nm adhere to smooth and rough surfaces
through van der Waals forces which operate only over a range of a few nm.
Interestingly, while the van der Waals forces provide the molecular bonding
forces, the geometry and topology of the hair-like structure plays a key role in
determining the mechanics and physics of adhesion and decohesion. Motivated by
these biological observations, we will explore the development and demonstration
of high-performance design tools and nanofabrication techniques for the
realization of nanostructures with engineered adhesive properties: the adhesion
characteristics can be tailored to the individual application. This approach is
to couple high-fidelity simulation tools capable of accurately modeling nano-
and microscale surface force interactions, with shape and topology optimization
tools allowing the tailoring of the adhesive properties. State-of-the-art
nanofabrication technologies will then be used to realize the adhesive
nanostructures, and an experimental nanomechanics program will be undertaken to
validate the approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of our
research is extensive. Not only does it bring together multiple cutting edge
technologies that have yet to be thought of in concert, it makes advances in
each individual technology: adhesion, micro/nanostructures, design, high-
performance computing, and nanofabrication. The research also promises broader
impact across an impressive spectrum of technologies in science, engineering,
biology, and medicine beyond the specific tasks proposed. These include, but are
not limited to: strategies to facilitate reliable nanomanufacturing processes
such as soft lithography; the realization of novel dry adhesives for use at
micro through macro scales; design technology to facilitate the nanofabrication
of bonding sites for biological implants; surface engineering of MEMS
components; and technology that can be used to design adhesive substrates for
cell capture, adhesion, and growth. The graduate student (and undergraduate
student that we will seek) will be exposed to a variety of techniques on the
forefront of computational and experimental work as applied to nanotechnology.
Specific attempts to recruit from underrepresented groups and women, in seeking
qualified students.&lt;br/&gt;
