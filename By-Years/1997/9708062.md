9708062 Jelinski This Focused Research Group (FRG) award, supported by MPS/DMR,
MPS/OMA, and BIO/MCB, seeks to understand the structure-function relationships
in a model biomolecular material - spider silk. The project draws on the
synergistic skills of the four Principal Investigators (PIs) Lynn Jelinski
(Cornell; NMR and biomaterials), David Kaplan (Tufts; biotechnology and
proteins), David Grubb (Cornell; x- ray diffraction and mechanical properties of
fibers) and Ron Eby (Akron; x-ray diffraction and polymer science). The goal is
to understand and mimic the design and crystal- growth processes found in a
naturally occurring system in order to obtain an improved structural material.
To this end, the project team will share samples, including various silks
collected in the wild, fibers produced from genetically engineered silk-like
proteins, and fibers produced from proteins containing a reversible redox switch
to control solubility. The primary characterization techniques will include
mechanical measurements, synchrotron x-ray diffraction, and solid state NMR
spectroscopy. The FRG will provide a focus for interdisciplinary education and
will serve to integrate education and research. The objectives are 1 to
correlate the structure and materials properties of different natural silks with
their protein content and sequence; 2 to correlate the structure and materials
properties of regenerated fibers and fibers drawn from silk-like proteins made
by recombinant DNA technology; 3 to design into silks a reversible redox switch
to control solution properties, and then to test films and fibers made of this
material. %%% This research will lead to a better understanding of the
relationships between structure and function in protein polymers and lead to
protein polymers with improved mechanical properties. The research will also
serve as a springboard from which undergraduate and graduate students will be
exposed to a wide range of interdisciplinary s cience. ***
