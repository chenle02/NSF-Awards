The proposed one year project will explore high performance architectures
applicable to realizing optical WAN switches. Some of the major drawbacks of
currently proposed high speed "optical" switches are the need for rapidly
tunable transmitters or receivers requiring fast control for contention
resolution and for transmitter-receiver coordination. Alternatively, current
architectures based on the use of fixed transmitters and receivers, as in a
Shuffle, result in good performance only for homogeneous traffic patterns and do
not smoothly adapt to component failures. The principle of the proposed solution
is the use of wavelength or frequency routing, in a way which trades the high
bandwidth of these technologies for simplifying the processing and hardware
switch requirements. the proposed solution integrates time oriented control with
wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) targeted to overcome the above
limitations. The objective of the one year effort will be to explore the major
issues that restrict WDM/TDM (time division multiplexing) operations and propose
a preliminary switch architecture. The operation of the proposed system will be
evaluated through simulation to provide a quantitative measure for evaluating
the future potential of the proposed approach.
