9727328 Charlie This action is to support the participation of Prof. Wayne
Charlie, Colorado State University, in CANLEX -- the Canadian Liquefaction
Experiment. Many large structures, such as hydroelectric dams and tailings dams,
are either built on sand deposits, or are partially constructed with sand. If
the sand is loose and is loaded rapidly, then the structure of the sand can
collapse, the soil can liquefy and a large amount of strength can be lost. A
major research effort is underway to study the behavior of loose cohesionless
soils. Much of this research is part of a large collaborative research project
called the Canadian Liquefaction Experiment (CANLEX). This project is controlled
and managed at the University of Alberta in collaboration with the Universities
of Laval, Carleton and British Columbia and with industrial support from
Syncrude, Suncor, B.C. Hydro, Quebec Hydro, Kennecott and Highland Valley
Copper. Current research includes the study of the mechanical and geophysical
properties of loose sands and the development of appropriate constitutive
models. Research also includes the study of mine waste materials found in large
waste dumps. Prof. Charlie is assisting in the current phase of this project,
namely to subject the Syncrude site in Alberta to blast loading in an attempt to
simulate earthquake cycling loading. The objective is to generate pore pressures
in the deposit of saturated loose sand sufficient to cause the site to liquefy.
This is an area in which Prof. Charlie has had considerable experience.
