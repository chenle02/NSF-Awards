Social concerns with the consequences of climatic change require evidence of
its effects on ecological systems on land and at sea. In both habitats humans
intervene, e.g., deforestation, pollution of lakes, and marine harvesting. In
addition, "natural" fluctuations driven by internal ecological processes also
occur. Therefore, there is a definite need to monitor the long-term variability
of populations, communities and ecosystem, and especially to understand the
underlying processes so as to separate the different causal factors. Marine,
freshwater and terrestrial ecologists are actively engaged in analysis and
planning of long-term data sets. However, ecological interpretations of these
data sets differ in detail, even though researchers have common questions about
ecological concepts. Dr. Steele will hold a month-long summer school in 1992 at
Cornell University that will bring together practitioners for the different
disciplines to exchange information about data sets, methods of analysis and
theoretical explanations. The steering committee will invite 15-20 students at
the graduate or post-doctoral levels, and approximately 10 lecturers. This
workshop follows a successful 1991 summer school at Cornell University.
