The principal investigator intends to explore common trends in representation
theory of reductive algebraic groups over local non-Archimedian fields and
representation theory of affine Kac-Moody algebras. In particular, he is
interested in finding a unified description of the Whittaker functionals in
these two representation theories using geometry. Understanding the underlying
geometry of the Whittaker functions should provide new insights into the
Langlands correspondence over the field of rational functions on an algebraic
curve, either over a finite field or over the field of complex numbers. A
closely related project is to prove the geometric Langlands conjecture using the
theory of ``Whittaker sheaves'' on the Drinfeld moduli spaces. On the other
hand, the investigator intends to continue his study of deformed W-algebras and
their connections with representation theory of quantum affine algebras. It is
expected that this study will lead to better understanding of the nature of the
Langlands duality.

In summary, the main idea of the proposed research is that seemingly disparate
areas of mathematics, such as representations theory and geometry contain
various hidden common trends. Recently, several deep phenomena have been
observed, such as the Langlands duality. The investigator believes that these
phenomena are so fundamental that they should manifest themselves in one way or
another in many different areas of mathematics. The goal is to uncover them
where they are still unknown, and this way understand the precise nature of the
phenomenon. This may also reveal new and unexpected connections between
different fields, through which new insights may be gained into fundamental
problems of mathematics.
