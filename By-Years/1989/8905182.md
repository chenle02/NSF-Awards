This grant supports research and operation of the Princeton cyclotron
laboratory. The group will carry out measurements at the frontiers of nuclear
physics, nuclear astrophysics, and fundamental symmetries and interactions. The
experiments will extend the search for time reversal invariance in nuclear
systems, for meson exchange currents in beta decay, and for axion-like particles
in electron-positron interactions. Other experiments will use specially
developed equipment to study the properties of nuclei far from stability. A
series of measurements using the Princeton QDDD magnetic spectrometer will
provide new data concerning astrophysical processes that occurred in the early
moments of the universe. A related program of accelerator improvement and of
advanced instrumentation development will continue. The accelerator improvements
are aimed at increasing both performance and reliability. The instrumentation
research and development will include work on bolometer radiation detectors. The
cyclotron laboratory is used for research and for graduate student training by a
large number of user groups from other universities, in addition to those from
Princeton.
