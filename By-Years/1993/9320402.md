Abstract - Daoutides - 9320402 Chemical engineering processes are inherently
nonlinear and multivariable, and are typically modeled by coupled differential
and algebraic equations (DAEs). The differential equations arise from dynamic
conservation equations, while the algebraic equations arise from thermodynamic
equilibrium relations, empirical constitutive equations, closure conditions,
quasi-steady-state assumptions, etc. For many chemical processes, the algebraic
equations are implicit and singular in nature and do not allow the direct
reduction of the process model to one consisting of pure differential equations.
The objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive framework for the
analysis and control of nonlinear multivariable DAE systems. A state-space
methodology framework will be adopted for this purpose and nonlinear analysis
and synthesis tools will be used. Fundamental insight on the nature of the
control problem will be obtained and general control methods will be developed.
Software tools will also be developed and used for the application of the
methods to representative chemical reaction and separation processes.
