Widom DMS-9424292 Widom has shown that there are differential equations
associated with important random matrix models, and has used this fact to obtain
explicit expressions for various quantities arising in the theory. He will
continue this investigation to determine the extent to which the results apply
to classes of models satisfying some common conditions. One class of
deterministic problems deals with the asymptotics of the eigenvalues of finite
Toeplitz matrices and their analogues. Each of these has an associated "symbol,"
and one expects to relate the distribution of eigenvalues to the values of the
symbol. This proposal concerns the applications of operator theory to random
matrix models. In random matrix theory fundamental quantities that arise
naturally are often related to determinants of certain operators. The asymptotic
behavior of these determinants is of independent interest in operator theory.
