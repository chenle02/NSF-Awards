This grant supports the development of new theory and models for tactical
logistics planning problems under uncertain demand. The core decision problem
focus of this research lies in optimally matching downstream requirements with
upstream resource capabilities in production and logistics systems. The modeling
approach implicitly accounts for an important structural feature of practical
logistics systems, which requires identifying a unique upstream source facility
(e.g., plant, warehouse) for serving each downstream stage (e.g., warehouse,
retailer). This pervasive structure found in production and logistics systems
both reduces downstream ordering and delivery receiving complexity, and
decreases the need for upstream cross-facility coordination. As a result of
these medium-term decisions, short-term operations planning and execution
problems decompose into separate subproblems (one for each upstream facility),
which reduces system-wide operations planning complexity. This research takes an
integrated view of optimizing logistics network performance, where
transportation decisions are considered jointly with other logistics network
decisions that drive overall performance, such as production and inventory
storage decisions, while explicitly accounting for demand uncertainty.

This project will provide an integrated approach for solving tactical logistics
planning problems effectively, thus providing opportunities for streamlining
distribution system costs. In particular, new and effective algorithms will be
developed that can solve medium- to large-size problems to near-optimality with
limited computational effort, and also enjoy a formal performance guarantee. The
associated algorithms will be developed in a general model setting, allowing for
specialization to a broad range of specific problem contexts. In addition,
through collaboration with an optimization software development firm, it will
provide a solution methodology that will allow for the reuse of much of the
software developed for one problem in the solution of other problems, thereby
speeding up software development time.
