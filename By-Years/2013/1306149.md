The objective of this program is to investigate the properties of high power
terahertz emitting devices based on impurity center transitions in the wide
bandgap semiconductor, gallium nitride. Using doped wafers from colleagues at
universities and industry, terahertz emitters will be fabricated, and a series
of electrical and optical experiments will determine their characteristics and
limitations, and provide the data to optimize their
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is that terahertz
emission is an important capability, and gallium nitride is an important
semiconductor that may enable higher performance than previous emitters based on
other materials and other mechanisms. The reason is that gallium nitride, as a
wide bandgap semiconductor, can accommodate high power dissipation, and the
dopants and impurities have deep energy levels that are perfectly suitable for
terahertz-producing transitions. The proposed emission mechanism was effective
for other semiconductors, but is not well understood in gallium nitride, so this
is an exploratory project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are that
the availability of compact, high performance, low cost terahertz emitters will
be transformative for global applications from medical diagnostics to pollution
detection. This research project will add to fundamental knowledge on devices
and materials, and will feature the interaction of students with university and
industrial researchers. Lectures on semiconductor optoelectronics will be
presented at local schools.
