This project will recruit 264 secondary school master science teachers from the
Los Angeles area to participate in a three week summer institute. (This
institute may be offered at different times during the year to allow teachers on
a year round schedule to participate.) The institute will be held in Los Angeles
and will start September 1, 1992 and end August 31, 1995. The goal of this
program is to develop a relationship between UCLA, community colleges, and
middle and high school faculty that will lead to the creation of two cross-
curricular, multi-level modules that focus on environmental science. The modules
will span middle school through freshman college in content and will be
disseminated throughout the Los Angeles basin. The project complements
California's Statewide Systemic Initiative and Scope, Sequence &amp;Coordination
projects. Approximate cost-share for the project is 13%.
