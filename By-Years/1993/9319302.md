During development of the brain, nerve cells become organized into functional
units for appropriately connected circuits. Patterns of layers or clustering in
the adult brain develop by mechanisms still unclear. There is evidence from many
studies that cell-cell interactions and extracellular factors such as cell
adhesion molecules play a significant role in organizing such regions before the
neuronal connections themselves are established. This project exploits the
development of forebrain organization, where novel molecular antibodies have
been found to demonstrate formation of a boundary of the region where olfactory
inputs terminate. Experimental manipulations utilize the well-established
developmental model system of the frog Xenopus. Cell grafting, molecular probes
for antibodies and gene expression are used to identify the molecules involved
and their relative contributions to defining this regional border. Results will
provide an important basis to proceed with analyzing the molecular mechanisms of
boundary formation, and so will be important beyond understanding the
development of olfactory circuits to understanding the biology of pattern
formation in general.
