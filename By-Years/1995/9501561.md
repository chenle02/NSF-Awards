PI: Manfredi DMS-9501561 Manfredi will investigate the interplay between
nonlinear elasticity and function theory. He will attempt to bridge the gap
between quasiregular mappings and mappings describing deformations of certain
types of hyperelastic materials. Regularity up to the boundary of solutions to
nonlinear elliptic systems that appear often in applications to non-Newtonian
fluid mechanics will also be discussed. The significance of this research is the
interconnections between areas of classical analysis and materials science.
Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the
physical world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the
equations as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the
solutions. This may include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness
and growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods for approximation of
solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.
