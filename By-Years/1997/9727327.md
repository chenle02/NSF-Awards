9727327 Chiu The purpose of the project is to hold a joint workshop of the Task
Committee of the United States-Japan Cooperative Program on Natural Resources
(UJNR). The theme of the workshop is "Prediction and Control of Wind-Induced
Response" and will be held at the East-West Center on the campus of the
University of Hawaii. The topics to be discussed are: (a) Topographic effects on
wind and the use of geographic information systems (GIS) to study these effects;
(b) Control of wind-induced response of structures; (c) Computational fluid
dynamics versus wind tunnel tests; (d) Prediction of wind-induced responses of
full-scale structures; and (e) Investigation of wind hazards, including damage
assessment technologies. For the technical program plenary sessions and small
working group sessions are scheduled. A technical study tour will include the
Tsunami Warning Venter, the Pacific Hurricane Center, National Weather Service
Forecast Office, the NOAA Mauna Loa Observatory and the Hawaii Volcano
Observatory. The research agenda developed will benefit the wind engineering
research committees from both countries. ***
