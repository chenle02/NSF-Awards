This workshop introduces participants to the basic theoretical concepts of
computergraphics and solid modeling and provides "hands.on" experience with
state.of.the.art graphics systems. Emphasis is placed on the integration of
these concepts into undergraduate design courses in aerospace, agricultural,
bioengineering, manufacturing, mechanical, and industrial engineering programs.
This workshop, held for one week during the summer of 1989, features an
extensive follow.up in which participants will be required to integrate these
concepts in an undergraduate design courses upon returning to their home
institution. The workshop staff serves as a resource group during the follow.up
activities. Participant institutions are cost. sharing the participants travel
expenses to this workshop. Results are to be published in the journals of the
American Society for Engineering Education.
