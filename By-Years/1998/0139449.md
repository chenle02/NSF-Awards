This award continues support for the Summer Undergraduate Research Program in
the Cognitive and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Minnesota. This ten-
week program will emphasize student participationh in the research activities of
faculty affiliated with the Center for Cognitive Sciences. Eleven undergraduates
will be selected from across the country. They will (1) work as a full member of
a faculty mentor's research team; (2) give an oral presentation to peers and
participating faculty and write a formal report on the research project engaged
during the program; (3) take part in workshops devoted to research ethics,
technical writing, and preparation for graduate studies; and (4) participate in
a thrice-weekly multidisciplinary research training seminar. Seminar activities
include presentations by faculty, laboratory tours, and field trips. The
integrated program includes opportunities for the participants to learn specific
research methods, to apply these methods in the context of their own research,
and to examine broad conceptual and methodological issues relevant to the
cognitive sciences and related areas. Participation in special social and
cultural team building events as well as common housing in a university
dormitory is designed to foster a strong community of
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes to the Foundation's
continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through
active undergraduate research experiences.
