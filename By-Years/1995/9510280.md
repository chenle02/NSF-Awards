Conflict in groups and organizations are becoming more pervasive due to the
increasing complexity and interdependence of organizational life. Conflict can
be difficult in any work group, but it can be particularly difficult when two
cultures are involved. Effective intercultural interaction is crucial to the
success of US- Foreign joint ventures. This Research Planning Grant lays the
foundation for a research program that investigates the dimensions of conflict
in bicultural top management teams. Planned research includes interviews of
managers in joint ventures in the US, the PRC, and Russia. Multiple methods,
such as multidimentional scaling and text analysis, will be used to analyze
different types of conflict situations identified by the managers. The research
will eventually lead to an increased understanding of the types of problems that
affect firm survival in an international business community.
