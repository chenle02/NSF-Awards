0340172&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will develop novel optical&lt;br/&gt;pressure sensor materials that can
be used in low pressure regimes, less than 100 psi, with&lt;br/&gt;1 psi or
lower resolution. While conventional "pressure sensitive" materials such
as&lt;br/&gt;pressure sensitive paints actually respond to oxygen partial
pressure, few true optical&lt;br/&gt;pressure sensors exist that can claim
insensitivity to competing effects such as chemicals,&lt;br/&gt;bending,
temperature, and electric field. Conventional sensors such as fiber Bragg
gratings &lt;br/&gt;and fiber Fabry-Perot interferometers will continue to be
prohibitively expensive for volume &lt;br/&gt;applications for a very long time
and cannot match the price performance mark of material-&lt;br/&gt;based
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pressure specification covers a wide range
of applications where optical sensors (and&lt;br/&gt;Fiber-optic sensors in
particular) are desirable, including diverse markets such
as&lt;br/&gt;biomedical and surgical (e.g. intravenous and intra-cranial
monitoring), energy (fuel cells&lt;br/&gt;and gas turbines), materials
processing (plastics and polymers), and petrochemical&lt;br/&gt;applications
(down-hole temperature and pressure monitoring). &lt;br/&gt;
