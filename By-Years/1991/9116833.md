Arizona State University will support six women, minorities, and/or persons with
disabilities in an engineering graduate program designed to culminate in the
awarding of a doctoral degree to each student. Five outstanding and
complementary research areas are proposed in this program. These areas are: (1)
Nanoelectronics, (2) Manufacturing Quality Improvement, (3) Telecommunications,
(4) Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems, and (5) Aerospace. Each of these
disciplines is headed by a professor who is a recognized authority in his area
of expertise. Students will be recruited to the program using a national
advertising campaign based on the College's success with the Industrial Fellows
Program. Candidates will be invited to campus to meet the faculty, students, and
to become acquainted with the research facilities available at the graduate
level. Final selection will be made by the departmental graduate committee, in
conjunction with the PI's. Immediately upon selection the student will be
assigned a mentor to assist in the preliminary phase of his/her program. ASU's
effort to recruit underrepresented students is vigorously supported by the state
legislature and the Board of Regents who have provided special funds for this
purpose.
