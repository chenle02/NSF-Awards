Lay Abstract PI: Miller, Mark Proposal Number: IBN-9722349 Many goal-oriented
behaviors are said to be "motivated" as their occurrence depends upon both
extrinsic factors (such as the presence of food) and the intrinsic state of the
organism (such as the level of hunger or satiety). This investigation relates
the activities of specific brain cells and the connections between them to the
generation of complex motivated patterns of behavior. The project focuses on the
role of chemical substances called neuropeptides, which modulate the activity of
these nervous system cells during motivated behavior such as eating. The studies
are conducted as part of an undergraduate summer program at the Institute of
Neurobiology in San Juan, Puerto Rico so that every step of the research program
involves undergraduates. Most organisms, including humans, exhibit a variety of
motivated behaviors. This project investigates the fundamental principles
underlying the brain mechanisms controlling such behaviors. By coupling the
research to the undergraduate summer research program, the project provides
students with access to hands-on research opportunities and experiences that
were previously inaccessible to students at the host institution.
