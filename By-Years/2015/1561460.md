This award will provide support for participants attending an international
conference and workshop on Representations of Algebras (ICRA XVII) at Syracuse
University from August 10-19, 2016. The ICRA is the preeminent international
meeting in this area and this is the first time that it will be held in the
United States. The meeting will consist of two parts: a 3.5 day workshop, and a
5 day conference. The workshop will feature six speakers each giving three one-
hour talks. The conference will consist of eighteen 50-minute plenary lectures,
together with parallel sessions of shorter presentations. The organizers expect
around 150 participants. The award will be used to support travel and lodging
for the workshop and plenary speakers as well as to support other participants,
particularly junior researchers and graduate students. One of the primary goals
of the conference is to promote interactions with other areas of mathematics by
inviting prominent mathematicians in these areas to share their ideas and
results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics to be covered at the conference
include: representations of quivers; Auslander-Reiten theory; tilting theory;
homological properties of finite dimensional algebras; cluster algebras and
categories; group representation theory; vector bundles on weighted projective
spaces; preprojective algebras and applications of geometry to representation
theory. Further information can be found at the conference website,
