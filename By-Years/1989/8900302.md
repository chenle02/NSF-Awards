This award provides partial support for the 1989 International Symposium on
Heavy Quark Physics at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York on June 13-17,
1989. This is the third in a series of conference on this topic. The subject
concerns the field of B-meson physics" and of "B-meson factories", as the future
accelerator facilities devoted to the study of b-quark interactions are known.
Cornell's Laboratory of Nuclear Studies has played a crucial role in the study
of b- quark phenomena since the start-up of the e+e- colliding ring CESR.
Results from Cornell's experiment will be presented as well as results from
major laboratories around the world.
