The proposed research targets advancing the state of knowledge on rational
design decisions in sustainable product design in order to enable a better
understanding of the consequences of those decisions from an overall design
perspective. The proposed research method will advance the current available
capabilities for product and process design by integrating LCA into decision
making for engineering design. The work intends to result in a novel decision
method, and related decision support tools, for sustainable design. The methods
and tools to be developed reflect the standards established in NISTs
sustainability portal, and complement and enhance the capabilities of PLM tools.

The outcomes of the proposed work have the potential to facilitate the design of
more sustainable products that could significantly improve both the environment
and the economy on a global scale. The work is supported by the Industry
Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the
potential to extend the centers portfolio. The PIs plan to introduce the
developed research methods in the graduate courses at UMass Amherst and the
University at Buffalo SUNY as well as develop coordinated prototype educational
tools to benefit the centers collaborators and industry partners.
