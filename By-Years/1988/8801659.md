The importance of efficient sorting algorithms is widely acknowledged in many
applications. This project is an investigation of the problem of producing fast
n-input parallel sorting circuits. The model used is the popular sorting
network. For extremely small n, the fastest sorting networks are hand-
constructed. For intermediate n, the fastest networks are essentially those of
Batcher. For extremely large n, the fastest sorting networks are those of Ajtai,
Kimlos and Szemeredi. Improvements in all three situations are sought. For very
small n, a modification of existing backtracking algorithms should result in
viable networks with a slightly larger number of inputs. For intermediate n,
Batcher's sorting algorithm will be modified to use larger building blocks. This
approach is essentially a careful analysis of the divide-and-conquer strategy.
For very large n, existing algorithms will be studied for potential
improvements.
