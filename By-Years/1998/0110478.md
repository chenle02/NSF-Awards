This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is directed at
developing a collection of software tools for use in selective extraction of
information from the running text of synthetic recipes. Synthetic procedures are
batch recipes used in the creation and discovery of new chemical entities for
drug discovery. The ultimate aim of the project is to automate information
extraction and place the information in a computer-understandable data structure
that fully captures the data and semantics of the synthetic recipe. The Phase I
program successfully demonstrated feasibility of the approach by constructing a
prototype system and using it to solve a range of representative synthetic-
recipe-related information extraction problems. In Phase II, the objectives are
to (1) refine and extend the features of the prototype system; (2) implement
machine learning capability for extraction rule induction, (3) construct focused
demonstration applications, and (4) test, evaluate and validate the software
system in conjunction with pharmaceutical-company research-collaborators. The
ultimate goal of the program is to develop a commercial software toolkit that
enables chemists to easily construct systems for information extraction from
synthetic recipes.

Recipes for more than 19 million unique compounds are contained in the public
literature, and there are a comparable number in the archives of pharmaceutical
companies. The vast majority of these procedures are maintained as unstructured
running text. Intellichem, Inc. proffers tools for extraction of synthetic
recipe information into computer-understandable data structures that will
benefit the following: database construction and updating, summarization,
chemical process discovery, knowledge reuse, improved productivity of the
chemist, and chemistry-related e-commerce.
