9322148 Webber This award provides funds to continue a successful REU Site at
Arizona State University in the Center for the Study of Early Events In
Photosynthesis. Life on this planet is ultimately dependent on photosynthesis
for its energy requirements. At Arizona State University, the center, comprised
of faculty in the departments of Botany and Chemistry and Biochemistry, takes an
interdisciplinary approach to understanding the energy storage process carried
out by photosynthetic organisms and mimicking photosynthesis using artificial
systems. Undergraduate students will participate in the individual research
programs of the Center faculty. Projects will include organic synthesis and
spectroscopic studies of model compounds, spectroscopic studies of bacterial and
plant photosynthetic reaction centers, and molecular biology and genetics of
photosynthetic systems. Structured interaction between faculty and student
participants, including the weekly photosynthesis seminar series, research group
meetings, instrumentation workshops and a concluding undergraduate symposium,
will help educate the students in the extremely diverse modern approach to the
study of photosynthesis. Student participants will be recruited from targeted
colleges and universities in the Southwest United States with the help of local
departments chairs and individual faculty. ***
