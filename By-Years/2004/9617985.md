9617985 Nowlin This award continues the cooperative agreement under which the
Project Office for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) operates. The
office provides US scientists with logistics and travel support for planning
meetings, workshops, and major field expeditions, publishes a periodic
newsletter, coordinates activities with the International Project Office in the
United Kingdom, and serves as the central source of information on the U. S.
WOCE program. WOCE will complete its final field phase in the 1998-1999 time
frame, and this will be followed by an intense phase of analysis, synthesis, and
modeling which will continue to require the coordination efforts of this office.
