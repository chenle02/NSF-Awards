Modern optics is an area of increasing importance to the economy. The Physics
Department at Cal Poly Pomona proposes to enhance their program in optics and
spectroscopy by purchasing a nitrogen-pumped dye laser and nanosecond resolution
detection system. This laser system will be used in the optics class to teach
students principles of laser operation and to provide a source for non-linear
optical effects. The laser system will also serve as a resource for the Physics
majors in the advanced laboratory series in order to enable students to do
advanced experiments and research projects in optical pumping, resonance
transfer of energy in optical systems, non-linear optics, the measurement of
fluorescence lifetimes, Raman spectroscopy, thermal lensing experiments, and
photochemistry. The short pulse duration, high power, and variable wavelength of
the dye laser will make it a versatile and reliable light source for
undergraduate optics at all levels.
