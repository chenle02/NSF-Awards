This project will examine "tropical cyclone attribution" to identify the primary
pre-existing disturbance(s) out of which each tropical cyclone in a season
develops. The investigators will (i) develop and apply a means of attributing
tropical cyclogenesis to one or more types of equatorial waves; (ii) address the
wildly divergent views of existing papers in the literature on tropical cyclone
pre-cursors; and (iii) attempt to merge traditional tropical meteorology
practice with an alternative framework that makes use of equatorial wave theory.
The goal of the last part of the work is to move some ideas from the research
community into the operational tropical cyclone forecast community.

The investigators have examined the role of mixed Rossby-gravity, equatorial
Rossby, easterly waves and the Madden-Julian Oscillation on tropical
cyclogenesis in their previous NSF support. In this project they will study
tropical cyclone formation within "monsoon gyres". These are broad subtropical
low pressure areas that often produce multiple tropical cyclones. The ultimate
goal of the two parts of this work is to develop a unified approach to
understanding the precursor disturbances for tropical cyclones.

The broader impacts of this project include (i) the potential in merging
operational forecast methods that rely on satellite images with some new
theoretical approaches that better define the precursor disturbances, to
ultimately improve the forecasts of hurricane formation on a time scale of 5-10
days, (ii) the training of graduate students and (iii) wide dissemination of
results and findings in conferences, workshops, and the refereed literature. The
principal investigator will also give talks on hurricanes to lay groups as part
of outreach efforts.
