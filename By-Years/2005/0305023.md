This Travel Grant will provide partial support for a small group of US
scientists to attend the International Conference on Non-Contact Atomic Force
Microscopy (ncAFM03) in Dingle, Ireland, August 31 to September 3, 2003. This
conference series is the primary international venue for sharing advances in
this rapidly developing technique, which enables atomic resolution investigation
of both insulating and conducting surfaces. The funds will enable new US
investigators to become informed about the latest progress in this exciting
technique, to meet members of the international groups at the frontier of the
field, and to bring back ideas for use of the technique in scientific
investigations in the USA. It will promote international cooperation and more
efficient use of US resources by informed researchers. The Travel Grant will
enable eight graduate students or post-doctoral associates, particularly those
with abstracts to present, to travel and interact with other scientists in this
field, which spans virtually all physical and biological sciences.
