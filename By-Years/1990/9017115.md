The objective of this effort is to examine research priorities and policy issues
in bioprocess engineering of relevance to both specialty high-value products
(e.g., therapeutic drugs) and commodity, low-value chemical products (e.g.,
liquid fuels). This will be done through the establishment of a committee of
experts and the convening of two workshops addressing research needs and policy
issues associated with specialty, high-value products and commodity. low-value
chemical products. A final report will be prepared that will provide a consensus
opinion and present the needs and opportunities of the area for the next decade
as biotechnology comes of age. A committee of experts will be recruited to
address the needs of this study on bioprocess engineering. The committee will be
comprised of individuals from academe, industry, and government in areas such as
bioprocess engineering, chemical engineering, molecular biology, cell, biology,
quality assurance, and biosafety. The committee will prepare a final report.
