0210995&lt;br/&gt;Pinsky&lt;br/&gt; The 25th Midwest Probability Colloquium will
be held at Northwestern University, on October 17-18, 2003. This is a regional
meeting with a limited number of talks and plenty of opportunity for interaction
among the researchers. It has a strong tradition of encouraging graduate
students and other young investigators to attend and interact with specialists.
This year's speakers are Gerard BenArous, Bruce Driver, and Jonathan
Mattingly.&lt;br/&gt;
