This project is recruiting and supporting 22 individuals pursuing undergraduate
degrees in science at Boston College to earn Master's Degrees in Education:
Secondary Science to teach in urban schools (8-12). This model for preparing
science teachers for urban schools presents a unique integration of social
justice, focus on teaching English Language Learners, well-developed mentoring
and induction, institutionalized tracking and evidence-gathering about
graduates, close collaborations with Boston Public Schools, and strong
relationships between School of Education and Arts and Sciences faculty. The
project offers structured involvement of STEM faculty through one-on-one
mentoring and content mentoring of the preservice students that continues into
their early years of teaching. All graduates obtain the Teaching English
Learners certificate qualifying them to teach nonnative English speakers in
mainstream classrooms. The 22 teachers produced by this Noyce Scholarship
project are impacting the learning of thousands of students in urban schools who
are often underrepresented in science and can serve as inspirations for
potential science educators. Science teachers armed with culturally relevant
pedagogy and strategies and skills to teach nonnative English speakers and
pupils with special needs in mainstream classrooms, increase the chances of
diverse pupils' success and participation as critical citizens in a democratic
society. Science teachers who represent underrepresented minority and gender
populations serve as effective role models that further enhance the achievement
and aspirations of diverse urban students. All these variables combine to
improve teacher self-efficacy, pupil achievement and teacher retention, reduce
district spending to hire and orient new teachers, and reinforce staff stability
in schools.
