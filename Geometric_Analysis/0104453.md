Abstract for DMS - 0104453

The goal of this project is to describe all embedded minimal surfaces of some
fixed (but arbitrary) genus in a fixed (but arbitrary) closed 3-manifold. Such a
study would include the description of these surfaces on a fixed small scale.
Various applications of such a description will also be studied. In particular
to the spherical space-form problem, the topology of 3-manifolds with positive
scalar curvature and various other problems in the topology of 3-manifolds. Two
other seperate projects will be investigated. One is simple closed geodesics on
surfaces and another is degeneration of Kahler-Einstein manifolds.

Roughly speaking the goal of this proposal is to describe all smooth soap-
films. I soap-film is a surface spanning a boundary and which is critical for
area among all other surfaces with the same boundary. Besides being a classical
problem such a description would have many possible applications in a wide
varieties of fields. Spanning from topology to mathematical biology.
