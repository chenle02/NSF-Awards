*** 9660183 Kortenkamp This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
is to develop a stereo vision system that can perform pursuit and obstacle
avoidance functions for a mobile robot. Visual sensing has long been a
significant obstacle to deploying truly autonomous mobile robots. Existing
vision systems are either too slow or too expensive. The focus of this effort is
to concentrate system resources in cubic volumes of space called proximity
spaces. Within the bounds of this space an array of stereo and motion
measurements are made in order to determine which regions of the space are
occupied by surface material, and what the spatial and temporal disparities are
within those regions. This project will look at extending an approach to pursuit
and obstacle avoidance for mobile robots. This will improve the flexibility and
safety of current robotic systems and increase the range of tasks to which
robots can be applied. This product will have wide applications in the emerging
service robotics industry, hazardous waste inspection and clean-up, service
robotics (i.e., delivery, security, warehousing), research robots, and the
entertainment industry. ***
