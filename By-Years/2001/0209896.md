In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Clouthier will conduct research on the electronic spectra of
main group intermediates. These intermediates are based on Si, Ge, and Sn atoms,
whose chemistry is significantly different from that of carbon atom-based
molecules. Information about the electronically excited states is very sparse
but is of great importance to the reaction chemistry of these species. The
results of these investigations will be of importance to the physics of
interstellar clouds and circumstellar atmospheres, as well for CVD fabrication
of industrially important thin films. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our basic
understanding of the behavior of the chemical vapor deposition process for the
fabrication of industrially important thin films, as well as for the molecular
modeling of interstellar clouds and circumstellar atmospheres is not well
developed. While the chemistry of molecules based on the carbon atom is well
understood, this is not the case for molecules in which silicon, germanium, or
tin atoms take the place of carbon atoms. This research is directed to provide
information on the properties of such molecules. The studies will be conducted
with the assistance of students, postdoctoral research associates and
collaborators from other institutions. Students will gain experience in modern
techniques of molecular spectroscopy in preparation for advanced studies or
entry into the scientific/technical workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
