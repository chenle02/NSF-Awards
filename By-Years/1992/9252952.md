This project will develop a set of curriculum materials and accompanying
teacher support materials that will use geometry to bring a culture of
mathematical exploration into the classroom, interconnect students' experiences
with various parts of experience. The materials will include (1) a library of
students activities designed so they can be used to form coherent units
addressing specific content and themes; (2) a Curriculum Map Maker designed to
help teachers select activities and sequences of related activities, ranging
from extensions to existing geometry courses to completely new courses; and (3)
a Self-Guided Inservice Package to help teachers learn to make effective use of
the toolkit and to explore the new models of teaching embodied in the
activities. The activities will encourage students to experiment mentally, using
physical manipulatives, and using computer images. They will foster students'
development of mathematical ways of reasoning, analyzing, and communicating;
link geometry to science, technology, art. and other areas of students'
experience; and link geometry to important ideas in other areas of mathematics,
including algebra, analysis, number theory, combinatoriecs, and linear algebra.
