Devices which have two states of transparency to light beams have the potential
of being used as two state logic devices. In this particular case, these two
states are stable to perturbations and can be changed by an additional optical
pulse. The authors of this proposal has been involved in the demonstration of a
complete set of logic gates and clocked optical flip flops based on these
devices. The logic gates perform such operations as; and, or, and nor functions
and the clocked flip flop, which is able to operate in two states can be flipped
from one to the other by an independent pulse (clock). A recent comment that
optical logic circuits, or rather combinations of them, can be simpler in
complexity than the corresponding electonic equivalents, has been noteworthy and
alleviates somewhat the criticism of the relatively large size of the optical
components. This research is in an area of current controversy and the author
has proposed highly innovative approaches to optical signal processing
questions.
