This award helps to support the participation of researchers in a workshop on
internet research ethics. Four US-based scholars will meet with three
U.K./European scholars and researchers to outline a research agenda directed
towards establishing an ethics of Internet research. Similarities and ethically
pertinent differences between traditional human subjects research and on-line
research with human subjects will be considered. Such differences emerge because
the Internet allows for varieties of research never before possible, raising new
ethical questions. Needed are guidelines for Internet research that are
genuinely global in their validity (as required for a global medium) while
acknowledging important cultural and national differences that might require
specific ethical codes. Workshop participants were chosen on the basis of their
expertise both as internet researchers and ethicists who have worked extensively
on the problems of Internet research ethics. The workshop will be held in
conjunction and interaction with CEPE participants--moral philosophers who have
long focussed on computer ethics hence providing an audience uniquely suited to
engaging productively with the issues raised by the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;The
workshop builds on recent efforts to develop such principles of research ethics,
including several national statements developed in the United States and abroad.
It also builds on the forthcoming report of the Ethics Working Committee (EWC)
of the Association of Internet Researchers, which attempts a first synthesis of
available analysis and guidelines and tentative proposals for local and global
Internet research ethics. Expected outcomes of this workshop include a series of
articles in a special issue of Ethics and Information Technology, workshop
results posted on www.cddc.vt.edu/aoir/ethics/, and stimulation of much many
practical outcomes such as national and international guidelines or principles
governing human research on-line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
