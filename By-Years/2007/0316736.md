In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Andrei Tokmakoff of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology will use two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy to investigate
the molecular dynamics of peptides and proteins in solution. The overall goal is
to obtain a broad understanding of the conformational, vibrational, and
solvation dynamics of peptides and proteins through studies of the amide
vibrations of the polypeptide backbone. More specific is the desire to obtain a
description of the vibrational dynamics of multiple coupled vibrational
coordinates interacting with a bath, and the structural dynamics of a polyatomic
solute in a strongly interacting solvent, as well as the development of
experimental tools for studying conformational changes and structural
heterogeneity accompanying protein folding and binding processes in solution.

Graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral research associates, and high
school teachers will participate in this project, which stands at the forefront
of condensed phase chemical dynamics research. They will acquire skills and
knowledge that will be of advantage in further studies or education.
