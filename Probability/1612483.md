The practical motivation for the questions under study in this research project
comes from quantitative finance. Specifically, the project investigates the
mathematics behind portfolios that outperform a standard index such as S&P 500
in the presence of volatility. The utility of such portfolios is that in that
process they reduce volatility demonstrably, and thus contribute to the
stability of financial markets. Although ad hoc use of such portfolios is
widespread, a systematic mathematical study has been limited so far. It turns
out the mathematics is related to some very modern topics in probability and
geometry, especially that of the Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport maps.
Successful completion of the research will not only lead to striking new
mathematics in probability and information geometry, but will also imply very
practical applications in modern portfolio management, with potential societal
benefits of the highest level via increased financial stability.

The investigator plans to study an array of problems linking the fields of
optimal transport and interacting particle systems, with applications to modern
portfolio theory. There are two parts to this project. The first one
investigates the behavior of exponential stochastic integrals where the
integrand is given by a solution of a Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport map.
The study is an interesting interplay between geometry of the unit simplex and
universal behavior of stochastic integrals when they are not martingales.
Classical probability relies heavily on the martingale property of stochastic
integrals. Here, the investigator explores a completely distinct class of
behaviors that should be of independent interest. The second part studies
properties of interacting continuous-time particle systems in finite and
infinite dimensions. These particle systems, originally coming from stochastic
portfolio theory, can be thought of as a continuous-time analogue of the
discrete time exclusion process on the integer lattice. However, unlike
exclusion processes, very little is known about these processes. They are
conjectured to display striking phase transitions. The project aims to establish
concentration inequalities and fluctuation estimates (among other properties)
for such processes, which is a step towards proving more subtle behavior of
these processes.
