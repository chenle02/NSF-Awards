Sensor networks create new challenges in the understanding of communication and
information processing. This research addresses two of the key issues: the
scaling behavior of the networks, and the fact that sensor networks involve both
sources and channels and hence generally perform both data compression and data
transmission. The "scaling behavior" of the network denotes its key properties
and characteristics as a function of the number of nodes. For low-cost, low-
power, and dense scenarios such as sensor networks, this is the most relevant
characterization, and it is theoretically important and successful since the
exact analysis of network performance appears to be a very hard problem. By
contrast, a scaling law focuses on how the performance depends on the number of
nodes. Preliminary scaling-law results of the investigators suggest that
qualitatively different laws and insights apply to large networks as compared to
small networks. This is of fundamental importance to both research and
education: different code constructions, algorithm designs, and signal
processing techniques have to be developed, and a different intuition has to be
taught to cover such networks. The second key issue of this research concerns
the fact that the sensed world is often analog, requiring both data compression
and data transmission. This communication problem is unsolved to date: The
omnipresent separation of the coding strategy into a compression and a
transmission stage can lead to dramatically suboptimal performance, implying
that the well-established understanding of information as "bits" needs to be
revised. This research investigates a new and different understanding of
communication as "matching" the source to the channel. In a scaling-law sense,
this can lead to spectacular gains, as preliminary results have shown.
