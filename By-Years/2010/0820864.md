The grant supports junior scientists' participation in the 2008 Gordon
Conference on Photonuclear Reactions. The objective of the Gordon Research
Conference on Photonuclear Reactions is to provide the international community
of nuclear scientists with a unique forum where the most recent developments in
this field can be presented, discussed and criticized. The agenda of this
Conference provokes new ideas for future research, in ensuring that discussions
facilitate vigorous and open interactions between scientists. This requires the
participation of a significant number of the leaders, including both
internationally recognized senior scientists and the young and rising stars.
Bright and promising postdoctoral researchers and graduate students are selected
for participation in this Conference and encouraged to present their ideas.
Their participation provides them with unique and extensive access to the
leaders in their field, exposes them to new research opportunities and
techniques and helps prepare them for the leadership roles they will assume in
the future. Some of the young scientists have been invited to present talks. For
others, poster sessions are organized to provide a forum for their ideas, with
best displays additionally selected for oral presentations.
