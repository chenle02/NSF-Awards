The over-arching goal of this proposal is to provide transformative advances
towards developing a nanofluidic pump inspired by principles of active pumping
from biology and engineered nanofluidics. In this proof-of-concept project, an
attempt will be made to establish electrokinetic aqueous electrolyte transport
in a confined nanochannel in the presence of asymmetric surface charges on the
channel walls. The experiments will be guided by computational models (both
continuum and molecular dynamics) to engineer a proof-of-concept, novel,
nanofluidic pump. The idea is based on well-established ideas in biological
systems that use asymmetric charges to move hydrated ions and combine with a
nanofluidic device with embedded electrodes to develop a novel nanofluidic pump.
Since, no such system has been built before this proposal presents high risk,
potentially transformative research. This work will have significant impact on
advances in nanoscale fluid dynamics leading to new avenues for engineering
novel nanofluidic devices for a variety of applications as described in the main
proposal narrative. By using multi-stage integration between research and
education, this multi-disciplinary experimental project is expected to give at a
minimum undergraduate and graduate students and perhaps a much broader audience
including minority, under-represented groups, middle and high school female
students exposure to microfluidics and nanofluidics through individual and group
lab training, coursework, hands-on workshops, outreach, and web modules for
impact on education of future scientists and engineers.
