Elliot Bernstein of Colorado State University is supported by the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program to study radical-closed shell molecule reactions
relevant to atmospheric and combustion chemistry. Specifically, Prof. Bernstein
will study radicals prevalent in mildly oxidizing environments such as methyl,
hydroxy, and nitrate radicals and their reactions with ethylene. He will
generate the radical-molecule complex initially in its ground electronic state,
where the barrier is high enough to inhibit reaction, then optically excite the
complex to an excited (barrier-less) electronic state to initiate reaction. He
will employ time-resolved optical/mass spectrometric techniques to follow the
reaction. Finally, ab initio calculations will be exploited to generate reaction
potential energy surfaces. The implications of this line of research are many-
fold. These studies will provide important details about reaction dynamics; the
reactions to be studied are particularly relevant in the areas of combustion and
atmospheric chemistry. The cluster environment will yield unique details not
readily obtainable in the gas- or bulk-phase, and new techniques for generating
radicals in clusters will be explored and developed.
