9704489 Kleinbock This project deals with algebraic dynamical systems and their
applications to number theory. Many problems concerning diophantine
approximations can be cast in terms of the behavior of the orbits of a suitable
homogeneous flow. Non-generic orbits such as those avoiding a given finite set
or ones that remain bounded are of particular interest. The investigator is to
continue his work on escapable sets and metric properties of matrices arising in
diophantine approximations. Dynamical systems in the present context deal with
how points in a system move over time, given a set of differential equations (or
laws of nature) governing the system. It turns out that various numerical
approximations used in the theory of integer equations can be better calculated
once they are phrased in dynamical systems language.
