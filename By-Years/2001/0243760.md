Institution: University of Idaho PI: McHale &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) involving the chemistry departments at the
University of Idaho and Washington State University will involve 10 students (8
NSF supported) during the summers of 2003-2005. This 10-week program will
emphasize research topics in Green Chemistry which is defined as "design of
chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation
of hazardous substances". Jeanne L. McHale (Idaho) is the site director and Sue
B.Clark (WSU) is the co-PI. Fourteen faculty from these institutions are
available to supervise research projects encompassing subjects such as hazardous
waste remediation, catalysis, solar energy conversion, and environmentally
friendly synthesis. The collaborating departments will maximize their available
resources for research and promote more diverse approaches to chemical research.
Students will be recruited from regional colleges in the Pacific Northwest,
which includes Washington, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Alaska, and Wyoming. There
will be an emphasis on attracting students from under-represented groups. Weekly
seminars on research and career issues will alternate between the schools. A
field trip will be taken to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
