Fayetteville State University will implement an HBCU-UP Broadening Participation
Research in STEM Education project to examine the impact of the Advancing
Interest and Motivation (AIM) model on student career interests, motivation,
self-efficacy, career outcome expectations, and employment outcomes in STEM. The
PIs also propose a supplemental study using structural equation modeling and
path analysis to study self-regulation and its influences on STEM career
interests and progression. AIM is designed for Fayetteville State seniors from
the Departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Physics, and Mathematics
and Computer Science in collaboration with the Office of Career Services and
STEM faculty. The research framework is based on social cognitive career theory.
The project will use aspects of the theory as a guide to develop a broadening
participation model for HBCU STEM students designed to enhance career self-
efficacy, share career expectations, advance interest and motivation to pursue
STEM careers, and improve job search skills via a coordinated set of learning
experiences involving STEM faculty, alumni, Office of Career Services, and STEM
professionals in the workforce.

The project will inform STEM teaching and career development intervention
strategies. The findings could contribute to the current body of information
regarding phenomena associated with STEM majors that do not pursue STEM careers,
an important aspect to understand in trying to increase the representation of
minorities in the STEM workforce.
