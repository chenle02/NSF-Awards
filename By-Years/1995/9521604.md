This proposal describes basic research activities to develop temporal imaging
systems capable of expanding of compressing the time scales of ultrafast optical
waveforms while maintaining the integrity of the envelope profiles. The
objective or the proposal is to develop temporal imaging systems capable of
resolving femtosecond features in optical waveforms. Time lenses will be
fabricated as electro-optic phase modulators resonators will be designed for the
modulators, new crystals with very high electro-optic coefficients will be
employed and very high frequency (mm wave) sources will be used to drive the
resonant modulators. New state-of-the-art three dimensional electromagnetic
field modeling programs will be used to model the field for the complicated
dielectric-loaded resonators; path-integrals through the fields will be used to
establish the peak phase deviations to be expected. Many applications could be
greatly impacted by the development of practical temporal imaging systems:
communications, laser selective photochemistry, and investigation of optical
waveforms which ex ceed the capacity of currently available detection systems.
