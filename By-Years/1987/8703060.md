The chemical and physical properties of molecules are determined not only by
their elemental composition, but also by their shape (stereochemistry). These
studies will provide further information on the role of shape in controlling
chemical properties. This is particularly important in understanding how
molecules interact in biological systems. The specific stereochemical studies of
this project are in four areas: (A) Conformational Analysis - The conformational
behavior of 1,2,3,4-N-methyltetrahydroquinolines and their salts will be studied
as well as the relation of optical rotation to conformation and hydrogen bonding
in cis-3-hydroxythiane sulfoxide and other compounds; (B) NMR Spectroscopy - NMR
spectroscopic studies will deal with O-17 NMR, especially effects of hydrogen
bonding, application to mechanistic studies and spectra of sugar derivatives;
(C) Asymmetric Synthesis - The studies in asymmetric synthesis will involve the
previously investigated 1,3-oxathiane system and will also encompass
methodological studies of chiral 1,3-oxazanes as molds for stereoselective
syntheses. Further, mechanistic studies of the importance of chelation in such
studies involving Cram's cyclic rule will be undertaken by stop-flow methods;
and (D) Carbanion Chemistry - The carbanion studies will involve carbanions
derived from 1,3-oxathiane and 1,3-dioxane and will encompass efforts to
investigate their rate of inversion by stop-flow nmr.
