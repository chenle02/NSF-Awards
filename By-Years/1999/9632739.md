ABSTRACT CTS-9632739 A new approach for the detection of the Doppler wavelength
shift and a corresponding new instrument (Doppler Fluorescence Velocimetry, DFM)
for single and two-phase flow velocity measurements will be investigated. The
Doppler shift is transformed into wave intensity ratio by collecting the laser
beams into a fluorescence chamber. The signal is projected on a black
background, from where a fast-color-switcher with an acoustic-optic-tunnel
filter is used to measure the intensity ratio. Two systems, a point velocimeter
with a photomultiplier tube and a planar velocimeter with a CCD array, will be
simultaneously constructed and tested. It is expected that the sensitivity and
the signal-to-noise ratio will increase significantly. If successful, the system
will allow for higher frequency response and simpler operation with out system
alignment. The objective of the project is to prove the feasibility of the
concept, and to find the most suitable areas of application. The proposed
concept may lead to significant increase in versality and efficiency of velocity
measurements in some conditions as compared to the laser Doppler velocimetry
(LDV), Phase-Doppler anemometry (PDA), and particle image velocimetry (PIV). ***
