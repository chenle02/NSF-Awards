Five underrepresented undergraduates will be involved in field and laboratory
research to determine the origin of three problematic glacial deposits in west-
central Minnesota. The studywill employ provenance analysis of soils and tills
using field pebble counts, sediment petrography and X-ray diffraction to
determine source area. Provenance studies are readily accomplished at the
undergraduate level yet remain the fundamantal method of studying glacial
deposits in Minnesota. The work will be done in the summer, and at least two of
the students will come from other than the grantee institution. It is
anticipated that at least four and possibly all of the students will come from
minority or handicapped populations
