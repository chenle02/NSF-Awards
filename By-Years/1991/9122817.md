The purpose of the proposed research is to identify the number and locations of
genetic factors underlying differences in adult male genital morphology in the
Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup. The approach will involve labeling
individual genomic segments of the mauritiana genome with a P-element construct
containing an eye- color marker. The study will also be aided by the use of
molecular markers. We propose a program of hybridization with simulans followed
by repeated backcrossing to create a large number of simulans strains each true-
breeding for a separate introgressed segment to the mauritiana genome. These
strains will be analyzed for characters of the male genitalia which differ of
these characters. Knowledge of the number of genetic factors that underlie
genitalic differentiation between closely related species is crucial to our
understanding of this widespread phenomenon, especially in the construction of
evolutionary models to account for it. Additional aspects of the study will
address whether the effects of the introgressed loci show additivity or
dominance, and the degree to which these loci interact epistatically to produce
this divergent morphology.
