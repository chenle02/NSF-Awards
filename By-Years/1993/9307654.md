The goal of the research is to obtain MR images in evolving physiological
states, using the properties of hyperpolarized 129Xe in (a) cell and tissue
compartmentalization, (b) dramatically time-dependent distribution, and (c)
response of NMR chemical shift, T1, and T2 to environment, O2, and exchange
kinetics, to obtain detailed anatomical images mapped with functional
information. %%% Magnetic resonance imaging is important to basic as well as
applied research in the biological sciences. Current imaging methods depend on
subtle differences in the magnetic properties of water molecules in biological
materials. The available contrast is quite low and the ubiquitous presence of
water prohibits its use, except in some flowing systems, to measure diffusion
and compartmentalization. The proposed research makes use of the extreme ease of
magnetic resonance detection of hyperpolarized Xe atoms and the fact that Xe
distributes rapidly in biological systems and similarly washes out rapidly. If
successful, these studies could lead to substantial changes in how magnetic
resonance imaging experiments are organized and add considerably to the method's
informational content.
