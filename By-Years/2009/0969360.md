Milwaukee Area Technical College (MATC) is addressing local and national
initiatives to increase the number of students transitioning to baccalaureate
degrees in STEM disciplines through the Biochemical Excellence in Science and
Technology (BEST) program. The primary goals of this project are to strengthen
the Associate of Science degree program and offer students different tracks
within this degree, most notably in the biochemical sciences. Enrollment in all
STEM fields is expected to increase. This five-year project offers an array of
recruitment, academic support and enrichment activities to ensure academic
success and stimulate interest as students explore career pathways in science
and technology when education and research are integrated. It includes summer
workshops for high school seniors, research internships for college students in
cooperation with four-year institutions and businesses, and a STEM-focused
professional development course for high school teachers and counselors. The
program is open to all, but minorities, women and other under-represented
populations are major target groups for recruitment. The BEST program provides a
model for integrating student learning and research through development of
curriculum and key partnerships with research institutions. The bridge
internships create stronger transfer relationships between MATC and local
colleges and universities. More importantly, there is a broader impact on the
number of technicians to meet the workforce development needs of Wisconsin
business and industry, where biochemical science and technology provides some of
the fastest growing job opportunities in the state.
