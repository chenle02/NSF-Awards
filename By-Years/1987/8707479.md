This research activity is supported under the Research Opportunities for Women -
-Planning Grants Program. The research is at the interstices of political
science and law and social sciences as it is concerned with an investigation of
compliance to public policies. An investigation of compliance to public policies
permits both theoretical and empirical analyses of the relationship between
government and the governed. The grant allows the investigator to plan for a
research investigation to refine a theory of compliance and to test the theory
in different policy settings in different countries. The initial part of the
planning stage involves a preliminary assessment of welfare fraud in the United
States and the second part of the planning stage involves the development of a
formal research proposal. The preliminary study will enable the investigator to
establish the criteria for selecting programs and countries for the subsequent
investigation. This phase will also enable the investigator to develop a
research design for the larger research acitivity.
