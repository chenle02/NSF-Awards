Dr. Kleene proposes to study the mechanisms that control the replacement of
histones by transition proteins and protamines during spermatogenesis in the
mouse. One major goal is to determine the amino acid sequences of the primary
translation products for all the transition proteins in the mouse from the
sequences of cDNA clones. Another goal is to elucidate the mechanisms which
repress the translation of the mRNAs for the transition proteins and protamines
in round spermatids, and activate their translation in elongating spermatids.
The critical question here--whether the translation of these mRNAs is repressed
by mRNP proteins or by structural elements of the RNA itself--will be answered
by comparing the translational efficiencies of mRNPs and deproteinized mRNAs
from the polysomal and nonpolysomal fractions of the testis in cell free
translation systems. To search for structural elements that may be involved in
translational regulation, the complete nucleotide sequences of the mRNAs for two
transition proteins and both protamines will be compared. UV crosslinking will
be employed to identify mRNP proteins in polysomal and non-polysomal fractions
of the testis. This proposal is intended to introduce promising undergraduates
to research in molecular biology. The differentiation of the sperm nucleus is a
simple developmental system involving the interaction of a small number of
abundant, structural proteins with DNA. It is an excellent system in which to
study the development of a specialized structure and translational regulation in
mammals.
