The proposed work is aimed at using renormalization group techniques to
construct light-front Hamiltonians from QCD. The results of this approach
include identifying forms for confining and chiral symmetry breaking
interactions, so that a low-energy picture of quarks and gluons with few degrees
of freedom can be constructed with a direct connection to QCD. ***
