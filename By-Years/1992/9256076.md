The University of Rochester will initiate an eight-week, commuter, Young
Scholars project in physics, engineering, and chemistry for 10 students entering
the 12th grade. This summer program will emphasize research participation in the
study of the physics of direct-drive laser fusion, high- energy-density physics,
optoelectronics, high-power lasers, plasma physics and nuclear fusion
technology. Students will conduct investigations and design experiments. There
also will be opportunities for students to engage in career exploration
activities through interactions with scientists.
