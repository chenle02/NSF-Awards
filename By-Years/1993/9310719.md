9310719 PELTZER As part of the U.S. JGOFS effort to construct a model for carbon
cycling during the Arabian Sea Process Study, the principal investigator will
measure water column concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at depths
of 0 to as much as 1000m at stations extending from the western upwelling margin
to the oligotrophic center of the Arabian Sea. By cooperating with another
investigator who will focus on DOC production and mineralization, the dynamics
of DOC during and between the monsoon seasons will be investigated with the
prospect of understanding how water column DOC dynamics are related to episodes
of monsoon-driven primary production.
