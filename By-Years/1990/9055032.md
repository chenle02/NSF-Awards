The University of Maine will initiate a three-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Engineering for 24 students entering grades 11,12. The project aims
to stimulate interest in engineering careers among the participants, with
particular emphasis on young women. This will be achieved through engineering
research projects, tours to industrial sites, an overview of career
opportunities in five engineering disciplines and a mini-course in Logic
Systems. Students and teachers at each participant's school will also become
aware of engineering through a follow-up project.
