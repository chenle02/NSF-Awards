With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor
Bruce Macher from San Francisco State University and colleague Ten-Yang Yen will
acquire a benchtop high resolution/accurate mass LC/MS/MS system. The proposal
is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels. Research
areas to be addressed with the new instrument include protein structure,
proteomics, biomarker discovery, protein-protein interactions, the development
of enzyme inhibitors, the mapping of post-translational modification sites on
proteins, the chemistry of singlet oxygen and oxidative methods in organic
chemistry, and the chemistry of fulvenes and their application to organic
synthesis. An LC/MS/MS system combines the physical separation capability of
liquid chromatography with the mass analysis ability of mass spectrometry. The
liquid chromatograph separates a mixture into its molecular components. The
separated components flow into the mass spectrometer where they are ionized into
a parent ion and fragment ions and their mass/charge ratio are measured. This
highly sensitive technique allows determination of the masses and chemical
composition of the substances in a complex mixture. The instrumentation provided
by this award will provide faculty and students in several departments the
opportunity to pursue research projects using state-of-the-art instrumentation.
It will also be used in several laboratory courses to train significant numbers
of women and students from underrepresented minority groups in the use of this
important and widely applied analytical tool.
