Number theory has a long history in mathematics, beginning with the ancient
Greeks. One of the most fundamental and important problems in number theory is
to solve Diophantine equations, that is, to find integer solutions to polynomial
equations with integer coefficients. For example, the famous Fermat's Last
Theorem concerns one class of Diophantine equations. In modern mathematical
language, Diophantine equations can be encoded into a geometric notion, called
algebraic varieties. Then the information of the solution will give rise to an
arithmetic invariant of the corresponding algebraic variety. However, these
algebraic varieties carry other important invariants related to the arithmetic
one via the so-called L-function. It is often possible to transfer information
from different invariants and achieve better understanding of all of them. This
project aims to deepen understanding of fundamental relationships among such
mathematical constructs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theme of this project is
to study L-functions of motives, which are a systematic generalization of
algebraic varieties, via studying various aspects of Shimura varieties and the
method of Arakelov geometry. The L-functions of motives play an important role
in the current research in number theory, automorphic representations, and
arithmetic geometry, as they encode crucial information from all these aspects.
The Langlands Program predicts that motives, like rational elliptic curves, are
linked with automorphic forms through L-functions. This project investigates
five topics: (1) the Bloch-Kato conjecture for motives appearing in the Gan-
Gross-Prasad conjecture; (2) modularity of Hecke actions on special cycles on
Shimura varieties; (3) potential theory on non-Archimedean spaces and its
connection to Arakelov geometry; (4) a higher derivative version of the Rallis
inner product formula over function fields; and (5) nearby cycles for Artin
stacks over general bases.
