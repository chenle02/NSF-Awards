This award provides funds to aid in the purchase of optical microscopy
equipment. The equipment will be located in a central facility where it will be
available to a group of neuroscientists in the Keck Center for Integrative
Neuroscience. The scientists are all interested in various aspects of local
circuit analysis of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). The goal of
their studies is an improved understanding of how small groups of neurons
generate behavior. The instruments requested will be used for combined
anatomical and physiological studies of brain function that include the use of
double or triple labeling techniques. The development of new instrumentation for
optical microscopy and of new methods that permit specific labeling of certain
cells or certain cell constituents has been key to progress in our understanding
of many aspects of cellular and developmental biology. Neuroscience has
benefited greatly from these developments, since they permit the rapid and
reliable identification of particular neurons or groups of neurons in the brain
or at other sites that typically contain many nerve cells or similar morphology.
