This funding provides support for the Principal Investigator to sponsor a visit
for five researchers from Latin America to the Center for Indigenous Languages
of Latin America at the University of Texas. The guests will participate in
activities and a conference focusing on preserving oral indigenous languages.
Activities in this area are regarded by many as essential to prevent the
disappearance of these languages and the knowledge and cultural assets they
embody from the human record. It has been documented that indigenous languages
around the world are disappearing at an alarming rate. The Digital Libraries
Initiative is funding several projects focusing on the capture and retrieval of
audio content and transcripts. Having indigenous linguists present and involved
in centers which are focusing on preservation of indigenous languages using
digital technologies is essential to the overall success of the endeavor.
