This workshop will address the challenges in earthquake hazard mitigation
involving siting and geotechnical systems, and the basic research that is needed
to address these challenges. Emphasis will be given to identifying especially
innovative ideas, or ideas involving high risk/high return which would generally
be considered too risky to receive unqualified peer approval. Approximately 100
participants are expected to attend, with one half being current grantees of the
Siting and Geotechnical Systems Program, while the remainder will be drawn from
academe, industry, national laboratories, distinguished foreign researchers, and
representatives from the funding agencies. The participants will be divided into
groups of approximately 10 people, and each group will address a current
challenge in earthquake hazard mitigation and will be charged with identifying
and recording the steps to be taken to meet this challenge.
