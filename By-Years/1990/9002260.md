Molecular studies of phenotypic evolution within the Californian-endemic,
annual genus Calycadenia are proposed. Unusual and well-resolved patterns of
chromosomal, flavonoid, and morphological evolution among these ca. 12 species
and 30 races or forms make Calycadenia a model system for examining questions of
broad systematic significance. Integrated chloropast DNA and nuclear DNA
restriction site polymorphism analyses are proposed to determine patterns and
relative timing of evolutionary divergence of these taxa and accompanying
phenotypic characters. Issues addressed by this study would include (1) the role
of selection in chromosome evolution, (2) the relationship between evolutionary
divergence and chromosome pairing, (3) the extent of evolutionary parallelism in
complex anatomical features, (4) the possible origin from within Calycadenia of
two highly-distinctive monotypic genera (Osmadenia and Blepharipappus) and their
accompanying suites of unique phenotypic characters, and (5) the taxinomic
validity of a proposed-endangered species, C.fremontii. This study would be
among the first to integrate extensive phylogenetically-informative data from
cytogenetics, phytochemistry, and morphology with evolutionary data from diverse
nucleotide sequences in both chloroplast and nuclear DNA. Preliminary
chloroplast DNA restriction site data revealed an ideal level of interspecific
variation for conducting molecular phylogenetic analysis in this group. //
