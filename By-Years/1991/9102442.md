With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Turecek will investigate the
preparations, stabilities, and dissociations of hypervalent oxonium, ammonium,
and sulfonium radicals that are generated and analyzed via neutralization-
reionization mass spectrometry. In addition, fragmentations of neutral species
will be employed for the structural elucidation of complex organic compounds by
mass spectrometry. %%% Hypervalent radicals represent a class of unstable
species in which the formal valence of an atom exceeds its normal coordination
number in the given oxidation state. Dissociations of small hypervalent radicals
often display deuterium (H-2) and O-18 isotope effects of unusual magnitude; the
nature of these effects is not well understood. Dr. Turecek will study
hypervalent radicals in the gas phase by employing the recently developed
technique of neutralization reionization mass spectrometry. In the gas phase,
hypervalent radicals can undergo exothermic dissociations to afford stable
products. Thus, these species hold promise as a novel method by which mass
spectroscopy can be used for organic structural analysis.
