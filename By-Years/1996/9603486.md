Construction of a detector for use in relativistic heavy ion experiments will
be carried out. The detector will be sited at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The detector, known as PHOBOS, will
provide a first look at the behavior and decay of matter at the extreme energy
densities that will be created in gold-on-gold collisions with energies of
100GeV/nucleon in the center-of-mass system. This work is aimed at
characterizing the hypothesized quark-gluon plasma which is created in such
energetic collisions, and in which quarks and gluons are thought to be
deconfined, unlike the case in normal hadronic matter. Specific elements of the
PHOBOS detector associated with the present activity include the particle
identification system which will permit the different mesons coming from decay
of the quark-gluon plasma to be separately identified, which is important to
characterizing the properties of the plasma. The data gathered by PHOBOS will
extend our knowledge of matter to energies and densities thought to have existed
only in the first microseconds of the early universe. This topic is a high
priority within US nuclear science, as established by the joint NSF/DOE Nuclear
Science Advisory Committee in its 1996 Long Range Plan. Education of students
and postdocs is a strong component of this experimental program.
