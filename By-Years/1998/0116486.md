OIA-0116486&lt;br/&gt;PI: McKinley&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
PI and three colleagues in the Mechanical Engineering Department at MIT request
funding to purchase imaging instrumentation for the renovation of the
Hatsopoulos Microfluids Laboratory. The instrumentation is to be used by the
four faculty members who are associated with this laboratory (a) for the
development and application of diagonostic techniques permitting noninvasive
study of fundamental scientific fluid phenomena at microscale, and (b) to
develop and optimize applications based on understanding of such
phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
