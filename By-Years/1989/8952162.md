This award to Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey at Newark, is made in
response to a proposal submitted to the NSF's Instrumentation and Facilities
Program, a program whose goal is to extend support for undergraduate
instructional equipment. The award will provide one-half of the funds needed to
acquire an X- ray fluorescence spectrometer for elemental analysis of geological
materials. The University is committed to matching the NSF contribution for this
equipment. The instrumentation will be used to enhance the undergraduate geology
curriculum and to give undergraduate students hands-on experience with a modern
analytical instrument.
