This NSF award will provide partial support for the U.S. based participants of
the "Young Geometric Group Theory XI" conference, which will be held in MÃ¼nster,
Germany, February 13-17, 2023. This international conference series is primarily
aimed at graduate students and early career researchers working in geometric
group theory and related areas of mathematics. The aim of the conference is to
expose these researchers to new topics, to provide them with an opportunity to
present their work, and to facilitate collaborations. The meeting includes mini-
courses by established experts, plenary talks by selected early career
researchers, informal discussion sessions, lightning talks by participants, a
poster session, and two panels. The mini-courses are on topics at the forefront
of research in geometric group theory. The panels will focus on professional
development as well as on equity, diversity, and
inclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mini-courses in this conferences are Big
Mapping Class Groups by Federica Fanoni, Cannon-Thurston Maps by Mahan Mj,
Soficity by Andreas Thom, and Incoherence and Quasiconvexity by Genevieve Walsh.
These lectures will present a panoramic overview of some of the important
developments in their field. The plenary presentations will aim to focus on
other recent research and directions to broaden the scope of the workshop, and
to encourage the participants to explore the boundaries of the subject. More
