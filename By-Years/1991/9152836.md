Mankato State University's (MSU) Department of Biological Sciences includes
quantitative training of undergraduates to develop skills necessary for
biologists and environmental scientists in the next decade. A Hewlett Packard
gas chromatograph (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography system (HPLC)
are to be purchased to facilitate instruction in Biology programs, including
Environmental Sciences, Toxicology, and Microbiology, as well as encourage
development of more interdisciplinary undergraduate courses and projects at MSU.
The GC and HPLC are essential tools for the detection and quantification organic
chemicals in a variety of matrices. Laboratory exercises and class projects have
been designed in seven courses to instruct students in the theory, advantages,
limitations, and proper use of each instrument. Course projects will involve use
of these instruments to determine anthropogenic organic compounds in water,
soil/sediments, biological fluids/tissues and air. Instrumental uses will
include measurement of the accumulation of organic compounds in organisms and
associated biomarker enzyme levels, natural products and the transformation of
pesticides. Undergraduate students will also have access to these instruments
for their independent study research projects.
