Abstract EEC-9612323 Lee The polymer industry is one of the major industries of
the U.S. and it continues to grow. Research is a necessary endeavor in order to
maintain the U.S.' position in the global market. This planning meeting is
studying the viability of forming an Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Advance Polymer Engineering at Ohio State University. The proposed
research agenda being studied as possible projects for the Center include 1)
Advanced Liquid Composite Molding; 2) Low Profile Additives and Their
Applications to Composite Processing; 3) Characterization of Low Pressure Sheet
Molding and Bulk Molding Compounds; 4) Analysis of Injection Pultrusion Process;
5) Gas-Assisted Injection Molding; 6) Analysis of Co-Injection Molding Process;
7) Polymer Rheology and its Application to Film/Fiber Processing; 8) Ultrasonic
Molding of Powder Polymers; 9) Extrusion Compounding of Polymer Blends; 10)
Protyping of Mold/Parts by Polymer Fused Deposition Modeling and 11) Design of
Injection Molding Parts/Molds.
