This project upgrade a soil mechanics laboratory, utilizes modern data
acquisition techniques, and constructs a device to demonstrate the flow of
seepage water through earth dams. Goals are to enhance student laboratory
experience and enable students to use modern data acquisition equipment. The use
of modern data acquisition techniques will replace the routine hand reduction of
data after testing is completed with observations of real-time plots of data
during testing. This rapid feedback will enable students to more easily relate
observed behavior with engineering properties derived from test data. Major
equipment acquisitions include transducers to enable electronic acquisition of
data from existing test equipment, two sets of signal conditioning amplifiers,
and two microcomputer-based data acquisition systems to collect, reduce, and
display data during testing. Experiments to be instrumented include unconfined
and triaxial compression, consolidation, and direct shear tests. This project is
significant because it gives students experience with modern data acquisition
techniques and reduces the monotonous hand collection of data during testing,
freeing the students to direct more attention to specimen behavior and
corresponding diagrams of test results during laboratory periods.
