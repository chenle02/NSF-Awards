AST-0307433&lt;br/&gt;Narayan&lt;br/&gt;This research covers a broad theoretical
program of studying hydrodynamic and/or magnetohydrodynamic flows in
astrophysics. Particular projects cover radiatively inefficient flows (such as
advection- or convection-dominated accretion), the role of conduction in setting
up and maintaining thermal equilibrium of the hot gas in galaxy clusters,
computational tools to model interstellar radio scintillation in the transition
regime between weak and strong scattering, and instabilities in the formation of
giant molecular clouds in spiral galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal
investigator will actively strive to involve graduate and undergraduate students
and postdoctoral fellows in the research program, and has a strong record of
past success at this sort of mentoring activity. His group has the right
atmosphere to nurture young and talented scientists.&lt;br/&gt;***
