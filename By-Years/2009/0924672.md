This SBIR Phase II project will provide technology to perform remote nucleic
acid testing (NAT) in any location. The combination of (a) our Probe-Target-
Reporter (PTR) assay which allows the detection of unlabeled Target DNA, (b) our
Parallume optical encoding technology which provides the ability to multiplex a
large number of samples in each assay and (c) an inexpensive, battery-powered
imaging system, based on a $500 commercial CMOS that is completely portable,
will be used to build an autonomous NAT platform. This system will be used to
detect and defend against the imminent invasion of California's citrus crop by
the Liberibacter pathogen and its insect vector/host which causes the 100% fatal
and incurable Citrus Greening disease of citrus. Collaborator Isca Technologies
will provide a "Front End" instrument which can selectively identify an insect
by measuring its wing beat frequency as it flies through a laser curtain. This
selective insect trap will provide a filtered homogenate of primarily the
desired insect vector and pathogen which will be analyzed with our PTR in the
field. The data will be relayed to a central database which can provide a real
time assessment of the location and bacterial load of the insect vector.

The Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) technology under development as part of this
project represents a substantial advance in the ability to perform assays
outside of the traditional laboratory or clinical setting. This technology can
be used to detect Target DNA sequences without the need to chemically label the
sample thereby allowing the NAT analysis to be performed in any location. This
NAT technology can be combined with our Parallume optical encoding technology
which allows many sample to be measured simultaneously. The ability to analyze
many DNA simultaneously without access to a laboratory on a completely portable
system will allow NAT to be performed in Low Resource Settings or for
Agricultural applications around the world.
