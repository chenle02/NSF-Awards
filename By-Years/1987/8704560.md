In this project researchers at a small minority university in Puerto Rico will
develop methodology to conduct larger scale research in the future on Dominican
migrants in Puerto Rico. This pilot project will gather basic ethnographic
information on the Dominican community in Santurce, Puerto Rico. Specifically
the project will assess the impact of Dominican migrants on the local labor
market. The researcher will estimate the size, composition, and location of the
Dominican population, and survey this population's economic activities. The
methods used will be a questionnaire administrated to about 250 Dominican
households in five neighborhoods, and in-depth interviews with about twenty
Dominican families. In addition to the principal investigator, three other
social science faculty at the University of the Sacred Heart will be involved in
the project as well as ten students. This research is important because
undocumented aliens are of major interest in the United States as well as other
nations, and increased understanding of one alien group's adaptation to a host
country can help illuminate the conditions of other aliens in similar
situations.
