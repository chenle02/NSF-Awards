This proposal will investigate a general framework for signal recovery problems,
combining set-theoretic and optimization techniques for use with incomplete
measurement data and partial constraints. Computationally attractive algorithms
and performance bounds will be developed and assessed, with the results applied
to inverse problems of practical interest.
