ABSTRACT DMS-9707022 The Twenty-first Summer Real Analysis Symposium will be
held on the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga campus June 18-21, 1997. The
chairperson for the meeting will be Harry Miller, Head of the UTC Mathematics
Department. Professors Ali Alikhani, Paul Humke and Clifford Weil will serve on
the organizing committee. It is anticipated that new results will be presented
from the fields of one dimensional dynamics, generalized derivatives and
integration theory. As in the past the symposium will continue to establish
links to different but related areas of analysis such as harmonic analysis,
measure theory and analytic set theory. This conference will act as a staging
area for future joint research projects and will assist graduate students (it is
anticipated that several will attend) and junior faculty along their career
paths. The Summer Real Analysis Symposium that will take place on the campus of
the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga on June 18-21,1997 has multiple
objectives. The participants of the Symposium will run the spectrum from
graduate students, to untenured young professors to established stars in the
field of real analysis. This mix, with three of the four invited principal
speakers being young mathematicians, who already have very fine track records,
should be very stimulating for all the participants. These symposia have been
successful in generating both collaborative and independent research activity.
The Chattanooga symposium will be attended by a number of mathematicians from
Canada and Europe.
