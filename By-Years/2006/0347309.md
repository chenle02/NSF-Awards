Guided by an overarching ecological model, this research will employ
a&lt;br/&gt;longitudinal design to study students' transitions from high school
to post-secondary education or work. The students selected are from two small
cities with high ethnic minority populations. Three interconnected topics will
be examined: (1) the social negotiations of educational and career aspirations
including how the students' science and technology aspirations develop over time
and across social contexts; (2) the nature of effective mentoring strategies,
including ways students and teachers can optimize&lt;br/&gt;students' access to
mentors; and (3) patterns of science and technology learning and motivation
across contexts. Quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to analyze
surveys, interviews, and observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education plan
features having undergraduate students, including pre-service teachers, enrolled
in the PI's community-based educational psychology courses, collaborate with
youth in the two urban neighborhoods on teaching and learning activities while
jointly conducting field-based educational research. Undergraduates will also
conduct research with the PI, during the year and in the summer, and contribute
to dissemination efforts.&lt;br/&gt;
