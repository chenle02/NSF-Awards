The objective of this research is to develop new algorithmic techniques to
compute efficiently near optimal solutions to a number of NP-hard graph problems
arising in network-design. A partial list of problems studied include: (a)
problems in Euclidean setting including the traveling salesman problem; (b)
designing low-congestion networks for multicommodity flow; (c) computing
broadcast-trees for fast dissemination of information in networks; (d) finding
low-cost networks of specified connectivity. The goal is to develop algorithms
which not only generate good solutions, but are also practically feasible.
Algorithms developed are both implemented and tested.
