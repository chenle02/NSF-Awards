The proposed research concerns a number of experimental approaches designed to
address the question of how the primary sequence of a protein influences
spontaneous folding and stability. The investigations will initially involve
variants of a protein, bacteriophage lysozyme. Two other bacteriophage proteins
will eventually replace the lysozyme as the paradigm of protein folding. Several
single- and multiple-site mutants of bacteriophage lysozyme will be selected
from a group of existing variants and will be employed in studies of their
thermodynamic stability. The types of mutants which will be used include those
which, compared to the wild type protein, exhibit altered: (1) sensitivity to
thermal inactivation, (2) numbers of charged residues, and (3) cysteine residues
capable of forming disulfide bridges. An attempt will be made to experimentally
determine electrostatic contributions to protein stability as a function of
sequence. Proteins containing genetically-engineered disulfide bridges will be
studied to determine the nature of the stability change introduced and also to
obtain the free energy of bridge formation for each as a function of pH and
temperature. From the latter and the free energy of denaturation of the bridged
and un-bridged proteins, a thermodynamic cycle will be constructed. This will
permit independent determination of how the free energy of the native and the
denatured states are modified.
