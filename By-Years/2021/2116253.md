This project would develop and validate a method for genomic analyses of
individual extracellular elements in the ocean utilizing a technique call
environment micro-compartment genomics (EMCG). Extracellular genetic elements
play major roles in marine microbiology and ecology. If successful, this
technique will become a part of the services available to the global research
community through the Bigelow Laboratory Single Cell Genomics Center (SCGC),
ensuring the sustainable continuation of this technology investment. This
project will also contribute to workforce development, by supporting the
recruitment and training of a research associate, an undergraduate student and
courses for students and scientists on Microbial Single Cell Genomics
Bioinformatics and Aquatic Flow Cytometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose
to develop and validate a robust, quantitative method for genomic analyses of
individual extracellular elements in the ocean utilizing a microcapsule
technique which we call environment micro-compartment genomics (EMCG).
Extracellular genetic elements play major roles in marine microbiology and
ecology. The influence of each type of extracellular DNA particle on marine
ecosystems is not equal and remains poorly constrained. Currently, there is no
established method to link quantitative observations of the extracellular DNA
with their genetic content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
