This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, "Curriculum
Initiative in Nanotechnology for Undergraduate Students," at New Mexico State
University under the direction of Dr. Joe Cecil, is jointly funded by the
Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC)and the Division of Civil and
Mechanical Systems (CMS) in the Directorate for Engineering (EEC) and the
Division of Chemistry (CHE) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences (MPS). This project focuses on the development of course and laboratory
modules related to the study of nanotechnologies and systems. An
interdisciplinary project team involving faculty and researchers from
industrial/manufacturing engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry, and
mathematics will be involved in this initiative. They include New Mexical State
University, Dona Ana Branch Community College, Xomics USA, NIST, Sandia National
Lab, and Monterrey Tech ITESM Monterrey, Mexico..
