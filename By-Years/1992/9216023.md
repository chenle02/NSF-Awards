Abstract for Demetre Economou / University of Houston / CTS-9216023 A combined
modeling and experimental program is proposed to improve the understanding of
plasma processes such as plasma etching and plasma deposition of thin films, and
to aid in the development of new plasma reactors. The work proposed here
represents an extension and continuation of previous work. The argon/chlorine
plasma system will be investigated. Two kinds of glow discharge models will be
considered viz. an overall glow discharge model and a simpler two-region model.
Solutions of the time-dependent Boltzmann equation will be sought to obtain
information on electron transport and reaction coefficients; these results will
be integrated with results for neutral transport and neutral reaction. Model
predictions will be compared to experiment. Spatially resolved optical emission
spectroscopy, laser interferometry, and Langmuir probe measurements together
with mass spectrometric measurements and ion flux and energy analysis will be
carried out. The model will be applied to three kinds of reactor configurations
viz. parallel plate reactors, electrodeless plasmas and the source region of ECR
reactors. Silicon and GaAs will be used as substrates for etching studies.
