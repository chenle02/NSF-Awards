9306443 Agnew This award provides operations and maintenance support for the
Pinon Flat Observatory operated by the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary
Physics at the University of California, San Diego. The observatory operates a
system of its own crustal strain meters and tiltmeters and also provides the
infrastructure necessary for the geophysics research community's development,
testing, and evaluation of geophysical instruments such as seismic sensors,
water vapor radiometers, and Global Positioning System receivers. ***
