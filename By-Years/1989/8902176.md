This project is to organize and convene an international Workshop on "Concrete
Shear in Earthquakes" at the University of Houston. In the last decade, there
has been considerable differences in design and theory concerning seismic shear
failure among international research communities. The purpose of the workshop is
to assess the recent advances made in the subject, to evaluate the state-of-the-
art research in reinforced concrete structural design for earthquake, to define
the problems involved and to examine the prospect of utilizing the membrane
shear ductility in reinforced concrete structures. The workshop is expected to
advance the earthquake design through cross fertilization of two areas involved,
e.g., concrete and earthquake design, and to identify future research in these
areas.
