Massive stars are born in clusters within giant molecular clouds, regions which
contain substantial concentrations of interstellar gas and dust. This cloud
material is gravitationally accreting onto the growing stellar embryo, as well
as being modified by the radiation and wind of the newly forming luminous hot
stars and nearby cluster constituents. The stars are often hidden from view
behind extensive local and line of sight dust absorption. This research is
utilizing infra-red wavelengths to study these hot stars from the time their
ionization of the local birth environment first makes itself known until the
time when the remnant dusty natal material has been fully shed. A radio selected
sample of giant molecular cloud regions is the source for the identification,
classification, and analysis of their stellar members with near infrared
photometry, infrared spectroscopy, and other measures of dust emission in the
mid IR and the radio wavelengths. The overall thrust of the project is to
investigate massive star birth during the initial stages of evolution. It will
have an impact on birth processes going on in our Galaxy and in nearby and more
distant starburst galaxies, and will help us understand the initial stages of
massive star formation during the very early history of the Universe.
