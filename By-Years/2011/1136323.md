The project is building the capacity in the greater Philadelphia area to
strengthen all aspects of the STEM teacher pipeline. Seven regional colleges and
universities that currently hold Noyce grants, Bryn Mawr College, Haverford
College, Drexel University, La Salle University, University of Pennsylvania,
Saint Joseph's University and Temple University, are partnering with the
Philadelphia Education Fund to create the Philadelphia Regional Noyce (PRN)
Partnership. The institutions in the partnership represent a broad array of
Noyce programs impacting undergraduates, career-changers, post-baccalaureate
students, and Master Teachers. With this range of Noyce programs, the
partnership has the critical mass necessary to successfully develop a model
demonstrating how multiple Noyce programs in the same geographical region work
together to add value to what their individual programs offer. The intellectual
merit of this project lies in understanding what initiatives lead to robust and
productive synergies. The project has the potential for broad national impact as
a model that could be adapted by other STEM teacher preparation consortia around
the country. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PRN Partnership is developing Asset
Mapping and Needs Assessment of the region's STEM teacher preparation programs,
is using these data in a year-long planning process, and is pilot testing a
variety of initiatives that bring together the partners' Noyce educators,
representing all stages of the STEM teacher continuum, to learn from one another
in a community of practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of the
partnership is inspired by theories of social network analysis which suggest
that positive and unexpected synergies will occur and social capital will
increase when trusted relationships are built between previously unconnected
individuals and organizations.
