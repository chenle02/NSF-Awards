This research is to utilize the polarization direction of short period P waves
to investigate lateral heterogeneities in the lithosphere. Recent measurements
of the polarization direction have shown that stable results can be obtained
with a precision of about 5 degrees, and that these directions are sometimes
systematically different from ray theoretical predictions based on a laterally
homogeneous compressional velocity structure. Lateral heterogeneities mapped by
means of the polarization direction anomalies have the potential to delineate
velocity anomalies associated with active fault zones. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
