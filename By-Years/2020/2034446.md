The research project is aimed at understanding how the N-protein of the SARS-
CoV-2 performs its essential functions in viral infection and transmission.
Elucidating the structure and properties of N-protein can open novel avenues of
drug design to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and add new tools to the repertoire
of anti-viral therapeutic strategies. The broader impact plan is to inform and
educate the younger generation about the science of virus transmission and
prevention using social media activities such as Skype a Scientist and TikTok
videos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The viral genome nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N
plays critical roles in multiple processes of the infection cycle: N-protein
protects and packages viral RNA in nucleocapsid assembly, interacts with the
inner domain of spike protein in virion assembly, binds to structural membrane
protein M during virion packaging and maturation, and binds to proteases causing
replication of infective virus particles. The goals of the project are to
determine the structure and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 N protein using high
resolution techniques such as NMR, identify structural features of viral
packaging using protein:RNA cross linking and bioinformatic analyses, and
determine the effect of phosphorylation of N on its structure, its interactions
with other proteins and its role as an RNA chaperone. This comprehensive
approach to N-protein structure-function will enable development of innovative
methods to block SARS-CoV-2 at different stages of its life
cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER award is made by the Genetic Mechanisms
Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, using funds from
the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES)
Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
