The awardee has developed a novel method of typing supernovae in distant
galaxies that does not require spectroscopic information. Support is provided to
further refine and extend this method in collaboration with Hamilton College
students. Supernovae are used as standard candles in cosmology and were crucial
to the discovery of dark energy. The supported work will help define future
space missions to further explore dark energy and its cosmological implications.

Broader impacts of this work include research training for an undergraduate
student, and outreach via public talks, visits to local schools and community
centers, and holding "Open Nights" at the local observatory.
