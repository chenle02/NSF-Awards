9622062 Berele This award supports the research of Professor A. Berele to work
in non-commutative ring theory with special emphasis on problems arising from
generalizations of the theory of cocharacter sequences that arise in the study
of p.i. algebras. In particular, he wants to study cocharacter sequences that
arise from Hopf algebra actions. This is research in the subfield of algebra
called non-commutative ring theory. Algebra can be though of as the study of
symmetry in the abstract. As such, algebra has direct applications to areas of
physics and chemistry. In fact, much of non-commutative ring theory generalizes
structures found in Quantum Mechanics and this proposal continues to explore
areas that connect directly with modern quantum field theory. There are also
connections to problems in many other areas of mathematics such as invariant
theory.
