Travel funds are provided for young American scientists including three
minority students to attend a "Symposium on Comparative Pharmacology of
Neuropeptides" in Konstanz, West Germany. The meeting involves approximately 100
participants. The invited lecturers represent the best scientists in their
respective fields. The program covers a wide range of topics encompassing
comparative neuropharmacological research across several disciplines and
evolutionary lines. The emphasis is on utilizing invertebrate model systems to
elucidate the properties of neuropeptides since many fundamental molecular
mechanisms are shared across diverse species. The major goal is to promote
active interchanges between scientists working in mammalian and in invertebrate
systems. The proceeding of the meetings which will be published have direct
relevance to basic neuroscience, psychiatry, neurology, pharmacology of drug
abuse and neurobiology of aging.
