The Campus Champions foster a dynamic and connected community of advanced
research computing professionals that promote leading practices at the frontiers
of research, scholarship, teaching, and industry application. Over the past 14
years, the Campus Champions program has grown to over 784 Champions at over 350
research institutions. As NSF's advanced cyberinfrastructure coordination
ecosystem of services and support (ACCESS-CI.org) continues to expand, Campus
Champions serve vital collaborative roles improving democratization of the
ecosystem by reaching prospective users from communities who have are new to
ecosystem capabilities and user support services.

Two-hour community events will be conducted at Supercomputing23 and PEARC23 with
dual purposes. First, Campus Champions will reflect on how to contribute and
sustain activities in the ACCESS era. Second, existing, new and prospective
Champions will tailor the program toward broader audiences. This will avail new
and existing Campus Champions opportunities to connect in person and with the
community, through discussion and social interaction. These events will enable
bi-directional learning between the Campus Champions and the ACCESS program
resources and outreach plans. People who are not Champions will be introduced to
the community and learn practices to best support researchers at their
institutions (if they support infrastructure) or to best utilize infrastructure
(if they support researchers). Five candidates to receive travel funds to
support participation in the events will be selected from under-resourced,
non-R1 institutions based on their new (within the last 5 years) roles as non-
traditional users or from an underrepresented category of Campus Champions.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
