&lt;br/&gt;Abstract for DMS - 0104363&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators'
research focuses on establishing sharp geometric&lt;br/&gt;inequalities that are
invariant under linear or affine transformations&lt;br/&gt;and using them to
obtain new analytic inequalities. Since an affine&lt;br/&gt;structure contains
no notion of distance or angle, one might think that&lt;br/&gt;there is little
to say or do. In fact, there is a rich and deep theory&lt;br/&gt;that already
encompasses many of the most important aspects of Euclidean&lt;br/&gt;geometry,
including the sharp isoperimetric and Sobolev inequalities.&lt;br/&gt;Most of
the investigators' efforts will be devoted to developing
and&lt;br/&gt;understanding the Brunn-Minkowski theory and its
generalizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators' work
involves some of the most fundamental objects in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics: bodies
in and functions of ordinary Euclidean space. These&lt;br/&gt;are used to
represent real objects and phenomena in science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering.
Although it is impossible to predict the future impact of&lt;br/&gt;this work,
the investigators believe that the concepts and techniques&lt;br/&gt;developed
in this project could prove to be useful in fields ranging from&lt;br/&gt;pure
mathematical areas such as differential geometry, partial
differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, and Banach spaces to more applied areas such
as robot vision,&lt;br/&gt;information theory, and stereology.&lt;br/&gt;
