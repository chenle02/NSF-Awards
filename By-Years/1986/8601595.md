The project deals with a fundamental study of crosslinking polymers at gel
point, i.e. at the transition from liquid to solid state. A simple physical
relationship has been developed which involves a single material parameter,
strength, which is able to describe limited visco-elastic phenomena at visco-
elastic transition (VET). This research aims to establish the validity over the
entire frequency range. Experimental work would involve the use of a range of
polymeric materials and physical characterization techniques.
