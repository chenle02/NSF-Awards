Motion planning is fundamental problem that need to be solved for a robot to
move from one location to another. This problem arises in many domains such as
self-driving cars and automated assembly. Motion planning algorithms typically
sample configurations of the robot to build a map of the space of robot
configurations. As more computational power becomes available, samples can be
placed more quickly, building a better map, but at tremendous cost in memory.

This project explores the problem of finding low-memory approximate maps that
allow rapid and accurate motion planning. Methods include mathematical analysis
of algorithms, and experiments applying algorithms in simulation. Expected
results include new algorithms that allow generation of configuration space maps
that require orders of magnitude less space than existing representations.
Expected results also include algorithms for motion planning that make use of
these maps, and formal guarantees about quality of motion plans and
computational costs of generating maps and plans. These results are expected to
advance the understanding of fundamental theoretical characteristics of motion
planning. These results will also have direct practical impact in application
areas, including automated manufacturing and self-driving vehicles, by allowing
vastly greater computational power to be leveraged to generate maps that can be
stored efficiently and transmitted quickly across a network. Results will be
disseminated on new motion planning web pages devoted to the project, in
international robotics journals, and at international robotics conferences.
Anticipated broader impacts of the work include training of the next generation
of scientists and engineers at both the undergraduate and graduate level.
