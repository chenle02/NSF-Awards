How the visual properties of an object or scene affect human visual perception
is a fundamental question in cognitive science. The proposed research is
concerned with the visual properties of surfaces, which can reveal many
characteristics important to decision-making, such as the identity of a
substance, the cleanliness of an item, or the authenticity of a photograph.
Humans make these judgments by analyzing the light reflected from surface
materials. The proposed research examines how this is accomplished. Shiny
materials like polished metal, gloss paint, smooth plastic, and varnished wood
yield bright reflections of the light sources that illuminate them. Humans are
quite adept at distinguishing those reflections from other causes of bright
spots, such as white matte paint. Reflections are view dependent, meaning that
their apparent position on the surface changes depending on the location of the
viewing eye. Because of this view dependence, the reflection usually appears to
lie beneath the surface. The proposed research will examine how the apparent
position of reflections affects human judgments of material. The investigators
will conduct theoretical work on the properties of reflections from many types
of materials and experimental work on how well humans are able to use these
properties to identify material. The investigators will also develop new
computer graphics algorithms and a new display technique to allow realistic
presentation of reflections from realistic materials.

The work will contribute significantly to basic science and to several
applications. One important application concerns how industry describes the
visual properties of materials. Currently, manufacturers of paint, plastics, and
furniture use one-dimensional scales of appearance, such as gloss, and
inexpensive appearance measurement devices, such as glossmeters, to categorize
finishes by "gloss level." Very different materials can have the same gloss
level even though they produce very different reflections. The investigators
will determine whether materials with the same gloss level actually look the
same. The results could affect the way industry measures and assesses material.
Another important application concerns how people distinguish between computer-
generated and real images. This has important implications, not only for the
motion picture and computer graphics industries, but also for forensic sciences.
The principal investigator, in collaboration with an expert in digital
forensics, will explore whether the pattern of light dispersal from human skin
in computer-generated and real people, and the associated parallax properties,
can aid in distinguishing fake from real images.
