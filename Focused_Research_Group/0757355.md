The investigators in this FRG project develop and study the theory of objective
structures. By definition, these are structures composed of identical molecules
having the property that corresponding atoms in each molecule see precisely the
same environment up to an orthogonal transformation. Objective structures
generalize classical crystal structures, and include many of the most intensely
studied structures in science today, including carbon nanotubes, buckyballs,
viral capsids and other parts (necks, tails, baseplates), many common proteins,
bilayers, and many other nanostructures now being synthesized, especially via
the process of self-assembly. The investigators exploit the symmetries of these
structures to develop computational numerical methods for molecular dynamics, a
mathematical theory for the self-assembly of objective structures, a
quasicontinuum numerical method for defective objective structures, and simpler
first-principles calculations of the energy of these structures.

Nanostructures are becoming increasingly important in a variety of scientific
and technological applications. Objective structures are the building blocks of
nanostructures, both organic and inorganic. A comprehensive and unified
mathematical treatment of such structures has the potential to lead to the
discovery of new structures with unusual forms of ferromagnetism and
ferroelectricity and unexpected transport properties. The detailed investigation
of the self-assembly of objective structures can lead to new methods of
synthesis of such structures, especially methods that produce nanostructures of
desired dimensions and molecular arrangement. These, in turn, could lead to new
strategies to combat viral infections, and new methods for the templated growth
of particular nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes. The quasicontinuum
mathematical methods deliver a general strategy for the systematic investigation
of the process of nucleation and growth of defects in nanostructures. These
methods are expected to give a systematic new tool for the discovery of
exceptionally strong molecular structures.
