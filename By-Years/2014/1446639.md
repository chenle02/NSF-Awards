The project funds the organization of a workshop on "Airborne Networking and
Communications". The workshop, colocated with the ACM MobiHoc Symposium, will be
held on August 11, 2014, in Philadelphia. The workshop will be the third in a
series that started in 2012. Airborne Networking is an emerging area of cyber
physical systems - and issues of control, processing, and networking lie at the
heart of this field. It is important to build a foundational science to support
this area as unmanned vehicles become more prevalent. The workshop brings top
researchers in area together to help develop a research agenda and continue to
further the field. In addition, strong outreach to undergraduate students for
participation is a key component of the NSF funding.
