This conference brings together many of the world's leading scholars in
operator theory and its applications so that they may exchange their latest
results and explore new avenues of research and application. It is more
ambitious than the usual one week conference both in its mathematical scope and
world attendance. Sessions are anticipated on such topics as operator theory,
functional analysis, approximation of operator functions, systems and control,
signal processing, parallel processing, and numerical methods. The conference
will highlight the infuence of Professor I. Gohberg in the development of these
topics in honor of his sixtieth birthday. Operator Theory is an area of
mathematics with ever increasing applications outside of mathematics proper,
including those to transport theory, control theory, and signal processing.
