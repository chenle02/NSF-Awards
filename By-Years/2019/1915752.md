This award provides funding for participation in the conference "Operator
Algebras in the Twenty-first Century" held March 30-31, 2019 at the Department
of Mathematics, University of Pennsylvania. The conference focuses on recent
developments in analysis, especially in the field of operator algebras and its
applications in physics. The conference aims to facilitate both the growth of
the operator algebras field per se, as well as to inform non-specialists of the
power of these methods for addressing questions outside of this field. Several
distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.
This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups,
and researchers without other sources of funding an opportunity to attend and
participate in this conference.

Operator algebras provide a powerful perspective on problems throughout
mathematics. This meeting will review some of the many accomplishments in this
field, especially as related to the work of Richard V. Kadison, and their
relationships to problems of current interest in mathematics and mathematical
physics. Topics include: relations with topological quantum field theory,
advances in condensed matter physics, the Kadison-Singer conjecture, and
elaboration of the non-commutative geometry paradigm, which places operator
algebras at the center of problems in fields from geometry, to mathematical
physics, to analytic number theory and beyond. More information is available at
the conference web site https://www.math.upenn.edu/~deturck/kadison-

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
