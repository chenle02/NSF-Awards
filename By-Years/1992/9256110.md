The Research Foundation of the State University of New York seeks to initiate
an eight-week summer commuter Young Scholars Program for 16 students entering
the twelfth grade. The Program will provide hands-on research experiences in the
biological sciences during the summer with follow-up activities during the
academic year. Students will work closely with a faculty mentor on a research
project and share the experiences in weekly seminars and with their classmates
during the academic year. Seminars on careers and field trips to industrial
setting are integral parts of the program.
