This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Mary Rakowski-DuBois, Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry, University of Colorado and Daniel DuBois, National Renewable
Energy Laboratory. The project plans to explore cooperative effects in reactions
with molecular hydrogen and determine quantitative thermodynamic data for metal-
centered proton and hydride donor/acceptor sites. This thermodynamic data will
be used to design new electrocatalysts for hydrogen oxidation/proton reduction
and for alcohol oxidation/aldehyde reduction. These electrocatalysts have
potential application in new economical fuel cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
activation of molecular hydrogen is key to many industrial catalytic processes.
The thermodynamic data from this project will be useful to the design of the
next generation of catalysts. This project also continues a strong collaboration
between the University of Colorado and NREL, providing a unique perspective for
students and allowing access to research techniques and equipment. &lt;br/&gt;
