On June 15-18, 2005, the University of Massachusetts will host the Sixth
Graduate Students Research Conference sponsored by the American Chemical Society
Polymer Division. The principal goal of this conference is to enhance
interaction for graduate students working in chemical sciences with specific
interest in polymers. The Polymer Science and Engineering Department will
organize this conference along with several senior members of the American
polymer community. Significantly, this is the only conference with principal
emphasis devoted to graduate students. IT is important they interact with each
other as emerging professionals. Research accomplishments will be presented both
orally and at poster sessions. Discussions in various topics of emerging fields
of study will be held by several leading researchers in the polymer community.
In addition, the students will have the opportunity to meet leaders of the
polymer industry on an informal basis. It is anticipated that 150 students will
attend. The University of Massachusetts seeks funding in support of this
conference from the National Science Foundation.
