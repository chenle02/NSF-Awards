*** 9661722 Giancola This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I is
directed at developers working with high performance parallel computers. The
primary commercial application codes for these computers are thus tools for
software development. To date, these tools have not been designed with an eye to
the requirements of the high performance computing user, but rather have been
ported from workstations, where their targets are much more limited in scale.
The most important of these tools, and to date the most inadequate, are the
symbolic debuggers. Experience in the supercomputer development environment on
both CTSS and UNICOS has shown that the most essential feature for an effective
debugger to have in addition to the standard ones of process control and
variable evaluation is the ability to save the target's state for later
restoration. Macro processing is another required capability; it allows the user
to record complex sequences of debugging commands for easy reuse. Also essential
is acceptance of an incomplete set of symbol table information to enable the
maximum possible function on optimized code. This project will develop software
technology for debuggers which it is believed no such debugger for high
performance parallel computing environment exists. This technology will be
marketed to one or more parallel computer hardware vendors for incorporation
into proprietary debuggers for bundled and unbundled sale with systems and to
retain the rights to market a workstation version. ***
