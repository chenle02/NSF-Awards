This funding renews a long-running and highly-successful CISE Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at DePauw University. The site exposes
students to a range of topics in Computer Science, including pen-based
computing, computer-supported cooperative work, assistive technology, natural
language processing, functional programming languages, wireless sensor networks,
programming pedagogy, parallel programming, and virtual reality. Students will
work in small teams with a mentor and will experience conducting research as
part of a team, disseminating research results, and participating in a community
of scholars.

This REU site will allow 24 students (over three years) to experience research
in a variety of areas in Computer Science. The site focuses on recruiting
students from undergraduate-only institutions, who do not have as ready access
to research opportunities as students at research universities. The site?s
primary objective is to encourage talented students enrolled at undergraduate
institutions to pursue graduate studies and research careers in Computer
Science.
