The geomagnetic intensity is probably the least well known parameter of the
paleomagnetic field, prior to the appearance of baked archeological artifacts
about 10 ka B.P. (ka = thousand years; B.P. = before present). This award
supports studies of the paleomagnetic intensities and secular variation during
the past 90 millennia, recorded in more than 50 dated lavas of the Massif
Central, Auvergne, France, and similar studies of dated flows from Italy, whose
ages extend to about 130 ka B.P. The study will contribute to the vector
description of the late Quaternary geomagnetic field, extending significantly
the archeomagnetic record of paleomagnetic intensities an directions in southern
Europe to about 130 ka B.P. Such data are needed for a more complete description
of the field and for a more thorough understanding of the geodynamo processes
responsible for its existence.
