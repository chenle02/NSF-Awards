This is an experimental and theoretical investigation of the structure and
extinction behavior of gaseous diffusion flames at low stretch rates. The low-
stretch condition is created by bottom-burning of a fuel mixture discharged from
a porous axisymmetric burner of very large radius. Fuels studied include
methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide/hydrogen, and carbon monoxide/methane.
Spatially resolved species, temperature, and velocity profiles are measured with
laser diagnostics. Flame radiation and burner-surface radiation are also
examined. Corresponding theoretical models are developed incorporating a
narrowband radiation model. The study consists of five elements: (1)
experimental determination of the flammability limit boundaries as functions of
stretch rate and the amount of fuel dilution with emphasis on the radiation-
induced extinction; (2) experimental exploration for the existence of
"flamelets"; (3) experimental mapping of flame structure including hydrodynamic,
thermal, and species profiles and radiation intensities from the flame and
burner surface; (4) detailed modeling of low-stretch diffusion with detailed
chemistry, transport properties, and flame/surface radiation; and (5)
development of detailed radiation models including flame-surface interaction in
a spectral manner and reevaluation of mean band parameters.
