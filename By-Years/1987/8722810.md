The project will determine isotopic compositions and The project will determine
isotopic compositions and concentrations of rare gases (Argon, Helium and Neon)
and Volatiles (Hydrogen, Carbon, etc) in phenocrysts and glassy basalts from the
Lau basin, Mariana Trough, Lohihi Seamount, Manus basin N. Fiji Basin and other
areas. The results of this study are expected to answer several important
questions about petrogenesis of basalt in backarc basins and mantle chemistry.
