The goal of the project is to advance understanding of basic questions about
learning and teaching through the development of a theory of embodied
mathematical cognition that can apply to a broad range of people, settings and
activities. The investigative team brings together expertise from a range of
quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. A theory of embodied
mathematical cognition empirically rooted in classroom learning and workplace
practices will broaden the range of activities and emerging technologies that
count as mathematical, and help educators to envision alternative forms of
bodily engagement with mathematical problems.
