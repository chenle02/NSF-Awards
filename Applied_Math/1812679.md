The investigator, his collaborators, and his students seek to develop
mathematical models for how to optimally buy or sell a given quantity of stocks
over a short time interval. The project's novelty lies in the fact that both
mathematics and equilibrium theory from the economics literature will be used to
develop models which: (i) endogenize stock price dynamics as model output, and
(ii) can deal with Big Data issues such as the very frequent arrival of massive
amounts of new relevant data points. Currently, all trade execution models used
by both practitioners and academics are not based on the sound and long standing
economic principle which says that the stock price should be determined by
equating stock demand with available stock supply. The goal is to build
mathematically tractable models based on equilibrium theory which can deal with
several Big Data issues.

From a rigorous mathematical perspective, the investigator first seeks to prove
existence of equilibria in continuous-time execution models governed by Brownian
motions and more generally governed by Levy processes. Subsequently, the
investigator seeks to investigate uniqueness and stability of these models. It
is suspected that uniqueness fails which implies a refinement need: How to
optimally choose an equilibrium? This optimization produces a new class of
problems in mathematical finance related to the theory of calculus of variations
from analysis. Furthermore, the equilibrium models are carefully designed such
that while being mathematically tractable, the models can deal with many of the
practical issues Big Data represent. The main Big Data issue to be addressed is
the continuous arrival of new relevant data which forces the model
implementation to be as an online algorithm.
