9725238 Beroza This research involves the development of an automated technique
for obtaining very precise relative earthquake locations. Observational errors
will be reduced by measuring relative P and S wave arrival times using waveform
cross correlation. The improved measurements will be used as input to a joint
hypocentral determination. The key challenge will be to automate this process so
that it can be widely applied. The method will be used to study fault mechanics
and the structure of active fault systems as expressed by microearthquake
seismicity. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program. ***
