This project establishes a state-of-the-art Metrology Data Center. This data
center enables students in the Quality Engineering Technology program to learn
efficient methods of collecting plant process and quality data and learn to use
effective means of turning that mass of data into useful information for
manufacturing decision making. The data center serves as a model of how plant
quality labs can serve to assist companies rise to world class competitors. The
primary piece of equipment is a coordinate measurement machine (CMM), which
serves three departments; Quality Engineering, Computer-Aided Manufacturing
(CAM), and Mechanical (CAD). The CMM provides the basis for "reverse
engineering" capability for the CAD program and precision measurement capability
for the Quality and CAM programs.
