This award will fund young participants at the Second Duke Mathematical
Journal/International Mathematics Research Notices (DMJ/IMRN) Conference, which
will take place at Duke University on April 27 to 29, 2001. For the purposes of
this Conference, a young mathematician is one who is just about to graduate or
is up to seven years beyond the doctorate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Conference
will focus on areas covered by the two journals. The eight speakers will be
internationally renowned younger mathematicians. The goal of the Conference is
to bring together young mathematicians to help them learn about recent major
developments in areas near their own, and also to help broaden their interests
and perspective (which should be important in their development as
mathematicians).&lt;br/&gt;
