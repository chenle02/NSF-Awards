9310484 Popper This U.S.-Russian Workshop on Comparative Sensory Biology is
organized by dr. Arthur N. Popper of the University of Maryland, College Park
and Dr. Mikhail A. Ostrovsky of the Institute of Chemical Physics of the Russian
Academy of Sciences and professor at Moscow State University. In past years, it
has become apparent that different animal species have evolved the ability to
extract a good deal of sensory information within their environment. While some
of these senses, such as vision and hearing, are similar in aquatic and
terrestrial animals, many aquatic animals have evolved special techniques for
extracting and processing information. In addition to the more "traditional"
senses, the lateral line and electroreception are found uniquely in aquatic
species. To date, there has been only a single international meeting on sensory
systems of aquatic animals and one on comparative sensory systems, in 1987. Due
to the political climate, no Russians were included in the meeting. Only a few
Russians were included in a more general 1982 meeting. At the same time, there
has been very active research in Russia in various areas of comparative sensory
biology and evolution of sensory systems. Thus, this workshop will enable U.S.
and Russian scientist to benefit from the interchange of ideas and from
potential bilateral collaborations. The workshop topics will be limited to three
sensory systems: electroreception, mechanoreception (hearing and the lateral
line), and vision. This research in zoology fulfills the program objectives of
advancing science by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
