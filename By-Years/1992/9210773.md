The eventual goal of this project is to develop a theory of discourse
representation for generating narrative texts. A discourse representation for
text generation (in contrast to understanding) must not only account for
phenomena such as anaphoric reference and rhetorical relations among
constituents, it must also address the problem of how the text is constructed
from an underlying semantic representation. Furthermore, the representation
should account for textual variation and constrain the decision making of the
text planner. An essential aspect of the project will be to implement the theory
in a generation system. Implementing not only strengthens the theory, since it
must address a wider range of problems more concretely, but also provides a
means of evaluating the results. Evaluation in the context of text generation
can be done relatively easily, since the output is English text, which can be
read and easily judged by people outside the project.
