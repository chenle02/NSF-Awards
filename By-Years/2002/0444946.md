This research focuses on Lycopersicon - the species group that includes the
domesticated tomato - to identify the genetic basis of hybrid pollen and seed
sterility, two of the strongest reproductive isolating barriers among species in
the Solanaceae, the tomato family. Using comparative genomic trait mapping
between five different Lycopersicon species, in combination with classical
genetics and phenotyping, the research will: 1) identify the number, individual
effect, and location within the genome, of genetic regions that cause pollen and
seed sterility among species; 2) determine the phenotypic consequences of
interactions among these different genetic regions; and, 3) develop the
groundwork to identify individual genes directly responsible for interspecific
reproductive barriers among Lycopersicon species.

Reproductive isolation barriers are a substantial obstacle to agricultural
exploitation of wild germplasm and are fundamental to the origin of
biodiversity. Nonetheless, very little is known about the genes responsible for
reproductive isolation, especially among plant species. This research will
provide detailed insight into the genetic basis of hybrid sterility among
multiple species in an economically important plant group. Research products
will include genomic data and resources that may increase the accessibility of
agriculturally useful traits found in wild species, and thereby aid the
development of new crop resources. Due to their close relationship, this work
may also help in identifying genes responsible for hybrid sterility in other
economically important plants, including potato, eggplant, and pepper. The
research will also provide a diverse training environment for undergraduates,
graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers, in plant breeding, genomics,
and evolutionary biology.
