This project conducts research that will lead to the implementation and
deployment of a digital library testbed and environment of textual, video, still
image, and data sets, from both primary and secondary information suppliers. The
project will make available capabilities and services to a large number of users
at multiple locations. The basic approach is one of self-assembling agent based
federation of distributed collections. The testbed is an extension of existing
DIRECT and TULIP projects. The testbed content is primarily concerned with the
earth and space sciences. The testbed will proceed in three releases, each
incorporating additional information and making available more advanced
capabilities. Usage and user evaluations will be reincorporated into the testbed
to contribute to rational system evolution.
