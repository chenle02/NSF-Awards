9730786 Babcock This is a study of existing multichannel siesmic data to
determine crustal thickness variations and the character of Moho reflectors. The
objectives are to obtain precise crustal thickness measurements at the segment
scale, to ascertain the continunity and character of Moho reflections and their
relationship to the ridge crest, to examine the response of Moho reflections to
identify other geologically plausible crust-mantle transitions.
