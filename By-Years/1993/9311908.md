Wah This conference, sponsored by the EUROMICRO Association, the IEEE Computer
Society, IFIP, AEI, and AICA, focuses on parallel computing, system design
methodologies, technology and implementation within the context of application
specific computing. Application specific computing is directly related to high
performance computing and is a major component in this program. This conference
will take place in conjunction with the IEEE International Workshop on Defect
and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems. This grant supports travel by selected
graduate students to permit them to attend the conference.
