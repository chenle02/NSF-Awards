9529575 Terray Detailed measurements of surface layer velocity shear will make
using a new vorticity sensor to test the conjecture that the spanwise averaged
shear in the downwind current is the same as in a shear flow over a solid
boundary. It is expected that an improved understanding of turbulent mixing near
the surface will benefit studies of processes like air-sea gas exchange,
phytoplankton dynamics and the mixing of nutrients and pollutants. ***
