This awards provides continuing support for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). The program will
introduce academically talented students to ongoing research in faculty
laboratories in the Department of Biological Sciences. The Department conducts
nationally recognized research in cell biology, genetics, molecular biology,
biochemistry and biophysics. Each student will carry out an original research
project devised by a faculty mentor who is a leader in his or her area of
expertise. Students will also attend a special seminar series and present the
results of their research at a concluding symposium. Students will be recruited
from colleges and universities all over the United States. Special efforts will
be made to recruit students from liberal arts colleges and the recruitment of a
significant number of minority students and women is a major goal. Selection of
students will be based upon academic criteria, letters of recommendation, as
well as the students' stated interest in research. For the 1989 summer research
program, the CMU administration has pledge $30,000 in supplemental university
funds. These funds will be used to support an increased number of student
participants. The number of participants in 1989 will be approximately 16 to 18.
