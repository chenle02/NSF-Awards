The primary goal of this research will be to study molecular systems. Earlier
work which used the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to study electron energy
level crossings, (infinite time) scattering problems, and problems that involve
oscillating external electric fields will be extended. Numerical calculations
will be used to test the usefulness of high order Born-Oppenheimer expansions on
realistic systems. Also studied will be a particular family of one-dimensional
Schrodinger operators. This research should have impact on the study of
quasicrystals.
