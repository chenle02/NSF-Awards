The profound change in conceptions of space, "from the closed world to the
infinite universe," has been matched by a parallel change in conceptions of
time, from a universe a few thousand years old to one estimated in billions.
Those two historical developments have been of equal cultural importance, but
the latter is far less understood. This change in human understanding of time of
our world should not be considered primarily as a mere expansion of the
timescale, but rather in terms of a reconstruction of the history of nature. The
crucial period in the reconstruction of earth history was the early 19th
century, during which a plethora of competing conjectures was replaced by a
broadly consensual view that is still embedded in the modern earth sciences. The
most decisive part of this research was the reconstruction of geologically
recent earth history (in modern terms, Cenozoic). This penetrated what was
perceived as an epistemic barrier between human and prehuman history, and
clarified the enigmatic event (first conceived as a Deluge, later as an Ice Age)
that marked that boundary. It is this later period that Professor Rudwick is
examining in this fundamentally important study.
