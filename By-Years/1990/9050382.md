The purpose of this project is to develop an advanced image processing
laboratory for use in a new course in image processing as well as for
undergraduate projects and research. The equipment for the project consists of
high-resolution cameras; high-speed image digitizers; AT computers; and a local
area network. The students use the cameras to observe both moving and stationary
objects, then the objects are digitized and stored in memory. Finally, the
students develop algorithms that communicate with a central knowledge base, and
process the images. Included in the laboratory experience are experiments such
as identifying a moving object in a stationary background, then calculating the
velocity and acceleration of the object. The project allows students to apply
theoretical concepts to the solution of very practical problems. The award is
being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
