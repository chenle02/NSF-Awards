9510266 Gordon The PI is organizing a Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric
Chemistry in Newport, RI on June 18-23, 1995. This Gordon Research Conference is
one of the major meetings in this field. This year, the conference theme will be
Aerosols - an extremely timely topic of intense interest in both tropospheric
and stratospheric chemistry. Aerosols have also been identified as being the key
uncertainty with respect to anthropogenic influences on climate. The meeting
will be attended by both established researchers and young scientists, among
them the participants of the preceding ACCESS meeting. ***
