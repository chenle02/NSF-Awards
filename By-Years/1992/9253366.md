The videodisc-based exhibit, the Powers of Ten in Time, will allow museum
visitors to explore the unseen world of natural change - events that occur too
quickly or too slowly to be perceived. Through the use of a touch screen and
interactive software, users will be able to, in effect, speed up or slow down
timeto witness changes that lie outside of the limits of human time perception.
Visitors will see scenes such as a forest recovering after a fire, a wall of
earth crumbling from erosion, tides coming in and out, the intricate motions of
complex machinery and molecules colliding and reacting to produce fire. The
videodiscs will contain more than 100 short video segments depicting a wide
range of phenomena. We will use time-lapse footage, slow-motion clips and
animations to show changes occurring over time periods form 300,000,000 to
femtoseconds. Not only will museum visitors be able to watch these video
segments at their own pace and in order they choose, they will also be able to
learn more about such phenomena through on- screen textual and graphical
explanations. The goal of the project is to engage museum visitors with
captivating photographic segments, explain the phenomena shown with supplemental
text and graphics, and stimulate them to look at the world in a new way - not
just with their eyes, but with their minds and imaginations.
