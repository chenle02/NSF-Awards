This project permits students at this institution to study Artificial
Intelligence (AI) as an interdisciplinary course - one involving both the
principles of programming AI problem solutions as well as the study of issues of
cognitive science. The new AI course is offered as a capstone course in that
students develop one or two very complex LISP programs in the area of AI. The
laboratory equipment that supports this project includes: networked Apollo
DN3000 and DN 4000 workstations running LISP. This award is being matched by an
equal sum from the grantee.
