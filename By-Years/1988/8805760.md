This project requests partial funding toward the purchase of an elevated
pressure high-temperature furnace. The furnace will be used in the area of a
wide range of advanced materials processing such as ceramic materials liquid
phase sintering, ceramic whiskers synthesis and ceramic matrix composites
sintering.
