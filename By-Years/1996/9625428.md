The goal of this project is to develop a domain-independent method to search
multimedia databases by content, e.g., to find video clips that are similar to a
news broadcasting session in a collection of video clips. The approach extracts
N numerical features from each object, effectively mapping the object into a
point in N-dimensional space. Then, highly fine-tuned, off-the-shelf, spatial
access methods (like R-trees) are used to cluster the data and to search very
quickly for similar objects, that is, nearby points in the N-d space. This
approach is generic and can be used for any database of multimedia objects, as
long as appropriate features can be derived. The specific applications in this
project are: (a) natural and medical images, with state-of-the-art signal
processing methods, like wavelets and morphology, and (b) voice and related time
sequences that include time-warping and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Applications
of such a system are numerous, including computer aided medical diagnosis and
teaching (by using similarity search on older, expertly diagnosed medical
images), queries on video by content (in art, entertainment, or journalism
applications), and similarity searching in financial and scientific time
sequences (for data mining, decision support, and forecasting).
