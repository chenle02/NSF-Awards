The Tidewater Summer Science Camp is a four-week summer enhancement project in
mathematics and science at Norfolk State University for minority 7th and 8th
grade students in the Tidewater, Virginia area. The major objective of the
project are to involve students in interesting investigations and projects
involving real-world science problems, to increase their knowledge, skill, and
confidence in mathematics and science, and to increase the likelihood that they
will pursue mathematics/science careers. Students are provided hands-on, scaled-
down versions of science problems in a laboratory setting; they use graphing
calculators and computers to aid in the mathematical analysis of science
problems; they go on field trips to obtain first-hand exposure to science
practitioners; and they are involved in intensive career exploration and
curriculum counseling. A follow-up component of the project includes Saturday
sessions throughout the academic year. The program's ultimate goal of
significantly increasing the number of the participants selecting
mathematics/science careers is monitored by maintaining a data base of the
participants' progress through high school and beyond. ***
