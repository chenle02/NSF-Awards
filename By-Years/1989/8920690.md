Professor William Miller is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in the theory of
chemical dynamics. This research contributes significantly to our understanding
of the fundamental interactions between molecules, and the nature of chemical
reactions. The main thrust of the research is in the general area of chemical
dynamics, and in the development and application of new theoretical methods and
models for the treatment of reactive scattering. The specific topics to be dealt
with include a rigorous quantum mechanical reactive scattering theory for simple
chemical reactions, and a Feynman path integral methodology for real time
simulations of quantum dynamics of more complex chemical systems.
