9354051 Gadson Curriculum Development for Science Teacher Preparation A
consortium has been formed to design specific approaches to improving the
quality of undergraduate science teacher preparation and increasing
substantially the quality and number of Black and Hispanic teachers in science.
The consortium will design fresh, comprehensive, and coordinated approaches to
reform science teacher preparation involving intra-institutional and inter-
institutional collaboration. Faculties in the departments of biology, chemistry,
physics, mathematics, and science education from Florida A&amp;M University,
University of Florida, University of South Florida, Bethune Cookman University,
and Florida Memorial University, along with lead science teachers from Leon,
Dade, and Volusia School Districts, will convene for two weekends. They will
develop an articulated program model for a four- year comprehensive curriculum
for teacher preparation in science education in the areas of biology, chemistry,
and physics at the five major institutions. The program will be characterized by
interdisciplinary experiences, use of new pedagogies, and clinical experiences.
The curriculum model will be disseminated throughout the U.S. through
newsletters and professional journals. ***y
