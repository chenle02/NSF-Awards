This project develops efficient optimization algorithms for the calibration of
stochastic microscopic multi-agent urban traffic models. Efficiency is achieved
by exploiting problem structure and by bringing together ideas from two already
highly developed fields, the mathematical discipline of simulation-based
optimization (SO) and the applied discipline of calibrating traffic simulation
models from real sensor data. As part of the research, metamodel SO techniques
are designed, efficient metamodels are formulated based on analytical
probabilistic traffic models and point selection techniques for small-sample
size problems are proposed. Such techniques are suitable to address complex
calibration problems within a tight simulation budget. They respond to the needs
of transportation simulation users by allowing them to address complex problems
in a practical manner.

If successful, the techniques of this project will allow traffic simulators to
be more accurately and efficiently calibrated, leading to more reliable results.
This is important given that federal, state, regional and local transportation
agencies, as well as transit agencies and a variety of transportation
consultants develop and rely on microscopic simulation tools to identify network
design or traffic management strategies that mitigate congestion as well as its
negative economic, environmental and health impacts. This award will be carried
out in collaboration with a regional planning agency. This allows us to design
techniques informed by the current and future needs of practitioners.
Additionally, a large-scale case study of the city of Berlin will be carried
out. By testing the performance of these tools on complex large-scale case
studies, we will demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach to
transportation practice. This project will engage undergraduate minority
students. It will integrate its findings within advanced graduate transportation
and operations research subjects.
