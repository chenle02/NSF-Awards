A workshop will be convened to develop a scientific plan for an initiative on
recruitment processes and ecosystem structure. The plan would: describe the
major scientific issues to be addressed; identify research strategies for
addressing these issues, especially interdisciplinary issues involving
population dynamics, ecology, and biological, chemical and physical
oceanography; specify conceptual, technological and implementation problems that
might impede attainment of research goals; and identify opportunities for
interinstitutional and international collboration. The workshop will be held in
April 1988 in Washington, D.C., at the Joint Oceanographic Institutions,
Incorporated, which will handle the arrangements for the workshop. An organizing
committee and a series of working groups will be set up to plan and organize the
workshop. Invitations to the workshop will be issued by the organizing committee
to approximately 100 prospective participants. A full report of the workshop,
including the conclusions reached and the working papers, will be published by
late 1988.
