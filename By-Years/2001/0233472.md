The proposed design study will create a MSP Network (MSP-NET), a web-based
interactive electronic community for MSP grantees. The network will: (1)
encourage sharing of resources, problems, strategies and solutions to issues;
(2) connect MSP projects with other resources at NSF and the Department of
Education; (3) permit interaction within MSP projects; (4) provide MSP projects
and the program as a whole with a public presence, publicizing the effort, and
disseminating positive results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
