We believe that the physical properties of artificially-prepared thin films are
strongly affected by the synthesis and processing methods employed and therefore
structural and chemical characterization must play a key role in all research
performed on such films. We plan to synthesize novel magnetic thin films using
state-of-the-art techniques such as sputtering and molecular-beam epitaxy, then
characterize the structure and chemical composition using a wide variety of
methods. Growth and characterization studies will be correlated with physical
properties, especially magnetotransport and magnetization. The studies will
relate to the magnetism of superlattices and interfaces with two problems -
giant magneto-resistance and exchange bias - receiving particular attention.
