ABSTRACT CTS-9704044 Carol Hall/N.C. State This proposal describes a program of
theoretical research aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which solutes such
as polyethylene glycol (PEG) enhance the refolding of proteins and prevent
aggregation. The goal is to develop molecular-level models that capture the
essential features that govern the competition protein refolding and aggregation
in both the presence and absence of solutes. By simulating the properties of
model proteins and solutes on the computer, we will be able to explore how
protein folding and kinetics are influenced by: protein type and concentration;
denaturant type and concentration; solute type; concentration, and size; and
temperature. The investigators will work on three parallel tracks whose
objectives are: (1) to extend the two dimensional lattice Monte Carlo studies of
protein folding and aggregation previously performed under NSF sponsorship to
include the presence of model solutes that mimic the effect of PEG, (2) to
develop simple off-lattice models based on the heteronuclear square-well chain
model and then to use discontinuous molecular dynamic (DMD) to simulate protein
folding and aggregation in the presence and absence of model PEG molecules. ***
