The University of Massachusetts at Amherst will create within the general
education context a series of courses that will provide education majors with a
comprehensive constructivist perspective concerning science and mathematics
instruction. Because the courses that will be designed are intended for a
broader audience than the education major, not only will students of other
majors reap the benefits of this epitemological approach, but the education
majors will have the experience of being taught as they should teach. The
individual components of the project consist of the modification and/or
development of (1) a faculty seminar on contructivism, (2) a basic mathematics
course, (3) an undergraduate course on the learning of mathematics and science,
(4) an interdisciplinary science laboratory course, and (5) an interdisciplinary
science course. To accomplish these tasks an interdisciplinary team of eight
scientists and mathematicians, two educators and two teachers will study recent
developments in the theory of science learning and apply them to the
construction of the new courses.
