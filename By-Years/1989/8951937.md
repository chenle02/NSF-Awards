This award to the University of New Hampshire at Durham is made in response to
a proposal submitted to the NSF's Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement
Program, a program whose goal is to extend support for undergraduate
instructional instrumentation. The award will provide one-half of the funds
needed to acquire field and laboratory instrumentation for a newly reformulated
hydrology curriculum. The University of New Hampshire is committed to matching
the NSF contribution for this equipment. The instrumentation will be used to
enhance the undergraduate hydrology curriculum and to provide practical training
in the use of modern environmental instrumentation.
