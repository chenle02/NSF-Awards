The dynamics of central nuclear collisions involves simultaneous and nontrivial
interactions of many nuclear constituents. Such interactions are a challenge for
nuclear theory and are important for studies of the physics of the early
Universe. Unfortunately, current descriptions of nuclear collisions rely on the
semiclassical limit of the dynamics. Overcoming previous technical difficulties
in the numerical implementation of the quantal theory of nuclear reactions, in
this project the investigator and his collaborators will develop new strategies
for the numerical implementation of this many-body theory in one and two
dimensions, before attacking the realistic three-dimensional case. The resulting
upgrade in software infrastructure for nuclear collisions will support the
experimental program at the future Facility for Rare Isotope Beams currently
under construction on the Michigan State University campus. The computational
methods developed in this project are likely to benefit research in other
fields, such as studies of electron transport across nanoscale electronic
devices in electrical engineering, and will train the postdoc and student
involved in cutting-edge computational techniques.

This project aims to develop the computational framework for a quantal
description of central nuclear collisions based on a nonequilibrium Green
functions approach that is expected to open up the path towards a first-
principles description of nuclear reactions. By following the quantal rather
than the semiclassical evolution of many-body systems, the PI and his
collaborators will reduce the level of uncertainty in the analysis of energetic
collisions for the study of bulk nuclear properties, including the symmetry
energy and the transport properties of matter. The successful completion of this
project will provide useful tools for studies of head-on nuclear collisions and
excitations of collective resonances, and will prepare the ground for future
studies of collisions at finite impact parameter.
