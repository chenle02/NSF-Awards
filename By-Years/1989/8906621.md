Geographic variation refers to the widespread phenomenon of variation within
the range of species. Understanding the origin and maintenance of such variation
is a primary goal of attempts to understand the evolutionary process itself.
This project is designed to clarify evolutionary processes that shape the
geography of intraspecific genetic variation in three codistributed species of
birds, namely, the Fox, Song, and Chipping sparrows. In morphology, these
species exhibit both marked geographic differentiation (Fox and Song sparrows)
and phenotypic uniformity (Chipping sparrow) in their continent-wide
distributions. In samples of birds taken throughout the range of each species,
genetic differentiation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and a series of genes that
encode soluble proteins, called allozymes will be measured. Such descriptive
data on genetic variation within species provide a foundation for understanding
the origin and evolutionary significance of geographic variation, and its
relationship to the process of adaptation and speciation. Examination of genetic
data is crucial because evolution ultimately occurs at this level in
populations. By examining genetic variation in samples of these three species,
it will be possible to determine if geographic distance alone or "vicariant"
events in earth history (such as the formation of mountain ranges) play a
primary role in geographic differentiation, the initial step in evolutionary
divergence. No studies of avian genetic variation within and among codistributed
species have been conducted on the geographic, continent-wide scale of the
proposed study. This study will provide the most detailed information on avian
population genetic structure yet available, for both proteins and at the level
of the genetic code itself, (mt)DNA. The use of three species that occur over
the same range increases the statistical power of interpreting patterns of
variation. The results will offer significant insight into the evolutionary
process in general as well as the birds under study.
