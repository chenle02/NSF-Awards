Support will be provided for a workshop devoted to control systems governed by
partial differential equations and application of the theory to control and
stabilization of large, flexible structures. There is currently great interest
in control of large flexible structures because of the number of such structures
requiring active control for acceptable performance. These include flexible arms
of robots, large communication and intelligence satellites, orbiting platforms
and power stations, and manned space stations. They are typically highly
flexible, consisting of a large number of beam-like elements coupled together
end-to-end in the form of a chain, with components mathematically modeled by
large systems of ordinary and partial differential equations. The main purpose
of the proposed workshop is to determine what the basic problems are in the
control of flexible structures, what the current state of affairs in the
application of pde techniques to these problems is, where this area of research
is heading, and where should it be going.
