Dr. Davis and collaborators will develop a series of models of increasing
complexity to examine the effects of storms and oceanic eddies on advective loss
rates of plankton and fish larvae from an idealized offshore bank. Their working
hypothesis is that such "wash-out" events cause major reduction in recruitment
in characteristic zooplankton (Calanus, Pseudocalanus, Centropages, Paracalanus)
and fish (cod, haddock, herring) populations. Although, for simplicity, they
focus on bank circulation, the work will provide insights into basic
interactions between physical forcing, food web dynamics, and recruitment which
can be applied to other regions of the ocean. The researchers will start with a
simple 2-D kinematic model of idealized flow around a bank (Georges Bank
parameter values will be used) and will then incorporate simple models of food
chain and zooplankton population dynamics. Eulerian models containing simple
biology will be compared with Lagrangian ones (using flow trajectories specified
from the Eulerian), containing more complete biology. We will develop
simplification techniques to reduce biological complexity to a minimal
acceptable level given dominant scales of physical and biological forcing.
Models of intermediate complexity such as contour dynamics analyses will be
developed to assess impact of rings on bank circulation. Finally, they will use
a primitive equation (PE) circulation model containing simplified biology and
compare the results with the other models. The primitive equation model will be
used to obtain realistic dynamical flows given strong topography and
stratification, so that temporal-spatial correspondence between physical losses
and biological distributions can be determined.
