In this project the principal investigator will study the equations of motion
for viscoelastic materials, thermoelastic materials and thermo-viscoelastic
materials. In particular, he will use the techniques of mathematical analysis to
investigate the existence of smooth solutions for all time and their asymptotic
behavior for large times, the formation of singularities such as shock and
rarefaction waves from initially smooth data, and the existence of weak (i.e.,
nondifferentiable) solutions. The goal of the work is to understand rigorously
the nature of nonlinear elastic responses of materials that are subjected to
dissipative forces such as viscosity and heat. Many materials of importance in
science and technology exhibit an elastic response that is modulated by the
presence of dissipative forces like viscosity and heat. The most striking
manifestation of this modulation is the actual breakdown of the material in a
finite time due to the formation of shock waves. Thus it is very important to
understand the interplay between dissipation and the formation of shocks. In
this project the principal investigator will prove rigorous results concerning
the formation and propagation of shock waves in systems of equations that model
the behavior of nonlinear elastic bodies in the presence of viscosity and heat.
