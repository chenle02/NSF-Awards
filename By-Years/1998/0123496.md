0123496&lt;br/&gt;Khammash&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed
research is to study examples of biological feedback regulation mechanisms using
the tools of dynamical systems and feedback control theory, and to use the
results to shed new understanding on the operation of these systems in health
and disease. In achieving this objective, The PI seeks to identify functional
modules that serve specific feedback control roles, to determine the
physiological basis of these modules, and to understand the extent to which such
modules generalize to other regulatory systems and across hierarchical scales.
These questions are key in addressing the long-term objective to develop a
unified framework for analyzing homeostatic mechanisms--one that is centered on
feedback control theory concepts and language, and takes into account known
physiology. It is believed that such a framework will make it possible to make
new progress in the understanding of those complex biological and chemical
processes involved in homeostasis and the functional modules that these
processes constitute, based on the functional constraints that are imposed on
these modules by the necessities of feedback and robustness.&lt;br/&gt;
