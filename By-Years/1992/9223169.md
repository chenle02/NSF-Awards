MU-SPIN, The Minority University-Space Interdisciplinary Network, is a program
for minority universities, as well as colleges with significant minority
enrollments, which is oriented around wide area networking technology and its
use for supporting multi- disciplinary research. Sponsorship is by the NASA
Goddard Space Flight Center, Data and Computing Division, the University
Programs Office, the Equal Opportunity Office, and NASA Headquarters. Based on
the success of the 1991 meeting, this project is to support the second meeting
of the MU-SPIN Users Working Group, September 13-15, 1992 at the Goddard Space
Flight Center. The meeting is to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas on
networking to support interdisciplinary research. Funding will support the cost
of participant travel, meals, and meeting arrangements. The project is directly
related to the interest of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering
Directorate in that CISE is actively supporting programs to enhance the
opportunities of underrepresented population in the computer field. Access to
adequate facilities, and the interchange made available by the network
connections is an important aspect of this effort, and the program of the
workshop should enhance the opportunities of the participants.
