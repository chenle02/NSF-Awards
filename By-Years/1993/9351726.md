9351726 Xiao Recent advances in the field of optics should be reflected in
undergraduate science and engineering programs. This is presently accomplished
at the University of Arkansas by offering to students in science and engineering
a series of three courses: "Optics", "Laser Physics", and "Applied Non- Linear
Optics". In "Optics" students develop a foundation of both physical and wave
optics, in "Laser Physics" students develop specific skills in design,
construction, and analysis of different laser systems, while in "Applied Non-
Linear Optics" they utilize their skills to investigate concepts and techniques
that are finding widespread applications in science and engineering. The present
program at Arkansas supports the "Optics", "Laser Physics" and "Applied Non-
Linear Optics" courses by providing a strong laboratory experience. The basic
project plan reinforces the interest and enthusiasm which is piqued in the
lecture and to give students the opportunity to continue to develop their
talents and their interests into specific skills. The new laboratory program
uses non-linear optical materials as a vehicle to develop skills in (i)
Electro-, Magneto-, and Acousto-Optics; (ii) Optical Wave Mixing; (iii)
Photorefractive Phenomena; and (iv) Guided Waves and Integrated Optics. In every
case the equipment requested is of the type which students encounter in research
and development laboratories engaged in optics related work.
