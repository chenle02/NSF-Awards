"Peep and the Big, Wide World" is an NSF-funded television series for children
ages 3 to 5. The Children's Museum proposes to build on this show and extend its
impact through exhibits, education and professional development programs.
Specifically, planning grant funds will be used to 1) gather best practices in
preschool & brand-based exhibition development, 2) conduct a front-end survey of
potential host museums to determine training needs of museum staff, parents,
caregivers and teachers of preschool children, and 3) clarify design of the
education and professional development programs associated with the exhibit.
