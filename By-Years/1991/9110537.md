In this project, the PI will deploy an array of four moored profiling current
meters (PCM) in support of the intensive observation period (IOP) for TOGA-
COARE. Each mooring will measure temperature, salinity, and velocity
fluctuations between about 20 meters and 200 meters' depth at regular intervals
for a period of one year. Characterization of these fluctuations will be used to
study the response of the upper ocean to variations in surface forcing, using
the vast array of supporting measurements to be made during the COARE IOP.
