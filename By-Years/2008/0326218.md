We propose to use a commercial Microelectromechanical System (MEMS) to develop a
detailed understanding of stiction and friction parameters as a function of
surface coating and environmental conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit&lt;br/&gt;Under this project, we will develop an environmental control
system that will allow various conditions (humidity, temperature, coatings, etc)
to be altered in a packaged commercial MEMS [Texas Instrument's Digital
Micromirror Display (DMD). The DMD, an array of ~ 1 million individually
controllable digital micromirrors, provides a stable and well-characterized
platform for making measurements with statistical
significance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the in-situ characterization,
we will carry out standard surface characterization using contact angle, atomic
force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Contact angle
measurements will be used to determine the surface energy of the anti-stiction
and anti-friction coatings applied to test substrates. The AFM and SEM will be
used to image any damage to the coatings and underlying surface caused by
wear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Through this
project, we will expand synergistic ties to TI's Digital Light Products group,
the makers of the DMD. This interaction will be expanded by providing Ph.D.
students the opportunity to interact with a corporate research group, through
shared research on a state-of-the-art MEMS. TI will provide DMDs, the controller
boards needed to actuate the mirrors, and internship opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;
