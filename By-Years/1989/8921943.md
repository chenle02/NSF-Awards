This investigation explores nucleation and growth of precipitates through the
concept of ledge mechanisms. The formation rate of growth ledges on the face-
centered cubic/body- centered cubic interphase boundaries of facetted
precipitates is measured in nickel-chromium alloys by hot stage transmission
electron microscopy. Ledge formation rates predicted from classical nucleation
theory are compared to those measured experimentally. The contributions of
solute supersaturation, strain energy, and interphase boundary energy to ledge
nucleation are assessed. The role of misfit dislocations at interphase
precipitate/matrix boundaries during growth is determined. These results should
provide a connection between the geometric approach to explaining precipitate
shape employed by the invariant line model and the physical mechanism of
precipitate growth.
