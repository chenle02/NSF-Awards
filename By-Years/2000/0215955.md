With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Denison University will acquire a 400 MHz Fourier
Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will
enable researchers to carry out studies on a) probing dynamics in macromolecules
using coupled spin relaxation; b) synthesis and characterization of methylene
bridge substituted calix[4]arenes; c) studies of the reactivity and
stereochemistry of protonated cyclopropanes in terpenoid rearrangements; and d)
NMR studies of nearest neighbor effects on chemical shifts in peptides and
studies of chemically modified proteins.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. In addition to research
involving undergraduate students, this instrument will be used in a number of
advanced undergraduate laboratory courses at Denison University.
