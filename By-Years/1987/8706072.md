This research is to attack the thorny problem of analyzing data that comes from
measurements made, or observed, repeatedly but not regularly over time. A novel
approach using successive differences is proposed as the basis for analysis
assuming piece- wise linearity in the interval of varying lengths. The question
to be studied is how to decide where to subdivide the time interval. The
traditional methods for analyzing data which is collected repeatedly over time
were developed to answer questions posed by the financial community. Financial
data is not missing and can be collected at regular fixed time intervals.
Because of the structure available in the data driving the early developments in
this subfield, the assumptions of a fixed and rigid data structure is built into
these analytic approaches. In many fields of research, however, data cannot be
collected according to a fixed time schedule as can be done when measuring
dollars and cents. Radically new methods of analysis are needed to obtain valid
tools for such data, in as much as conclusions are being drawn and decisions
based on results from very ad hoc analytical procedures. This research aims to
work toward a statistical theory that will be valid for this general framework
of scientific investigation.
