The summer research program in Physics and Astronomy at the University of
Oklahoma will be continued, providing undergraduates with an opportunity to
participate in substantial scientific research in one of four areas:
astrophysics, condensed matter, atomic and molecular physics or high energy
physics. External students will be funded by the REU site grant, and additional
OU students will be funded by the University each year. The goal of the program
is to encourage and prepare students to seek further educational and career
opportunities in physics and astronomy. External students will be recruited
nationally with emphasis on underrepresented groups and participants who
otherwise lack opportunities for research experience. They will be matched with
individual research mentors in their stated area of interest. Students will
present their results at regional SPS and APS conferences. The program will
build upon the previous success in introducing students of diverse backgrounds
to modern research in an engaging setting.&lt;br/&gt;
