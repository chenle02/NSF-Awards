Biological Sciences (61) In order to enhance the number and quality of
undergraduate laboratory offerings in cell biology and provide the students with
more modern quantitative experiments, the Department of Biology at SUNY
Binghamton is introducing the powerful technology of flow cytometry into the
curriculum. Flow cytometry, used extensively in diverse areas of research to
analyze fluorescent stained subpopulations of cells, is now sufficiently
automated to be suitable for use in undergraduate laboratory courses. This
provides opportunities for student-derived independent research projects. The
goals of the project are to introduce quantitative flow cytometry experiments
into the cell biology laboratory, to develop a mini-course focusing on flow
cytometry principles, and to increase undergraduate student participation in
research. Approximately 65 students a year are exposed to the technique of flow
cytometry, both in cell biology and in the new mini-course. Project evaluation
is both formative and summative and involves both students and faculty.
