This research describes a support environment for parallelism exploitation in
ordinary (scientific) programs. The environment will be designed for mapping
programs with real-time constraints and/or massive compilation requirements onto
parallel computers. It is envisioned as part of a scientist's workstation, to
serve as a front end for the NSF Supercomputing Center at Cornell. Within this
system, the user may control the parallelization process while the system deals
with the burdensome details of architecture, correctness-preservation and
synchronization. Through a graphical interface the user suggests what should be
done in parallel, while the system performs the actual changes using semantic-
preserving transformations. If a request cannot be satisfied, the system reports
the problem causing the failure. The user may then eliminate the problem by
supplying guidance of information not explicit in the code.
