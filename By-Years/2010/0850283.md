The Computational Science Research Center (CSRC) at San Diego State University
(SDSU) is to provide talented disadvantaged engineering, mathematics and
computer science students with scholarships. CSRC provides the infrastructure
for collaborative research efforts between applied mathematics and other science
and engineering disciplines. The program is to match each student with a faculty
and/or industrial mentor who will participate actively in academic and
professional development of the student as they train the student in their
research. Each student's progress is to be tracked to ensure timely graduation.
The project will serve 60 unique students over a 5 year period. Participating
students will gain the necessary skills and expertise for success in
professional careers and/or graduate course work.
