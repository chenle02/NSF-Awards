The California Consortium for Minority Graduate Student Education Program is a
partnership organization composed of the California State University and the
University of California systems. The goal of the Consortium's forum is to
increase graduate school access for underrepresented minority college students.
Minority students in undergraduate institutions throughout California will be
provided with the most current information on graduate study opportunities. A
number of educators and administrators from federal, state and private agencies
will present lectures and workshops to 500-600 undergraduate and graduate
students in a one-day forum at San Jose State University in 1992. The forum's
objectives are i) to provide information on sources of funding for graduate
study including support from MARC and MBRS programs, NSF fellowships and
minority supplements on federal grants; ii) to demonstrate more effective ways
to prepare for the graduate record examination; iii) to expose students to
graduate school recruiters, and encourage them to establish an early
relationship with graduate advisors in their field of research interest.
