Commercial harvest of yellow perch in the Great Lakes region can not meet
market demand. Additional controls being placed on commercial harvest, while
consumer demand and high perch prices have generated renewed interest in perch
aquaculture. Attempts to establish commercial perch culture have faced three
major constraints: 1) seasonal supply for fingerlings, 2) feeding fry practical
feeds, and 3) providing optimum growth conditions. Stunted 3-5 inch perch could
be harvested from wild populations or raised in farm ponds to provide a year-
round source of larger fish for intensive culture using waste heat. Stunted
perch are not acceptable to most anglers and have no comercial value. Various
harvesting, holding and transportation methods and prophylactic treatments will
be tested to minimize stress and disease. Perch will be fed practical feeds
immediately or will be converted from live feeds (minnows) to practical feeds
over a 10-14 day period. Fish converted to practical feeds will be fed
commercially available fish feeds to determine growth rates at 20oC. Comparisons
between stunted and non-stunted perch will be used to determine if stunted perch
exhibit growth compensation and if the added growth (weight gain) is fat or
protein (muscle). Results from phase I research could provide solutions to the
major constraints to commercial perch aquaculture.
