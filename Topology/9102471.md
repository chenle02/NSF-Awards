The simplest of infinite groups is the free group on a finite number of
letters. Here an element of the group is a word in the letters and their
inverses. Two words are equal if and only if after iteratively canceling
consecutive occurrences of a letter and its inverse the two words become the
same. Gromov initiated the study of a class of groups, called "negatively
curved," that share some of the computational ease of a free group. The first
part of this project is to continue the exploration of these groups and to
extend this study to include a class of groups that the investigator calls
"relatively negatively curved." We say we have tiled the complex plane if we
have expressed the plane as a union of finitely many congruent pieces, the
tiles, that are pairwise disjoint up to their boundaries. The tiles need not be
connected and their boundaries may be fractal. The tiling is self-similar if
there is a complex number b associated to the tiling such that multiplication by
b takes each tile to a union of tiles. An example is the famous Penrose tiling.
Thurston has identified the complex numbers that can be associated to self-
similar tilings. The second part of this project is to determine which complex
numbers may be associated to tilings by disks and which numbers may be
associated to tilings by polygons.
