Agler will continue his development of a very general extension theory for
operators on Hilbert spaces that would apply to many classes of operators
including subnormal operators, n-symmetric operators, and m-isometries. This
will require first identifying the class of extensions that would go with a
given operator, finding a good model theory for the extension, and finally
applying the construction to prove new theorems. Progress on these problems will
be of interest to many parts of analysis. Operator theory is that part of
mathematics that studies the infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.
In particular, when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has
the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a matrix. The
central problem in operator theory is to classify operators satisfying
additional conditions given in terms of associated operators (e.g. the adjoint)
or in terms of the underlying space. Operator theory underlies much of
mathematics, and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
