The Department of Chemistry will acquire a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM)
for undergraduate education. The project intends the incorporation of STM into
the junior and senior years of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at the
University of Miami. STM is a conceptually and instrumentally simple technique
which has developed from an esoteric research topic at the beginning of this
decade to a highly useful tool in the field of surface science at present. STM
is capable of generating surface images with atomic resolution and thus affords
the direct observation of individual atoms. STM can also be utilized for
microscopic purposes competing advantageously with Transmission Electron
Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy. STM instruments are completely
computerized and easy to use. This technique will be used to introduce
undergraduate students to the growing field of surface chemistry. This project
will pioneer the incorporation of STM into upper level chemistry laboratories in
undergraduate courses of Instrumental Analysis and Physical Chemistry.
