This project strengthens the university's undergraduate Computational
Mathematics program by targeting for improvement the Numerical Analysis, Linear
Algebra, and Parallel Computation courses and by implementing an undergraduate
research program in Computational Mathematics. To this end, improvement in the
Unix environment open laboratory facilities is needed and Unix environment
classroom is established. This project will contribute to increasing the number
of students who pursue advanced degrees in Computational Mathematics and as such
is in accord with the long-term developmental goals of the Department of
Mathematics.
