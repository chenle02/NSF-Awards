This project will apply mathematical modeling and computational simulation to
epitaxial growth of thin films, in particular semiconductor materials grown by
MBE (molecular beam epitaxy). The research topics are characterized by complex
geometry and a hierarchy of length scales, requiring significantly new
mathematical and numerical approaches. Specific topics include strain in thin
films, accelerated numerical methods, coarse-graining and the dynamics of
interacting defect lines.

This project will apply mathematical modeling and computational simulation to
material science, in particular to semiconductor materials grown by MBE
(molecular beam epitaxy). Although MBE is just one of many possible growth
techniques, it is the growth method for many of the most demanding applications,
such as high-performance, low-power systems for wireless communications.
Modeling and simulation are not generally well developed for MBE growth, and
current computational methods are not sufficient to address many of the
important problems of epitaxy. The goal is to develop new mathematical models
and computational methods that will significantly advance the state of the art.
This project is multi-disciplinary, involving mathematics (both applied and
core) and materials science, as well as participation from both industry and
university. The distinguishing feature of this collaboration is that it combines
expertise in modeling, simulation and experimentation in one cohesive group.
