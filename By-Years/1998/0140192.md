This work addresses questions ranging from the possible charges of
&lt;br/&gt;elementary particles to the possible shape of our universe. The main
&lt;br/&gt;research tool is finding and using classical features of diverse
physical &lt;br/&gt;systems. The classical aspects make it feasible for
undergraduate as&lt;br/&gt;well as graduate students to contribute
significantly, also advancing&lt;br/&gt;their own
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the questions, the method itself is
important because classical&lt;br/&gt;intuition strengthens and speeds the
research and eases understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the results for other researchers
as well as the public at large. For&lt;br/&gt;example, properties of the
neutrons and protons found in all atomic&lt;br/&gt;nuclei may be understood by
viewing each such object as a kind of knot, and&lt;br/&gt;using experience about
how a knot responds to squeezing and to tugging.&lt;br/&gt;
