1111196&lt;br/&gt;Liang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant provides support
for leading scientists, early-career faculty, and graduate students to
participate discussions on thermal energy transfer for energy harvesting, at the
Materials Research Society (MRS) annual spring meeting, San Francisco, CA in
April 25-29, 2011. The symposium will bring researchers together from two
communities, materials and thermal energy. The current needs in energy and waste
heat recovery have challenged mechanical engineers and materials scientists in
design of engineering components and fabrication of novel materials for heat
transfer and energy harvesting. This symposium provides an opportunity for
participants to discuss important issues in thermal energy transfer and
materials development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this
grant will provide a venue for examination of energy transfer, waster energy
recovery, and needs for materials development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad
impacts of the grant are in enabling the participation of students and early
career scientists in the symposium, thereby providing the education and training
opportunities for next generation scientists.
