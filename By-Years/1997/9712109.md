Modern cryptography relies heavily on assumptions about the asymptotic
intractability of certain number-theoretic problems. However, at the
implementation level, assumptions about the concrete complexity of problems of a
fixed size must be made (e.g. the intractability of factorization assumption in
practice is "factoring 1024-bit cryptographic numbers is impossible").
Determining what "small-size" is too small to be secure is the focus of this
project: to design and implement algorithms which solve, in practice, those
number-theoretic problems which are the pillars of modern cryptography. These
problems which are vital to modern cryptography are i) the discrete logarithm
problem; ii) deciding quadratic residuosity modulo a composite number; iii)
factorization of cryptographic numbers. These three problems will be central to
this project. The project will also consider a host of problems peripheral to
these three: primality testing, fast arithmetric with large numbers, diophantine
approximation, rapid factorization of small numbers, factorization of random
numbers, and other problems that will surely arise as research progresses.***
