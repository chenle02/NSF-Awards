This project entails the organization and execution of a conference on the issue
of women in astronomy. As its name implies, this is the fourth in a series of
conferences over a period of two decades. While the number of women astronomers
has increased over that period, women are still underrepresented in the science.
This conference will address these issues, and build on the success of past
meetings. It will also set the framework for continuing meetings of this topic
in a more regular way. The American Astronomical Society will organize these
future meetings. The current meeting is expected to take place after the
American Astronomical Society meeting in July 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key
component of this conference is support for participants who would not normally
be able to attend such a meeting: students and early-career professionals. These
are the target demographic to attend such a meeting, so their inclusion is
vital. The support provided for the workshop will ensure that those most in need
will be able to attend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination of the conference
proceedings will ensure that best practices provided by conference presenters
will be shared to a broader audience. Goals for follow-on meetings will be
formalized, and this workshop will form the basis for future activities designed
to ensure a more equal environment for students and practitioners of astronomy.
