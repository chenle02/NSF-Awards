Professor Richard McCreery of Ohio State University is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study the structure and mechanisms
of molecular tunneling junction systems. Monomolecular films of a compound
tethered to a graphite surface are probed as a mercury drop approaches the
surface. Raman spectroscopy is employed in an in-situ manner. Molecules such as
nitroazobenzene are utilized as adsorbates. The mechanism of conduction and
conductive switching of this system is being investigated. How does the
molecular structure of the organic layer affect the electronic properties of
carbon based junctions?

The work is relevant to the development of molecular electronics for
applications such as high density data storage, molecular transistors,
photodetectors, display technology and chemical sensors. Using molecules as
electronic elements is a goal of nanotechnology.
