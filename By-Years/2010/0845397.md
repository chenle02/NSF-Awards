landscape is changing. Improvements in instrumentation and simulation software
are giving scientists access to data at an unprecedented scale. This data is
increasingly being stored in data centers running thousands of commodity
servers. This new environment creates significant data management challenges. In
addition to efficient query processing, the magnitude of data and queries call
for new query management techniques such as runtime query control, intra-query
fault tolerance, query composition support, and seamless query
sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a series of techniques
to support the above query management tasks. To achieve this goal, the project
includes the design and implementation of a prototype massively parallel
database management system that serves as the platform for the development of
various query management schemes. The new algorithms are evaluated on both
synthetic and real data from the scientific domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
expected results of this project include a variety of runtime query management
algorithms including parallel query progress indicators, distributed intra-query
fault-tolerance, and the ability to suspend and resume queries as needed. The
expected results also include tools for searching previously executed queries,
annotating them, and sharing them with others. Together, these tools hold the
promise to significantly improve data analysis at massive scale, making it an
interactive and collaborative process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the above
contributions, this project will have significant impact on the scientific
community, currently limited by their ability to analyze data. The software and
technical papers resulting from this project will be disseminated through the
project website (http://nuage.cs.washington.edu/).&lt;br/&gt;
