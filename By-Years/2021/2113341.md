Severe thunderstorms are commonly associated with hot and humid airmasses.
However, there is evidence that storms can be maintained or even enhanced on the
cooler side of a boundary in certain circumstances. This research project will
analyze these scenarios, where the cool side of an airmass has significant
energy available to fuel thunderstorms. The researchers will develop a
climatology of cases and analyze the physical processes responsible for their
development. The research has direct impact on public safety through improved
forecasting of severe weather events. Multiple students would be involved in the
project, ensuring training of the next generation of
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will conduct a study of
mesoscale airmasses with high theta-e (MAHTE), which are generally areas of
moist air with high Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values on the
cool side of a frontal or outflow boundary. This award is for a foundational
study on MAHTEs to determine their climatology and the physical processes
responsible for their development. Analysis of surface observations will provide
the spatial distribution, diurnal cycle, and seasonality of MAHTEs within the
US. Idealized simulations would be used to provide a thorough understanding of
the processes through which MAHTE develop. The following hypotheses will be
tested: 1) The primary mechanism through which MAHTE develop is differential
vertical advection across the airmass boundary, 2) A secondary mechanism through
which MAHTEs develop is locally-enhanced surface fluxes of moisture near the
leading edge of the MAHTEs, and 3) MAHTE formation is likely to depend on the
environmental wind shear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
