This project contains two major research themes: semiparametric models and
empirical processes. Specific topics include: (1) information bounds for
semiparametric models; (2) efficiency calculations for estimation problems
involving althernating projection (ACE and MAP) methods; (3) construction of
efficient estimates in semiparametric models including transformation models,
constrained models involving infinitely many constraints, and semiparametric
regression models; (4) uniformity in P of the convergence of empirical
processes; (5) asympotic optimality of empirical measures; (6) preservation of
the Donsker class property of a collection of functions F under projection onto
a subspace in L2; (7) symmetric and quadratic statistics based on empirical
measures. Research to be performed under this project is in the area of
statistics.
