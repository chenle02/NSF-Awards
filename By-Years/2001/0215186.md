This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is intended to
demonstrate the fabrication of multiple, unconventionally small diameter, and
foundry incompatible wafers on a single, large-area 8-inch substrate. The
success of this effort will bring the benefits offered by devices made from such
wafers to the global community at affordable cost. The superior thermo-
mechanical properties of silicon carbide have made it a material of choice for
use as sensors in harsh environments. However, the lack of profit incentive due
to high substrate cost, small diameter (implying high production cost per unit
volume), and high capital equipment cost have combined to inhibit industry
interest in its global commercialization. A recently patented wafer platform
technology offers four immediate crucial benefits: 1) It significantly reduces
the high production cost by an order of magnitude to make silicon carbide based
sensors economically viable and competitive; 2) It utilizes semiconductor-on-
insulator technology to improve silicon carbide sensor functionality at 600oC
over pn-junction based silicon carbide sensors, which suffer from leakage
current as it approaches 500C; 3) A large-area (8-inch) platform technology will
significantly increase industry confidence toward global commercialization; and
4) It opens a new technology growth path toward integrated micro-systems
packaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential commercial applications a wide variety
of electronic and opto-electronic sensors. The domestic sensors and
instrumentation market in 2000 was $49 billion at an annual growth rate of
13.5%, Worldwide Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMs) market was $14.2
billion, expected to reach $30.4 billion with at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate
(CAGR) of 21% in 2004, of which the Silicon Carbide MEMs; worldwide market is
expected to reach $6 billion by 2005 (Sensors magazine, July 2001).
