As issues of climate change, loss of biodiversity, ozone depletion and other
global environmental problems come to center stage in national and international
policy debates, the role of the state becomes increasingly decisive. This
project studies the nation state as a critical actor in shaping both the forces
that cause global change and human response to it. Macro-social indicator data
on nation states are used to develop and test a macro-comparative theory of
state environmental policy. The model includes such factors as citizen
affluence, economic growth rates and capital stock, position of dependency in a
world economic order, structure of the economy, population pressure, class
structure and education, the strength of the national environmental movement,
scientific resources, level of democracy, and cultural and institutional
history. Because measures of the strength of the environmental movement and the
strength of the environmental science community were heretofore unavailable,
this research project fills that gap by combining objective indicators from
secondary sources with assessments of a panel of experts in order toy develop
those measures. This project adds to the comparative policy and international
relations field by examining rigorously the importance of considering a nation's
position in the world political economy as a determinant of the degree of state
control of the protection of the environment. It contributes new understanding
of what leads nations toward accepting various restrictions on their autonomy
for the sake of protecting the environment.
