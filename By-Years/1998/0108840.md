This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
development of an ultrafast TOC analyzer to enable real-time recycling of spent
rinse waters from semiconductor wet benches. At the present time, semiconductor
fabrication facilities generate about 3800 gallons of wastewater discharge per
wafer, which is equivalent to 53 million gallons of wastewater per year for
facilities operating at 100 gpm (gallons per minute). Recycling spent rinse
waters from semiconductor wet benches provides a viable solution to dramatically
reduce the environmental impact of this manufacturing process. On-line
monitoring of key contaminants in real time is necessary to successfully operate
future water systems having recycle and reuse capabilities. Phase I research
will be directed at developing microfluidic sensors having reliable, ultra-fast
response times to trace concentrations of organic contaminants found in spent
r5inse waters from simiconductor wet benches. Specific performance goals for
Phase I devices include: <30 s response time, <30 ppb detection limit, operation
in <10 microSiemen/cm water conductivity, and 100% +/- 30% recovery of key
contaminants.

An ultra-fast TOC analyzer will be developed that enables real-time recycling of
water used by seimiconductor manufacturing to reduce their demand upon regional
water supplies. This novel instrument will find widespread applications in the
semiconductor industry as well as other manufacturing environments that require
real-time detection of organic contaminants in aqueous effluent.
