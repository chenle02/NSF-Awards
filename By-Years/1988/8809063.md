The U.S. Pulp and Paper is an industry in the midst of contradictions. On the
one hand it is based on a renewable natural resource which currently is the best
on the planet, and, up until recently, could deliver pulp and paper anywhere in
the world at a price which was less than pulp and paper could be produced
locally. The result was a U.S. industry which, at least on average, was
profitable and provided a major contribution to the U.S. balance of payments. On
the other hand the U.S. Pulp and Paper industry has come under serious
international competition in recent years. In the short term this resulted from
the strong dollar of 1984 which, unfortunately, allowed domestic customers to
become acquainted with the quality and variety of grades of paper from other
countries and so has had to have had some potential for a lasting effect; and in
the long term it has resulted from intensive research/development/national
support in other countries with important pulp and paper industries which has
increased substantially the competition from abroad. A planning workshop will be
held in 1988, at the University of Maine to conduct discussions by experts in
pulp and paper research and its management which will lead to an integrated
statement of the research needs of the U.S. Pulp and Paper industry and identify
those on which government, industry and academia could best mount cooperative
efforts. Seven categories have been defined for group discussion of research
needs. Individuals have been identified to organize and lead the discussions.
The role of each category in affecting the performance of the industry will be
studied and discussed. A Workshop Proceedings will be prepared to bring together
the discussions and recommendations of the Workshop. These Proceedings will be
distributed to key organizations in the U.S.
