The project is gathering and analyzing stories and data that chronicle and
document lessons learned from the numerous initiatives directed toward
transforming the undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) learning environment over the last 25 years. These lessons are serving as
a roadmap for others continuing to build the kind of undergraduate natural
science communities that attract students to STEM fields and motivate them to
persist and succeed. Distilling and disseminating the essence of what works
provides guidance for those working to shape the innovators and life-long
learners needed for a transformational society. The investigator is preparing a
series of monthly postings on the PKAL web site that will cumulate in a major
web-based report.
