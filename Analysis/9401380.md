9401380 Bercovici The proposed work is in three directions. The first is in
basic operator theory. The theory of dual algebras will be applied to study
pairs of commuting operators. These techniques were most successful in the case
of single operators. The second direction is related to the study of
interpolation and lifting problems associated with the concept of structured
singular value. These issues are interesting as problems in operator theory but
they also have applications for control theory. The third direction is a
development of earlier work in the framework of Voiculescu's free harmonic
analysis. The convolution theory in this analysis still has many aspects which
are not well understood. For instance, the domain of attraction to the
semicircle distribution in the central limit theorem is not known. Problems on
large deviations have not been studied in this context. This project lies at the
interface of several branches of mathematics (operator theory, probability,
function theory). Much of the project involves a better understanding and new
results in these disciplines. Further, parts of the project have a significant
interaction with control theory and systems theory, and the results might have
an impact on calculations related to the control of large systems. ***
