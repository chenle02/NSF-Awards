9703695 Strauss The purpose of this project is to study mathematical models of
waves that occur in the theories of plasmas, of fluids, and of other branches of
physical science. Stability and instability phenomena will be investigated,
particularly in the kinetic theory of charged particles with and without
collisions. Stability problems for a variety of other kinds of waves, including
breathers, solitary waves and dispersive waves, will also be explored. Energy
conserving waves of marginal stability will be emphasized, and methods of
mathematical analysis will be employed in the investigations. Waves occur in
many forms in the physical environment, such as in the ocean, the atmosphere,
biochemical processes, acoustics, telecommunications, and so on. The most
complicated ones are the nonlinear ones, where it is difficult to predict the
outcomes without very complex calculations. Some of these nonlinear waves are
unstable, which means that a small change creates a large disturbance. Which
waves are stable and which are unstable will be the focus of this project. The
basic principles for understanding these phenomena are mathematical. These
principles are fundamental to the creation of high-performance computing
algorithms. We shall investigate the stability theory especially within the
theory of physical plasmas. The stability of nonlinear plasma waves is relevant
to such diverse applications as fusion energy research and satellite and radio
communications in space.
