Harry Atwater Abstract The acquistion of a quantitative high-resolution video
imaging system is proposed. The system will be used in conjunction with existing
transmission electron microscopes for (i) atomic-scale imaging of thin films and
nanoparticles, (ii) energy-filtered imaging of thin films and nanoparticles,
(iii) quantitative electron diffraction nmeasurements,a nd (iv) facilitating the
teaching of electron microscopy and microanalyis of materials. ***
