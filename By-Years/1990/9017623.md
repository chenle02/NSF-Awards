This project has two primary objectives designed to increase our understanding
of the replication of a plant rhabdovirus, sonchus yellow net virus (SYNV).
These objectives are: to continue ongoing studies of SYNV replication in
infected tobacco protoplasts; and to develop an in vitro system for
investigating transcription and replication of the SYNV genome. The protoplast
experiments will contribute to a more detailed understanding of events occurring
during the replication cycle of the virus and will permit analysis of the roles
the host may play in this process. The in vitro system will yeild information
relevant to the regulation of transcription, replication and encapsidation of
the SYNV genome products. Thus, this project will provide information of broad
biological significance for understanding the life cycles of negative strand
viruses and applications of their gene products for therapeutic purposes.
