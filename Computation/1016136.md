This work will extend two mathematical models for the dissolution and release
process occurring in sustained release matrix tablets. The first of these models
uses random walks on the weighted contact graph of a random dense packing of
spheres of multiple diameters. The second model consists of a system of partial
differential equations of reaction-diffusion type for the solved and unsolved
excipient and drug, respectively. We will develop new computational tools,
borrowing from theories of random walks on graphs, probability density
estimation, and numerical partial differential equations. The theoretical models
will be implemented in fast, robust code, and model parameters will be
calibrated to actual data in close collaboration with researchers in the
pharmaceutical sciences.

The team of investigators will develop mathematical and computational methods to
predict the release kinetics of sustained release matrix tablets. These tablets
are used to deliver an active drug and to gradually release it over an extended
period of time. Sustained release tablets offer considerable advantages over
immediate release tablets, namely maintaining more constant drug levels in the
patient's body while minimizing the number of tablets that need to be taken each
day. In previous work, jointly with collaborators in New Zealand (initiated by
NSF grant DMS-0737537), we have proposed mathematical models for the dissolution
and release process, predicting qualitatively excellent release curves for
different compositions of the powder mixture. This research will streamline the
design process of new and better pharmaceutical delivery devices and will
introduce computational methods into a new field of science. All programs will
be written in open source software and will be freely available online to
interested researchers.
