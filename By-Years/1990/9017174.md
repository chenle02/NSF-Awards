The goal of this research project is to develop computational methods for
investigating the dynamical behavior of chaotic attractors resulting from
systems of differential equations of moderately high dimension. The emphasis is
on systems of equations arising from inertial manifold reductions of PDE's
governing fluid flows at and somewhat beyond the onset of instabilities and
turbulence. The PI's interest is in characterizing the low dimensional dynamics
of systems which potentially have 10-100 degrees of freedom. The principal
components of the proposed work include: the development of accurate numerical
methods for the precise calculation of stable and unstable manifolds of
attractors in more than three dimensions; use of real-time color graphics for
improved visualization of the geometric structure of saddle orbits and the
associated manifolds; and the use of vectorized algorithms to exploit the power
of new computer hardware. The algorithms and resulting software packages are
intended to assist applied mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and students
investigating the dynamical behavior of systems of nonlinear ordinary and
partial differential equations.
