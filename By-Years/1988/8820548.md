This three-year continuing grant supports the work of von Goeler and
collaborators at Northeastern University on the "Large Volume Detector" (LVD)
underground experiment in the Gran Sasso, in Italy. This experiment is operated
by an international collaboration in a deep-underground facility constructed by
the government of Italy. The experiment will have many goals. Several of the
goals are: (1) to search for neutrinos from supernova explosions; (2) to search
for oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos; and (3) to detect solar neutrinos.
The experiment will be somewhat different from previous underground neutrino
experiments. The apparatus will be sensitive to neutrinos of lower energies, and
so will be able to answer new questions in the areas of elementary particle
physics and astrophysics.
