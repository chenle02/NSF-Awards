This is a planning visit award for Dr. Ronald D. McKelvey, of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, to meet with Drs. Mangala D.
Manandhar, Mohan B. Gewali, and Sarbajna M. Tuladhar, of the Central Department
of Chemistry at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, Nepal, for the purpose of
developing a cooperative research activity on the identification of medicinal
and pesticidal compounds from four varieties of high-altitude plants (Lobelia
pyramidalis, Arisaema totuosum, Lyonia ovalifolia, and Sapium insigne) found in
Nepal. Traditionally many Nepalese have used a wide variety of plants for
medicinal purposes and natural pest control, but at the present time little is
known about the chemical compounds in these plants. The planned activity would
identify the plant compounds which might be useful in producing medicines or
pesticides from natural products.
