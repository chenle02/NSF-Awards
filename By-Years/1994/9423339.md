Many biological systems can be adequately treated by assuming there is
homogeneous mixing and reducing the system to a differential equation. In some
systems, however, the spatial arrangement of individuals and stochastic effects
are important. The principal investigators will use stochastic spatial models to
explore four phenomena in which these effects play an important role: the
unexpectedly low fraction of heterozygotes for t haplotypes in the common house
mouse, the dynamics of hybrid zones which are maintained by heterozygote
unfitness, attempts at using a virus to control the spread of chestnut blight,
and competition of various strains of potato virus Y. This award is being
jointly funded by the Computational Biology Activity, the Statistics and
Probability, and the Ecological Studies programs.
