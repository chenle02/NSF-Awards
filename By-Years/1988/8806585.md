Nitrogen is the mineral element that plants require in greatest quantity and
its availability determines to a large extent the productivity of both natural
and cultivated ecosystems. The two mineral forms of nitrogen accessible to
plants are ammonium and nitrate. Little is known abut the relative importance of
ammonium and nitrate as nitrogen sources under field conditions, in part,
because of the methodological limitations. Nitrogen has no long-lived
radioisotope. Use of the stable isotope 15N-the most common approach for
measuring plant absorption from soils-has major disadvantages. The proposed
research shall develop new field methods for studying plant nitrogen absorption
utilizing methylamine, a chemical analog for ammonium, and chlorate, a chemical
analog for nitrate. These analogs have several advantages. They are not readily
metabolized in the soil. They can be used at low concentrations because they
have long-lived, radioactive forms, 14C-methylamine and 36Cl-chlorate. Moreover,
use of the radioactive forms can separate ammonium from nitrate absorption. The
objective is to design a procedure which uses only small amounts of radioactive
compounds and ensures that virtually no radioactive material is left in the
field. Field experiments using these techniques will access seasonal and spatial
changes in the availability of ammonium and nitrate. The distribution of tomato
roots through the soil should indicate whether roots develop special branching
patterns to optimize the absorption of ammonium or nitrate. Tomato mutants that
have diminished abilities to absorb ammonium or nitrate or unusual root
branching patterns have been isolated. Differences among the nitrogen
accumulation in these mutants and that in normal tomatoes should reflect the
relative importance of plant physiological mechanisms and root morphology on
ammonium or nitrate absorption from soils. This research brings together
innovative techniques and unique genetic material to examine nitrogen
acquisition under realistic conditions. This information should stimulate the
development of cultivars and agricultural practices that increase the efficiency
of nitrogen fertilizer use. Because the production of nitrogen fertilizer
expends from 1/3 to 1/2 of the total energy inputs in modern agriculture,
increased nitrogen fertilizer efficiency would dramatically reduce the energy
requirements of agriculture.
