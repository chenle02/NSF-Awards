9703942 Conley The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by
Dr. Charles H. Conley, of the University of Texas, Denton, to work with Dr.
Moshe Flato at the Universite de Bourgogne in Dijon, France. Dr. Flato is a
well-known expert in mathematical physics. Dr. Conley will study irreducible
unitary representations of gauge supergroups. He is trying to generalize them to
the setting of supergroups and supermanifolds. In addition, he will complete a
study on indecomposable representations of semidirect project Lie groups. He
will use the realizations he has found to show that the smooth indecomposable
representations with a preunitary composition series may be completed to
representations acting by bounded operators in a Hilbert space. In addition to
his work with Dr. Flato, the PI will also be able to work with active groups in
affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras, quantum groups, and star representations. ***
