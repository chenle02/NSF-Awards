The separation technique of ultracentrifugation will be added to the existing
work in chromatography and electrophoresis in the curriculum for Biology and
Biochemistry majors at Hood College. The ultracentrifuge will be used in three
courses: Genetics, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry. Students will isolate plasmid
DNA and bacteriophage lambda by isopyknic centrifugation in CsCl density
gradients and will fractionate liver cells by a series of velocity sedimentation
steps. All students in these courses (90% women) will have hands-on experience
with these modern biochemical separation techniques. The college will provide
50% matching funds.
