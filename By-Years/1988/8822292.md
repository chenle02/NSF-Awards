This award provides approximately one-half of the funds required to operate the
NSF-Arizona Accelerator Facility for Radioisotope Analysis on an annual basis.
The rest of the annual operational funds are to be raised from user fees. The
"carbon-14" method makes use of the known rate of radioactive decay of this
carbon isotope and the well-determined systematics of its chemistry in the
atmosphere-biosphere- lithosphere-hydrosphere cycles in order to use it as an
extremely valuable tool in dating natural samples and artifacts in the 100-
60,000 year range. The accelerator facility supported by this award extends the
use of the carbon-14 method to extremely small samples, samples with very small
concentrations of carbon, or very old samples with very little carbon-14
content.
