The National Academy of Sciences, Center for Education through the Board on
Testing and Assessment, will convene a committee to conduct a series of
activities over the next two years that will: (1) provide guidance to states on
designing and developing quality science assessments in light of requirements of
the No Child Left Behind Legislation; (2) foster communication and collaboration
between the NRC Committee and key stakeholders in states and school districts so
that the guidance provided is practical and useable. The Committee's report will
be widely disseminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
