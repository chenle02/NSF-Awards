This research project deals with a new method, called the short-time Gaussian
cell mapping method for solving nonlinear stochastic optimal control problems.
Stochastic nonlinear optimal control problems can be found in civil engineering
structures subject to earthquake, ocean waves, and wind loading excitations, in
precision machines, manufacturing processes and robots, and in armed vehicles
(land or air), target tracking systems and guidance systems operated in combat
or rough environments. Few effective methods exist for obtaining optimal control
solutions of complex nonlinear systems to random excitations. The method has
been applied to some very challenging nonlinear oscillators under Gaussian white
noise excitations and has been proven to be effective and accurate in analyzing
complex nonlinear stochastic systems. This project develops this method further
for nonlinear stochastic optimal control problems. The results of this research
provide the capability to more efficiently and accurately predict and control
the response of nonlinear systems subject to stochastic excitations, to better
assess the reliability of the system under harsh random environments, and to
develop new strategies for controlling the state-constrained stochastic system.
