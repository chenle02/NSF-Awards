This research is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of computer based research. This research involves a number of
inter-related research areas which combine separation and spectroscopic
detection to produce synergistic methods for the analysis of complex organic
mixtures. The overall goal of this research is to develop novel guidelines and
algorithms for integrated mixture analysis using software/hardware systems more
capable than those that are currently in use. This research encompasses many
areas of chemical analysis including chromatography, infrared spectrometry,
nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The use of these techniques in
combination should provide unique capabilities for analytical measurement of
samples with unknown compositions.
