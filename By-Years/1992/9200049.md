This award provides ongoing funds to the Department of Psychology at Kent State
University to support eight Junior-class level participants in a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates program. One of these will be a Kent State
student, while the remaining seven will be selected from nominees provided by
specified liberal- arts colleges in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.
Designated faculty members from the Psychology Departments of collaborating
institutions have agreed to serve as project coordinators to assist in the
initiation, organization, and follow-up of student research activity associated
with program operation. Student selection involves nomination by home faculty
and a familiarization visit to Kent (at Kent's expense) for interview and
introduction of project opportunities. Fourteen topics are available for choice
with the restriction that advisors and students be matched one-to-one.
Competitively selected awardees work with their individual advisor and engage in
training, travel to other institutions, and informational exchange with other
participants during ten summer weeks. Follow-up of analysis and reporting will
be monitored by the Project Director and local coordinators during the ensuing
Fall term.
