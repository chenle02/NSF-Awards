This award supports work in matrix theory. The principal investigator will seek
a better understanding of eigenvalues of (0,1)-matrices, partially ordered sets
with the fixed point property, transversal matroids especially those that arise
bicircular matroids of graphs, and tree-packing problems and their relation to
the joint-realization of (0,1)-matrices with prescribed row and column sums. The
co-principal investigator will work on non-negative matrices, the related class
of M-matrices and their generalizations, on scaling of matrices and inertia
theory of matrices. The work on sparse matrix analysis and the work on scaling
of matrices has applications to problems in manufacturing. A matrix is a
rectangular array with possible entries from a wide variety of rings. This is a
field which originated in the nineteenth century as part of algebra. It is
currently very active in view of its many applications and connections with
other parts of mathematics as well as other scientific and technical
disciplines.
