The fungal toxin fusicoccin (FC) binds to a receptor (FCBP) in the plasma
membrane (PM) of virtually all higher plant cells and causes enhanced proton
excretion by the plasma membrane proton- (ATPase). The ubiquitous nature of the
response suggests that the FCBP, a receptor for a compound a plant normally
never would encounter, is a conserved protein with a different but essential
function. If so, a loss of FCBPs should be lethal. To test this hypothesis, a
search is being made for mutant Arabadopsis thaliana plants which are
insensitive to FC and lack FCBPs. To characterize the FCBP, the FCBP gene will
first be isolated from an Arabadopsis genomic library. This will require
microsequencing the 31 kDa FCBP polypeptide which has been purified, and then
constructing an oligonucleotide probe. The manner in which FC-FCBP enhances
ATPase activity is uncertain. One possibility is that it alters the pH profile
for the ATPase to enchance its activity in the cytoplasmic pH range. It may do
so by increasing the content of lysophospholipids (LPL) in the PM. Two questions
concerning this hypothesis will be tested. First, are the FCBP and ATPase
sufficient for a FC effect or are other PM proteins required? Secondly, does FC
enhance the LPL content of the PM, and can increased LPL replace the requirement
for FC? Cells move chemicals across their membranes by a system of active
transport. The pumps are proteins but they are difficult to separate and purify
because they are located across and embedded in membranes. It is now possible to
study one of these proteins from plants because it has been purified. This
protein is thought to play a role in plant growth hormone action.
