Morgantown Algebra Days (MAD) is a conference on Commutative Algebra which is to
take place at West Virginia University on the weekend of April 25-26, 2020. The
main objective of the conference is to showcase new mathematical trends to a
large group of mathematicians specializing in the subject of Commutative Algebra
which is a ubiquitous mathematical subject whose techniques and results are
utilized in Algebraic Geometry, Combinatorics, Complex Analysis, Graph Theory,
Number Theory, Representation Theory, and other areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAD
2020 will showcase new trends in this constantly evolving subject, and it will
gather researchers at all levels (graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty,
and senior faculty) in the field for the purpose of developing collaborations
pertaining to future research. MAD 2020 aims to accomplish both of these goals
by featuring seven research talks from a diverse group of research
mathematicians and a poster session for junior researchers to present their
work. Further details about this conference will appear at
http://www.math.wvu.edu/mad2020/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
