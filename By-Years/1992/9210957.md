The learnability of classes of functions in various formal learning models will
be studied. There have been many negative results on learning even simple
classes of functions in the Valiant PAC model. One goal of this research is to
develop algorithms for learning relatively complex classes of functions in other
learning models. A related goal is to determine the relative power of some of
these learning models. Also proposed is the study of the relation between
learnability of a class of functions, structural properties of the class, and
the complexity of decision problems involving the class, in order to discover
which classes of functions are learnable, by what means they are learnable, and
what inherent qualities make them learnable.
