Ostfeld, R. S. DEB-9615414 The PIs propose to test the importance of direct and
indirect effects in oak forests of southeastern New York State. Episodic mast
production by oak trees appears to cause transient increases in the density of
rodent populations. Rodents, in turn, appear to regulate low-density gypsy moth
populations and are the primary reservoirs of the tick that carries Lyme
disease. The PIs will simulate mast production and measure the response in
rodent population levels. The effect of changes in mouse population densities
will be determined for survival of gypsy moth pupae and density of egg masses,
and parasitization rates of larval ticks and nymphal tick abundance. The PIs
will conduct rodent removal experiments to test the hypothesis that rodent
population density regulates gypsy moth population dynamics only during the low
phase of the moth cycle. Modeling of the interaction will determine the
sensitivity of system behavior to variation in the functional response of rodent
predation and acorn consumption and to variation in the rhythm of the masting
cycle. In addition to contributing to a more complete understanding of the
factors determining the structure and dynamics of ecological systems, the
results of this study will be applicable to the management of deciduous forests
and to two factors affecting quality of life in the northeast - gypsy moth
defoliation and the rapid spread of Lyme disease.
