Saluja This research addresses testing large, reconfigurable random access
memories for faults due to certain patterns originating in the physical
neighborhood of a memory cell. These are pattern sensitive faults (PSF). Current
methods do not deal with 5 and 9 cell neighborhoods, and are complex. In this
research, necessary and sufficient conditions to test check bits for
neighborhood pattern sensitive faults are being developed. Based on these
results, algorithms to test for 5 and 9 cell physical neighborhood PSFs in
random access memories (RAMs) are being designed. These algorithms deal with the
cases where logical and physical address spaces are not identical, memories are
reconfigured, and where built in error detection and correction techniques are
employed. The use of these algorithms for built in self test implementation is
being explored.
