This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
deals with the synthesis and study of compounds which are designed to model the
active site of blue copper proteins. These important proteins have a variety of
functions, including participation in electron-transfer chains and the transport
and activation of molecular oxygen. The target protein sites are the reduced and
oxidized sites of the blue proteins which participate in electron transfer
chains and the sequentially oxidized binuclear units in hemocyanins and
tyrosinases which respectively bind dioxygen for transport and activate dioxygen
to accomplish the ring hydroxylation of aromatic substrates. Previous work on
ligand design in this project has afforded redox-stable Cu(II) aliphatic
thiolates and Cu(I) and Cu(II) complexes having pseudotetrahedral coordination
by biologically realistic ligands, such as imidazoles, thiolates and thioethers.
The technology for synthesizing and elaborating polyimidazole ligands will be
further developed with the aim of preparing good synthetic approximations of
these target sites. The relationship of electronic structure to molecular
structure will be probed by a combination of crystallographic, electronic
spectral, electrochemical, epr, molecular orbital, and photoelectron
spectroscopic and single crystal spin-echo studies. General questions regarding
the epr properties of approximately tetrahedral Cu(II) and the nature of azide-
to-Cu(II) LMCT will be probed by oriented single crystal spectroscopic studies
of Cu(II) doped into isostructural Zn(II) lattices.
