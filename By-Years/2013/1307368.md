This project will extend and apply new computer simulation tools to predict the
behavior of nanoscale &lt;br/&gt;electronic designs. The applications will be to
designs with feature sizes so small that quantum mechanical
effects&lt;br/&gt;(interference, quantum coherence and quantum correlation) play
a central role, such that fundamental innovations in modeling are required to
get affordable &lt;br/&gt;realistic calculations for multiterminal designs.
There will be special focus on design and validation for quantum crossbar
structures, built from nanotubes, graphene &lt;br/&gt;ribbons and
nanowires.&lt;br/&gt; The calculations will be based on a multi-scale time-
dependent approach. The open-access simulation platform includes advanced first
principles molecular dynamics calculations for structural predictions based on
electronic structure calculations using density functional theory (DFT). The
simulation codes include efficient quantum transport codes with multi terminal
and first principles time-dependent transport simulation capabilities. The
multidomain decomposition method used in these calculations allow the PI to
simulate realistic systems containing tens of thousands of atoms. For the new
simulation, starting from single devices at the quantum level, the PI plans to
simulate complete quantum circuits.&lt;br/&gt; The new research will be
incorporated into future editions of the PI's book Computational Nanoscience,
his open-access simulation tools,&lt;br/&gt;and his work with the Vanderbilt
University summer schools and summer camps, and other streams of his substantial
track record in education and outreach.
