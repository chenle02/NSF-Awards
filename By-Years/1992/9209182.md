The project aims at interpreting long- and medium-run productivity dynamics in
light of various realistic factor market imperfections. In endogenous growth
models, productivity dynamics are driven by private optimal decisions to invest
in physical capital or knowledge. A lower income share for accumulated factors
such as physical capital and new knowledge implies lesser incentives to save
rather than consume, and slower productivity growth if private optimal
investment decisions are the engine of growth. Income shares may in turn be
explained in light of imperfectly competitive factor market interactions. This
research will seek interpretations for the post-1973 worldwide productivity
slowdown. Non-accumulated production factors such as natural resources and labor
enjoyed higher shares of worldwide production in the 1970s. This may be
explained in terms of changes in factor market structure, with a prominent role
for insider power in unionized labor markets and cartelization of natural
resource markets.
