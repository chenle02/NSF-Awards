Android software is widely used in smartphones, tablets, and various other
devices. In devices with limited resources, an application that consumes too
many resources can lead to slowdowns, crashes, and negative user experience.
Software defects related to leaking of resources are widespread and varied, but
there does not exist a comprehensive strategy for testing and debugging of such
leaks. Another common problem in Android software is when an application takes
too long to respond to a user action, in which case it is perceived as sluggish
and of low quality. There do not exist testing techniques or tools for exposing
the underlying software defects leading to poor responsiveness.

Resource leaks and poor responsiveness can have severe effects on software
reliability, performance, and marketplace success. This project develops
LeakDroid, a novel approach and toolset for testing and debugging of such
defects. Static code analyses are used to extract precise GUI models of Android
applications; such analyses are essential for many algorithms for program
understanding, optimization, testing, and debugging. Next, GUI tests are
generated based on common leak patterns, through sequences of GUI events that
should not lead to increases in resource usage. Poor responsiveness is exposed
with tests that introduce delays at chosen code locations. Debugging techniques
are then employed to find leaking data structures and poor responsiveness
operations, as well as the corresponding defective code. These contributions
advance the state of the art in the important area of analysis, testing, and
debugging for Android software. When these advances and tools become part of
software development practices, they would result in lower costs and increased
quality applications for millions of users of mobile devices. The educational
efforts of the project develop the skills of the next generation of creators of
mobile software
