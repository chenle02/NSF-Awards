This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program supports U.S.
participation in a U.S.- Brazilian Workshop on Dynamics and Control of Multi-
body Systems to be held at the Instituto Politecnico do Rio de Janeiro,
Friburgo, Brazil, from March 1-5, 1993. The organizers are Professor Richard
Montgomery of the University of California, Santa Cruz and Dr. Jair Koiller of
the National Laboratory of Scientific Computing, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The
purpose of the workshop is to bring together U.S. and Brazilian mathematicians
to discuss recent progress in the study of complex interconnected mechanical
systems with rigid as well as elastic components. The tradition of excellence of
Brazil in dynamical systems coupled with the high quality of the proposed U.S.
participants will lead to an interaction that will lay the groundwork for future
collaboration.
