The principal investigator will analyze the hyperbolic behavior of finite
systems of interacting problems. Specifically, he will investigate the ergodic
theory or long term behavior of a system of n particles in a line subject to an
appropriate external force. The project will also investigate diffusion around a
particular stable solution of the dynamical system. The research considers a
special case of a problem, the n-body problem, which has resisted complete
solution since Newton.
