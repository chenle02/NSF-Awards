This award supports a two-year collaborative research project between Professor
Eugene C. Loh of the University of Utah and Professor Motohiko Nagano of the
University of Tokyo. Together the investigators will attempt to develop a very
high resolution camera that can be used as the light signal detector in a high
energy cosmic ray detector and perform a number of studies related to the design
of a very large cosmic ray detector. The Japanese group under the direction of
Professor Nagano operates the world's largest surface detectors, called AGASA,
designed to detect electrons, muons, and gamma rays. The U.S. group operates the
world's only nitrogen scintillation detector called the Fly's Eye Detector.
Topics of mutual interest to the two groups include measurements of the cosmic
ray energy spectrum, chemical composition, and anisotropy. The common goal is to
discover where and how these extremely energetic particles are accelerated. The
search for point sources of neutral particles is a high priority for both
groups. In addition to the principal investigator, five other scientists and
technicians specializing in electronics, calibration, analysis, and computer
modelling will participate in the project.
