In pelagic systems, the microbial foodweb represents the primary link for fixed
carbon to metazoan food chains, while at the same time a large fraction of
phytoplankton production is respired by microbes. Recent studies suggest that
phagotrophic flagellates less than 5 um are the dominant grazers of
picoplankton, while slightly larger flagellates (5-10 um) consume both
autotrophic and heterotrophic cells less than 5um, and flagellates and ciliates
larger than 10 um prey on smaller flagellates. There is also preliminary data
that suggest that some phagotrophic flagellates may be capable of direct uptake
of high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (DOM). This research is to
examine the sources of nutrition, including DOM, bacteria and cyanobacteria,
phytoplankton and colorless flagellates, as well as the rates of growth, of
phagotrophic flagellates in three size classes of nanoplankton (less than 5 um,
5-10 um, and greater than 10 um) in the open waters of a salt marsh estuary.
