&lt;br/&gt;This research designs and examines models in which credit constraints
arise endogenously due to imperfect enforcement, and considers the consequences
it has for life-cycle behavior of consumption, labor supply and investment in
human and physical capital. The endogeneity of the constraints allows the models
to capture the response of private markets to the policies of the government.
The policies examined include taxation of labor and capital income, education
subsidies, public provision of schooling, and social security. The research also
analyzes changes in the institutional framework of private creditor markets, and
examines the existing Guaranteed Student Loan Program . &lt;br/&gt; It is
expected that insights and findings from the research will be used for
evaluating, and suggesting possible improvements in the current student loan
programs in the United States. It is important to understand how the Guaranteed
Student Loan Program affects incentives to invest in human capital, interacts
with credit markets, and generates incentives to default. More efficient loan
programs may be possible, and can only be found by understanding the origins of
credit constraints.&lt;br/&gt;
