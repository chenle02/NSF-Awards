The Populus genome has been sequenced to a 7.5X depth, a BAC-based physical map
has been created, and an initial draft assembly containing more than 90% of the
euchromatic genome has been constructed. We will consolidate these resources by
integrating all Populus genomic information and resources into a web-based
portal that will provide direct access to the entire genomics community and
promote further functional and comparative genomic research among all plant
species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among biologically derived materials, wood-based
products are second only to maize in their monetary contribution to the U.S.
economy. The genus Populus, including poplars, cottonwoods and aspens, is
recognized as a model for forest tree research due to its ease of propagation,
relatively short reproductive cycle, small genome size, and transformability.
Populus is also of major ecological importance, and the genomics tools derived
from this study will provide a new platform for investigation of ecosystem
processes. Populus is uniquely positioned taxonomically relative to Medicago and
Arabidopsis, allowing rigorous comparison of genetic differences underlying
species with similar complements of genes but contrasting life histories and
growth habits. This project will thus enable the Populus, Medicago and
Arabidopsis genome resources to be used synergistically to provide breakthrough
insights into the molecular underpinnings of contrasting plant life
histories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Populus Genome Portal will be accessible
