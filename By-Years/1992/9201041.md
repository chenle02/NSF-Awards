The primary objectives of this research if to explore the synthesis of new
ternary compounds of the type A+?(MX)!, where M is a transition metal. The
structural relationship of these metal compounds are similar to some extent to
the well-known Zintl compounds. A variety of techniques will be used to
characterize the compounds. These include, x-ray diffraction, NMR and Ir
spectroscopies, DTA and TGA analysis, and measurements of resistivity and
magnetic susceptibility. The proposed research is exciting because it has
potentials for developing new high- temperature superconductors.
