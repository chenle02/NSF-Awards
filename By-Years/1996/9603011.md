This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in mechanics of
materials involves the research groups of Rob B. Phillips at Brown University
and Giles Canova at the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble in Grenoble,
France. The objective of the research is to investigate plastic deformation
using a mixed atomistic and continuum method. The project takes advantage of
complementary expertise of the U.S. and French investigators and amalgamates two
different methods and types of simulation. Their models will advance
understanding of the permanent deformation of structures.
