Phonological Form, Morphological Class, and Syntactic Gender: The Noun Class
Systems of Papua New Guinea Arapesh. This research will add to the understanding
of linguistic clasification by collecting and analyzing data on the Arapesh
dialects spoken in Papua New Guinea. Arapesh nouns are assigned to genders
(agreement classes) not according to their semantics, but rather according to
their phonological form. Arapesh speech will be carefully recorded so that the
phonological system may be analyzed, gender agreement will be documented, and
the precise basis of classification will be determined for each of the dialects.
The proposed research will (1) document an extraordinary linguistic system that
is currently being leveled under contact pressure, (2) contribute to linguistic
typology by drawing attention to a new dimension of structure which is relevant
to classification, and (3) challenge the fundamental assumption of modern
cognitive science that subdomains of knowledge are informationally encapsulated.
