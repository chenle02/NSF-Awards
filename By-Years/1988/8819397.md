Their proposal is to continue to develop and apply analytical methods in the
electronic structure of solids, complementary to the more widely used
computational techniques. As part of this program they would include Coulomb
effects selfconsistently in the tight-binding theory of transition-metal and
f-shell-metal compounds. They would also incorporate these effects in the theory
of the bonding properties of covalent solids, using improvements in the overlap
repulsion suggested by Van Schilfgaarde and Sher. They propose also to study the
temperature dependence of band edges, first using tight-binding theory and
second using pseudopotential theory, and then to compare the two theories.
Finally, they would like again to direct a student in a program closely
associated with one of the experimental programs at Stanford.
