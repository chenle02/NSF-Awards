9550692 Travis The purpose of the Research Careers for Minority Scholars (RCMS)
Program at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is to increase the
number of minority student graduating in mathematics and statistics, to enhance
their educational achievements, and to increase the number who attend graduate
school and pursue careers in these fields. To this end, UTSA will make available
scholarships to talented undergraduate students. We will identify and recruit 18
honors minority students (4 each of freshmen and sophomores and 5 each of
juniors and seniors) to participate in the program. The program will be strongly
research oriented and the capstone will be a mentor relationship between
research faculty and RCMS Scholars. The faculty participants will be asked to
commit themselves to mentor relationships with students, to encourage them to
pursue graduate training, and to assist in addressing and solving academic and
personal problems. Program elements include (1) Mentor relationships with a
faculty research mentor and graduate student; (2) An EXCEL Summer Bridge Program
for in-coming freshman; (3) Curriculum enhancement, using Calculus as the
anchor; (4) Summer research internship in mathematics and statistics; (5) Honors
Research and Professional Development Seminars; (6) Undergraduate Research
courses; (7) Distinguished Guest Lecturer Series, utilizing minority role models
in the science; (8) Participation in at least one professional meeting at the
state or national level during the academic year; (9) Special Workshops such as
Preparing for the GRE and Getting Into Graduate School; (10) Academic and career
advisement; and (11) Aggressive retention efforts.
