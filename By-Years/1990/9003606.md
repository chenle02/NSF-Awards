With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Barbara Stark will conduct
sourcing analysis of ca. 174 obsidian artifacts recovered from archaeological
contexts in the Veracruz region of Mexico. In the course of previous NSF funded
research, Dr. Stark has examined the prehistory of this small region located on
the Gulf coast of Mexico. In contrast to the central highlands region, Veracruz
never developed into a large and powerful state but rather was characterized by
smaller polities. Dr. Stark, therefore, looked at Veracruz as a marginal area
and wished to discover how it interacted with and was affected by these more
powerful states. Because obsidian (volcanic glass) makes excellent stone tools
which hold a sharp edge, it was highly prized in antiquity and was widely
traded. It is also of interest to archaeologists because its distribution in
Middle America is highly localized and the number of sources small. Individual
sources are chemically distinct, and through trace element analysis it is
possible to match obsidian artifact with its geological source. On this basis it
is possible to trace the movement of obsidian, to reconstruct economic patterns,
and in turn to gain insight into the changing political landscape. In this
project, the University of Missouri will conduct neutron activation analysis on
a series of obsidian artifacts from a number of Veracruz sites. Through these,
interactions with larger central Mexican states can be reconstructed. This
research is important because it will increase our understanding of how the
complex societies characteristic of many portions of the world develop and are
maintained. It will also allow the maximum amount of information to be obtained
from an already successful project.
