Students of biology must learn the theoretical basis of molecular biology and
also acquire practical experience with the methods used in this critically
important and rapidly expanding field. This project will establish an
instructional unit in molecular biology in the Introductory Biology Laboratory
Curriculum at the University of California at Santa Barbara. This unit is
composed of two three-hour laboratory exercises, in which students will explore
extraction of DNA from intact cells, restriction endonuclease digestion, the
electrophoretic separation of DNA, and analysis of DNA fragment size, and a one-
hour computer-assisted restriction mapping exercise.
