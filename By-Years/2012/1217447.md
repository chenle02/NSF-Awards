This proposal presents a plan to attack the problem of manipulating flexible
materials like string and wire using minimal sensing and actuation. Flexible
materials are ubiquitous in manufacturung and surgery, and human examples
demonstrate that complex manipulation of flexible materials is possible, from
knot-tying to folding laundry or even origami. Robots are currently far less
capable in these domains, leaving many boring, repetitive factory tasks
inaccessible to robotic automation. Current simulation models of flexible
objects are too computationally complex for standard approaches to manipulation
planning to be effective. Furthermore, although the simulated dynamic behavior
of a piece of string using existing models might be visually believable, the
behavior is unlikely to match any particular piece of string in the real world
and, therefore, is of limited use.

Knot tying has many applications ranging from manufacturing to surgery to
agriculture and service robots. Manipulation of deformable objects is
fundamental to many manufacturing and household applications. The proposed work
has application to factory operations and seems to apply to potential future
needs in manipulation of linear, flexible 1-D structures such as carbon
nanotubes and proteins.

Broader Impacts: The development of reliable, inexpensive techniques for
manipulation of flexible materials goes beyond the obvious potential impact on
factory automation. Minimalism is particularly appropriate for problems
involving manipulation at new scales. Fixtures for tying knots might be built at
the microscale, allowing parallel manipulation of many very tiny threads or
rods. Although we emphasize that the focus of the current work is on theoretical
foundations and manipulation at the macro-scale, one can imagine using cleverly-
designed geometries to manipulate carbon nano-tubes or proteins - things not
possible with standard serial arm designs.
