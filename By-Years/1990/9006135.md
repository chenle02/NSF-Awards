This research is concerned with the dynamics of matrix differential equations
and their applications. These matrix differential equations are cast in fairly
general frameworks of which special cases have been found to be closely related
to important numerical algorithms. In particular, the dynamics of each matrix
differential equation will be explored using computer experiments, high
resolution graphics and symbolic manipulation, in conjunction with analysis.
This study is expected to find important applications ranging from new
developments of numerical algorithms to theoretic solutions of open problems.
