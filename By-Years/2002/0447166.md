This CAREER project aims to develop a research and education program to foster
positive and healthy youth development through the use of multi-user, virtual
environments called identity construction environments (ICEs), which are
hypothesized to foster new kinds of communities of learning and care. One
context where such technologies may have the most impact is in situations where
youth might otherwise be isolated and in danger of developing mental health-
related problems. The PI will work with youth at the Boston Children's Hospital
that have suffered severe renal and cardiac failure and who wouldn't otherwise
survive without medical interventions such as heart and kidney transplants. An
applied developmental model provides a framework to design ICEs. It also
provides a model for doing research in complex real world settings. It is
hypothesized that ICEs will 1) promote positive youth development (measured as
competence, connection, character, confidence, caring and contribution to civil
society), 2) complement and augment face-to-face psychosocial interventions, and
3) that the positive effects are due to design features and the nature of online
activities that engage youth in cognitive, social and emotional development.
Educational activities include research opportunities for undergraduate and
graduate students in an interdisciplinary research group, service learning in
healthcare and community-based settings, new courses and curricula for students
from a variety of disciplines: education, mental health, engineering and
computer science.
