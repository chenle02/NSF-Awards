As they gain expertise in problem solving, humans increasingly rely on patterns
and spatially-oriented reasoning. The goals of this project are to learn pattern
associations and spatially-oriented reasoning, and then to integrate the
knowledge to make decisions in conjunction with other high-level reasoning. This
research develops an associative visual pattern classifier and algorithms for
the automated acquisition of new, spatially-oriented reasoning agents. These
components are readily integrated into a multi-agent decision making program for
broad classes of related problems. The pre-existing program robustly combines
agents with conflicting perspectives and withstands incomplete and erroneous
evidence for the early stages of learning. It makes decisions with a hierarchy
of modules representing individual, limitedly rational, heuristic agents. Each
agent may draw upon a variety of knowledge bases generated and maintained by
various learning strategies. The new visual pattern classifier learns meaningful
patterns from experience. In addition, domain-specific spatial concepts are
generalized from these patterns to create new heuristic agents.
