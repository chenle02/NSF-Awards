Collaborating groups are dynamic affairs in which patterns of activity, working
styles, levels of interaction, information structures and other elements emerge
dynamically in response to the circumstances and settings in which work is
carried out. In contrast, the technologies that we offer to support
collaboration are static and rigid. Conventional software architectures support
only limited degrees of adaptation and dynamic response. Combining analysis,
design, and evaluation, this research investigates metalevel architectures, an
alternative approach supporting radically dynamic application response. If
successful, this will yield both applications and application platforms which
provide much more seamless support for collaboration than is currently possible.
It also forges new connections between the two major areas of CSCW research,
social analysis and technical design. The complex relationship between these two
areas of interest is a major challenge to research and teaching. This research
further supports the training of a new generation of CSCW researchers who are
not just familiar with both halves of the puzzle, but have the skills to put
them together. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
