9714999 Reys A national center, the Show-Me Center, is established at the
University of Missouri, Columbia for facilitating and supporting implementation
of middle school mathematics curriculum based on recommendations of the
Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics issued by the
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The Show-Me Center, in partnership
with the five NSF-supported middle school mathematics materials development
projects (Connected Mathematics Project; Seeing and Thinking Mathematically;
Mathematics in Context; Six Through Eight Mathematics, and Middle-school
Mathematics Through Applications Project) and their commercial publishers,
disseminates information and facilitates national awareness and implementation
of new curricular models which support Standards-based reform in middle school
mathematics classrooms. Each materials development project serves as a satellite
center and is a focal point for establishing networks of teachers, schools,
districts, and state leadership personnel exploring and investing in standards-
based reform.
