Quantum computing and technology are poised to transform society and business.
However, the quantum computers that exist today have yet to live up to this
promise, in large part because their key component ‚Äìthe quantum bit or qubit ‚Äì
is too prone to errors. Early digital computers also suffered from unreliable
components, but over time new technologies such as the transistor have made
today‚Äôs computers cheaper, smaller, and more reliable. Broadly, the goal of this
CAREER project is to spur on similar developments in quantum technologies by
designing qubits that are significantly more reliable than those used today.
These low-error ‚ÄúSecond Generation‚Äù qubits could accelerate the development of
the large-scale, robust quantum computers needed to solve problems of societal
interest. Additionally, this CAREER project seeks to increase public engagement
with quantum technology and to broaden access to quantum education for
scientists and engineers across disciplines. These aims will be met through
establishing a Boulder-Denver area quantum community meetup and by developing a
publicly-available introductory quantum course that will be shared with other
educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER proposal will develop theoretical
foundations for novel types of ultra-low error qubits. These Second Generation
qubits could transform the landscape of quantum technology, as low error qubits
are critical ingredients for realizing the promise of quantum computation. While
remarkable progress has already been made on reducing qubit errors across
hardware modalities, these first-generation qubits are designed to perform just
below the required error rate for implementing fault-tolerant quantum error
correction. A guiding principle in the development of second generation qubits
is: the qubit should be constructed so that the physical laws provide immunity
from certain errors. This CAREER proposal will pursue the development of second
generation qubits using this principle in superconducting circuits. The major
objectives of the project are to (1) develop two-qubit gates for a second
generation qubit called the 0‚ÄìœÄ qubit, (2) design a new class of ultra protected
second generation qubits ‚Äì cos(Nùúë) qubits, and (3) develop error protected gates
for second generation qubits. The designs proposed will be validated by
simulation with noise models. To determine whether the proposed qubits and gate
have superior performance, their performance will be evaluated by comparing them
to the most successful superconducting qubit: the
transmon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
