The objective of this program is to develop "optical wings" that allow the
controlled transport of objects through space and liquids using radiation
pressure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit combines optical and
aerodynamic design principles to achieve rotationally stable flight. The
transformative idea is that by controlling shape and optical properties,
efficient and stable optical wings can be made into practical devices for use in
air, water, and outer space. The proposed research holds the potential to find
all-optical means of navigating large solar sails for future space travel, with
the promise of lighter weight sail-crafts compared to those requiring mechanical
controls. Smaller earth-bound optical wings may be used to transport tissues in
a buoyant liquid environment, or to scuttle micro-machines across a horizontal
surface in air. As the Wright brothers discovered, mastering rotational
stability is the paramount concern for controlling flight.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are (1) advanced warning times for
solar storms, (2) low-cost high-speed space missions, (3) microscopic transport
techniques for use in biological and materials science, (4) opto-mechanical
sensors for use in bio-medicine or chemical detection. Students, ranging from
the graduate to the high school level, will participate in this research and
thereby develop practical hands-on experiences in the laboratory as well as
computer, technical writing, and scientific presentation skills. These efforts
provide a path and a vision for younger students to strive for high goals in an
encouraging environment, as well as opportunities for advanced students to
develop experimental and analytical multidisciplinary skills in optics, micro-
fabrication, and aerodynamics.
