Competition for scarce resources in the face of birth and death (the struggle
for survival) has shaped social and economic interaction since the very
beginnings of mankind. This research is the first to induce selection pressure
in controlled strategic decision-making experiments using performance-based
replacement of participants over time. The studies advance unique insights into
how real-life human decision makers manage short- versus long-term strategic
tradeoffs in the face of evolutionary competition. The effect of selection
pressure on strategic decision-making is assessed by comparing two treatment
conditions. In the selection pressure condition participants' survival (and
payoffs) depend on their performance relative to that of other participants.
Performance is evaluated every few periods and participants earning low payoffs
relative to their peers are more likely to be replaced by new, inexperienced
performers. In the control, no pressure condition, participants are selected for
removal with the same frequency as under the selection pressure situation, but
removal is random rather than based on relative performance. This experimental
design enables the causal identification of the effects of selection pressure on
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategic decision-making is considered in three
well-known economic applications, each with and without selection pressure. The
first application is to repeated Tullock-type rent seeking contests. The
experiment uses selection pressure to empirically separate evolutionary adaptive
and maladaptive psychological mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the
intensely competitive behavior of contestants in previous contest experiments
that lacked selection pressure. The second application concerns evolving norms
and social change. Selection pressure in repeated coordination games is used to
study how short-term risks and long-term gains lead to path-dependencies in
experimental equilibrium selection. The final application is to bargaining. In
repeated Nash Demand games, the study addresses whether selection pressure helps
increase the efficiency of bargaining conventions relative to results from
previous experiments without selection pressure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
