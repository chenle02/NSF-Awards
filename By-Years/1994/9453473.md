9453473 Lehman This is a Presidential Faculty Fellow (PFF) Award. Research
during the award period includes a study of the theory and applications of
vibrational control and robust periodic feedback control as applied to finite
and infinite dimensional systems such as jet engines and chemical processes. A
primary emphasis is placed on the development of open-loop vibration control and
results are compared to those obtained via classical feedback control
techniques. In addition, multi-media interactive instructional material is
developed in the area of automatic control systems. This material is placed on a
world-wide web (W3) which is a global hypertext-based system for accessing
information on the Internet. As such, students throughout the world are able to
have access to this material using the hyperlink capabilities of Xmosiac, a
multi-media W3 browser. ***
