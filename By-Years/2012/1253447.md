The 8th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and
Technologies(CoNEXT) will take place from December 10 to December 13 2012 in
Nice, France. CoNEXT is a highly selective (&lt;20%), high-quality conference
sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM). The
conference is a major forum for presentation and discussion of novel networking
protocols and technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests funds to
partially support the travel of 10 US-based graduate students. The support
amount will be $1,500 or the actual documented amount of expenses, whichever is
less. Each student will need to cover expenses in excess of the fixed amount
from other funds. Preference in the award of the travel grants will be given to
students who have their work accepted to the CoNEXT student workshop which will
take place the first day of the conference. Other criteria will include evidence
of a serious interest in networking, as demonstrated by coursework and/or
project experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;This project
integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier
technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have
the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior
researchers in the field both in the main conference and the associated
workshops. The PI will especially encourage women and under-represented groups
to participate.
