This study of the dynamics of a stable atmospheric boundary layer will be
carried out jointly by the University of California, Davis, and the NOAA Wave
Propagation Laboratory, and will concentrate on the importance of intermittent
and episodic forcing mechanisms in determining the structure and energy transfer
within the lowest layers of the antarctic troposphere. The study will combine
ground-based remote sensing techniques with theoretical and modelling analyses,
particularly of wave phenomena. The field phase of the project will be carried
out at Amundsen-Scott South Pole station because of its reliably stable boundary
layer, its smooth air-snow interface, and its lack of a diurnal solar cycle. A
monostatic Sodar, the acoustic analogue of Radar, will provide continuous time-
height depictions of the boundary layer structure, while a Radar profiler will
be used to extend the observations to an altitude of 3000 meters. Two arrays of
microbarographs will monitor the passage of internal gravity waves, while a
network of Automatic Weather Stations on the 100 kilometer scale will provide
information on the regional pressure distribution.
