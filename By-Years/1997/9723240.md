PI: Steve Bressler Visuomotor Control by Large-Scale Distributed Cortical
Networks The aim of this research project is to understand how different parts
of the brain work together to allow us to move based on what we see. These
scientists are designing sophisticated computer analysis techniques to measure
properties of brain signals that occur when the brain must interpret visual
patterns and use the information to make a movement. Previous results from this
project showed that brain waves from many parts of the cerebral cortex,
including but not limited to visual and motor parts, briefly become aligned when
the brain is deciding how to respond to a visual pattern. This suggests that the
alignment of wavelike signals from many parts of the cortex is important for
brain function. The objectives of this project are: (1) to observe how the
normal brain processes visual input signals and transforms them into motor
command signals, and (2) to advance our general understanding of similar large-
scale integration problems which arise in many engineering applications.
