This research will gain a better understanding of the depositional setting and
post-depositional alteration of hardgrounds (submarine-cemented layers exposed
on the sea floor) during the Phanerozoic (the last 600 million years) and to
determine the relationship of hardground properties to temporal oscillations in
the physical and chemical nature of the oceans. From a large suite of
Phanerozoic hardgrounds through field work and from existing collections,
samples will be systematically studied using a integrated textural-isotopic-
elemental approach. Standard petrographic and microanalytical methods will be
augmented by the new technologies of quantitative cathode luminescence
spectrometry and synchrotron radiation induced x-ray fluorescence (SRIXE). In
addition to providing a new understanding of hardground sedimentology and
diagenesis, the project should: 1. yield compositional criteria by which marine
calcitic cements may be recognized in ancient limestones; 2. provide new insight
on chemical conditions favoring cement precipitation and subsequent diagenesis;
3. advance the understanding of cathodoluminescence in carbonates, and 4. yield
new information on the apparent temporal trends in ocean- atmosphere
compositions and carbonate cement mineralogy. The combined methodologies to be
employed should open new avenues of research in carbonate petrology and
sedimentology.
