9531844 Moo-Young The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effects of
freezing and thawing on the permeability of fine-grained soils used for landfill
cover material. Laboratory-compacted samples of fine-grained soils used in
landfill covers are subjected to one- and three- dimensional freezing. The
permeability of the frozen and thawed samples is measured. X-ray techniques are
performed on unfrozen and frozen laboratory compacted clay samples to analyze if
the formation of ice lenses and shrinkage cracks are caused by freezing and
thawing, or if the ice lenses and shrinkage cracks are created by the method of
compaction. The microstructure of fine-grained soils subjected to various
freeze/thaw cycles is studied using scanning electron microscopy to determine
particle orientation and distribution that results from freezing and thawing.
