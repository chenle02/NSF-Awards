Spatial quantization of the electron wavefunction and changes in electron
scattering which result from the concomitant phase space restrictions will
become evident as current micron-size field effect transistors are shrunk to 1/4
micron sizes. Experiments will be conducted to observe electromagnetically
induced electron transitions between spatially quantized levels in devices of
dimension 0.1 to 0.3 um. The issues of quantum-statistical limits and behavior,
discrete energy level structure, and single electron behavior may be addressed
by these studies.
