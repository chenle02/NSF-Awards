The objective of this research is to perform exploratory research to assess the
potential capability of wide-band radar in imaging FRP-confined concrete
systems. The proposed work will scientifically test a novel idea of focusing
through data processing of multiple scattering microwave signals in
distinguishing different damage levels under the FRP layers. Capabilities
including the optimization of resolution, penetration, and computing time will
be tested. Owing to the novelty of the study, we will bring together the
expertise from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Department
of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Research Laboratory of
Electronics, and Lincoln Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.

Successful completion of this project would lead to an enormous scientific
impact and lead us to the next phase of developing new imaging technologies for
FRP-confined concrete systems. Such technologies are urgently needed, and would
revolutionize industrial practices and better help ensure public safety. In view
of the novelty and impacts of the subject, this proposal is considered suitable
for an SGER grant.
