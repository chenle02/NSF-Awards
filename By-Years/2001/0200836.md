0200836&lt;br/&gt;Rabalais&lt;br/&gt;This award to Louisiana Universities Marine
Consortium provides instrumentation to update and expand the oceanographic
research capabilities of the research vessel Pelican, a ship operated by LUMCON
as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS)
research fleet. The present award supports acquisition and commissioning of a
new, 75 kHz acoustic current profiler with phased array technology. It will
significantly extend the depth to which profiles of ocean current velocity can
be collected during vessel operations. These improvements will be of substantial
advantage to marine scientists using the ship in their research during 2002 and
future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
