The PI proposes to study departures of the geomagnetic field from the geocentric
axial dipole which provides a very good model for the Earth's magnetic field.
These departures from the dipole field model will be determined in sedimentary
cores and will be used to model the contribution of small scale changes in the
Earth's magnetic field for the last 5 million years. This work is a continuation
of earlier work in the equatorial Indian and Atlantic Oceans; the PI proposes to
identify still smaller deviations of the magnetic field by studying higher
latitude cores where that effect is best seen. This study in combination with
the earlier work will provide a fine-scale analysis of the magnetic field
behaviour of the Earth.
