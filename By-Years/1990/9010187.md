Dystonia, the lack of muscle control with loss of muscle strength indicates a
neural deficit. The question is where in the brain is the deficit? A useful
model for studying dystonia is a genetic mutant rat ,the dt rat. The disorder in
this mutant does not appear until the second week after birth and its neuronal
morphology appears to be normal. To get a handle on the deficit the investigator
has used harmaline a drug known to cause tremor inthe second week after birth
and to act specifically on a neural circuit in the brainstem, the IO-Cerebellar
circuit. Dt rats do not respond to haramline even during the first weeks of
life. This to be used as a clue for investigating the physiological deficit in
the dt rat. Harmaline will be administered in infant rats and the whole circuit
tested to see if one or all synaptic linkages in the IO pathway are the source
of the dystonia. The novel idea of using harmaline which has been well
characterized,provides a pharmacological instrument for analysing a specific
neural system involved in motor movement.
