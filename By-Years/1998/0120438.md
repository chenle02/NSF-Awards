The workshop will be convened to address the issues raised in the recent report
from the National Research Council, Grand Challenges in the Environmental
Sciences, concerning the use of materials. The objective of the workshop is to
recommend a research agenda needed to reinvent the use of materials. Topics will
include material budgets and cycles, their resource and environmental
implications, the next generation of products and materials, optimization of
material cycles, and scenarios for the future use of materials. Participants
will include research scientists in academia, industry, and relevant
agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcomes will include a 5-year plan
for the implementation of an initial detailed research program, a strategy for
developing the necessary research integration across the disciplines, a program
for training individuals in the topical area of materials use, and a strategy
for coordinating the program results with those of the other grand challenge
initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
