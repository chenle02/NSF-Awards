This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has the goal of
developing a technology that accelerates the discovery of drugs for a broad
range of diseases. The proposed technology, termed SAMDI, is innovative in that
it combines advances in materials science and mass spectrometry to allow the
rapid testing of potential drug candidates. The technology uses robotic liquid
handling and high-density assay plates that are modified with substrate
molecules that are modified by enzymes that alter the structures of the
molecules. This change in structure is characterized by mass spectrometry and
provides a simple assay for the enzyme activity. The SBIR project will translate
the SAMDI assay to a high throughput format that can assay many thousands of
samples in a day in an automated fashion.

The broader/commercial impacts of this research are expected in the early stages
of drug discovery. The development of a drug begins with a screen, where
hundreds of thousands of small drug-like compounds are tested to identify those
few that can interact with and alter the activity of an enzyme that is involved
in disease progression. These ?hits? are then optimized and ultimately lead to
pharmaceuticals that benefit patients. For many enzymes, assays that are rapid,
cost-effective and reliable do not yet exist and therefore delay the drug
discovery process. The SAMDI assay is applicable to most of these difficult
targets and would radically accelerate drug discovery programs for a broad range
of diseases.
