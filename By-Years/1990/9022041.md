This award enables the Manufacturing Studies Board to create a fifteen-member
committee of university and industry experts in the areas of materials science,
industrial and mechanical engineering, and production management. The committee
will evaluate the research needs of the key technologies and processes in a
three-phase study. The first phase will entail both developing a taxonomy for
classifying unit processes (e.g., by physical characteristics, by industry, by
product) and examining the characteristics of unit processes across macro-level
cross sections of the taxonomy. The second phase will involve developing
criteria to determine which unit processes are critical to long- term
manufacturing competitiveness. The third and final phase of the study will
involve an in-depth analysis of specific critical processes. This two-year study
will result in (1) a series of detailed analyses of unit processes and their
potential impact on U.S. manufacturing competitiveness and (2) the development
of a comprehensive, prioritized, long-term research agenda for the National
Science Foundation and the United States manufacturing community in the area of
unit processes.
