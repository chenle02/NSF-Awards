Highway bridges are one of the most critical elements in the nation's
transportation system, and costly delays occur when one collapses or is closed
for repairs. This project is to conduct a conference for researchers to present
on-going research activities in order to document current projects and to
exchange data and information to eliminate duplication and to benefit from the
research results of others.
