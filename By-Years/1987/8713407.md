This action would provide funds for the completion of two experiments supported
through NSF grant PHY85-09316. Both experiments use accelerator facilities at
Fermilab and involve collaborators from other institutions. The first
experiment, E580, was approved to be scheduled for 800 hours of data taking in
1978. Data was taken in 1980 and several papers have since appeared from this
experiment. This work will be completed by a graduate student at Notre Dame who
will write his doctoral thesis on the scattering process in which a pion
diffractively dissociates into three pions. The second experiment, E743, was
designed to study short lived particles containing the c-quark. A high
resolution bubble chamber was exposed to a beam of 800 GeV protons. The
principal investigator will complete his contributions activities in progress to
measure lifetimes and the production dynamics of particles containing c-quarks.
