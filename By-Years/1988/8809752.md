The Law-of-the-Sea Institute (LSI) will sponsor a conference in 1988 on "New
Developments in Marine Science and Technology" with a focus on the implications
of these developments on the economy, policies, and law of the nations of the
world. The conference will consider among others the following: improved
capabilities for prediction of atmospheric and oceanic climate; increased
utilization of marine resources; new stresses on the marine environment; use of
ocean energy; and increased needs and capabilities for conducting marine
research. Then, the conference will consider the impact of these changes on the
global economy and that of individual nations; international and national
policies for use and management of the ocean; and the international legal regime
for the oceans.
