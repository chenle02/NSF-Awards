This research concerns statistical inference for: (1) Lattice models for
conditional independence in a multivariate normal distribution; (2) normal
models with lattice restrictions on both the mean vector and covariance matrix;
(3) non-nested missing data models; (4) group symmetry covariance models; (5)
covariance models combining lattice conditional independence restrictions and
group symmetry conditions; (6) characterizing transitive actions of generalized
lower triangular matrix groups; (7) extensions of Hadamard's inequality for the
determinant of a positive definite matrix; (8) consistency of invariant
multivariant tests; (9) bounds for tail probabilities of weighted sums of
independent gamma random variables; and (10) combining independent significance
tests - a defense of Fisher's combination procedure. This research is in the
general area of statistics and probability. The problems are attacked by a
combination of algebraic and analytic techniques, including the theory of group
representations, distributive lattice theory, and invariant (Haar) measures, in
order to characterize the structure of the models and to determine
distributional and decision-theoretic properties of estimators and test
characteristics.
