Software vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the code that may be exploited by
cybercriminals to harm a system. They often do not hinder a program's
functionality, and are thus difficult to detect. This project focuses on
developing methods to identify such "weak spots" in a program, where
vulnerabilities are more likely to occur.

The approach used for detecting weak spots is based on the novel idea of
examining linguistic patterns employed by code developers in Open-Source
Software (OSS) online communities. Using a combination of natural language
processing methods and sociolinguistic analyses, the PIs research the links
between a programmer's role within a social hierarchy of trust and influence and
his or her skills in producing code that avoids vulnerabilities and adheres to
the communal cybersecurity standards. The research results in a faster way to
identify vulnerabilities, therefore contributing to make programs safer. It also
contributes to understanding of the natural properties of code and the social
dynamics of communication in online groups, laying the foundation for further
research into linguistic aspects of software engineering.
