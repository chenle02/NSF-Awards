This project targets at symmetric computational problems. Tensors are
generalizations of matrices. The entries of symmetric tensors obey symmetric
patterns. Computational problems about them become more and more important in
big data time. Like the case of matrices, basic problems about symmetric tensors
are computing their decompositions over the real and complex fields, determining
their ranks, computing low-rank approximations, and applying them in relevant
applications. This project devotes to the research of computational problems
about symmetric tensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tensor is a powerful tool in
computational mathematics. Symmetric tensors have beautiful algebraic and
geometric properties. A problem of fundamental importance is to write a tensor
as a sum of rank one tensors, with minimum length. This is the so-called tensor
decomposition problem. Tensor decompositions can be over either the real or
complex field. Although they are related, the decomposition over the real field
is very different from the case of complex field. In applications, tensors can
be very large, but their ranks may be small. People often need to approximate a
symmetric tensor by a low rank one, as close as possible. Generating polynomial
is an efficient tool for solving symmetric tensor computational problems. It
uses the algebraic properties elegantly. A symmetric tensor can be viewed as a
symmetric multi-linear functional, which can be expressed by a multivariate
polynomial. This project uses mathematical knowledge from computational algebra,
polynomial systems, matrix computations, complex and real algebraic geometry,
and optimization. The results produced by this project have potential
applications in multilinear algebra, signal processing, blind source separation,
numerical analysis, higher order Markov chains. The project is going to provide
training for students and young researchers who are interested in the subject.
Produced results will be promptly disseminated to the scientific community.
