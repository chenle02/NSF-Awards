The purpose of the workshops is to demonstrate the utility of computer algebra,
to allow the participants hands-on experience using computer algebra, and to
provide a forum for the creation and exchange of materials developed for various
mathematics courses. An additional purpose of the workshops is to disseminate
the information and materials gained from two years of experience in using the
computer algebra laboratory which was partially funded by the NSF ILI Program.
The workshops are designed for instructors of undergraduate mathematics.
Participants learn to use the computer algebra system, Maple, and have access to
a computer at all times during the workshop. Participants are expected to
produce curricular materials relating to their own areas of expertise and all
material is shared during and at the end of the workshops. A network is being
formed for the purpose of sharing materials produced by the participants
subsequent to the workshops, and to ensure continued communication between
participants. //
