This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, seeks to
understand the basic dynamics of simple gas phase chemical reactions. It uses
techniques of laser spectroscopy to probe the energetics of product and
transient species. The reaction chosen for study is K + NaCl ---- Na* + KCl.
Techniques of laser induced fluorescence fluorescence will be used to probe the
energetics of the Na* at different energies using cooled beams. For the K + NaCl
system (and similar systems) attempts will be made to observe the transition
species, KNaCl, formed in the supersonic beam using the methods of laser induced
fluorescence. In particular the vibrational and energy levels of these complexes
will be observed and mapped in order to provide a generic understanding of the
energetics and dynamics of these Transition Region Species (TRS).
