9554168 McLaren This four-year project, sponsored by the National Center for
Atmospheric Research, teaches those teachers, primarily from grades 6-8, in
seven selected rural school districts in Western Colorado, the basic concepts of
atmospheric science. The project will start out first with the district outreach
component. Then in the next years of funding the project will bring 35 teachers
(five from each district) for three consecutive three-week summer workshops for
intensive content, pedagogical and leadership training. The workshops will
increase the teachers' knowledge of the atmospheric sciences and mathematics,
enable them to develop aativity-based teaching strategies, show them how to use
current educational technologies, increase their leadership skills and provide
them with laboratory and field experiences as they work with NCAR scientists.
During the school year these teams of lead teachers will work with 21 teachers
in their district (for a total of 182) to implement atmospheric science in the
schools. These lead teachers will be aided by NCAR scientists, instructors from
Colorado's Science Discovery Program and the Annenberg/CPB Internet training
program. The atmospheric science curriculum will be based upon the materials
developed by the original Project LEARN program and includes modules entitled
Atmospheric Dynamics, Ozone in Our Atmosphere and Cycles of the Earth and
Atmosphere. Matching funds account for 51% of the NSF award.
