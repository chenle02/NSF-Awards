This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project will study
transition - metal complexes in the synthesis of highly unsaturated and
conjugated molecules. The research plan will explore more fully the use of
cobalt complexes for the protection of acetylene and diyne units. Results of
this phase will be applied to the synthesis of histrionicotoxins, a set of
complex organic molecules. Knowledge from these experiments will provide
rationales for broader studies of substituent and electronic influences on the
pharmacology of histrionicotoxins which in turn will increase our understanding
of neuromuscular disorders. This ambitious examination of complexation reactions
for transition metals will significantly increase the research capability of a
predominantly minority institution. The principal investigator has excellent
synthesis training and has published in refereed journals. Faculty and students
working on this project will have their skills in chemical synthesis measurably
improved.
