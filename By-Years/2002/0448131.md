Modern wireless networks are complex dynamic systems that promise to provide the
public with Internet access, new commercial and public safety services, and
real-time information about the world at any location and any time. Without a
unifying analytical framework, though, the promises of wireless technology will
not be fully realized. This project is exploring the application of game theory,
an analysis tool that has been successful in explaining complex economic
systems, to create an analytical framework for wireless
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project is developing a theory
of cooperation to explain how network nodes with disparate and limited
information can cooperate to achieve network-wide goals. This theory is based on
the game-theoretic notion of a potential game, and makes game theory more useful
for engineering applications. The nascent theory is being applied to produce
optimal algorithms for controlling transmission power and selecting code
sequences in a wireless network. This work is expected to lead to more efficient
power control and interference avoidance algorithms, thus improving the
performance of wireless networks and using radio spectrum (an important public
resource) more efficiently. More importantly, though, this research is
developing fundamental analytical tools that will enable other researchers to
create more efficient and more powerful wireless networks for a wide variety of
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While pursuing these important research aims,
the project also includes strong education components which introduce K-12
students to wireless technology with hands-on activities designed to stimulate
interest in electrical and computer engineering and wireless communications.
