One of the important, long standing events that is held annually in conjunction
with the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS)
is the ICAPS Doctoral Consortium (ICAPS DC). The ICAPS DC is a primary method
for broadening participation and improving retention of doctoral researchers in
the field of automated planning and scheduling, which is essential to ensuring
the continued vibrancy of research and scientific advancement in this area. This
travel grant will enable travel awards to be provided to US doctoral students to
support their participation of in the ICAPS 2016 DC. The ICAPS 2016 DC will be
the fourteenth inception of the event, and will take place in June 2016 at
London, England UK. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the DC is to provide
a forum where doctoral students, in any phase of their training, can receive
career and research advice from peers and mentors, present preliminary results
and plans for their dissertations, and build professional relationships. A
popular component of past ICAPS DCs that will be included in the 2016 edition is
the formation of several small focus groups where students and assigned mentors
meet to discuss each student's dissertation topic. To broaden the feedback that
students receive, students will also prepare posters that they will present
during a social event open to all conference attendees. To support career
development, two invited speakers will address the students, discussing research
skills and the process of transitioning to the workplace after graduation.
Finally, students will have the opportunity to attend to all ICAPS conference
events, including the technical program, workshops and tutorials.
