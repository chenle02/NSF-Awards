9521618 GREEN A continuous flow analyzer powered by osmotic pumps has been
developed to monitor nitrate concentrations while submerged in freshwater or
seawater. Osmotic pumps driven by a NaCl gradient propel both sample and
reagents through a miniature continuous flow manifold. The analyzer operates
with sample and reagent flow rates of about 8.0 and 0.7 ml per month,
respectively, shows a linear response from 0 to 20 micromolar nitrate with a
detection limit of 0.1 micromoles, and has a 90% response time of approximately
30 minutes. The analyzer automatically standardizes itself by correcting for
baseline and sensitivity drift by periodically injecting and analyzing known
standard solutions. The system has operated continuously for month-long periods
in freshwater and seawater, and can be adapted to a variety of colorimetric
analyses. The research supported here will take this demonstrated technology and
develop the chemistries to analyze for a variety of trace metals (i.e., iron,
zinc, cadmium, copper and manganese), as well as other macro-nutrients (i.e.,
silica and phosphate). Potential applications for such analyzers include
oceanographic studies as well as environmental monitoring and industrial process
control.
