This proposed research aims at developing adaptive fast algorithms using wavelet
bases in the Galerkin, Petrov-Galerkin, collocation, product integration and
quadrature methods for both linear and nonlinear boundary integral equations
whose solutions may have singularities. We will also consider efficient
evaluation of potentials which relates the solution of a boundary integral
equation with the solution of the original boundary value problem.

The primary purpose of the proposed research is to understand how wavelet bases
can be employed to improve the computational efficiency of the commonly used
conventional numerical methods for boundary integral equations while preserving
the attractive features of the conventional methods such as high convergence
order and stability. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide
computationally efficient algorithms for high-performance computing in science
and engineering.
