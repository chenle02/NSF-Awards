Lnenicka 9511558 The development and regeneration of the nervous system is
highly dependent upon the properties of the growing tip of the nerve cell, the
growth cone. Growth cones control the extent and direction of nerve cell
elongation and, thus, allow the formation of appropriate connections in the
nervous system. The actions of growth cones are largely regulated by their level
of intracellular calcium. Calcium enters the growth cone through calcium
channels and is removed through a number of processes collectively referred to
as calcium buffering. Nerve cells show differences in their properties of
growth. Differences in the regulation of intracellular calcium and/or the
sensitivity of growth cones to intracellular calcium play an important role in
these differences in nerve cell growth. The purpose of this research is to
define the role of calcium regulation and calcium sensitivity in these
differences in nerve cell growth. In addition, the factors responsible for the
development of these differences in growth cone properties will be examined. In
particular, the hypothesis that the previous activity or "use" of nerve cells
affects their properties of regeneration will be tested. These studies are
possible by utilizing the relatively simple invertebrate nervous system, where
large identified cells with differences in activity and growth cone properties
can be directly examined. The studies will be performed using previously
developed cell-culture techniques for studying the growth of regenerating axons
of nerve cells. Axon growth will be followed using time-lapse video-microscopy
of growth cones. Recently developed methods for measuring intracellular calcium
concentration using imaging techniques will be used to determine the sensitivity
of the growth cones to intracellular calcium, and their calcium buffering
capacity. Calcium influx will also be directly measured in growth cones. These
studies will contribute to our understanding of the basic mechanisms invo lved
in the growth and regeneration of nerve cells.
