The objective of this Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site renewal
is to engage 10 undergraduate students per summer at the University of Southern
California's Institute for Creative Technologies, a unique multidisciplinary
research community that combines leading academic researchers in computer
science, psychology, communications, cinematic arts, and medicine. Participants
will be immersed in collaborative research teams focused on the institute's core
theme of interactive virtual experiences, with specific projects in areas such
as virtual reality, narrative, virtual humans, natural language dialogue, and
graphics. These activities will be combined with weekly interactive seminars for
training in best research practices, mentorship support, and peer feedback.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The techniques and technologies developed by the
researchers drive the creation of compelling synthetic environments and
characters with immediate relevance to a broad range of application domains
including training, education, rehabilitation, and medicine. The undergraduate
students will become engaged in summer experiences that emphasize
interdisciplinary research, with the goals of broadening participation from
underrepresented populations in computing and exposing undergraduate students to
opportunities in science and engineering graduate programs. This effort has the
potential to prepare undergraduates to perform independent research, thereby
increasing enrollment and retention in computing doctoral programs.
