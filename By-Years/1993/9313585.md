A light particle focal plane detector will be developed, calibrated and tested
in an experiment at the Michigan State University Superconducting Cyclotron
Laboratory on the A1200 Spectrometer facility. The work will be done as part of
a MS thesis project for Mr. Frank Underdown under the ROA program.
