The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports
research in the area of photochemistry of transition metal coordination
compounds. In this project Lisa McElwee-White of Stanford University will
investigate the photochemical reactions of metal carbynes which will involve
activation of the metal-carbon triple bond and subsequent reaction to form new
chemical compounds through novel reaction pathways. This research will be of
importance in the understanding of the fundamental processes occurring in the
photochemistry of organometallic compounds. The focus of the research will be
low valent molybdenum and tungsten carbynes, such as
chlorotetrakis(trimethylphosphite)- tungsten phenylcarbyne, which contain
ancillary ligands which are not photoactive. Studies of the reactivity of the
activated metal carbyne triple bond will be of two types: (a) unimolecular
reactions such as ligand rearrangements or intramolecular trapping with tethered
functionality; (b) bimolecular reactions with added reagents.
