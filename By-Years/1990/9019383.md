This proposal is for the continuation of research on transformation toughening
in ZrO2-containig ceramics. Specifically, the research will focus on i) making
dense transformation toughened Mg-PSZ with fine grain size, in contrast to the
current generation of tough Mg- PSZ's which are course grained, porous, and
contain unwanted second phases, ii)studying structure-property relationships in
ternary Mg, Y-PSZ's, particularly probing the effect of particle morphology and
hence coherency stresses, on the crack tip stress-induced transformation, iii)
Studying the mechanics of stress-induced subcritical transformation which in
"supertough" Mg-PSZ can occur before any visible surface microcracks, and iv)
studying transformation around microhardness indents in Y-PSZ single crystals,
particularly the dislocation-nucleated autocatalytic transformation.
