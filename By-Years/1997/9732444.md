9732444&lt;br/&gt;Dehmelt&lt;br/&gt;This work consists of a set of experiments
that seek to approach the fundamental limits of resolution and accuracy in
optical spectroscopy by making use of individually confined ions in purely
electric rf traps. Efforts will include improving ion trapping systems,
developing better trapping technology, and exploring new ion candidates. Results
will have impact on applications in modern navigation and communication as well
as on fundamental physical measurements.&lt;br/&gt;
