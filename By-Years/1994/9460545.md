Ion implantation can change the properties of a surface without changing the
underlying substrate. This technology has growing applications to wear reduction
and corrosion reduction of metal surfaces. Many of these applications have been
limited by the fact that implantation is usually a `line of sight process`.
Plasma source ion implantation (PSII) has the potential to overcome this
limitation as long as the plasma can be made to `conform` to the surface
throughout the implant's duration. Limitations in plasma density and power
system drive conditions often limit the degree to which the implant conforms to
the surface. By increasing the plasma density and power system peak power, those
limitations can be overcome, leading to a significant improvement in the
uniformity of the implant and a subsequent increase in implant utility as a
surface modification technique. By combining NSRC's expertise in high current
pulse transformer design with improved high density plasma sources North Star
Research Corp., can develop a system which overcomes the present limitations of
PSII. In this Phase I program, the researchers will use existing pulsed power
equipment at NSRC along with a high density plasma source to make an initial
study of the high density, high power PSII regime. Preliminary implants will be
performed to validate this new technique.
