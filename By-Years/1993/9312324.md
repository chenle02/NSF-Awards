This program is to allow a young PI working in a spectral, finite- element
method applied to ocean modeling, to attend meetings as well as to consult with
experts, on how to make the model better reflect reality, and more useful in
studying ocean general circulation problems. The application of the model the PI
is working on, is to study ocean circulation and local heat transport patterns,
energy exhcange processes among different scales, mechanisms of mesoscale
dynamical structures (like eddies and fronts) and their roles in maintaining the
local and global ocean climate.
