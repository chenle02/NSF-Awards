This project of the Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS), University of California at
Berkeley, will develop and disseminate a mathematics and science methods course,
a teacher's science curriculum guide, and a motivational video designed for
preschool educators. The project is in response to the need for improving the
science and mathematics knowledge and teaching skills of preschool teachers. To
accomplish this goal the project will develop and test a 70 hour course for
early childhood educators. The inservice course will provide teachers with an
introduction to science and mathematical concepts through the ecological
sciences, participation in activity-based lessons, experience in adapting and
teaching science content and process to preschoolers, observation of preschool
programs, and development of a plan-of-action for the implementation of their
own preschool science program. A revised science curriculum resulting from the
course will be produced as a Teacher's Science Curriculum Guide available at the
end of Year Two. During the third year, the project's materials will be
disseminated through conference training sessions for an additional 400
preschool educators, and during year four the evaluation of the training
materials will be completed. The cost sharing for the project will be thirty-
eight percent of the NSF award.
