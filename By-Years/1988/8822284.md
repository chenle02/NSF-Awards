The Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California at San
Diego will acquire several sea-going systems and items of oceanographic
instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment. This equipment
is maintained for use on or in association with the four research vessels
operated by the institution. A substantial part of the ships' operating
schedules during 1989 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects. The
instrumenta- tion will also increase the capabilities of the ships and of the
institution to support research and engineering activities. The instrumentation
includes: -Shipboard data management systems and components for real- time
acquisition and display of large data sets, -Doppler Current Profiler spares for
reliable collection and continuous measurements of subsurface circulation
features, -Environmental sensors for multiple-opening and closing net system.
-CTD enhancements for obtaining detailed profiles of seawater conductivity and
temperature as a function of depth, -Salinity bottles for storing seawater
samples, -Niskin bottles for collecting discrete seawater samples at various
depths in the water column, -waterguns and depressors for an acoustic seismic
profiling system upgrade, -High-speed streamer for single-channel acoustic
profiling, -Precision acoustic pingers for determining position of an instrument
package relative to the surface or seafloor, and -12-kHz echosounder system for
collecting data on seafloor bathymetry and sedimentary profiles. The University
of California is cost sharing in the acquisition of this equipment. The
instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the organization
to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
