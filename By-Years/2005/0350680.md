A novel analysis algorithm, the "S-Transform", is applied to all-sky images of
emissions from the mesosphere and lower thermosphere to extract the gravity wave
spectral signatures of frequency and horizontal and vertical wavenumber. The
S-transform is a Time Frequency Representation (TFR) technique capable of
identifying transient wave packets characteristic of coherent wave features in
the airglow. The algorithm expanded from the current 1-dimensional form to a
4-dimensional form (time, XY horizontal, and vertical). Algorithm testing and
validation is provided by a supply of actual all-sky data acquired by
collaborative formality from Utah State University.
