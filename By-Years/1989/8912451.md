Three research thrusts are included in this project: a) time variation and
maintenance of the planetary-scale divergent circulation with seasonal and
intraseasonal time scales; b) low-frequency variability of the atmospheric
rotational circulation associated with the Indian monsoon life cycle, blocking,
and the 1982-1983 El Nino/Southern Oscillation event; and c) long-range forecast
of the Indian monsoon with a statistical- empirical scheme. The 1978-1987
outgoing longwave radiation and operational data generated by the global data
assimilation systems of the National Meteorological Center and the European
Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts will be used. A multilevel,
baroclinic, linear primitive-equation model will also be applied to supplement
the diagnostic analysis proposed in the second research thrust. This research is
important because it seeks to enhance understanding of climate variability on
time scales important to social-economic activities.
