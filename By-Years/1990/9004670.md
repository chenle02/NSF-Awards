We have been studying the structural features of insulin analogs in solution as
part of project to engineer proteins with altered biologic and physical
properties. A striking finding has been the degree of flexibility observed for
insulin in solution. Most notably, the binding potency of several analogs
correlates with overall molecular flexibility. Selected mutations and bridging
structures can lock conformational substructures that are not productive for
receptor recognition. Moreover, mutations that increase molecular flexibility
appear to reverse these effects. Therefore, we have identified a system for
relating protein structures in crystals, in solution (NMR) and at the receptor
surface. It appears that changes in molecular structure are necessary
accompaniments to high affinity receptor recognition. In the current proposal I
have outlined three complimentary approaches for defining the structural
requirements of insulin action. First, site-site interactions between insulin
and the insulin receptor will be positively identified. In this fashion,
comparative binding surfaces of insulin and the insulin receptor will be
constructed, using the three- dimensional crystal structure of insulin as a
template. Second, solution structures of selected series of analogs are being
analyzed by NMR and CD spectroscopy. Specific structural features will be
correlated with receptor binding potency. Finally, increasing concentrations of
truncated receptor homologs will be added to solutions of insulin and selected
analogs; the effects on insulin structure will be characterized. In combination
these studies should identify the structural features in solution that are
necessary for receptor binding and the changes in structure that accompany
binding. Furthermore, these studies will help to provide a more general
foundation for studying relationships between protein crystal structures,
solution structures, and changes in structure that occur during complex
formation.
