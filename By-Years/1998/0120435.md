0120435&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biogeochemical Cycles of Carbon and Nitrogen in an
Ice-Covered Volcanic Crater Lake&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project
Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 1 year research planning and
exploratory proposal to investigate the microbial ecology of and ice-covered
crater lake within the active Grimsvotn Volcano in Iceland. The proposal
anticpates that there is an active microbial community under the Grimsvotn ice-
covered lake. Because of the simplicity of the biogeochemical environment and
its isolation from other inputs other than volcanic and glacial, it is suggested
to be an excellent location to pursue coupled biocomplexity studies. The
proposal will evaluate four hypotheses by sampling the lake through the ice
using hot-water drilling equipment. Samples will be collected from different
lake depths and examined using: microscopy, cultivation, stable isotopic
analyses, molecular biological tools, C and N fixation assays, and phylogentic
analysis of genes involved in N fixation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
