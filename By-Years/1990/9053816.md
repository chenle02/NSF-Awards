This project of the Cleveland Education Fund aims to improve student
performance by establishing NCTM standards for teaching high school mathematics
in Cleveland. A representative racial and gender mix will be sought, both in
enrollment in classes and in the contact the students have with the business
partners. A new curriculum will be developed and implemented in Cleveland high
schools. Problem-solving abilities will be enhanced. The effectiveness of the
NCTM standards in an urban setting will be determined.
