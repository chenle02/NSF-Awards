The National Nanofabrication Facility (NNF) at Cornell University is an
interdisciplinary center, whose primary role is to provide resources and
technical expertise to researchers in microstructure science, particularly in
the areas of advanced lithographies, nanostructure physics, scanning tunneling
microscopy for fabrication and analysis, optoelectronic and electronic
applications, microfabrication applications to biology, and related areas. NNF
provides equipment, training , and expertise to leading edge research in a
"hands-on" environment where the user is responsible for the conduct of that
research. NNF has a program of discrete projects under the supervision of
academic mentors at Cornell whose research is associated with the Facility. The
proposed period of performance takes particular advantage of ongoing NNF
educational activities as well as interaction with other REU programs campus-
wide. Ongoing NNF educational activities include general laboratory orientation;
wet chemical safety orientation; and "NanoCourses". Several events are planned
to encourage interaction with other REU Students on campus, and some NNF
participants will work in teams or in collaboration with students in other
programs. All students are required to present their project results at a
concluding all-campus Forum and to prepare a final report. NNF again is
targeting women and minority undergraduates, and schools with small-to-medium-
sized programs presumed to have limited laboratory facilities. The program goals
are for a total of 12 participants, at least 9 of whom are not regularly
enrolled at Cornell, and 6 are women or underrepresented minorities.
