This award provides support for research describing and explaining how people
make judgments and choices and in what ways these decision making behaviors are
at variance from rational prescriptive theories of decision making. Specifically
the objective of this research is to extend the study of preference reversal
behavior into real world situations and to develop formal models which describe
and explain judgement and choice behavior. Since the early reporting of
preference reversal behavior the phenomenon has been shown to operate in many
diverse decision making situations. Various competing explanations have been
advanced to account for decision making which violate the prescriptions of
quantitative theories of decision analysis. This research effort which will
extend prior laboratory research into real world situations has the objective of
developing more comprehensive process descriptions and explanations of
preference reversal behavior as well as to develop formal models of the
psychological phenomena of judgement and choice. Such progress is crucial if
normative decision models were to serve as a basis to increase the rationality
and effectiveness of actual decision making behavior.
