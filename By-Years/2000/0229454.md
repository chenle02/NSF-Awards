SGER: Hidden Markov Models for Three-Dimensional Packing Arrangements in
Proteins

Our goal is to design a hidden Markov model (HMM) that captures the sequence
dependence of non-local interactions in proteins. The model will focus on
recurrent substructures that are known to exist in proteins but whose sequence
similarity is undetectable by current methods. These recurrent packing
arrangements, or cores, are encoded in the spatial relationships between the HMM
states, which represent individual residues. New algorithms will allow the
prediction of the protein chain's self-avoiding path through the 3D states. The
approach tests the topology-driven hypothesis for protein folding, and if
successful it will represent an advance in our ability to predict protein
structure from sequence.

The approach is broadly applicable to systems that can be described in two
spaces, sequential/temporal and spatial, and for which (1) a large database of
known examples exists, and (2) a common underlying principle led to all of the
examples. Applications include weather prediction, brain function, ecosystems
and natural languages.
