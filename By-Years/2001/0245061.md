APOLLO (Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation) is a next-
generation laser-ranging apparatus capable of obtaining lunar ranges with
millimeter accuracy. Relying on the still-operational retroreflector arrays
placed on the lunar surface by Apollo astronauts, APOLLO&lt;br/&gt;constitutes
the ground-link of a dynamically clean orbital laboratory. APOLLO will bring new
life to lunar ranging by applying advanced laser and detector technology on a
large telescope, by incorporating precision gravimetry, millimeter-accuracy GPS
positioning, and a meteorological&lt;br/&gt;array on the site, and by forming a
tight interface between the observation and data analysis
efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The order-of-magnitude improvement in range
precision expected from APOLLO will advance by a similar factor the scientific
power of lunar ranging to determine a number of qualitative aspects of the
fundamental properties of gravity. Among the tests that lunar ranging currently
leads are tests of the equivalence principle, time variation of the
gravitational constant, geodetic precession, gravitomagnetic effects, and the
possible presence of long-range forces. Through its comprehensive investigation
of the nature of gravity, lunar ranging addresses the question: is general
relativity correct? The technique, ambitious goals, and connection to our
remarkable history of space exploration make APOLLO especially appealing to the
public, presenting excellent outreach potential. The APOLLO team is committed to
sharing the excitement of this project with its immediate community and
beyond.&lt;br/&gt;
