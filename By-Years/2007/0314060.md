The investigators will conduct a comprehensive modeling effort aimed at
understanding gravity wave propagation, spectral energy transfers, mean-flow
interactions, and wave and turbulent transports in the mesosphere and lower
thermosphere (MLT). The approach involves two modeling methodologies: a highly-
parallel incompressible direct simulation code and a newly-tested spectral-
element code. Specific topics to be addressed include (1) the role of
instabilities in limiting gravity wave amplitudes and fluxes, (2) the
competition between wave-wave interactions and local instability processes in
controlling wave amplitudes, (3) the role of wave superposition in controlling
interaction processes, (4) the mixing and turbulent transports of heat and
momentum, and (5) the effects of gravity wave dynamics on the large-scale wave
fields in the MLT. The results will help quantify important gravity wave
dynamics that remain largely unknown and have significant implications for
modeling gravity wave effects. These results will have application to climate
change, tropospheric and space weather, solar forcing of the atmosphere, and
tropospheric optical turbulence.
