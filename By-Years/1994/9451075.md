9451075 Lubin The Remote Access Astronomy Project is a unique program designed
to foster scientific interest through the use of astronomical (and other) image
processing. Developed over the past five years, it is now operational and in use
by our upper division physics students as well as by numerous other schools
including community colleges and secondary schools. We propose to expand the
program so that our numerous introductory Astronomy I and II students can take
advantage of this program.
