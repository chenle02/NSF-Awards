Abstract DeBacker

The investigator will continue his research into a number of topics in harmonic
analysis for Lie groups over nonarchimedian fields. The first goal is to
establish Murnaghan-Kirillov theory for depth zero supercuspidal
representations. At its most basic level, Murnaghan-Kirillov theory asks for a
connection between the supercuspidal representations of our group and the
Fourier transforms of certain coadjoint orbital integrals. Because of their
intimate connection to finite groups of Lie type, the problem of establishing
Murnaghan-Kirillov theory for these representations reduces to the problem of
associating regular semisimple orbital integrals to generalized Green functions.
The second objective is to investigate questions about stability. For example,
it would be useful to explicitly understand, in a uniform way via Bruhat-Tits
theory, the space of stable distributions supported on the nilpotent set. Thanks
to various homogeneity results, this problem can be addressed by associating (as
above) regular semisimple orbital integrals to generalized Green functions.

Harmonic analysis on Lie groups traces its roots to the following problem from
physics: Describe the motion of a plucked guitar string. Eventually, people
realized that this problem --- and rather more pure problems like calculating
Gauss sums or studying the density of primes in arithmetic progressions ---
could be understood by studying certain well-behaved functions on the circle (or
other groups). These well-behaved functions are called characters, and the
resulting theory is called harmonic analysis. By the 1930s mathematicians had a
firm understanding of harmonic analysis on many types of groups (for example,
compact or abelian groups). During the 1940s problems from relativistic physics
led people to think about harmonic analysis on a more general class of groups,
called Lie groups. Initiated by the work of Bargmann, Gelfand--Naimark, and
Harish-Chandra, the goal was, as for the guitar problem, to understand functions
on the group by studying characters. Thanks mostly to Harish-Chandra this goal
was largely realized. Based at least partially on his understanding of this
work, in the late 1960s Langlands was led to formulate his program; this program
is a vast, remarkable web of conjectures and ideas --- a kind of mathematical
theory of everything. For example, the celebrated works of Harris--Taylor, Kim--
Shahidi, and Lafforgue provide a small sampling of the deep results it
anticipates. As harmonic analysis on Lie groups plays a central role in our
understanding of many of the problems in this area, the investigator hopes his
research will contribute to future progress.
