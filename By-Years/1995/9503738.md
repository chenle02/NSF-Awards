With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports continued research on transition metal complexes as catalysts
for organic oxidation reactions by Dr. Thomas J. Meyer of the Chemistry
Department, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Electrochemical and
photochemical methods will be used to effect and to investigate the mechanism of
the reactions. The goal of the project is to design selective catalytic reagents
using oxo polypyridyl complexes of ruthenium or osmium. New dioxo and ligand-
bridged systems will be synthesized and tested for stereospecificity. Nitrido
and imido analogues of the oxo complexes will also be prepared and investigated
for oxidation activity. Thin polymeric films of promising materials will be
adhered to electrodes to test their potential as sensors. Aldehydes and aromatic
hydrocarbons undergo oxidation when an oxygen atom is added to them directly to
form acids and alcohols, respectively. Such reactions are important in making
new organic compounds. In order to develop reagents that will effect these
reactions in a manner in which the products desired can be obtained, it is
important to understand the details of the reactions. In this investigation, the
exact pathway of reactions in which metal complexes provide an oxygen atom will
be determined.
