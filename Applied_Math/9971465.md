The NSF award will be used mainly to provide travel support for participation of
graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s in the Fourth Mississippi State Conference
on Differential Equation and Computational Simulations. The conference will take
place on May 21 - 22, 1999 in Starkville, Mississippi. A number of well-known
experts will present invited principal lectures at the conference. In addition,
there will be sessions of contributed talks. A collection of refereed papers
from the conference will be published as a special issue of the Electronic
Journal of Differential Equations.

The conference is organized jointly by the Department of Mathematics and
Statistics, and the NSF Engineering Research Center at Mississippi State
University. An overall goal of the conference is to promote research and
education in mathematical and computational analysis of mathematical models that
use differential equations. The conference will provide a forum where
mathematicians, scientists and engineers from industries, federal laboratories
and academia exchange research and development ideas. This interaction between
mathematicians and engineers will be a unique feature of the conference
