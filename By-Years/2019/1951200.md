The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II
project is the low-cost, high-purity biobased production of glucaric acid, a
compound with a broad range of applications. This production of glucaric acid
will enable a broad change from petroleum-based sources for everyday materials,
such as nylon in clothes or PET in two-liter bottles, to a bio-based product
generated from renewable resources. Similarly, this technology will allow an
evolution beyond the traditional phosphates used in water treatment systems to a
safer, cost-effective alternative. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project
will develop a strain, fermentation process, and scalable downstream separation
workflow to produce low-cost, high-purity glucaric acid from glucose as a
feedstock. Microbial fermentation represents an attractive option for the
production of fuels and valuable chemicals from renewable resources, such as
cellulosic sugars. Microbes are well suited for the conversion of carbohydrate
feedstocks; several examples of their metabolic engineering have been
demonstrated to direct these feedstocks to non-natural chemicals and materials
of industrial value, often as drop-in replacements for petroleum products. On
the other hand, products derived from sugar oxidation pose a new, less explored
challenge because of the need to direct glucose into the product pathway rather
than the competing path to catabolize the sugar for biomass and energy
production. Initial methods, such as deletion of glycolysis and other competing
pathways, result in poor glucose uptake because of the cell's complex regulatory
circuits. This project proposes to develop strains of E. coli that can
efficiently take up glucose while also directing it to the glucaric acid
pathway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
