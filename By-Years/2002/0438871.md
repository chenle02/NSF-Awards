Abstract Language Towers as Desigh Frameworks Olin Shivers, Panagiotis Manolios

Good notations enable good design: they channel designer effort away from
infeasible designs, highlight novel aspects of a specific design, supress
inessential detail, and enable both human and automated reasoning about the
artifact being described. Unfortunately, a tremendous amount of labor is
required at the meta-design level to implement the tool suites supporting design
in a new, extended, or domains-specific notation. This labor overhead means it
is not practical for most designers and engineers to incorporate notation
design, or meta-design, into their design methodology.

This research explores developing the meta-tools to allow the development of
specialized notations, allowing designers to better express and reason about
their artifacts. The focus of the research is on enabling design-time reasoning
---what the programming-language community refers to as "static semantics"---of
the designed artifact.

The resulting framework allows the construction of "language towers," that is,
notations defined at varying levels of abstraction, linked by procedurally-
encoded static semantics (analyses) and dynamic semantics (translations) between
the levels of the tower. While the work has its origin in the research
underlying the Scheme macro system, it is intended to be applied to language
frameworks that have much greater static-semantic content.
