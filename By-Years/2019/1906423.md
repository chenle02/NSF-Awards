General Relativity is Einstein's theory of gravity that interprets gravity as a
consequence of the curvature of spacetime. The theory predicts the existence of
black holes via solutions to the Einstein equation. The first image of a black
hole, recently obtained by astronomers using Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), has
given remarkable evidence to the accuracy of this theory. The aim of this
proposal is to investigate the geometry of space regions in general relativity,
which in particular include regions surrounding a black hole. Results from this
project will shed new light on the gravitational energy confined in a finite
region, as well as the contribution of black holes to such quasi-local
energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In geometric terms, the PI aims at studying
manifolds with non-negative scalar curvature, with boundary. The goal is to
obtain new understanding of the interaction among scalar curvature, boundary
mean curvature, interior minimal surfaces, volume of compact manifolds, and mass
of asymptotically flat manifolds. The PI willl also establish a Poincare-type
inequality on the boundary of compact manifolds with non-negative scalar
curvature. The PI will employ geometric and analytic methods from calculus of
variation and partial differential equations to achieve these
goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
