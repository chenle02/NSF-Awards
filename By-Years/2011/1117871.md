Uncertainty is inherent in scientific data. Quantification and interpretation of
the uncertainty are essential to a holistic understanding of the data.
Uncertainty representation is often overlooked in high-dimensional and
multivariate data due to a lack of effective methods and a lack of guidance on
appropriate existing methods. This project systematically investigates
uncertainty visualization in high-dimensional data, within the application
domain of meteorology. The interdisciplinary research team spans different areas
such as visualization, atmospheric science, and statistics. The research team is
investigating (1) quantifying uncertainty by using bootstrap mean confidence
intervals, which relax assumptions about the underlying distribution; (2)
designing a number of uncertainty visualization methods and implement these
methods in an integrated user interface; and (3) employing both qualitative and
quantitative user studies to evaluate the uncertainty visualization
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting tools and methods are deployed to
the Environmental Modeling Center. Although the primary application area of this
project is meteorology, the principles learned have the potential to be applied
to a variety of scientific fields, including hydrology, geospatial science,
medical imaging, and biology. The research work of this project is integrated
into Visualization and Meteorology classes at Mississippi State University.
