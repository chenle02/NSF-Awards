This award is for support of a one-year Small Grant for Exploratory Research
(SGER) to test an hypothesis that frazil ice and anchor ice form in glacial
meltwater flowing into subpolar marine water and form deposits that may be
distinguishable from deposits of temperate and polar glacial environments. The
proposed study to search and document that frazil and anchor ice form at the
termini of glaciers and play a role in sediment transport is high risk, but if
successful, this study will have identified a significant new mechanism of
sediment dispersal, thus leading the way to an increased understanding of ice-
front processes in the Antarctic. The field-based study will consist of (1)
video surveys with an ROV submersible to detect frazil and anchor ice and to
study the glacier terminus, (2) CTD profiles, water samples and sediment traps
to study processes of dispersal and sedimentation, and 3) bottom cores to
document the record of these processes.
