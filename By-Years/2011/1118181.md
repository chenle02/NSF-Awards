The goal of this workshop on CO2 Utilization is to foster discussion and
innovation across the disciplines involved in the development of practicable
methods and technologies for CO2 Utilization. This group of stakeholders
includes scientific researchers, policy makers, venture capitalists, and
industry executives working in this area. The workshop will provide an
environment for open dialogue about the challenges facing widespread adoption of
various CO2 Utilization techniques. By linking across disciplines, innovative
solutions can be developed that should have a broad impact in driving the
inventive and novel solutions needed in this field.

The report that comes out of this workshop promises to provide a reference for
both attendees and outside observers to gain insight into the discussions that
take place during the workshop. The report will summarize the lectures given and
also include the interdisciplinary discussions.

The NSF award is to fund travel grants for travel, housing and conference
expenses for several graduate and post-doctoral students and junior faculty.
Additional funding to cover other workshop expenses is in hand.
