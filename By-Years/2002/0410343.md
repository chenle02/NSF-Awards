Chemistry (12) The goal of this project is to incorporate Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) into all levels of the undergraduate chemistry
curriculum at Nashville State Community College in order to enhance students'
learning experiences and broaden the appeal of our chemistry program. The
project is responding to the expectations of the American Chemical Society and
recent recommendations by the National Research Council to include the latest
developments in science and technology in introductory chemistry curricula.
Laboratory experiments from the chemical education literature that utilize FTIR
are being adapted for use in introductory chemistry, general chemistry, organic
chemistry, and in biology and biotechnology courses. In addition, the FTIR is
being utilized to provide hands-on activities for students from a high school
located on campus. The presence of the FTIR is enhancing our ability to provide
students with the technical skills and motivation to pursue professional careers
in science. The impact of this curricular upgrade on student learning and
interest in the subject is being evaluated and the results will be disseminated
to the larger community.
