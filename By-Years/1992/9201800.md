The first goal of this project is to develop and parallel algorithms for
symbolic polynomial factorization. The past work on ``pfactor'' is extended, and
parallel linear and quadratic p-lifting techniques are investigated. The second
goal is to investigate the integration of numeric, symbolic, and graphic
techniques. A distributed paradigm is devised to interface loosely coupled
scientific and mathematical computation components. The vision is to develop
scientific computation systems consisting of multiple autonomous compute servers
running on different hosts. Each compute server in such a system supplies a
single or a set of related services such as polynomial factorization, solution
of linear or nonlinear equations, automatic code generation from symbolic
programs, or graphic display of mathematical functions, just to name a few
services.
