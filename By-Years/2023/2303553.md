Darryl Seligman is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Fellowship to carry
out a program of research and education at Cornell University. Seligman will
conduct research to maximize the scientific return from the newly discovered
population of interstellar comets. Results from this study will reveal new
insights into how the planet formation process varies throughout the galaxy. For
the educational component of this project, Seligman will develop educational
materials to help identify misinformation in media, using the case study of
artificial origins of interstellar objects to motivate more pressing matters
such as climate change and the global pandemic.

The forthcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will
detect 1-3 interstellar objects every year. A subset of these objects will
exhibit trajectories amenable to detailed ground and space-based follow-up
observational characterization. With this motivation, Seligman will identify
expected interstellar comet velocities (which trace galactic age) and
compositions (which trace formation location) based on their original systems
and formation locations within their protoplanetary disks. Seligman will predict
exoplanet atmospheric compositional signatures of volatile enrichment from
interstellar comet analogues which will inform our understanding of volatile
delivery to short period exoplanets. Finally, Seligman will calculate detection
rates and population statistics for interstellar objects that the LSST will
discover that will be suitable targets for detailed ground and space based
follow-up measurements. This research award is partially funded by a generous
gift from Charles Simonyi to the NSF Astronomy division. The project includes
significant contributions to Vera C. Rubin Observatoryâ€™s Legacy Survey of Space
and Time.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
