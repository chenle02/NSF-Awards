This project involves the development of a new integrated molecular assembly
approach for construction of amperometric enzyme sensors. This approach will use
chemical modification techniques to incorporate components of an amperometric
enzyme sensor. The enzyme will be immobilized covalently at a chemically
derivitized carbon electrode surface through a hydrophilic tether employing an
avidin-biotin linkage to immobilize a large quantity of active enzyme far from
the surface and out of the electical double-layer. The electron transfer
mediator and the permselective membrane will be incorporated at the electrode
surface in a one step operation by depositing a ferrocene conjugated polymer
film electrochemically from an electrochemical bath of ferrocene conjugated
monomers.
