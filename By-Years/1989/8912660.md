This award provides partial support for a sabbatical visit to the Max Planck
Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, Munich, West Germany, for Professor J.
Patrick Henry of the Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii. He will
participate in a major German-led astronomical survey of clusters of galaxies
using satellite based x-ray equipment (ROSAT), and then conduct followup optical
studies at the University of Hawaii. His primary col- laborators will be the
Institute Director, Dr. Joachim Trumper, and others on the Institute staff. The
ROSAT satellite was to be launched in February, 1990. The x-ray imaging survey
of the entire sky is expected to provide a sample of clusters of galaxies which
will be at least twice as deep as the deepest optically selected samples. The
ROSAT sample will also have well established, quantifiable selection criteria
and will be in a contiguous region of the sky. U.S. astronomers will have
relatively little access to survey data; Professor Henry is one of very few
invited to participate in the survey phase. The study of the largest structures
in the universe can tell us much about its history and evolution. Galaxies are
classically used to investigate structure in the universe. But surveys of
galaxies are only complete to a certain scale. Clusters can give a rough idea of
structure on a much larger scale. Professor Henry will be able to relay data on
position clusters to observers in Hawaii. He and his colleagues will emphasize
studies of the evolution of cluster x-ray and optical properties, large scale
structure, and the classical magnitude redshift relation. The depth and
complete- ness of the ROSAT sample will enable these studies to produce
significant improvements over previous work.
