Lindahl, David U. of Washington In recent decades the commercial real estate
industry has undergone important structural transformations, including
globalization of capital sources, the globalized securitization of assets, and
the development of new types of financial intermediaries. There have been major
changes in sources of capital being used to fuel the investment process. This
proposal will develop a technical approach to document the behavior of key
institutions making commercial real estate capital supply decisions. It will aim
to develop an understanding of the consequences of these actions in selected
regional economies. The survey entails an investigation of major suppliers of
capital to the real estate industry as well as local investment players in four
metropolitan areas. In addition the research will include case studies of
specific commercial properties in the metropolitan areas to examine the local
outcomes of these global processes. The results will improve of knowledge of the
investment mechanisms at work and their consequences in such markets.
