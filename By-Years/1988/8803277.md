The herpetological collection in the Museum of Natural History at the University
of Kansas is one of the most important collections of its kind nationally and
internationally. During the past six years the collection has been undergoing
renovation in the form of confirmation of identifications, taxonomic updating,
association of ancillary data (color transparencies, tape recordings, etc.) with
specimen data and reorganization. During the past two years a hierarchical
electronic data management system has been established, and data on part of the
collection have been input into the data management system. In October 1987 the
Museum acquired the Albert Schwartz collection of about 68,000 specimens of
amphibians and reptiles from the West Indies. This project will provide funds
for (1) completion of the renovation of the collection and input of the data
into the management system, (2) concurrent curation of the Schwartz collection
and input of the data into the management system, and (3) collection storage
equipment that will result in about 30% increase in the collection storage
facilities.
