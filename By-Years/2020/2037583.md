Political trust is shaped by many factors over time, including the COVID-19
pandemic. This project will examine trust in governmental authorities and
adherence to COVID-19 directives among low-income adults with childhood
maltreatment histories. The project will study how various factors influence
political trust and how that relates to observance of governmental instructions
during the pandemic, particularly among adults with a history of child
maltreatment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engaging in theories of legal attitudes,
behavior, and socialization, this project will study political trust in adults
who as children were removed from home in child protection actions. This
longitudinal study will employ survey techniques to ascertain how this adult
population adheres to government-issued directives during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The project also will examine how these adults socialize their children with
respect to following government mandates meant to control the pandemic. This
project will provide the public with insight on both practical and theoretical
levels, as it will be important for characterizing political trust and legal
socialization that may affect the spread of disease during the COVID-19
pandemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
