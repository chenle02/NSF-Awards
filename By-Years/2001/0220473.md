Glucocorticoids, such as corticosterone (CORT), are an important group of
steroid hormones that modulate cellular and behavioral responses to stress.
Their action can involve genomic mechanisms in the cell nucleus, and also much
faster non-genomic actions involving receptors on the cell membrane. The
cellular mechanisms mediating responses to acute, as distinct from chronic,
stress are still not well understood. Recent evidence suggests that CORT
interactions with behaviorally important peptide hormones, in particular
arginine vasotocin (AVT), are critical during acute stress. This project
examines how CORT and AVT interact within brain cells in response to acute
stress, using the salamander as a novel and accessible system to combine
biochemistry with behavior. The interactions of the hormones in triggering
intracellular biochemical signaling pathways will be tested in specific
contexts, in terms of behavior and neuroendocrine state. Results will be
important for understanding fundamental cellular mechanisms of stress hormone
action in vertebrates.&lt;br/&gt; The impact will extend beyond
neuroendocrinology to endocrinology and stress-related behavior, as well as cell
biology related to signaling. Valuable training of students at several levels in
this productive laboratory also will continue to include students with handicaps
and those from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
