9224193 Fujita This award supports a multi-disciplinary study (seismology,
geochronology, and paleomagnetism) toward an understanding of the present
tectonics and recent tectonic history of the Sakha Republic in Russia. The goals
are to determine the geometry of present plate boundaries and to determine the
geologic and tectonic development of this part of northeastern Russia and it
relationship to the tectonic development of northwestern Alaska. Of particular
importance is the goal of distinguishing between tectonic models which involve
large scale relative motion between Alaska and the Russian far-east. This
project is a collaborative venture between the investigators from the United
States and Russia. ***
