This research is on algorithmic approaches to VLSI, and four problems are being
investigated. These are: 1. Literal minimization in logic synthesis using an
approach based on term intersection graphs. 2. Gate level placement problems
using minimum floating Steiner trees. 3. Budget assignment in timing driven
placement in which a novel optimization tool is being explored. 4. Clock tree
design using a gated design which minimizes activity, hence power consumption. A
coherent design system, incorporating above stages, is being developed.
