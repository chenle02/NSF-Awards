This project addresses a Mechatronics Design Laboratory for use in DTeC III, the
third of a three course sequence. The sequence introduces engineering students
to graphics, computer applications, writing and oral communication, and open-
ended problem solving. The projects undertaken by sophomores in the mechatronics
laboratory will be for external clients in the disabled community, and will
provide practice in using the knowledge and skills learned in the course
sequence, exposure to the working environment of the engineering professional,
and experience with team-based project management and problem solving. In 1995,
The Watson School of Engineering at Binghamton University received State
approval to expand its transfer-based engineering program to include the first
two years. Coincidentally, the University Faculty approved a general education
(Gen.Ed.) requirement to be met in the first two years. The Design, Technology,
and Communication (DTeC) course sequence, which started in September 1995, is
designed to meet the composition and aesthetics Gen.Ed. requirements, as well as
ABET requirements in graphics, computer programming, engineering design, and
technical writing. The course consists of three 24-student sections studying
graphics, computer applications, and writing/design, rotating through three two-
hour labs per week. Eventually, 200 students will enter the course sequence each
year. DTeC is designed to improve enrollment and retention in engineering
education, in particular, for women and minorities. Experience has shown that
hands-on activities with social relevance are important in retention. Starting
with simple exercises, a sequence of projects for the disabled tie human factors
to the creation of useful products using computers, graphics and mechatronic
devices controlled by a computer. Machine and electronic shop instruction
complements the mechatronics instruction. The laboratory equipment will include
multifunction analog and digital I/O systems which interfa ce to the DTeC
projects, and the host computers and development software.
