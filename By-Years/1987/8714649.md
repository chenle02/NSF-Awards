An integrated research program is proposed to develop mathematical models for
strategic planning of logistics systems in which a central depot routes vehicles
to replenish depleting inventories of spatially dispersed customers. The models
will incorporate such system complexities as probabilistic customer demands,
local inventory holding capacities, vehicle capacities, cost of alternative
vehicle types, point-to-point travel times, and nonlinear "loading" and "off
loading" times. The effort is directed to assist system designers to address
important strategic problems such as: 1) fleet sizing and mix; 2) determining
vehicle capacities; 3) determining local inventory holding capacities; 4)
investigating alternative technologies for "loading" and "off loading"; 5)
designing the logistics system with or without transhipment points; 6) designing
hierarchial distribution networks. The work is directed at complimenting
important work done over the past five years in tactical inventory/routing
problems. The new methodologies will be tested with data from operating systems.
Dick Larson is extremely qualified and based on past performance is very likely
to provide breakthroughs in modeling integrated systems that will be fundamental
to operational science.
