An exciting and scientifically important frontier of modern astronomy is the
push to understand the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), a time in the distant past
when the first stars began to influence the material between galaxies. This era
is also referred to as "Cosmic Dawn", and has been identified as potentially
rife with new discoveries and one of the key problems to be understood in the
near future. With that in mind, some innovative instrumentation has been under
development, including new radio-astronomy arrays suchs as the Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA) and the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of
Reionization (PAPER). The precise extraction of the needed information from such
instruments requires unusual measures for instrument calibration, and this
proposal addresses that need by building ECHO, a helicopter drone to carry a
test transmitter over the telescope array and investigate its actual spatial
response pattern to a very high precision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key obstacle
to extracting the information on astrophysical processes from data measured by
the new generation of telescope arrays is the accurate removal of foreground
emission due to extraneous sources unrelated to the EoR emission being sought.
That foreground emission problem depends critically on an accurate knowledge of
the as-built primary beam of each telescope in the array. Current techniques,
such as beam modeling, are uncertain at the 20% level; this project intends to
push that limit down to 1% for MWA and PAPER. The scientific payoff is
potentially very large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ECHO project will recruit and
train undergraduates interested in electronics and field experiments, and will
feature strong student involvement in many phases of design, construction, and
testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project is being provided by
NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and
Instrumentation program.
