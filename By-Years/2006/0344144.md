Because eukaryotic organisms require oxygen for life it is probably not
surprising that oxygen deprivation influences their growth and development.
However, the absence of oxygen during development is not always fatal. It fact,
several organisms, including nematodes, zebrafish, brine shrimp, and fruit flies
arrest developmental and cell cycle progression in response to oxygen
deprivation. The nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, exposed to anoxia remarkably
arrests developmental and cell cycle progression for up to 4 days. This arrest
is reversible upon reexposure to oxygen, and is thus referred to as anoxia-
induced suspended animation. The conservation of anoxia-induced suspended
animation in eukaryotes suggests that reversible arrests have a significant role
in organisms. However the phenomenon of anoxia-induced suspended animation has
not been well studied and therefore is not understood, The proposed research
focuses on how C. elegans embryos survive anoxia. The long-term research goal is
to identify and characterize the molecular mechanisms that occur in nematodes to
arrest developmental and cellular processes in response to anoxia. A combination
of genetic and cell biological studies will be used to test the hypothesis that
nematodes have developmentally dependent genetic and cellular mechanisms to
survive anoxia. Genes required for nematodes to survive anoxia have been
identified and will be further studied at the molecular level. Specifically, the
role of spindle checkpoint genes, san-1 and mdf-2, in anoxia induced suspended
animation will be investigated. Additionally, expansion of an RNA interference
screen will be used to identify additional genes required for embryos to survive
anoxia. The proposed project is significant because it will identify genetic
pathways required for nematode embryos to survive anoxia. Understanding the
effect oxygen deprivation has on organisms will lead to a greater understanding
of how the environment effects developing embryos. Finally, the proposed project
will integrate research and education by having the involvement of students at
both the graduate and undergraduate level.
