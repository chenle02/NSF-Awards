This NSF Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to synthesize
cadmium-free, water-soluble, and multicolor quantum dots (QDs) by chemical
doping. The project will focus on the synthesis of high quality doped ZnSe QDs
using a newly developed phosphine-free approach. From these cadmium free doped
derivatives with high quality blue, green, and red emissione will be produced.
Then the doped core/shell QDs will be processed to make them water-soluble and
biocompatible through proprietary methods for
biomedical&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful development
of the proposed techniques will result in a new generation of biolabels and make
significant advances in biomedical applications of such cadmium-free doped QDs.
The "green" nature of the production methods, mineral precursors, natural
surfactants, non-toxic and nonvolatile solvents and cadmium free QDs, will
assist to maintain a sustainable environment, in addition to delivering high
performance end products to the public.
