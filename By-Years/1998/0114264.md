This IGERT award supports the establishment of an interdisciplinary research
training program in the emerging field of cellular engineering. The program
focuses on metabolic and tissue engineering and provides science and engineering
students with rigorous educational and research training in the fields of
bioengineering, biochemistry, and cell biology. A co-supervision system is
created in which students will have an advisor from the Department of
Bioengineering and an advisor from the Department of Biochemistry and Cell
Biology for guidance of mechanistic and design aspects of research projects. The
fundamental curriculum for IGERT trainees includes coverage of scientific
ethics, advanced laboratory skills, basic biosciences (biochemistry and cell
biology) and engineering systems analysis. Student participants work in
cooperative environments including team design projects and an industrial
internship program with companies engaged in cellular engineering. This program
is coordinated with a pre- and post internship seminar program to maximize the
impact of the students' industrial experiences. The establishment of a visiting
scientist position and a focused seminar series having different annual themes
provides in depth exposure to new areas. A key component of the program will be
continued expansion of our successful undergraduate recruitment program for
underrepresented minorities to this specialized area of graduate education.
Building upon established strengths in interdisciplinary research and education,
this training program creates a center of excellence in cellular engineering
that will train researchers who can utilize advances in biological sciences to
produce innovative and cost- effective biotechnological products in the 21st
century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the
challenges of educating Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the
multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and personal
skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to
catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing new, innovative
models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for
collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. In
the fourth year of the program, awards are being made to twenty-two institutions
for programs that collectively span all areas of science and engineering
supported by NSF. The intellectual foci of this specific award reside in the
Directorates for Engineering; Biological Sciences; and Education and Human
Resources.&lt;br/&gt;
