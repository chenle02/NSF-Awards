Near shore and continental shelf areas are significantly more supersaturated
with CH4 than are the open oceans, yet global CH4 budgets ignore this fact
because of the paucity of data. Investigations of the near shore regions of
Washington and Oregon, particularly those areas influenced by the Columbia River
plume and evaluations of the impact of this plume on the rate of CH4 evasion to
the atmosphere will help to construct accurate CH4 budgets. The lower Columbia
River is, on average, supersaturaterd with methane by a factor of 120. There is
also an active population of methane oxidizing bacteria within the river with an
average consumption rate of 20 nM methane per day. Preliminary evidence
indicates that within the estuary, as the salinity increases above about 5 parts
per thousand, this microbial activity ceases. This study will determine whether
a marine population of methane oxidizing organisms becomes established as the
Columbia River plume moves downstream and consumes the residual methane or if
the riverine supply of methane is completely evaded to the atmosphere. Ths study
is relevant to all river systems and is of significance to current attempts to
develop a methane budget for the oceans.
