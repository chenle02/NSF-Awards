The study of flow problems in polymeric liquids poses numerous challenges for
mathematical analysis. The topics addressed in this project include asymptotic
analysis of the breakup of liquid jets, analysis of stability and control of
viscoelastic flows, and numerical simulation of drop breakup under shear, a
fundamental process in the formation of emulsions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications of viscoelastic flows arise in manufacturing
of plastics, foods, and other products, as well as in biological problems such
as blood flow. The effect of polymer additives in suppressing breakup of drops
is exploited both in nature (in spider webs) and in technology (to control sizes
of drops in the spraying of liquids). Instabilities in the flow of complex
fluids often pose limits for polymer processing techniques. The research carried
on under this project will clarify fundamental mathematical issues underlying
such phenomena to enable a better understanding of these flows and the
development of methods for their simulation. &lt;br/&gt;
