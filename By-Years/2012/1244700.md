This project is integrating concept mapping, laboratory instrumentation, and the
5E learning cycle to improve student conceptual understanding in a foundational
course on engineering dynamics. Engineering dynamics is typically a high
enrollment course nationally and is required of students in Mechanical,
Aerospace, Civil, and Bio Engineering programs. One study indicated that
national success rates in dynamics is approximately 53%. Because the course is
taken early in the undergraduate program, poor performance can often be the
cause of low graduation rates. This project is meeting three goals: (1) improve
student conceptual understanding of dynamics, (2) cultivate student interest in
learning dynamics, and (3) to understand if and to what extent the use of the
proposed pedagogical model impacts student learning
outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is the first of its kind to
integrate these three proven instructional approaches to improve student
conceptual understanding in dynamics. Building on previous work this study will
have a national impact on STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assessment
instruments contain both quantitative and qualitative components and the study
includes control and quasi-experimental groups utilizing pre and post testing.
