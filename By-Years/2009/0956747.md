This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a novel
security capability for protecting websites against hackers by providing
preventive and early diagnosis services. Compromising websites is an emerging
and profitable business for hackers, with devastating effects since such
attacks: (a) hurt the compromised site directly, e.g. stealing stored credit
card information, (b) hurt the website visitors, who are subjected to viruses
infections or identity theft via code injection, which turns a legitimate
website into a distributor of malware, and (c) hurt the reputation of the code-
injected website, which is inevitably blacklisted by search engines. The project
will develop the technology to: (a) assess the vulnerability level of a website,
(b) detect security breaches in the form of code injection, and (c) expedite the
recovery of a compromised website. the proposed work focuses on three key goals:
(a) massive scalability through the minimization of manual intervention, (b)
robustness and manageability by a carefully designed software-hardware
architecture, and (c) continuous process of self-improvement and assessment of
performance.

If successful, the impact of the proposed project has the potential to be
immediate and direct: it promises to make website security more affordable, and
not a luxury or an afterthought. Website security is an immediate and expensive
problem: (a) it is estimate that most websites (over 60%) are vulnerable, (b)
web-based malware spreading is taking the dimensions of a pandemic, (c) all of
the reported 74M active websites are likely targets: from banks, to the local
cookie store, and ultimately, (d) cyber-crime is a top national security threat
according to the government. The proposed solution has the potential to make
significant contributions in each of these four areas.
