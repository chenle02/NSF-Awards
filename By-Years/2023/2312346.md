The ‘shell’ is the glue that holds modern computer systems together: It is the
programming language that connects components and manages systems; it is the
quick-and-dirty language for writing scientific workflows and data analysis; it
is the control hatch that offers skilled users direct access to their computer's
inner-workings. Shell programming remains ubiquitous —steadily in the top 10
most popular programming languages— partly because it allows non-expert
developers to combine components available in any programming language with
little-to-no understanding of their internals. Unfortunately, this black-box,
language-agnostic composition hinders automated acceleration of shell programs.
This project will develop techniques to accelerate shell programs without
requiring input from shell programmers and little-to-no input from the authors
of individual components. This work's approach (1) builds on the real-world
success of prior research by the PIs (that requires more user input), (2) brings
together expertise in several subfields of computer science —parallel and
distributed systems, programming languages, and formal methods— and (3) offers
synergy. The individual techniques each offer significant benefits, but yield a
transformative whole.

By enabling practical, push-button enhancement of a real-world, pervasively-used
programming language, the proposed work promises to significantly accelerate
existing and new shell programs without any effort from their developers,
without any changes to existing infrastructure, and while maintaining
compatibility with prior results. The shell's ubiquity means these speedups will
have broad impact, especially in disciplines that use computing as a tool to
solve problems in their respective fields, e.g., bioinformatics, data science,
and economics.
