The project funded by this award consists of a collection of topics in
Stochastic Control and Financial Mathematics. The first topic is an optimal
investment problem where the investor is paying a proportional share of the
profit to the fund manager. The problem involves both modeling and the analysis
of the resulting non-standard stochastic control problem, in order to fully
characterize the optimal policy. In addition, an asymptotic analysis for small
proportional fees will be performed. The second topic represents a
characterization of semimartingale models of financial markets where Mutual Fund
Theorems hold true in the context of expected utility from consumption. This
will provide a tool for the study of mutual fund theorems for markets in
equilibrium. The last topic is based on a new definition of admissible
strategies for the optimal investment problem for utilities defined on the whole
real line and the duality results that derive from it.

Incomplete markets are financial models where contingent claims cannot be
replicated by trading, so they are not redundant. While, in practice, most
models are incomplete, the mathematical analysis of optimal investment and
pricing in these markets is usually very difficult. The present project
contributes to both modeling of incompleteness arising from different market
frictions, as well as to the mathematical analysis of the new stochastic control
problems resulting from such models. The second topic of the project is expected
to provide a better understanding of incomplete markets in a very general
mathematical framework.
