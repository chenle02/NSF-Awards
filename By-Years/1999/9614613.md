Abstract/Avery-(ATM-9614613) The objectives of this research are: (1) to
continue our observations of the atmospheric processes that operate throughout
the tropical Pacific using the Tropical Pacific Profiler Network (TPPN), (2) to
extend our existing multi-year observations into projected periods of strong
climate variability, (3) to extract from these observations accurate values of
the three-dimensional wind fields, including mean values as well as seasonal and
shorter- term variability (e.g., tidal and gravity wave intesities, (4) using
TPPN results in conjunction with other data bases, to study the relationship
between these quantities and global circulation, El Nino, tropical convection,
tropical rainfall estimation and diabatic heating, and orographyically-generated
waves, and (5) to provide data from the profiler network to the rest of the
scientific community by means of an Internet Web Site as well as by digital
computer disks.
