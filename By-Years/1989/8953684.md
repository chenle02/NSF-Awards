Microelectronics technology is a large and diverse field generating an
increasing body of knowledge, in the form of new design methodologies and
software applications, for use in microelectronics education laboratories. These
research results are now being applied to the education process at only a small
number of United States universities. The current complexity associated with
maintaining design laboratories himders the widespread introduction of
microelectronics curricula at many institutions. Better packaging for software,
and information tailored to the educational VLSI lab, allows many more
universities to offer these types of programs, while also providing a better
framework for introducing future microelectronic research results into the
educational environment. The grantee provides funds for this project that more
than match the NSF award.
