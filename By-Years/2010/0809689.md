Migration and storage of melts in the deep interior of the Earth is largely
controlled by the microscopic structure of the rocks. In partially molten rocks,
melt is distributed in nanometer to micron-sized pockets and tubules along
corners and edges of the mineral grains in the rock. The shape, distribution,
and connectivity of these melt-rich pockets and tubules determine the rate and
direction of melt transport through the rock. The area fraction of the grain
surface wetted by the melt tubules and pockets controls a large number of
physical properties, including the seismic signature of the partially molten
rock. This project will lead to the development of a theoretical framework for
quantifying the shape and distribution of the melt tubules and melt pockets in a
partially molten rock. The analytical and numerical tools developed in this
project will identify the forces that control the melt geometry, predict the
redistribution of melt tubules and melt pockets in partially molten rocks in
response to the forces of deformation, and use the observed seismic signature of
the so-called ultra low velocity zones to infer the extent of melting and melt
storage in the deep interior of the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;
