Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy is employed to examine the atomic
structure and electronic structure of quasicrystals. The scanning tunneling
microscope is incorporated with a surface spectroscopy chamber to allow
measurements under nonoxidizing conditions. Atomic structure, local order, work
function profiles, and electronic energies of local states are measured.
