Interstellar Scattering Disks. Dr. Gwinn will carry out a radio wavelength
observational study of the shapes of scattering disks in the interstellar medium
and of their temporal variations. The observations include Very Long Baseline
Interferometry (VLBI) measurements of the sizes of the scattering disks of
pulsars over periods of years; sensitive VLBI observations of the scattering
disks of hydroxyl masers; and a search for speckles in the scattering disk of
the Vela pulsar. Radio wavelength scattering in the interstellar plasma limits
the resolution and positional accuracy of observations of many radio sources and
will become more important as a limit as VLBI baselines are extended into space
and the accuracy of astrometric VLBI approaches the microarcsecond level. Large
scale plasma fluctuations, acting as lenses, can focus and defocus radiation
from pulsars and quasars, producing the observed low frequency variability of
these sources. Dr. Gwinn's research is directed toward improving our
understanding of the properties of the scattering plasma.
