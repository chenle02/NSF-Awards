9317691 Wilkins This proposal requests support to permit replacement of an
obsolete PDP-11 computer system controlling two mass spectrometers located in
the Southern California Regional Mass Spectrometry Facility. That computer
controls both a VG-7070 and a VG-ZAB mass spectrometer which provide services to
Southern California academic scientists doing research primarily in the fields
of biology, biochemistry, and chemistry. It is intended to replace the current
slow single computer with two modern independent stand-alone systems, along with
the requisite interface hardware and software. This computer upgrade will
substantially reduce mass spectral sample turn-around times and eliminate the
possibility that both mass spectrometers become inoperable as a result of a
single computer malfunction. As described in the "project description section"
mass spectrometric analysis is a vital part of any synthetic research involving
preparation and characterization of chemicals with biological functions. Thus,
the proposed equipment upgrade is expected to have a major impact upon the rate
of research progress for all facility users.
