The mechanisms involved in mitotic movements are central to our knowledge of
cell biology yet remain poorly understood. Understanding the regulation of these
mechanisms is crucial to development of an integrated model of cell division and
cellular motility in general. Recently a model system has been developed where
anaphase B (spindle elongation) can be studied in vitro using isolated,
functional spindles from a diatom. Using this system it was found that spindle
elongation in vitro requires a highly phosphorylated environment. Several
phosphorylated proteins associated with the microtubule overlap zone were also
identified. Protein phosphorylation thus may play a key role in the regulation
of mitosis. The identification and characterization of the protein kinase(s)
involved is proposed. An in vitro quantitative assay will be developed whereby
phosphorylation levels of overlap zone proteins can be evaluated. Phosphorylated
overlap zone proteins may be integral to spindle motor function. Also proposed
is an immuno-analysis of these proteins. A monoclonal antibody library will be
raised against phosphorylated overlap zone proteins. Any antibodies found to
inhibit anaphase B will be used to purify the antigen for in vitro
characterization. Antibodies also will be tried on higher plant cells to see if
these proteins are common to the higher plant mitotic machinery as well. Mitosis
is central to genetic inheritance in eukaryotic cells. Knowledge of the
molecular mechanisms involved with the ordered movement of chomosomes is
essential to any understanding of the mechanics of cell division as well as the
transmission of genetic information. The results of this study should greatly
enhance the minimal understanding we now have.
