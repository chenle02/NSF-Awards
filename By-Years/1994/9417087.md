Abstract University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences - John Roy Connection to
NSFNET Proposal No. NCR-9417087 This proposal for connecting the University of
Arkansas for Medical Sciences to the Internet will facilitate rapid, cost-
effective access to the vast array of resources and services available on the
Internet for faculty and students at the Arkansas Area Health Education Centers
(AHEC). It will enhance the research environment at the AHECs through improved
access to Internet resources, encourage faculty and researcher interaction and
collaboration, allow the sharing of departmental information and disease
databases, improve overall communications capabilities, facilitate more
effective evaluation of program outcomes and strengthen the professional support
system for rural providers.
