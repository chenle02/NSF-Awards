The goal of this proposal is to tailor modern topology optimization theories and
procedures to improve practical design processes of buildings subject to
stochastic excitations caused by natural or man-made hazards. By considering
random vibrations and structural reliability into the structural design process,
the proposal aims to provide optimum structural system for buildings. If
successful the theoretical development will lead to optimal design of tall
building that saves construction material while providing reliable service and
expected safety during earthquake events. The industrial partner will act as
advisor to the project to ascertain that the results are relevant to the
society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on concepts of structural
topology optimization considering dynamic excitations for building systems. It
will create a new framework for finding optimal topology of structures under
stochastic excitations caused by wind and earthquake loadings. It will also
investigate influence of stochastic excitations on optimal topology and find
equivalent load profiles for efficient topology optimization. By integrating
random vibration theory and system reliability into topology optimization, it
would be possible to identify optimal topologies for discrete (beam/column)
elements as well. A simplified equivalent static load profile will be developed
to facilitate design of lateral load systems. Results of this research will be
adapted into the curriculum at UIUC, and a new optimization course will be
introduced. The Co-PIs plan to continue their involvement in the existing
programs at the institution to attract students from underrepresented groups.
