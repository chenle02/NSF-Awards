9401079 Huang The proposer has classified up to flow equivalence all 2-
component shifts of finite type. He has recently classified n-component shifts
of finite type when 1 is not an eigenvalue of the defining matrix. The project
is to complete the classification for general n-component shifts of finite type
by proving a crucial "two-sided" realization theorem which may also have a new
implication to C*-algebras. Moreover, based on the existing results, the
proposer intends to study (almost) flow equivalence of sofic shifts, of
stochastic Markov shifts and of the more general setting of Laurent polynomial
matrices. Especially, he plans to explore more interesting relations between
flow equivalence and C*-algebras, including a conjecture he made for the
classification of non-simple Cuntz-Krieger algebras associated to 2-component
shifts of finite type. This project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic
theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems whose
dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail.
Under the heading of "dynamics" can be placed the modern theory of how groups of
abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way ergodic theory makes
contact with geometry and algebra in their quests to clasify flows and algebraic
structures. ***
