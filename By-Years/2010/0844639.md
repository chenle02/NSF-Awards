This project provides for international technology assessments and related
planning workshop support. WTEC and its predecessors have conducted over 60 such
technology assessments since 1989. The objectives include seeking technologies
to transfer to the U.S., evaluating the position of U.S. science and technology
with respect to leading competitors, and seeking opportunities for international
cooperation in research.

The project provides for four or more additional international studies and
reporting of the results, plus one or more workshops in area related to
international technology assessments.

Results will be disseminated at workshops including copies of visual aids
distributed in hardcopy and posted on the Web, final reports from each study
tour of academic quality in hardcopy, CD, and Web media, plus at least one
synthesis report on cross-cutting findings. A blog on international S&T policy
will be published to report progress.
