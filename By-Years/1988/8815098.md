The proposed work involves: new optical architectures, allows incorporation of
new optical devices (bistable arrays, ferroelectric liquid crystals, etc.) being
developed for other applications, and provides new algorithms and new
applications. It addresses the problem of the fact that different optical
systems architectures are required to implement different operations. The
proposed work will emphasize iconic image processing (at the pixel level),
feature and symbolic processing (low level features), processing of object parts
(medium level features), and information processing of facts (high level data).
This allows the parallelism, multi-processor and global interconnection
capability of photonics to be used at all levels (pixel, feature, part,
symbolic, and facts) of information/data processing. Such multi-functional
flexibility is not commonly found in optical processors.
