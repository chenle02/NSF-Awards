This award provides funds for the upgraded spectrometer to be developed
sufficiently to check if it is appropriate for future Class I Optical Sites. The
funding will complete the upgrading of the instrument (which will be a factor of
20 or so more sensitive than the existing spectrometer) and allow determinations
of its potential usefulness in twilight neutral composition studies.***//
