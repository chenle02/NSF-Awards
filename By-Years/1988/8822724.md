The support provided by this award will assist the Rochester researchers to
pursue the goal of real-time active vision. Based on their experience with
parallel vision algorithms on both general and special purpose hardware, they
will move to the next stage: integration of parallel solutions to individual
problems into a unified solution to a single complex problem. To facilitate this
research the award will help them develop a parallel laboratory for real-time
vision consisting of four key components: a "head," containing cameras for
visual input, a robot arm or "neck" that supports and moves the "head," a
special purpose parallel processor for high-bandwidth, low-level vision
processing, and a general purpose parallel processor for high-level vision and
planning. New research directions that will be investigated using the laboratory
include heterogeneous parallelism, hierarchical adaptive control for sensory-
motor systems, cooperation of symbolic planning with real-world action,
operating systems for sealable MIMD architectures, and parallel programming
environments. The laboratory will also serve to unify research in massively
parallel architectures, vision, planning, robotics, and parallel software
systems.
