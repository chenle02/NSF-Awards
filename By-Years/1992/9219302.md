This research deals with the investigation of relative strengths of oceanic
crust at ridges and transforms relative to the remaining oceanic lithosphere by
means of seismologically-determined stress drops from earthquakes. Preliminary
results show several interesting differences in the relative body and surface
wave magnitudes, seismic moments, and source time functions. These data suggest
that with respect to intraplate events, ridge earthquakes are generally "fast"
(releasing energy preferentially at short periods) whereas transform earthquakes
are generally "slow" (releasing energy preferentially at long periods). Using
seismic source models, the investigators have found that these differences are
consistent with ridge events having higher stress drops than transform events,
which implies a higher strength of the relatively thin crust at ridges. This
research seeks to expand the data set, continue and refine the seismological
analysis, and explore the tectonic implications.
