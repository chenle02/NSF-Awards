The principal investigator will study mathematical models that describe the
combined processes of heat conduction and electrical conduction in certain
semiconductors. Thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity are assumed to
be highly temperature-dependent. Due to the presence of strong degeneracy and
quadratic nonlinearities in the partiual differential equations that describe
these processes, these physical problems lead to deep and intriguing questions
in nonlinear analysis. Part of the mathematical analysis involves the
applications of partial regularity and the local description of a solution near
a singularity. However, solutions in these processes exhibit rich structures and
different structures require different mathematical approaches.

How to control temperature in microprocessors is a very important issue in the
semiconductor industry. The planned research will use mathematical models to
reveal how the temperature in a semiconductor depends on the known data. It is
expected that the understanding of these issues can assist engineers and
researchers in the design of future products.
