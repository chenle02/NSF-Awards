The PI proposes to apply ideas from the area of robust/stochastic optimization
to significant problems in the telecommunications industry. In order to develop
realistic models, the PI will work with Bellcore and US WEST. These firms will
assist in selecting the target applications, implementing the robust
optimization models, and evaluating the concepts.
