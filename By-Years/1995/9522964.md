9522964 Liechti This project is to determine the nature of and the force vs.
separation laws for crack faces where surface interactions may be occurring. One
possibility is that contact electrification may be taking place during the
formation of the new surfaces. A combined experimental/numerical approach will
be used to extract the force separation data for freshly cracked interfaces and
those interfaces that have been brought into sliding contact and non-sliding
contact. These will be complemented by measurements of charging and electron
emission in order to determine if electrostatic effects are involved in the
surface interactions. The knowledge obtained in this work is expected to be
useful in predicting the durability of microelectronic devices, coatings and
adhesively bonded joints. ***
