In this project within the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, Henry Taube (Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, 1983) of Stanford University
will investigate the coordination chemistry of vanadium in the oxidation states
2+ to 5+ in non-aqueous and aqueous solvents. The ultimate aim is to devise a
useful catalytic system for the oxidation of organic substrates by dioxygen.
Such a system has important implications in synthetic organic chemistry as well
as in the understanding of fundamental oxygen transfer processes. The effort
will include investigations of the stabilization of the different oxidation
states of vanadium by various ligands and solvents, the structure and
composition of the higher oxidation state species, the redox chemistry of the
various oxidation states of vanadium, and the kinetics of the substitution and
oxygen transfer reactions.
