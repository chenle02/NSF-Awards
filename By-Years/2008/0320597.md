EAR-0320597&lt;br/&gt;Johnson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) will acquire a multiple collector inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) to serve a highly diverse community of
researchers in the Geology Department and elsewhere on campus. This new
instrumentation will play a key role in the research and teaching programs of
the PI's that focus on the dynamics of magma generation, paleoclimate studies,
environmental geochemistry (contamination of groundwater with selenium and
chromium), and archeological tracing (hominids and artifacts). The equipment
will provide essential training on modern instrumentation for graduate students
from two core research groups, and valuable experience with key methods for
students from other research groups. Some of the research supported by this
instrument has direct impacts on environmental issues.&lt;br/&gt;
