Knowledge of the distribution and potential availability of mineral resources
in the ground is fundamental to many political and investment decisions that
will be made, placing economic geology at the interface between science and
society. This study propose to examine the effects of recent political changes
on the economic importance of non-fuel mineral resources in the affairs of both
developed and developing countries. Mineral endowment trends in substitution and
recycling, and policy strategies are preeminent concerns. Procedure will entail
consultation with international scholars in political science, mineral
economics, history, and geology, in addition to archival research. Results of
this study should provide guidance both for resource policy decisions and for
ore deposit research. The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide
opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or engineering
through research, and to encourage other women to pursue careers in these areas
through the investigators' enhanced visibility as role models on the host
campuses. In this effort, the proposed activities which contribute to the second
objective include: developing and teaching a course on minerals and world
affairs; presenting a seminar on science and policy, giving lectures on a
scientist's role in government; and serving as a counselor and mentor to
students.
