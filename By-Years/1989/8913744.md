This project is a small piece of a large multi-agency project (NSF,USGS,DOE)
involving scientific drilling in Katmai National Park, Alaska. As envisioned at
the present time, DOE will provide the drilling funds, and all three agencies
will share in the cost of the associated science. Actual drilling is not to
start until 1990 (subject to the availability of funds in DOE) but there are a
number of predrilling investigations that will be carried out in order to site
the drill holes in the optimum locations to achieve the scientific goals of the
project. This award will provide funds to carry out three experiments to try to
define the subsurface dimension of the 1912 Novarupta vent in preparation for
the proposed drilling: (1) reinterpretation of existing aeromagnetic and ground-
based magnetic survey data; (2) the acquisition of new magnetic data to fill
critical gaps; and (3) a detailed micro-gravity survey of the Novarupta
depression (caldera?).
