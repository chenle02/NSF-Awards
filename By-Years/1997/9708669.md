ABSTRACT This project will explore the use of 30-Si in fossil marine diatoms as
a tracer of diatom production, a substantial portion of primary production in
many parts of the world ocean. Surface sediments from the Southern Ocean will be
analyzed and the results compared with 15-N and 13-C analyses on the same
material. The results can be used to determine whether changes in opal
accumulation over glacial/interglacial cycles resulted from differential
production or preservation.
