The nation's physical plant is currently deteriorating more rapidly than it is
being maintained. To assist in the planning and scheduling of maintenance
operations, it is essential to have the data of each type of facility properly
documented and organized. This project will investigate the methods most
appropriate for each facility to gather the data, store it, analyze it, display
it, and disseminate it through a geographic information system. The results of
the investigation will be of benefit to managers of facilities by helping them
to determine budget requirements and future actions.
