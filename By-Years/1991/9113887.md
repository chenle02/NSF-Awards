This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to study the
properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast
Water (NEW) Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order to gain
an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope processes. This element of the
NEW program will study the physical oceanography and circulation of the NEW
polynya using closely-spaced CTD stations, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler and
current meter moorings. Current meter moorings will be used during the initial
four week research program and then redeployed for year-long measurements. The
moorings will be recovered during the second field research period. The data
from these instruments will be used to determine whether Atlantic Intermediate
Water arrives in the polynya via the polynya trough system to supply heat to
melt ice and to assess the importance of the flow fields to biological
productivity.
