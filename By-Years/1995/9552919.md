residential and commuter, Young Scholars project in molecular biology,
environmental science, and mathematics for 100 rising 10, 11, and 12 grade
students. Molecular biology students carry out laboratory projects, guided by
faculty, and attend lectures on enzymes, molecular genetics, and developmental
biology. Students in environmental science collect data and do environmental
analysis of various types of ecosystems in the Delaware Valley area. Mathematics
students explore areas of research including number theory, geometric
optimization, chaos, and statistics. All students have a computer lab and will
engage in follow-up activities during the academic year.
