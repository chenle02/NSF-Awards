This proposal deals with the automated layout of mixed analog and digital
circuits. Optical interconnect interfaces which contain optoelectronic arrays
integrated with digital processing capability require layouts in which noise
sensitive analog circuits must be distributed throughout digital designs on a
regular pitch for alignment with guided or free-space optical inputs. New layout
tools must automatically incorporate application specific geometric constraints
and analog noise requirements to produce layouts for these emerging
technologies. The floor planning tool must have inputs from (1) a mask
encapsulating the optical interface positioning requirements, called a keyhole
mask,(2) standard cell and block compilers, and (3) the analog interfaces
themselves. Problems being investigated are (1) creating a keyhole mask(2)
modifying the Berkeley floor planning tool to provide feedback to the standard
cell and block compilers based on keyhole mask inputs, and(3) modifying the
Berkeley standard cell compiler to provide modified compilations based on inputs
from the floor planning tool.
