Students in Molecular Biology are carrying out experimental analyses of genes
and their proteins with special emphasis on methodologies used to study
recombinant DNA and gene cloning. The instrumentation purchased through this
award is being used for the electrophoresis procedures which chemically separate
and identify proteins and DNA fragments. The major equipment items include
vertical and horizontal slab gel electrophoresis units and various supportive
instrumentation -- a microcentrifuge, scanning densitometer, constant
temperature incubator, shaker bath, analytical balance, and pH meter. The
student experiments are being developed around a model gene-protein system in
Bacillus, a spore-forming group of bacteria in which heat- resistant spores are
produced that contain sizeable quantities of small, acid-soluble proteins
(SASP). Such proteins play important, but not yet fully understood, roles in
spore germination. Students are isolating and identifying SASPs, and are
determining the number of genes involved in the coding their production.
