This research project is devoted to various algebraic and geometric aspects of
the equations of continuum mechanics and mathematical physics. The principal
areas of concentration include the equations of linear and nonlinear elasticity,
Lie algebras and quasi-exactly solvable quantum problems, the Cartan equivalence
method, bi-Hamiltonian systems, solitary waves, and nonlinear dissipation.
Specific applications include: 1. Conservation laws, symmetries, canonical forms
and invariants for the variational problems of linear and nonlinear elasticity,
2. The classification of Lie algebras of differential operators and quasi-
exactly solvable Schrodinger operators, 3. Canonical forms and integrability of
bi-Hamiltonian systems, 4. Nonlinear dissipation and normal forms for both
ordinary and partial differential equations, 5. Equivalence problems from the
calculus of variations, and 6. Existence and non-existence of solitary wave
solutions to higher order model evolution equations. These research topics are
relevant to the studies of important problems arising from fluid mechanics,
elasticity, and quantum mechanics. Particular problems to be addressed include
the investigation of solitary wave solutions to certain model equations for
water waves, classification and application of a new and physically important
class of quantum mechanical systems, understanding dissipation (friction and
viscosity) in mathematical models of nonlinear systems, and the analysis of
symmetry and conservation laws for linear and nonlinear elasticity.
