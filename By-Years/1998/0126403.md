FACILITATING EDUCATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2000,
the National Science Foundation (NSF) announced a special competition,
Biocomplexity in the Environment (BE): Integrated Research and Education in
Environmental Systems. This five-year initiative epitomizes NSF's stated
priorities of enhancing the integration of work done in research and education.
It requires that all research proposals be accompanied by a related educational
or outreach activity. However NSF is aware that many scientists have little
experience with translating or applying their research methods and findings to
educational settings. Proposing and designing education projects that are
useful, meaningful, achievable, and whose outcomes can be assessed for their
short- and long-term efficacy is a challenging task. The NRC aims to facilitate
the integration of research and education by convening a 2-day workshop focused
on the educational efforts of scientists working in environmental research and
related disciplines. Participants will include researchers who have successfully
integrated education with their research, researchers just beginning educational
projects, and education professionals with expertise in areas such as the life,
chemical, and earth sciences; assessment of teaching and learning; student
research programs; interdisciplinary approaches to teaching and learning
science; and state and national standards for science. At the workshop
Scientist/Educators whose work is exemplary will present their approaches,
methods, and perspectives. The sharing of their "stories" will be used as the
basis for a discussion on how to develop, implement, integrate and assess
educational components of research projects. The workshop discussions will be
summarized and published as a report together with papers submitted by
participants. The workshop summary report will provide a resource to assist
scientists who are struggling to integrate education components into their
research.&lt;br/&gt;
