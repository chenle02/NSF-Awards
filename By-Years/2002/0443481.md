ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colorado River Delta Research Coordination
Network&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will establish a network of natural
scientists, social scientists and legal scholars to facilitate
interdisciplinary, inter-institutional, and international research on the
Colorado River delta of the U.S. and Mexico. The network will focus on how
natural and human-caused variation in water supply affects the biotas and
landscapes of the Colorado River delta in the United States and Mexico.
Participants are from research institutions, universities, community colleges,
government agencies and NGOs in both countries. The grant will support
workshops, exchange visits, and a bilingual website that provides access to key
literature.&lt;br/&gt;The landscapes and biotas of the Colorado River delta,
once regulated by natural fluctuations in the river's flow, have now passed into
the control of human society. The Colorado River delta is thus a microcosm for
the transformation of the Earth's surface for human needs. Network activities
will improve the scientific basis of water and environmental policy in this
rapidly growing region. Broader impacts also include improved collaboration and
coordination of research efforts among disciplines, between U.S. and Mexican
scientists, and among academic, agency, and NGO scientists. Opportunities for
under-represented minorities will be enhanced through the participation of
community college students.&lt;br/&gt;
