In a recently completed study in SE Alaska we found a strong and unexpected
correlation between 15 N and aliphaticity in soils. Using Nuclear Magnet
Resonance (NMR), we are developing a relatively inexpensive and simple technique
for estimating humification in soils. The unusually high C content of these
Alaskan mineral soils (up to 18%), we believe, facilitated obtaining reliable
NMR spectra and stable isotope values. We propose here to extend this previous
work to forest soil types across a broader range of climatic zones, all of which
tend to be lower C content (&lt;7%) and drier than these Alaskan soils. We will
determine the extent to which 15 N and 13 C values correspond to degree of soil
organic matter humification (using NMR to estimate aliphaticity) in 4
contrasting ecosystems, in particular those in which illuviation is less
pronounced than in the Alaskan soils, N is less limiting (open N systems), and
microbial processes are faster. To do this will require exploring a variety of
techniques to obtain reliable NMR spectra in the presence of paramagnetics
(especially Fe). Based on the widely reported and consistent increase in 15 N
values with depth (and an associated lack of consistent trend with depth
reported for 13 C), our expectation is that 15 N but not 13 C values will
correspond to degree of humification across ecosystems worldwide. If we
successfully obtain reliable NMR spectra for the soils we study, and if this 15
N-aliphaticity pattern holds elsewhere, we will have developed a comparatively
cheap proxy for degree of SOM humification, which should allow controls on this
important process to be studied much more efficiently than now.&lt;br/&gt;
