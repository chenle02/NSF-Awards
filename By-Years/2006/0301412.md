The overall goal of this investigation is to formulate and develop
&lt;br/&gt;methods to analyze the complex interactions between noise,
symmetries, &lt;br/&gt;and nonlinearities inherent in rotating and gyroscopic
systems, &lt;br/&gt;particularly the dynamics of spinning flexible discs and
rotating shafts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach consists of a rational
construction of low-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;stochastic models that systematically
capture essential features of &lt;br/&gt;noisy mechanical systems. The basis of
the proposed work is a &lt;br/&gt;collection of limit theories for stochastic
processes which model a &lt;br/&gt;class of engineering problems with dominant
Hamiltonian dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;For the reduced model, one seeks standard
statistical measures of &lt;br/&gt;response and stability; e.g., mean exit
times, Lyapunov exponents and &lt;br/&gt;stationary measures, so that it may be
possible to design reliable &lt;br/&gt;engineering systems. The proposed work
will be a cross-disciplinary &lt;br/&gt;one, spanning the spectrum from modeling
and novel analytical &lt;br/&gt;techniques to experimental
verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We plan to transfer to industry innovative
theory and simulations &lt;br/&gt;developed in the proposed program which will
allow improved design &lt;br/&gt;and greater performance of various rotating
systems.&lt;br/&gt;An integral part of the final outcome of the proposed work
will be &lt;br/&gt;web-based simulators to be used in senior undergraduate and
graduate &lt;br/&gt;courses and to provide industrial designers with a
predictive tool &lt;br/&gt;to avoid unwanted behavior. This will enhance visual
understanding of &lt;br/&gt;the effect of noise on real engineering
problems.&lt;br/&gt;
