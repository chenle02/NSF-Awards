Research involves the continuation and expansion of an interdisciplinary-
international (US-French-Bolivian) paleontological program to document
vertebrate evolution, particularly of mammals, in the Late Cretaceous
(Maestrichtian) age El Molino Formation and Maestrichtian and/or Paleocene age
Santa Lucia Formation in southcentral Bolivia. The fauna from the El Molino
Formation at Tiupampa is spectacularly rich in both number of taxa and number
and quality of specimens--thus far the mammals are represented by over 600
specimens, including about 500 isolated teeth, 60 partial jaws with teeth, four
partial skeletons, four complete and four partial skulls. Collectively these
specimens represent at least 20 species of therian mammals, including 11
marsupials and 9 placentals. Among the marsupials are the earliest South
American records of the families Peradectidae, Didelphidae, Microbiotheriidae,
Caroloameghiniidae, and Borhyaenidae; and the only South American records of
Proteutheria, Pantodonta, and undoubted mioclaenine hyopsodontid Condylarthra.
The Tiupampa mammals are proving of great importance for understanding many
debated aspects (and creating new controversies) about the biogeographic
histories and phylogenetic relationships of early Cenozoic age mammal groups in
South America in particular and in the Western Hemisphere in general. P.I. will:
1) collect additional fossils; 2) prospect additional sites (including the
Campanian age Chauanaca Formation); 3) prepare fossils in hand and others to be
collected; 4) mold and cast type and important specimens for distribution to
interested colleagues and other research institutions around the world; and 5)
study and publish the results.
