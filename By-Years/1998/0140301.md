A broad program of research in the theory of elementary particles and
quantum&lt;br/&gt;field theory will include investigation of composite models of
particles thought to be&lt;br/&gt;elementary up to now using the existence of
extra space dimensions. The relation&lt;br/&gt;of violations of CPT symmetry,
where C is charge conjugation or matter-antimatter&lt;br/&gt;exchange, P is
parity or space inversion, and T is time reversal, to violations
of&lt;br/&gt;Lorentz invariance (i.e., of the theory of relativity) will be
investigated. The nature&lt;br/&gt;of elementary particle statistics will be
explored. These investigations are central to&lt;br/&gt;the understanding of the
properties and interactions of elementary particles.&lt;br/&gt;
