In recent decades, experts and decision makers have begun to recognize the roles
of lay experts as sources of information useful to policy, and to subject those
roles to scrutiny. The present study examines the use of such experienced-based
knowledge in the domain of marine fisheries management. This knowledge, although
qualitatively different from research-based knowledge, has been important in
policy outcomes. This award provides support to allow data collection on
cooperative research between industry members and government and academic
scientists in the United States and , to a limited extent, Canada. It will
entail a qualitative exploration of the role of cooperative research and the use
of experienced-based knopwledge in the production of scientific knowledge and
management decisions for groundfish, including cod. The goal of this preliminary
work is to develop accurate and detailed narrative accounts of the uses of
experience-based knowledge in the science policy process in North America, which
can become the basis of generalizations and hypotheses for further more refined
and comparative research. The project will include a meeting with colleagues in
the European Union engaged in similar projects, to prepare for further research.
This project contributes to understanding how knowledge develops and to
improving public participation in policy making.
