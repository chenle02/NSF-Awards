The School of Biology is the focal point for the institution's undergraduate
programs in the life sciences. It offers the Bachelor of Science degree in
applied biology and supports certificate programs in biochemistry,
bioengineering, and health and performance sciences. The long-term goal of the
institution is to promote student interest in pursuing careers in the biological
sciences by providing stimulating and realistic laboratory experiments through
the use of modern instrumentation. In order to realize this goal, computer-
assisted data acquisition and processing are being introduced in the laboratory
experiments. This process is expanding the experimental possibilities in many
undergraduate biology laboratories. It is also shortening the time and effort
required to gather sufficient data for statistical analysis, which allows the
focus of a laboratory exercise to shift from data collection to data analysis
and interpretation. The introduction of computerized acquisition and processing
techniques is benefiting the undergraduate laboratories in three distinct areas;
Image Analysis, Microbial Technology, and Environmental Biology. Automation of
the measuring and storage of images is allowing students to record statistically
valid data regarding the size, shape, and transparency of microscopic organisms
to determine variation, biomass, and productivity of natural populations. The
introduction of an automated carbon dioxide analysis system in the microbial
technology laboratory courses is enabling students to record and store
continuous measurements on disc and perform post-acquisition analyses to
determine growth curves and metabolic rates. In the environmental biology
laboratory courses, a computerized analysis system is being introduced to
measure energy metabolism and respiration in whole organisms and aquatic
ecosystems. *
