0730727 Micikas The BSCS (Biological Sciences Curriculum Study) is working with
an advisory panel to do an in-depth study of integrated science for high school
level courses. The project acknowledges the growing interest in integrated
science as states have increased their science requirements for graduation and
as states, school districts, and individual schools have struggled to implement
various standards in science education. This project is to help make sense of
the diverse assumptions now in place about the goals, placement of, and content
for integrated science in high school. The work plan involves solicitation of
substantive guidance from constituencies concerned with integrated science such
as scientific organizations, publishers, teacher educators, teachers, science
educators, mathematics educators, specialists in technology, and state science
supervisors. The advisory committee sets the framework for the design study and
reviews the process of the BSCS staff. The projected outcome is a report
available in hard copy and on the BSCS web site.
