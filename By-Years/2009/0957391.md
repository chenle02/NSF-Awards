This research program targets the study of unprecedented diastereo- and
enantiospecific photodimerization reactions in bimolecular crystals. Families of
homochiral, racemic, and quasiracemic cinnamoylsulfonamides will be developed,
and their crystal packing tendencies and photochemical crystal reactions
explored. These studies provide student participants with broad experience in
organic synthesis, crystal engineering, materials design, X-ray crystallography,
and issues in chirality, crystal cohesion, chemical reactivity and
nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of this award from the
Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program, Professor Wheeler, of
the Department of Chemistry at Eastern Illinois University, will fine-tune
solid-state reactivity via molecular engineering of constituent building blocks.
This research program promises to delineate the relationship between molecular
structure and the reactivity of the bulk solid with results leading to
transformative developments in the areas of solid-state reactions and materials
research. Findings from this program will be especially useful in future work
for rationally designed multi-component solid-state reactions, where managing
the spatial orientation of reactive components is often by chance rather than a
well-defined preconceived approach to molecular assembly. This project also
targets a number of other developments regarding recruitment and training in the
chemical sciences through enhancing the research relevance of laboratory
courses, devising novel approaches for incorporating advanced structure
determination techniques in the undergraduate curriculum, and fostering career
paths of students in the chemical and related fields. This project will have an
important impact on society because of the current technological need for next
generation methods for fabricating functional materials (e.g., optical materials
and therapeutic agents).
