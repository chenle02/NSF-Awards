This PYI award will fund research into the development of a methodology for
order reduction of nonlinear systems which (i) respects and preserves the
nonlinearity of the original model, (ii) does not require exact knowledge of the
relative speeds of various system variables, and (iii) incorporates the effect
of an exogenous control input. The results will have implications for nonlinear
controller design of systems with fast and slow modes. There are two major
reasons for developing a nonlinear model order reduction technique. The first is
common to all large dynamical engineering systems: the large number of governing
equations. The second reason concerns the fact that nonlinear effects can not be
neglected since they will often be the deciding influence in the performance of
many advanced engineering systems, such as high-performance aircraft, rapidly
maneuvering spacecraft, and chemical reactors. Only the first of these issues is
considered in the standard technique of first linearizing the dynamical
equations and then using a linear model order reduction technique. Clearly, any
nonlinear effect (such as bifurcations, or even nonlinear transient response)
will be lost using this approach. The main analytical framework for this study
consists of multiparameter singular perturbation theory and center manifold
theory. These two powerful tools will be merged and extended. Use of functional-
analytic results such as the so-called hard implicit function theorem will be
made. The research supported under this PYI award concerns the development of a
methodology for model order reduction of nonlinear systems. The approach will
attempt to preserve the nonlinear nature of the original system since the
nonlinearities may be the deciding influence in many advanced engineering
systems.
