In 1957 in the Netherlands, Pierre Marie Van Hiele and his wife Dina Van Hiele -
Geldof postulated a model of the development of geometric thought. The model,
which posits the existence of discrete levels of geometric thinking and phases
of instruction that help students progress through the levels, explains why many
students have difficulty learning geometry. Since l979 three major research
studies have investigated the validity of the Van Hiele model and its
applicability to American Schools. The project will convene 30 people (the
principal investigators and senior personnel from previous Van Hiele - based
research, scholars from mathematics education, psychology and computer science,
local supervisors, and teacher trainers) for a two and one half day conference
at Syracuse University. The objectives of the conference are (1) to analyze,
synthesize, and evaluate recent research on the Van Hiele model; (2) to examine
alternative models of geometric thinking; (3) to plan ways to utilize current
research results in developing materials for students and teachers of geometry;
and (4) to outline directions for future research. Conference proceedings will
be disseminated via a book of scholarly papers edited by the conference
organizer, via journal articles and other professional publications, and via
workshops and lectures by conference participants at professional meetings.
