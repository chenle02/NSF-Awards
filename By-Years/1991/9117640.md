Sierra Negra and Cerro Azul Volcanoes make up the southern end of Isabela Island
in the Galapagos Archipelago. Preliminary observations suggest that these
volcanoes are also fundamentally different, with Cerro Azul's lavas being the
most primitive and Alcedo's strongly bimodal. Detailed field studies
supplemented by geochronology will establish the eruptive history of the
volcanoes. Geochemical and petrologic study will be used to determine the
petrologic processes responsible for the diversity at the two volcanoes. These
data will add further insight into the volcanic and petrologic evolution of
Galapagos volcanoes and oceanic volcanism in general.
