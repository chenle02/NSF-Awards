The objectives of this project are to address two key issues in the modeling of
premixed turbulent reacting flows: (1) examine the effects of flames on
turbulence, principally through the pressure-velocity gradient correlation,
which will address a major weakness in current turbulence models of reacting
flows; and (2) study effects of differential diffusion of mass and energy on
combustion, which will address a significant aspect of combustion modeling that
is not considered in present flamelet models. To meet these objectives,
turbulent flame propagation will be studied using direct numerical simulations.
These are large computer calculations in which no models are used. Thus, they
can be used like laboratory experiments to study basic physical processes in
turbulent flames. The approach proposed is to use DNS to examine the issues
listed above and increase our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms and
processes involved. This insight is then used to suggest improvements to
existing models and develop new models. The models are tested using the data
generated in the simulations. Combustion is a significant and widespread source
of power in many important technological systems. Requirements for increased
efficiency and reduced emissions are placing increased demands on these systems.
To effectively meet these requirements will require accurate predictive computer
modeling. These models must represent the complex processes of gas flow
turbulence, combustion, and the interaction of the two. Current models in these
areas are lacking in many respects and are limiting the widespread use of
computer modeling as an engineering design tool.
