This award supports travel costs for students and junior researchers to attend a
summer training workshop at the University of Texas at Austin in the domain of
SaTC--secure and trustworthy cyberspace. The event allows emerging scholar
cohorts the opportunity to diversify the way they think about technological and
data intensive research problems as well as to expand and diversify their
professional networks. Participants are mentored by faculty and receive
opportunities to lay the groundwork for ongoing collaborative engagement with
peers and more experienced researchers. This interdisciplinary environment
creates opportunities for scholarly innovation and future leadership. This
growing network will help to strengthen sociotechnical approaches to privacy,
security, ethics, and data science research among colleagues in their home
departments, and to their future students and
colleagues&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
