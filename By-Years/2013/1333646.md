The objective of this award is to develop a new paradigm for the determination
of reserve requirements for either day-ahead unit commitment (UC) models or
reliability UC models to maintain a reliable electric power system.
Specifically, this work will 1) develop novel mathematical programming
frameworks for the determination of reserve zones and reserve levels embedded in
unit commitment models; 2) develop mathematical frameworks that adaptively
determine reserve requirements for various reliability standards; 3) embed
dynamic reserve policies inside stochastic programming algorithms in order to
improve scalability and solution quality; 4) compare the techniques to existing
reserve rules as well as stochastic programming techniques; 5) validate the
concepts by demonstrating improvements in reliability, economic efficiency, and
scalability; 6) validate these techniques by examining their ability to
facilitate the integration and management of high levels of variable generation
(renewable) resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the mathematical
frameworks for reserve policies will lead to improvements in electric power
systems operations and planning by improving efficiency and systems reliability,
with a reduction in grid outages. This framework will also improve the ability
to manage renewable resources and, thus, allow for higher levels of variable
renewable resources, which will help reduce emissions and it will facilitate the
development of a sustainable economy for energy independence and security. The
process to balance reserve policies with stochastic programming algorithms will
facilitate the integration and adoption of stochastic programming in electric
power systems. The mathematical models and polyhedral studies developed will
also contribute to large scale network flow or scheduling problems with
uncertainties and reliability standards, e.g., transportation systems and
telecommunication systems.
