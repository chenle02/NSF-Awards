Many bridges constructed by steel plates welded together to form deep girders or
large box sections have collapsed as a result of the brittle fracture fatigue
failure of the weld metal. A technique to increase the fatigue life of welds
would be very beneficial to local, state and Federal agencies who have the
responsibility of constructing and maintaining bridges within their
jurisdiction. This project will investigate an innovative technique of using an
explosive treatment applied to the weld metal in order to improve its fatigue
life. This technique has the potential of being an effective low cost method
when compared with the currently applied alternatives. The research will consist
of establishing the mechanism by which a shock wave enhances the failure
resistance of weld metals. The researcher is qualified to perform this
investigation from experience and education and the required experimental
facilities are available. This is the first year of a two year award for an
amount of $91,395 for the first year and $96,868 for the second year for a total
of $188,263.
