Manifold learning approach for nonlinear dimension reduction has drawn
considerable interests from the machine learning as well as applied mathematics
communities. The basic idea is to consider data as samples from a low-
dimensional nonlinear manifold embedded in a high-dimensional space. Hongyuan
Zha and Haesun Park propose to develop efficient computational algorithms for
nonlinear dimension reduction and theoretical tools for analyzing and better
understanding their behaviors as well as applications to video sequence
annotation and ad-hoc sensor network localization problems, focusing on the
following two important issues in manifold learning: 1) deeper understanding of
the behaviors of manifold learning methods such as local tangent space alignment
through analysis of the spectral properties of the alignment matrix, and
developing specialized pre-conditioning methods for effectively handling ill-
conditioned problems; and 2) exploring and adapting methods such as domain
decomposition to develop more efficient and scalable computational algorithms
for manifold learning. As applications of the proposed algorithms, video
sequence annotation in the context of semi-supervised manifold learning and
algorithms for ad-hoc sensor network localization problems especially for the
case when the terrain is nonflat will be developed.

Extracting compact representations of complex and high-dimensional data are at
the core of many scientific and engineering endeavors. Manifold learning has
become a very active research field aiming at discovering hidden structures from
the statistical and geometric regularity inherent in many complex high-
dimensional data. The investigators study methods that have the promise of
significantly expanding the applicability and functionality of existing and new
manifold learning methods and thus advancing the state of the art in manifold
learning research. The proposed research lies at the interface between
scientific computing and machine learning applications and provides an ideal
setting for research cross-fertilization and collaboration as well as training
of graduate students in interdisciplinary research. The applications in Video
sequence annotation is important in surveillance analysis for homeland security
and localization methods for sensor networks will contribute to the development
of new generation of networking systems.
