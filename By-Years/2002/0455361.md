This SGER proposal describes research on grid workflow refinement and execution
for abstract workflows in two areas: preplanning and advance resource
reservation; and context-aware dynamic planning and failure repair. Drawing from
AI planning techniques, resource reasoning, and languages for expressive
knowledge representation, techniques for workflow refinement will be developed.
Mechanisms for monitoring and failure-detection based on models for expressive
representation of the environments will also be developed. Resulting service
implementations will build upon the existing Pegasus workflow mapping system and
disseminated through Pegasus.
