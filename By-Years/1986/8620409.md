Multilimbed industrial robots (robots that have at least one arm and two or
more legs) are suggested for improving robot performance in industrial
automation. Because of the legged mobility, a multilimbed robot has three
advantages in comparison with an ordinary arm: (1) a large reachable work space,
(2) arm degeneracy avoidance, and (3) large force exertion by the hand. To plan
multilimbed robot motion, the arm-leg motion coordination problem is studied
through task decomposition. Specifically, a given task is decomposed into
subtasks for arm manipulation and for leg locomotion. The former is defined as
the end-effector motion with respect to the main body, and the latter as the
motion of the main body itself. For optimal decomposition of a given task, three
criteria are proposed: least-energy, best-manipulability, and minimum-effort.
