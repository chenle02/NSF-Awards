The velocity of seismic waves and the electrical conductivity of the oceanic
crust and mantle at mid-ocean ridges depend on how melt is distributed around
mineral grains. The strength of the mantle also depends how much melt is
present, so flow of the mantle is strongly dependent on the amount of melt. The
investigators want to examine several aspects of melt distribution with
laboratory experiments on mantle rocks. The experiments will determine how the
strength of the rocks depends on the presence of water, and temperature, and
strain. They will also determine how melt is distributed in the rocks. The
results of these experiments will be applied to measurements of seismic wave
velocities and electrical conductivity that are being undertaken on a mid ocean
ridge.
