This project concerns the development of efficient algorithms and programs for
RNA structure prediction, using both established models of RNA structure and
dynamics, and emerging new models. Computational RNA structure prediction is a
classic area of research, starting more than thirty years ago, and yet it is
still a vital and open area. The motivation for this project is based on three
fairly recent developments. First, in the last decade, there has been a huge
growth in understanding of the varied biological roles and properties of RNA.
Second, there has been recent, yet still limited, progress on experimentally
determining new RNA structures and dynamics. Finally, and most central to this
project, there have been recent theoretical and practical advances in the time
and space-efficiency of solutions to classic problems of RNA structure
prediction. This also points to the fact that additional powerful algorithmic
techniques developed in the computer science community have not been fully
exploited (or in some cases ever applied) to problems of RNA structure
prediction. This provides a clear and compelling opportunity to improve
computational RNA structure prediction, i.e., through improvement in the
efficiency (in time and space) of computational methods, and by incorporating
new biological and structural insights into the formulation of computational
models and problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve the
efficiency of algorithms for a variety of RNA structure prediction problems
through the further development and exploitation of known, powerful algorithmic
techniques that have not been previously introduced or fully exploited in
addressing RNA structure problems. The project will also provide implementations
of these ideas as computer programs and empirically validate the theory. The
project will also articulate new computational problems and models for RNA
structure and dynamics, driven by new and emerging biological and structural
results.
