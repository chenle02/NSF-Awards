9626173 Spatzier The proposed research lies at the interface of differential
geometry and dynamical systems. A principal goal is to investigate the dynamical
and geometric structures of "higher rank" systems. In particular, the
investigator intends to classify hyperbolic actions of higher rank abelian and
semisimple Lie groups or actions which preserve geometric structures, and also
establish other rigidity properties. The investigator also plans to study
Riemannian manifolds (especially higher rank ones) and their geodesic flows.
Both geometric, dynamical and group theoretic tools are used in this research.
Geometry is one of the oldest fields in mathematics, and generally studies
curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues, their shapes, shortest
paths, and maps between such spaces. Differential geometry had its roots in
cartography, and is now studied for aesthetic reasons and its close ties with
physics and other sciences and applied areas (computer vision e.g.). Dynamical
systems is a relatively new field that investigates the evolution of a physical
or mathematical system over time (e.g. turbulence in a fluid flow). New ideas
and concepts from dynamics (e.g. chaos, fractals) have changed our perception of
the world fundamentally. Dynamical systems have had a major impact on the
sciences and engineering. Symbolic dynamics for instance has been instrumental
for developing efficient and safe codes for computer science. Tools and ideas
from smooth dynamics are used as far afield as cell biology and meteorology.
