This project involves the dissertation research of a student from the
University of California-Davis. The student will focus on disputes about the use
of federal lands in Nye County, Nevada. Ranchers dominate the rhetoric about
federal land use and local politics in this area although they are not the
dominant industry. The student hypothesizes that the ranchers' dominance is
based on their use of `anti-colonialist` rhetoric and use of powerful cultural
symbols against the federal government, tracing their cause back to the colonial
exploitation of the West by Eastern interests. The student will study local
lifestyles through participant observation in government meetings and local
social and political events, will collect genealogies and federal land surveys,
and will interview participants in Forest Service and BLM disputes. This
research will shed light on a subject of great current interest, the anti-
government rhetoric and activities of local people concerned about `White
identity` which has given rise to militias and other anti-government movements.
The in-depth social science knowledge will correct biases and advance public
understanding beyond sensationalist media accounts. ?
