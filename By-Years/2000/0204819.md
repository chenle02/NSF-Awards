The Polar Research Board (PRB), a unit of the National Research Council, was
established in 1958 to advise the government on polar issues. The PRB strives to
make research in the polar regions more productive and responsive to the needs
of the United States, to maintain U.S. awareness of, and representation in,
international science programs, and to enhance understanding of issues in polar
regions. The Board provides national and international scientific and technical
information to U.S. government policy makers and the polar community, represents
U.S. interests in international nongovernmental polar scientific organizations
and conducts focused studies in areas of polar science, technology and resource
management. The PRB facilitates participation of U.S. scientists in two critical
international committees dedicated to planning and coordination research in the
Arctic and Antarctic [i.e., the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC)
and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)]. PRB activities are
conducted by a group of volunteer experts, supported by a small staff, selected
from academic institutions, industry and national laboratories. The PRB will
continue to serve as an information center for distributing materials on IASC
and SCAR to U.S. government agencies and the polar community. Other federal
agencies and foundations also provide support to the PRB.
