9612283 Dupuis This multidisciplinarv research project, overlapping the
disciplines of Materials Science, Electrical Engineering, and Chemistry
comprises a comprehensive approach to study the synthesis and properties of thin
film native oxides in technologically important III-V semiconductors, as well as
addressing the improvement of optoelectronic devices through the use of these
oxides. The overall aim is to achieve greater basic understanding and subsequent
development of a native oxide suitable for compound semiconductor structures to
obtain comparable performance to the role and importance of SiO2 in silicon
based electronics. %%% The project combines concepts and methodologies from
materials science, electrical engineering, chemistry and physics with advanced
electronic, spectroscopic and structural characterization tools to address
forefront issues at the interfaces between these disciplines. The research will
contribute basic new knowledge at a fundamental level to several aspects of
materials science engineering, and optoelectronics. An important feature of the
program is the integration of research and education through the training of
students in fundamental interdisciplinary research areas. ***
