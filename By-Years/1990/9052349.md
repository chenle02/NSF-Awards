A Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and related sampling
accessories were acquired through this project in order to implement an
instructional project which has yielded "across the board" improvements in
undergraduate chemistry instruction at the institution. This project involved
the design and implementation of experiments utilizing the FTIR and its data
station for both upper and lower level courses. The work enhanced the quality of
undergraduate instruction in three way, namely by (1) serving as a vehicle for
teaching advanced instrumental concepts such as analog-digital relations and
software data manipulation, (2) providing students hands-on experience with a
modern, computerized instrument commonly encountered in academic and industrial
postgraduate settings, and (3) motivating underclassmen to purse chemistry as
their major field of study by exposing them to the "state of the art" in
infrared analysis. The institution contributed to this project in an amount
equal to the NSF funds.
