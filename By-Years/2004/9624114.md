This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported in the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, aims to focus on the synthesis and
characterization of stable thin films that will be suspended across
microfabricated structures. During the tenure of this four-year continuing
grant, Professor Fritsch- Faules and her students at the University of Arkansas
will test these structures for application in novel devices for sensing and for
biomimetric applications. Submicron structures will be constructed to support
suspended films such as artificial biomembranes. The inorganic substrates will
be both insulators and conductors depending upon the particular function they
are intended to serve in these structures. Studies of these surface- confined
materials will probe their stability and function with variables including
electric field strength, solvent character and ionic composition of these
systems. Professor Fritsch-Faules will include a host of activities that are
designed to involve students in the K-12 grades. Educating these students in the
high-order thinking abilities and problem-solving skills that are part of
science and mathematics will be emphasized. Community Access Television and the
World Wide Web will be used to disseminate such programs to diverse audiences.
The ability to construct new three-dimensional microfabricated structures with
wells having geometries for supporting suspended thin films will be an important
outcome of this CAREER research project. The characterization of these suspended
thin films will be a challenging scientific and engineering problem that depends
on Professor Fritsch-Faules' unique background in electroanalytical chemistry
and in microfabrication science. Her integrated educational plan is no less
ambitious and it has the potential for immense societal impact upon the K-12
students in her immediate geographic area in the near-term and upon a much more
broadly distributed cohort in the long-term.
