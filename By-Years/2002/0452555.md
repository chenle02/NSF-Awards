The concept of risk aversion is important for macroeconomics, finance, and
insurance. This award funds innovative research that will provide direct
evidence regarding the degree and hetereogeneity of individual risk aversion.
Much of the existing evidence is based on laboratory experiments and answers
given by individuals to hypothetical survey questions. This project is different
because it uses market data about individual decisions about insurance
purchases. These data are combined with information about insurance claims
history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his co-author will develop a structural
econometric model based on expected utility theory. This model will be used to
analyze data from the market for automobile insurance in Israel. Individuals are
allowed to vary in two unobserved dimensions -- their level of risk and their
coefficient of absolute risk aversion -- and the econometric model will allow
the researchers to estimate the joint distribution of these two factors. This
information will then be combined with ex-post data on insurance claims to allow
the investigators to separate actual levels of accident risk from risk
aversion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result sfrom this project will benefit
policymakers and others who need to predict the decisions individuals make in a
variety of risky situations. This includes most insurance and financial markets.
