Professor Palathingal will undertake the investigation of single quantum
annihilation of positrons, using the Dynamitron facility of the Brookhaven
National Laboratory. Differential cross sections will be measured with enhanced
precision for the core electron shells, employing thin targets of varied atomic
number.
