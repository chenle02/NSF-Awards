The project is to build and operate a cryogenically cooled polarimeter that will
be used in conjunction with the bolometer camera at the Caltech Submillimeter
Observatory to map the polarized emission from Galactic molecular clouds at a
wavelength of 1.1 mm. By adding a polarizer to the millimeter-wavelength camera,
a significant increase in mapping speed over existing submillimeter polarimeters
will be achieved. The data obtained with the polarimeter will be used to map out
the detailed magnetic structure of various components of the interstellar
medium.
