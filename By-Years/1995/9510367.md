The focus of this research is the development of new methodology for the
synthesis of organofluorine compounds. The insertion of difluoromethylene in
fluorinated organometallic compounds gives a new technological method for the
synthesis of fluorocarbon derivatives, whic have demonstrated value as
commercial surgactants. The routes to fluorinated polyenes and aromatics.
Polymerization of diiodofluoropolyenes will give fluorcarbon polymers with
potentially useful conduction properties. The aromatic derivatives prepared via
the synthon chemistry will provide precursors for the synthesis of high
temperature aromatic polymers with a Teflon-like surface. The new fluorine
containing heterocycles will give new building blocks for the incorporation of
fluorine into biologically important compounds, and the new porphyrins will be
useful oxidation catalysts for the conversion of petroleum feed stocks to
industrially important organic chemicals with minimal environmental impact. With
this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Donald J. Burton of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa.
Professor Burton will focus his work on the development of new synthetic
methodology for the preparation of organofluorine compounds. These methods will
provide useful routes to molecules of both academic and industrial importance
spanning the spectrum from materials to biologically important systems.
