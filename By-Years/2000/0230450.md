Proposal : IIS-0230450&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;PI:
Larry Leifer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, entitled
"Accelerating globally Distributed Team Innovation: Building an Experimental
Testbed to Leverage Digital Libraries in the Transformation of Design
Engineering Education" is a collaborative effort of Stanford University and
Strathclyde University, Scotland. The project also informally engages partners
at other institutions. The project proposes the development, implementation and
use of a testbed to improve the teaching and learning of students participating
in global team based design projects. The project aims to fundamentally change
the way design engineering is taught by combining the use of digital libraries
with virtual design studios. The goal of the project is to enhance student
learning opportunities by enabling them to partake in global, team based design
engineering projects, in which they directly experience different cultural
contexts and access a variety of digital information sources via a range of
appropriate technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
