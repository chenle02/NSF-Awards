Hash-based data structures and algorithms are currently a booming industry in
the Internet, particularly for applications related to measurement, monitoring,
and security. Hash tables and related structures such as Bloom filters are used
billions of times a day, and new uses keep proliferating. There remain, however,
large gaps between the theoretical design and analysis of these structures and
their use and implementation in practice. This research aims to bridge the gap
between the theory and practice of algorithms and data structures that utilize
hashing, with an emphasis on networking applications. The outcomes of this
research will include tools and frameworks for translating theoretical results
into real-world settings, better analyses and implementations of existing
algorithms and data structures, and the development and analysis of new
algorithms and data structures. Related educational efforts will focus on
methods to make undergraduate students, graduate students, and the professional
networking community more aware of the potential and power of hash-based
approaches, thereby expanding the reach and influence of theoretical work in the
area.
