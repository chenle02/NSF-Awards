EAR-0345612&lt;br/&gt;Farquhar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support a
full time laboratory technician who will work in the newly renovated Stable
Isotope Facility of the Geochemistry Laboratories at the University of Maryland
(http://www.geol.umd.edu/~jfarquha/stable_isotope_lab.htm). The laboratory
technician will be primarily responsible for the mass spectrometry facility.
Other responsibilities will include overseeing the day-to-day operation of
sample preparation facilities, supervising visitors, post doctoral fellows, and
students using the facility, and for the development, refinement, and
application of new analytical techniques. This facility presently houses four
mass spectrometers and is overseen by two principal investigators. Geochemical
investigations undertaken in the Stable Isotope Facility span a wide range of
research topics, including: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Earth's earliest sulfur and
carbon cycles;&lt;br/&gt; Photochemical and atmospheric studies;&lt;br/&gt;
Studies of the Earth.s crust and mantle;&lt;br/&gt; Studies of
meteorites;&lt;br/&gt; Proterozoic glacial cycles;&lt;br/&gt; Permo-Triassic
extinction and recovery;&lt;br/&gt; Hydrologic processes; and&lt;br/&gt;
Ecological studies.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;All of there on-going projects require
a versatile set of mass analyzers and inlet systems, and the full-time
coordination and oversight of a technical officer. In this role, the technician
will contribute to the science of the facility, and be expected to contribute to
the training and teaching of students and other users from within and beyond
University of Maryland boundaries, including course activities that utilize the
laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;
