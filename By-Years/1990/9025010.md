This award is for renewed support for the National Center for Earthquake
Engineering Research (NCEER) at the State University of New York (SUNY) at
Buffalo. The Center was established by NSF in September, 1986 with matching
funds from the State of New York and industrial sources. The goal of the Center
is, through multidisciplinary research and the use of a systems approach, to
accelerate the advancement of basic knowledge, improve engineering and disaster
management practice, enhance the educational process, and facilitate technology
transfer to professional and public users; its special function is to contribute
to improved seismic safety through the timely and effective implementation of
new knowledge and techniques in earthquake hazard mitigation. This award will
enable the Center to continue to make advances in earthquake engineering
research, including in such areas as structural, lifeline and geotechnical
engineering systems as well as in the area of disaster research and planning. In
addition to its coordinated research program, the Center will also continue to
carry out its technology transfer program, which will include working with
building officials and operating one of the major earthquake information
clearinghouses in the country.
