This research uses the measured scattering parameters of GaAs and In (GaA1) As
heterojunction transistors (emitter-up and emitter-down) to obtain an optimized
model of the device. The method of modelling is based on the simulated annealing
algorithm which avoids the problem of entrapment in local minima encountered in
conventional methods of modelling. The resultant model is expected to lead
devices that offer superior microwave performance.
