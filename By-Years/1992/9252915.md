The "Hands-on Universe" project creates eight supplemental investigations in
which students analyze astronomical images taken by remote telescopes using
charge coupled device detectors. Current and past images will become available
from the Automated Supernova Search, which takes 500 images per clear night. The
analysis is done in the classroom using IBM-compatible image processing software
developed at the University of California/Berkeley for research work. The
activities, intended for high school astronomy, physics or physical science
courses, provide hands-on investigations coupled with an in-depth experience of
engaging in science research using powerful technological tools.
Telecommunications links students, teachers and professionals in a genuine
collaborative and apprenticeship style interaction which can lead to original
research. The activities, generated by professional astronomers and teachers,
include investigations of the mass of Jupiter by measuring the motion of one of
its moons, spatial dimensions of the solar system, collaborative searches for
varying sources, plotting light curves, and distance to distant objects.
Materials will include an introductory video, student materials, and software
for students to conduct their own image processing activities.
