9451098 Barber In order to enhance the teaching of behavioral neuroscience in
our Psychology curriculum, we propose to acquire specific equipment items for
introductory and methodology courses in Biological Psychology and for student
research in this field. The formal courses bring students up to date on basic
findings, theories, and techniques of Biological Psychology. Equipment requested
for the Introductory course in the sequence (Psychology 125) will facilitate a
weekly demonstration component that provides video, interactive computer, and
hands-on experiences to enable students to visualize structure/function
relationships and to "see" anatomical and physiological terminology in an active
context. The Methodology course (Psychology 325) combines lectures and
discussions with laboratory exercises. Students ultimately perform a guided
experiment on brain/behavior relationships, using equipment provided by the
grant. In this experiment, students examine (1) the normal physiological
functioning of brain structures implicated in learning and memory and (2) the
ways these structures may affect learning and memory. Students in the
Methodology course also prepare a professional report of their experiment and
participate in co-producing a Laboratory Manual in Biological Psychology, to be
used by future student generations. Thus, they undertake a full range of
scientist's activites, from the acquisition of factual information, through the
generation of new data, to dissemination of information into the community of
scientists.
