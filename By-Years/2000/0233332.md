The NWCET Skill Standards for Information Technology are used by The Boston Area
Advanced Technological Education Connections (BATEC) in a summer institute and
follow on activities to understand industry requirements and to align academic
curricula of the partner schools with them. Relevant curricula from the BATEC
partner schools are cataloged, the academic outcomes and skill standards
addressed within functional clusters, and gaps and redundancies are noted. This
results in a "Roadmap of Opportunities" - a 2+2+2 mapping framework to ensure
flexibility in and across information technology career clusters that serves as
a foundation for future cooperation agreements between the schools. The
"roadmap" also provides navigational guidance to facilitate student movement
through various educational levels in a flexible, systematic manner with
multiple entrance and exit points.
