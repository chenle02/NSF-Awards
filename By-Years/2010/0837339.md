Interdisciplinary - (99)

This project creates the courses necessary to add a forensic engineering track
to the undergraduate Interdisciplinary Engineering curriculum at the Missouri
University of Science and Technology. The investigators are developing three new
interdisciplinary courses, Applied Design of Experiments, Reverse Failure
Analysis, and Forensic Investigation Procedures, that form the core curriculum
of programs in engineering accident and crime scene investigation. The courses
utilize modern pedagogical techniques including case based learning and problem
based learning in an effort to increase student learning outcomes. The courses
incorporate real-world engineering forensic examples and hands-on laboratory
experiences. The project includes an extensive and rigorous evaluation plan with
both formative and summative components. The evaluation plan uses both
quantitative and qualitative data to measure student achievement and course
material effectiveness. The new course materials and evaluation results are
disseminated to other educators and institutions through established online STEM
knowledgebases, including the National Science Digital Library, and national
workshops. The project includes a focused outreach effort to interest eighth
grade girls in careers in engineering.
