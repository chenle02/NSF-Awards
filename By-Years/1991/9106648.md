Research will be conducted on solvable statistical mechanical and quantum field
theoretical models. Particular emphasis will be placed on the chiral Potts
model. The chiral Potts model has recently been solved for its eigenvalues and
displays a number of novel effects. The model exhibits a commensurate-
incommensurate phase, the magnetic analog of optical activity and a Pokrovsky-
Talapov transition. Further studies will be undertaken of this class of exact
level crossing transitions which may impact strongly interacting fermion
systems. Order parameters and correlation functions in the incommensurate phase
will be computed. The results of this solvable level crossing system will be
used to study more general non-integrable models. More general integrable models
will be examined. Connections with the mathematics of monopoles, algebraic
geometry and topological field theory will be explored. %%% The study of
complex, interacting, many-particle systems lies at the foundation of condensed
matter physics and materials physics. Because of the complexity of these
systems, radical approximations frequently need to be made in order to obtain
solutions. However, occasionally a physical model, such as the Ising model, is
able to be solved exactly. These exact solutions provide invaluable guidance to
understanding the underlying physics and the mathematical structure of the exact
model and related models. The chiral Potts model has recently been solved
exactly and the proposed research will investigate the application of this model
to various classes of physical phemonena and further explore the nature of the
solutions.
