In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Barry M. Trost of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford
University aims to improve efficiency in organic synthesis through the
development of asymmetric catalysis. Specifically, three areas of catalysis are
targeted. The first involves the rational design of ligands for formation of
dinuclear and heterodinuclear metal complexes as catalysts for addition
reactions. The second area involves asymmetric trimethylenemethane
cycloadditions. The third area examines Pd catalyzed asymmetric allylic and
benzylic alkylation. Novel Ru-Pd sequential reactions for asymmetric synthesis
and examination of such systems in the context of Mo catalyzed reactions will
also be pursued. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need of increasingly complex organic
molecules for a myriad of applications ranging from biology to material science
heightens the need for increased efficiency in organic synthesis. This project
intends to achieve high synthetic efficiency through high reaction selectivity
and high atom economy. Successful accomplishment of this project will positively
impact the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and specialty chemical industries and
contribute positively to the sustainability of the society. The project will
also provide excellent trainings to the graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows involved, including those currently underrepresented in Chemistry.
