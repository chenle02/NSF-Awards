This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a computer system to
be installed and operated in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the
University of Connecticut. The University is committed to providing the
remaining funds needed for the purchase. The computer system will be used
primarily in research on deep Earth structure and seismic wave propagation,
earthquake strong ground motion studies, and the structure of descending
lithospheric slabs.
