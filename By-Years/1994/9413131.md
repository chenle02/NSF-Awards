Kassner 9413131 The research is to develop an efficient spheroidization
technology for several aluminum alloys. Specific heating processes and cycles,
compositions, and forming operations will be developed that allow effective
production and fabrication of spheroidized semi-solids as determined by cost and
final material properties. Traditional metal shaping processes such as casting
and forging can be dramatically improved in terms of cost and reliability using
novel semi-solids alloys. However, this is possible only with special processing
of semi-solids to ensure a spheroidized microstructure. Semi-solids with a
typical dendritic morphology of the solid phase cannot be readily shaped due to
cracking. To date, producing a spheroidized microstructure on a commercial scale
has been difficult. The research is directed at the use of semi-solids in the
casting of aluminum alloys. The reduction of casting temperatures in foundries
is a worthy goal. The manufacturing process development is a collaborative
effort between an aluminum industry and the university. The commerical potential
of the work is high.
