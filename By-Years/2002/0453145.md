For centuries, scientists, engineers, and mathematicians have been building
predictive models of the world around them using Differential Calculus, an
invaluable tool in describing complexity using concise, continuous relations
between measurable quantities. However, the historical differential modeling of
the laws of nature clashes with the purely digital nature of current computers:
if no special care is used, turning continuous equations into discrete numbers
often results in a limited predictive power, as discrete computations can be
unfaithful to the underlying mathematics and physical principles we are trying
to simulate. In this project, the investigator and his colleagues develop and
adapt discrete-geometry based methodologies for concise discretizations, as well
as discrete operations, which are faithful to the continuous world they are
meant to represent. The goal is to create a Discrete Differential Calculus, for
which computation is no longer an afterthought requiring a discretization of
continuous models, but is ``built-in'' from the start. This approach promises to
provide theoretical and computational foundations for modeling that are directly
amenable to digital computations, with guaranteed higher
fidelity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research, a synergetic mixture of classical
modeling and novel computational tools, promises to be a rich source of
fundamental and computationally important methods, and interdisciplinary
interactions. The investigator anticipates a mutually beneficial flow of ideas
among physical sciences, mathematics, engineering and Information Technology to
emerge from this unifying approach to discrete computations. The novel
methodology resulting from this careful reformulation of modeling is expected to
concretely result in an improved predictive power and a host of algorithms which
will be practically useful in countless applications---from weather forecasts,
earthquake engineering, building and car safety, to biomedical simulation and
diagnostics from medical imaging.
