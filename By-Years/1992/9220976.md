Fine, ultrapure, uniform, loosely agglomerated particles are desirable starting
materials for advanced ceramics. Mixtures of silicon nitride and silicon carbide
are particularly valuable. In this program, the use of silane/acetylene/ammonia
flames to produce silicon nitride/silicon carbide powders will be studied.
Specific tasks include: (1) Experimental determination of flame stability limits
on a flat-flame burner for selected mixtures of silane, ammonia, and acetylene
as a function of unburned gas velocity; (2) Thermodynamic determination of
expected flame temperatures and product yields as functions of input
compositions, pressure, and initial temperature; (3) Determination of the
effects of operating conditions on the properties of the powder produced,
specifically what operating conditions devermine whether the individual
particles are a mixture of the carbide and nitride or whether the nitride and
carbide are in separate particles; (4) Determination of the product properties
(chemical composition, purity, particle size distribution, morphology); and (5)
Interpretation of the results in terms of mechanisms and commercialization
potential. High quality ultrafine silicon nitride/silicon carbide powders have a
large potential market in the preparation of advanced ceramic materials via
sintering or hot pressing. Progress in production of advanced ceramics is
currently limited by the unavailability of a US-made high quality powder. In
addition, an understanding of the mechanisms involved in this process will have
broad implications for combustion synthesis (especially of mixed materials) in
general.
