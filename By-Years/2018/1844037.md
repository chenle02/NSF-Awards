The broader market impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project is to foster the mainstream use of decentralized
database solutions in place of centrally owned and operated data centers and
cloud services offered by companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. Data
security breaches involving tens or hundreds of millions of customers are now
commonplace, as are high-profile news stories related to questionable uses of
customer-supplied data.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to solve the key problem of developing a new
network protocol that allows for a low-latency, secure, persistent and highly-
available, decentralized No-SQL database which may operate at Internet scale.
Key objectives include: development of a novel P2P overlay network which
combines a zero-hop Distributed Hash Table (DHT) as a base routing layer and any
number of traditional Kademlia DHTs as application specific leaf networks, all
of which may communicate through a variety of transport protocols; constructing
a new proof-of-space for use both as the consensus layer of a proof-of-space
blockchain and as a proof-of-capacity for storage nodes; creating a secure
Decentralized Storage Network utilizing a proof of replication based on
verifiable delay functions; and implementing and testing the protocol across
common host devices and client runtimes. The end goal of the project is to
validate the technical feasibility, scalability, and market interest for the
subspace protocol.
