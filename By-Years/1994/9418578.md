9418578 Van Schmus This project will examine a diverse crustal xenolith suite
from the Navajo volcanic field in the Four Corners area of the southwestern
United States. The research will include field, petrographic, major and trace
element, U/Pb zircon dating, and thermobarometric studies. Major objectives are
to determine the spatial, depth, and age relationships among these xenoliths,
and from these results, to better understand the origin and evolution of the
crust in this region.
