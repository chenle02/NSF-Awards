This project will investigate the anomaly exhibited in the vibrational motion
of copper atoms in high Tc superconductors that has been detected near the onset
of the superconductivity. At present it is not known whether this anomaly is
associated with the superconductive state. The experiments will use blocking of
beta particles emitted from neutron activated Cu-64 nuclei in a superconductor,
neutron absorption spectroscopy and channeling radiation spectroscopy. These
measurements will provide a quantitative measure of the amplitude of the atomic
vibrations that can be correlation with the superconducting properties. The
experiments will involve collaborations with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
and with Aarhus University in Denmark
