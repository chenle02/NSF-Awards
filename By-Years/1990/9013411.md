This project supports a conference which focuses on techniques to analyze
problems associated with air and structure borne sound and vibration. The
techniques include sound intensity, structural intensity, modal analysis and
synthesis, statistical energy analysis, passive and active damping, boundary
element methods, diagnostics and conditioning monitoring, material
characterization, and non-destructive evaluation, active noise and vibration
control, sound radiation and scattering, and finite element analysis. The
techniques have potentially numerous applications in aircraft, spacecraft,
buildings, and infrastructure systems.
