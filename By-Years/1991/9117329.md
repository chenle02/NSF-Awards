This Science in Developing Countries award will support a Seminar on Research in
Socio-Economics Aspects of Disasters in Developing Countries in Central America,
to be held in San Jose, Costa Rica, in summer 1992. Organizers of the seminar
are Russell R. Dynes of the Disaster Research Center at the University of
Delaware and Allan Lavell, Director of the Central American Research Program at
the Confederacion Universitaria Centroamericana in San Jose, Costa Rica. The
seminar aims to highlight areas for future regional collaborative research
concerning the social and economic impact of disasters and emergencies on
society. The agenda includes an assessment of current disaster risks in the
region, a review of research in the field, an analysis of the current status of
socioeconomic aspects of disaster, determination of high-priority research
areas, development of cooperative research projects, and establishment of a
research network within the region and with the United States. The 24 Central
American and U.S. participants, all active researchers in this field, will
benefit from an exchange of current information and future research ideas.
