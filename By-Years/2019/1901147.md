This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Boundaries
of Random Walks and Applications" that will be held on June 4-6, 2019 at Bowdoin
College. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on the topic of random
walks on groups, which interfaces core areas of mathematical analysis and
related fields, specifically probability, ergodic theory, geometry, and operator
algebras. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and
speak at this conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of
underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF an opportunity to attend
and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make
this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different
activities. More information will be made available at:
