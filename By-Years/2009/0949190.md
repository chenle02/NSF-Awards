This award provides $56,805 in NSF funding over 12 months to acquire borehole
geophysical instrumentation and supporting equipment to characterize hydraulic
properties and fractrure flow hydrology in the field. Funds will be used to
obtain a winch with cable, caliper probe, resistivity probes, flowmeter,
software, data loggers, TLC meter, a generator, and pump. The main focus for
this equipment is to characterize fracture hydraulic properties and
interconnectivity. Tests will be conducted under a variety of ambient and
stressed conditions. The instrumentation will significantly enhance
hydrogeological and environmental science education at SUNY Plattsburgh. The
borehole geophysical instruments will be used for to students in both research
and classroom environments. The equipment will be incorporated into
undergraduate classes to provide opportunities for students to use state-of-
the-art geophysical equipment. Students will learn how to collect and interpret
geophysical data and apply that information to the study of fractured-rock
hydrology, thus better preparing them for graduate school or industry.
