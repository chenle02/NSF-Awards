9422794 Kole Once predominately white and male, the American Labor force is
composed increasingly of women, minorities, and foreign-born workers. Given the
changing face of America's workforce, the objective of this project is to better
understand how a divers workforce affects the activities of the firm.
Specifically, a theoretical framework is developed to capture the impact of
worker heterogeneity on organizations, and its testable implications are
explored. The spirit of this research is that workforce diversity impacts
organizations both within their boundaries and in the interface with customers.
In both of these of settings, information is exchanged and miscommunications are
assumed to lower the efficiency of the firm. This assumption of lower
communication costs between similar-type agents formalizes worker heterogeneity
as a form of human capital and facilitates the matching of a firm's distribution
and customer populations to minimize delivery costs. ***
