A research team, lead by Dr. Michael Jochim, will conduct a survey and
archaeological excavation in the Federsee region of Germany. Prior work by Dr.
Jochim has revealed the presence of a Late/Terminal Mesolithic site, Henauhof
West, which is located near an extinct shoreline of Lake Federsee. The site
holds great potential because materials lie in a layer of waterlogged peat and
this has resulted in the excellent preservation of cultural remains. Not only
faunal remains but also fragile plant specimens can be recovered. The materials
recovered from these excavations will be analyzed to show changing patterns of
subsistence and material culture during the transition from Late to Terminal
Mesolithic. Dr. Jochim will also conduct a regional survey to locate other
sites. This period of Central European prehistory is of interest because it
marks the first appearance of agriculturalists in an area which until then had
been occupied solely by hunting and gathering societies. During the Late
Mesolithic the Federsee region was inhabited solely by such foraging peoples. In
the Terminal period the first agriculturalists most likely appeared from the
Southeast. Archaeologists have speculated on the effect of this contact and have
proposed a number of models for the interaction which resulted. Some have
suggested that hostility was the norm while other believe that rapid
assimilation took place. Very little data however are available to address this
issue and, for this reason, Dr. Jochim's work is of great interest. From a
broader perspective, this research is important for several reasons. First, it
examines the interactions between more and less technologically advanced
societies, and the general principles which emerge may be applicable to many
situations, including contemporary ones. Secondly, because of the close
cooperation between the German and American teams, scientific ties between the
two countries will be strengthened.
