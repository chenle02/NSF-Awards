The primary purpose of the workshop is to bring together leading scientists from
academia, industry, and government agencies to discuss the role of large-scale
computing in Theoretical Structural Biology and to discuss the formation of a
Grand Challenge Group in response to the High Performance Computing and
Communications Initiative. The scientific focus of the workshop will be on
structure/function aspects of biological macromolecules and their relationships
to high performance computing. The subjects to be discussed are: 1) structure
determination and the protein folding problem; 2) molecular recognition and drug
design; 3) catalysis, i.e., enzyme reaction mechanisms and electron/proton
transfer processes. This workshop will also allow graduate students and post-
doctoral researchers an opportunity to meet the leading scientists in the field
and to become acquainted with the future development in Structural Biology.
