In the last decade there has been a growing interest in applying evolutionary
and ecological ideas from biology to the study of social organization. Such
work, known as organizational ecology, focuses on the determinants of births
growth, and deaths of organizations. This study is designed to explain the
changes in the population of firms in the U.S. brewing industry over the past
three centuries. The foundings, mergers, and disbandments of firms will be
examined in terms of both the dynamics internal to the population of brewing
firms (e.g., competition among firms) and environmental factors external to the
industry (e.g., economic cycles). Special attention will be paid to the effects
of size on the "liability of newness," the handicap that new firms operate
under. The analysis will be carried out at the city, state, and nation-wide
levels. This research will contribute to our understanding of the nature of
long-term structural change in an organizational population.
