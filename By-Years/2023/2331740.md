The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a device to deliver pharmaceutical or cosmetic dental treatments
into tooth enamel. Currently, state-of-the-art treatment to enamel relies on
topical application. However, the nanoporous nature of the enamel inhibits
diffusion of small molecules and pharmaceuticals, which prevents deep and rapid
treatments. The deeper and more rapid delivery of a diverse range of therapeutic
molecules into the enamel, such as fluoride or potassium, could lead to better
protection against tooth decay or sensitivity. The proposed technology is
designed to enhance infiltration of small molecules to provide higher efficacy
and/or longer lasting dental treatments. This may improve fluoride treatments to
prevent cavities, cosmetic whitening procedures, and antibiotic delivery to
treat pulpitis that would otherwise require root canal treatment.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a technology to induce
electrokinetic flow within the nanochannels of the teeth to drive fluid flow
into the dental enamel. Electrokinetic flow is produced as a result of the
electrical double layer that exists in the nanochannels of the enamel being
driven by an imposed electrical field. Through application of a sufficient
voltage across the dental enamel, this method allows rapid and deep infiltration
of small and large, charged and uncharged molecules into the teeth. The proposed
technology may impact both preventative and cosmetic dentistry. In addition to
the delivery of fluoride and potassium treatments, the proposed technology may
be used for the delivery of large and macromolecular species such as dental
resins, which may expand the use case for these protecting and strengthening
species on non-decayed or previously acid-etched teeth.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
