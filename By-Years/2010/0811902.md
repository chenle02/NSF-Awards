In the past few decades biochemists have discovered that practically all
fundamental molecular design problems are about the geometric relationship of
complex molecules. Massively parallel and distributed versions of such
algorithms have been recently developed in hope of finding such proteins with
shear brute force. For example, implementing screensavers that harvest idle CPU
time from PC users worldwide to provide sufficient computing power to solve the
protein prediction problems. So far, all these attempts have produced very
modest improvements. This project takes a radically different approach: the
molecular folding problem is cast as a massively distributed 3D puzzle game, and
encourages people to work together with computers to find the solutions to
current open problems including cures for cancer, AIDS, and discovery of novel
biofuels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental idea is to employ user-assisted
optimization for protein design, and formulate and present it as a competitive
game played by thousands of people. The intention in this project is that people
will play the game beacause it is fun (it looks like a fun 3d puzzle and not
like some biochemistry textbook), it is addicting, it is competitive, it is
collaborative (players can work together in groups to solve a problem), has
impact (players want to get credit for the drug that cures cancer). The impact
of this proposal is in its addressing of a number of fundamental areas: 1) how
to best develop games to maximize human ability to discover novel proteins
beyond what is currently possible with computation-only approaches; 2)
determining the guiding principles of a successful molecular design game; 3) how
to best generalize game-development principles to the widest possible range of
biochemical problems; 4) revealing what is learned from the way people play the
game, and how these strategies could be "distilled" towards developing stronger
automated approaches.
