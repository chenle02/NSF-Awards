The project will convene a community workshop for the purposes of motivating and
accelerating progress on the integration of hydrometeorological-hydroclimatic-
ecohydrological process understanding for improving predictive capabilities,
sustainability and resilience to environmental change. The goal is to lay out a
framework for identifying and addressing key challenges in hydrometeorological-
hydroclimatic-ecohydrological understanding and predictions and formulate
consensus scientific, observational and modeling challenges. The primary outcome
of this workshop will be a community White Paper that articulates the challenges
and opportunities facing integrated hydrological-atmospheric research.
