CHE-0202784 PI: McHale, Jeanne L.

In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, McHale will conduct a series of spectroscopic investigations
of interfacial electron transfer and chromophore aggregation. Resonance Raman
intensity analysis and absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies will be used
to investigate the sub-picosecond dynamics of interfacial charge-transfer from
excited electronic states of dyes adsorbed on semiconductor surfaces. Details of
the electron injection by dye sensitizers adsorbed on colloidal titanium oxide
nanoparticles suspended in aqueous and non-aqueous solution will be
investigated. Along with electronic absorption and emission spectroscopy,
resonance Raman experiments will also probe the nature of the electronic
coupling of the dye and the semiconductor.

This research deals with fundamental photophysical processes of dyes adsorbed on
semiconductor surfaces. The results of the work will be of interest in the
development of dye-sensitized solar cells and related photoelectrochemical,
photovoltaic, and photocatalytic devices. Students will participate in this
research and acquire research skills in a technologically important area.
