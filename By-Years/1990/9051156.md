The college is modernizing, upgrading, and revitalizing biological instruction
directed primarily toward freshman biology courses. Instrument purchases provide
opportunities for students to develop skills and knowledge about computer
interfaced spectrophotometers, pH meters, and physiological recording apparati.
While the previous course was largely descriptive, the new courses use an
inquiry/problem solving approach to biological study, thereby enhancing the
development of critical thinking, data analysis, application of technology, and
scientific reporting. Students initially use the instrumentation in pre-designed
experiments and then use them to answer experimental questions that they have
initiated. In addition, the instrumentation is shared with upper division
courses in physiology, cell biology, and biochemistry to enhance their
laboratory experience. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
