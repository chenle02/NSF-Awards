This award supports research related to networks that change over time. Examples
of such networks include road systems, railways, power grids, and
telecommunication networks. Because networks form the backbone of many integral
components of society, designing efficient network layouts is crucial.
Historically, network design studies have predominantly emphasized the final
design while ignoring uncertainties that are inherent in the future, such as
construction delays or variable user demand. This research aims to devise
network design strategies that take both time and future uncertainties into
account. To that end, this work will be conducted with Dr. Dmytro Matsypura, one
of the pioneering experts in time-varying network design, at the University of
Sydney. The result will be a mathematical model and solution framework that
produces efficient design strategies for expanding networks. This framework will
intentionally be made as general as possible, to allow for direct application to
various types of networks.

This work bridges the areas of network design and stochastic optimization by
incorporating uncertainty into the design model. The initial focus will be on
the traditional Shortest Path Problem, solved to optimality on the user-defined
network at every time within a predetermined period. In order to account for
future uncertainties (i.e. arc build times, arc build costs, user demand), this
project will use a stochastic multi-stage programming framework with the
objective of minimizing total cost. This modeling strategy, though very
powerful, is expected to be computationally expensive. To overcome this hurdle,
this research will analyze solution properties and emphasize algorithm
development and heuristic methods. Solutions to this newly proposed ?Stochastic
Incremental Network Design Problem? will be compared to those from existing
methods. This project will give insights into balancing modern computational
ability with modeling and optimization frameworks for network design. This NSF
EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.
