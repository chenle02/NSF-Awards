The desire to characterize the trace gas composition and chemical reactivity of
the troposphere has stimulated the development of various instrumental methods
for the analysis of atmospheric gases at low part-per-billion and part-per-
trillion concentrations. In order to assess the quantitative agreement between
independent analysis methods, the atmospheric chemistry community has promoted
the use of formal intercomparisons. The principal investigator of this award has
developed a portable dynamic dilution system for the preparation of synthetic
gas mixtures containing known pptv amounts of various sulfur gases. This system
was recently employed successfully in an intercomparison focused on sulfur
dioxide. An important step in extending the use of this system to non-sulfur
compounds is the development of an enhanced measurement capability for testing
and monitoring the different test gas streams prepared by the modified gas
delivery system. This award is to develop such a capability based on an
atmospheric pressure ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (API-TOFMS).
The API-TOFMS will provide rapid response time for simultaneous real-time
monitoring of several analytes and relative design simplicity and robustness for
dependable field operation. The instrument will extend the use of the gas
dilution system to trace atmospheric compounds such as nitrogen gases,
halogenated gases, aldehydes and ketones, and biogenic hydrocarbons. It will
also contribute to the education and training of young scientists related to the
importance of quality assurance for trace species measurements.
