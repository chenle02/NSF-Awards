The use of the microcantilever-based sensors for detecting onset of protein
expression will be tested in a model cell line. The device consists of a
piezoelectric cantilever smaller than 5 microns in length coupled to antibody
proteins immobilized at the cantilever tip. Binding of target molecules is
detected by monitoring the resonance frequency shift. Due to the small size, the
cantilever potentially allows for high sensitivity. Because the proposed
piezoelectric cantilever sensors use electrical signal for actuation and
detection, the sensor and all necessary electronics can be organized in a
compact form thereby enabling use in applications such as bioreactor monitoring
and genomics-inspired proteomics.&lt;br/&gt;
