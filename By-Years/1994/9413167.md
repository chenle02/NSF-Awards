9413167 McCartney This project is a contribution to the US World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Hydrographic Program (IO WHP). The PI
will provide hydrographic support and scientific leadership for the first two
legs of the expedition, denoted as WOCE lines I8S and I9S, respectively. These
are essentially meridional lines along 115 degrees east, and 85 to 95 degrees
east between about 30 degrees South and the Antarctic continent. Specific
objectives include study of the deep water circulation in the western South
Australia Basin, and the formation of Subantarctic Mode Water Antarctic
Intermediate Water along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. ***
