This award will support Quantum Information Processing Workshop to be held in
Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on December 12-16, 2011, at the Mathematics Research
Center at the University of Montreal. More detailed conference information for
QIP 2012 may be found at http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Quantum2011/. This workshop
is the central event in the area of Quantum Computing and, more generally,
Quantum Information Science. It is expected that QIP will bring together about
300 leading researchers in theoretical aspects of quantum information and
computation, and play a role as one of the most important venues for the
groundbreaking research in theoretical computer science. NSF support will help
broaden participation at the QIP Workshop by subsidizing the travel for
participants who might not otherwise attend QIP, and assist with the venue
costs. Organizers aim at increasing the number of student and postdoctoral
participants from the under-represented groups.
