The goal of this research is to develop a new framework to control teams of
mobile robots, cooperating in a beamforming fashion, to transmit information
between multiple source-destination pairs, while meeting quality-of-service
constraints and consuming minimum power. The approach of this project ensures
robust communications and longevity in challenging environments, arising during
the transmission of high-rate data, such as video or images, or in environments
where there is no line-of-sight. It also allows significant performance gains
compared to static systems that do not consider
mobility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research lies in
the development of a cyber-physical system of mobile beamformers, where the
physical space of robot trajectories and velocities constitutes an input to the
cyber space of wireless communications, and vise versa. Integration of the
resulting discrete and continuous dynamics and different time scales requires
the synthesis of new theoretical results drawing from control theory, wireless
networking, distributed optimization, and hybrid control. This cyber-physical
system combines the following interrelated objectives: Distributed control of
mobile beamformers; Node selection, grouping and motion scheduling; Rich models
of the communication space; Platform deployment and
validation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this research will
provide these necessary components in facilitating the design of mobile
autonomous systems and fostering their adoption. Wide availability of such
systems can have a significant societal impact on, e.g., search, rescue and
recovery operations, environmental monitoring for homeland security, or
surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The broader impact of this project
lies on disseminating the research output in the industry and academia.
