Temporal dependence within the workload of any computing or networking system
has been widely recognized as a significant factor affecting performance. More
specifically, autocorrelation in flows, is catastrophic for performance.
&lt;br/&gt;In a simple single server system, autocorrelation in the arrival
intensities or service demands may result in user response times that are slower
by several orders of magnitude. In homogeneous clusters where size-based load
balancing policies have been proved optimal for performance, autocorrelation in
the arrival intensities of jobs obliterates any performance benefit of
traditional load balancing policies.&lt;br/&gt;In multi-tiered systems, if a
service process of any of the tiers is autocorrelated, then user response times
are very high, in spite of the fact that the bottleneck resource in the system
is far from saturation and that the measured throughput and utilizations in all
other tiers are also modest, falsely indicating that the system can sustain
higher capacities. In storage systems, autocorrelation in the arrival or service
processes at the disk level may result in significant user-perceived performance
degradation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at providing a practical way
to characterize and quantify the performance impacts of autocorrelated flows in
systems. The main focus is on the development of new technologies for resource
allocation that consider autocorrelation as an important characteristic of any
stochastic process. On-line monitoring of autocorrelation provides the necessary
information for scheduling parameterization, making an important step toward the
development of autonomic systems.&lt;br/&gt;
