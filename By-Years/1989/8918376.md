Dr. Wittebort is pursuing three areas of investigation under the general
heading of structure and dynamics in bimolecular systems. They include the study
of local magnetic interactions in transition metal clusters related to electron
transport proteins, torsional dynamics in crystalline and fibrous proteins and
the properties of water in solid proteins and related compounds. In each case,
the experimental method employed is nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The
feature of magnetic resonance that makes it useful is that in a solid, such as a
crystalline molecule or a fibrous protein, interactions between nuclear spins
and spatially anisotropic local fields can be directly observed and simply
related to molecular structure. Furthermore, the effect of time dependent
processes such as atomic reorientation is to average and reduce the anisotropic
local fields in an understandable way. Thus the experiment is a good way to
study simultaneously molecular structure and dynamics. The results over the past
three years, which are the basis for this proposal, show that the onset of rapid
electron transfer among three chemically and magnetically coupled Fe or Mn ions
is coincident with the onset of rotational motion of a nearby solvate molecule,
that water molecules in hexagonal ice readily explore the four tetrahedral
orientations surrounding the oxygen atoms in a time of 100 microseconds, and
that most of the water of hydration surrounding a crystalline protein is
dynamically disordered and distinguished from liquid water primarily in its
higher viscosity.*** //
