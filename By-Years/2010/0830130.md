Symbolic/Numeric Linear Algebra
Computation&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary characteristic
of symbolic computation with large rational numbers is that the computations may
be slow but exact -- sometimes more exact than needed. The primary
characteristic of numerical computation with floating point numbers is that the
computations are fast but approximate -- sometimes more approximate than
acceptable. In this research, accuracy and speed of computation are achieved by
using hybrids of symbolic and numeric methods. This work involves improvements
for linear system solving, matrix inertia computation, and minimal polynomial
computation. The methods and implementations that this project creates can be
taken up by software systems used widely in science, engineering, and education
such as Maple, Mathematica, and Matlab. This research contributes to the
fundamental understanding of the interplay between the exact and the
approximate.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators create and demonstrate computational
methods to solve several classes of linear systems of equations. Techniques
heretofore undeveloped in this arena include matrix bordering techniques and
iterative refinement. Additionally, the research improves symbolic-numeric
capability to compute inertia of matrices, a measure that is important in
control theory and arises in the study of Lie groups. The research includes
finessing numerical loss of accuracy and handling of singular cases. The
experimental approach to mathematics is enhanced by enabling large problems to
be solved, particularly in number theory, combinatorics, algebraic geometry,
thus providing data for conjecture formation and for experimental verification
of conjectures. For science and engineering, this project creates a capability
to solve a class of problems for which no solution method currently exists at
all, specifically it is to solve linear systems where (1) numerical methods fail
due to ill-condition of the problem instance, yet (2) the exact result is valid
and meaningful despite the approximate nature of the input data. &lt;br/&gt;
