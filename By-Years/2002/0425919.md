Funds are provided to resolve a controversy about the origin of the continental
margin bedforms comprising the "Humboldt slide" feature off the California
coast. Previous workers using seismic reflection and multibeam sonar data have
interpreted them as either landslide or drift deposits. The PIs will attempt to
resolve the question by using existing sediment cores and apply anisotropy of
magnetic susceptibility (AMS) analysis of marine sediment to determine the
nature of some continental margin deposits (slide deposit vs. bedforms). Though
it has been demonstrated that the AMS method can distinguish slumps from un-
deformed sediment, this method has not yet been applied to seafloor structures
of unknown origin.
