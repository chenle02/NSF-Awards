This award funds a new Directorate of Computer & Information Science &
Engineering (CISE) special project at Iowa State University. The project
provides resources and services to the community of new investigators organizing
CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites at their universities.
The team at Iowa State will work with other experienced CISE REU Site leaders to
create the REU PI Guide, a set of web-based resources to help new CISE REU Site
researchers prepare and run and effective and efficient REU Sites. CISE REU
Sites typically involve universities hosting a cohort of 8-10 undergraduate
students from around the country for summer research in state-of-the art labs
with faculty teams. REU Sites often target students who do not have such
research opportunities available to them at their home institutions. This
project will provide resources so that faculty can organize and run quality
summer research experiences that will be of long-lasting benefit to
undergraduates as they complete their degrees, pursue graduate school
opportunities, or enter the computing workforce.

The team will undertake a series of five activities to implement their vision:
assess needs, collect and refine resources, create video overviews, create and
refine the REU PI Guide website, and evaluate the impact. The project is led by
a team that has significant experience in conducting a CISE REU Site as well as
extensive interactions with the CISE REU Site PI community. The team also has
the design expertise and evaluation expertise needed to fully implement the REU
PI Guide vision. The team will consider all stakeholders including the faculty
site leaders, the faculty project mentors, REU program coordinators, graduate
student mentors, and the REU students and provide resources to meet all of their
needs. The resource should enhance the quality of undergraduate research
experiences which are valuable components in the of preparation of
undergraduates to become the computing professionals needed in the future.
