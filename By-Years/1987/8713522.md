This is a study of the articulation of vowels in a large number of languages,
through the examination of collections of x-ray photographs located in
repositories in Budapest, Strasbourg, Toronto, and Iowa City. No new x-ray
photographs will be made. It is expected that comparison of these photographs
will demonstrate that the range of variation across speakers of a given language
will be systematically constrained, and from language to language there will be
regular differences in vowel articulation. This study has the potential to
contribute to a quantitative model of articulation in support of phonological
theory, which until now has made tenuous connections between basically
perceptual features and the actual configuation of the vocal track during speech
production. The hypothesis of the investigators is that there is a finite set of
"articulatory primes" which serve as the building blocks of all vowel
articulations observed across languages.
