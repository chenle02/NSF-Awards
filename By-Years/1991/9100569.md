This award provides funds to continue an REU program which is designed to
provide highly motivated undergraduates, especially women, and minorities with
the opportunity to develop their skills as archaeological field scientists while
working within the context of the Naco Valley Archaeological Project, NW
Honduras. The project focuses on student conduct of a significant independent
research project, from the enunciation of a hypothesis to final write-up,
supported by in-field class instruction and a living and working situation in
which interaction among students and research leaders is easy and yet intense.
This course of study is founded on the Principal Investigator's considerable
experience in collaborating with and instructing undergraduates within field
settings in the past, and especially, on NSF-REU site projects which took place
during the 1988 and 1990 Naco Valley seasons. Ultimately, the goal for the
project is to help students grow from neophyte research assistants to junior
colleagues confident in their ability to make independent research decisions and
contribute to scientific knowledge. The 1988 and 1990 efforts, which form the
model of the current program, were successful in accomplishing these objectives.
