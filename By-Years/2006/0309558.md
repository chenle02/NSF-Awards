In this project, a newly-discovered, inexpensive gas/solid reduction process
will be examined for creating nanofibrillar structures with organized nanopore
channels on surfaces of dense, semiconducting titanium dioxide. The influence of
the starting titanium dioxide structure (e.g., amorphous, anatase, or rutile
forms), the crystallographic orientation (i.e., single crystals of rutile with
varied orientations), and solid-solution additives, on the orientation and
morphology of the resulting nanofibers will be carefully examined with the use
of scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The rate-limiting step(s) for
the steady-state, gas-phase reduction of nanofibrillar oxide will be evaluated
by examining the influence of time, temperature, gas flow rates, and gas
atmospheres on the extent of reduction (as determined by thermogravimetric
analyses and electron microscopy of cross-sections). Finally, electrical
properties of the nanofibrillar structures will be investigated and modeled
based on the so-called lumped parameter complex plane analysis (LP/CPA) of the
ac electrical data. Sensing and catalytic reactivity of the nanofibrrillar
structures will also be tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed approach is a
very inexpensive method for fabrication of nano-structured ceramic platform for
various applications, particularly for chemical sensing and catalysis. To enable
more widespread use of the method, a fundamental understanding of the mechanism
of fiber formation is needed so that critical process variables can be
identified. The proposed approach integrates cutting-edge resources in ceramic
processing, microscopy, modeling and testing of sensing and catalytic
properties. Other potential applications of such platforms include photonic
crystals and photo-optical devices. Moreover, the proposed process may also open
a new avenue for micro-/nano-machining of ceramics, which is a non-trivial task.
