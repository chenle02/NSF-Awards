The term currently most succcessful in drawing attention to global environmental
problems and fostering action to combat those problems is 'biodiversity.' The
central aim of this dissertation research project is to examine how and why
scientists have shaped the concept of 'biodiversity' and promoted it to a broad
audience. Through an extensive literature review and numerous interviews, the
investigator plans to analyze why scientists value biodiversity, how they have
promulgated this value in the public realm, and how they intend their results to
influence environmental conservation imperatives, societal values towards
nature, and nature itself. Analysis of scientific advocacy in the name of
'biodiversity' provides insight into the complex interactions between
scientists' values, society's values, conservation, and the natural world. This
modest grant will enable the collection of interview data in various parts of
the U.S. and Costa Rica.
