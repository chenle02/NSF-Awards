This project studies uniqueness and stability of solutions of well-known but
ill-posed inverse problems. It considers the inverse problem of potential theory
that is fundamental in geophysics, the inverse conductivity problem with
applications in electrical tomography and in crack detection and a non-
hyperbolic Cauchy problem for hyperbolic equations as well as related heat
conduction parameter identification, earthquakes prediction and acoustic and
seismic prospecting. The work will involve some classical (potential theory,
Carleman type and energy estimates, orthogonality relations) and more recent
methods ( the logarithmic convexity and the Calderon-Sylvester-Uhlmann's
method). The aim is to solve fundamental questions, provide applications and
derive new mathematical tools.
