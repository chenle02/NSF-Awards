Abstract

Award: DMS-0074126 Principal Investigator: Brian R. Greene

This research project brings together a team of mathematicians and physicists
based at three campuses to work together on string theory. Specific research
tasks include the study of the quantum corrections to the mypermultiplet moduli
spaces in theories with eight supercharges, the structure of the moduli spaces
of heterotic string compactifications, M-theory models compactified on seven-
dimensional spaces whose global holonomy group lies in the exceptional Lie group
G2, M-theory models on Calabi-Yau fourfolds, and a study of the AdS/CFT
correspondence for branes at singularities.

String theory is a promising candidate for a unifying theory of the universe at
its most fundamental levels. Although the basic idea is simple - elementary
particles should be modeled as mathematical loops of stgring rather than as
points - working out the details of this theory has involved and inspired some
sophisticated mathematical tools and ideas. The task is by no means complete,
even in an area where the synergy between mathematics and physics has been
particularly productive, the study of the Calabi-Yau spaces that appear as
solutions of the classical string equations of motion. This is one of three
linked awards to a research group that includes mathematicians and physicists at
Duke University, Columbia University, and Rutgers University, and NSF funds are
supporting this interdisciplinary group's collaborations through
videoconferencing and travel.
