The proposed research is a continuation of joint work already begun with Dr.
Daniel Bump and Dr. Jeffrey Hoffstein, which established nonvanishing results
for certain L-functions arising in the theory of automorphic forms. Partial
results along these lines have already allowed Dr. Friedberg and his
collaborators to conclude that when the L-function of an elliptic curve defined
over the rational numbers is nonzero at the value 1, both the group of
Q-rational points and the Tate-Shafarevich group of the elliptic curve are
finite. In algebraic geometry, a "curve" is what may be defined in the plane by
a single polynomial equation in two variables. When at least one of the
monomials in this polynomial has total degree three, and no monomials have
higher degree; and when the resulting curve does not cross itself, the curve is
called "elliptic". These curves, seemingly so simple, carry nonetheless an
astonishing amount of deep structure, and have been the basis of farreaching
conjectures of astonishing difficulty. Among these conjectures are those made in
the 1960's by Birch and Swinnerton- Dyer, connecting values of certain functions
to the structure of elliptic curves. Dr. Friedberg's work is an essential part
of the recent verification of the first cases of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
Conjectures.
