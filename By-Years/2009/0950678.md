The requested amount of the revised budget is equal to $95,725.00 and the
difference with the original budget will be covered by the cost share of
$10,206.00 that Michigan Tech will provide. The total budget includes two months
of summer salary for Dr. Ebnenasir and 18 months of graduate student support
spanned over 12 months. One graduate student who has been involved in the
preliminary investigations of this project during past 4 months will be
supported by this project for the entire 12 months. Another PhD student -- who
will participate in Task 3 -- will be supported for the final 6 months of the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
