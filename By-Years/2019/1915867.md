Funds are requested to support the participation of graduate students and post-
doctoral researchers in the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and the Gordon
Research Seminar (GRS) on Spin Dynamics in Nanostructures. The GRC and the GRS
will be held in Les Diablerets, Switzerland during July 7th-12th 2019 and July
6th-7th 2019, respectively. The GRS is primarily aimed at young researchers,
such as graduate students and postdocs. It is immediately followed by, and hence
merges into, the GRC, which features presentations by the leading scientists in
the field thereby bringing together junior and senior scientists in the research
community.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The GRS program will feature oral and poster
presentations accompanied by informal discussions with a small number of
attendees (around 50 participants). All the participants of the GRS generally
attend the GRC, where the attendance is desired to be limited to approximately
100 researchers. The GRC program will include invited oral presentations by
established leading researchers and poster presentations, focusing on
developments at the cutting edge in the field. The conference chairs aim to
actively encourage participation from a diverse group of researchers that
represent a broad range of backgrounds, institutions, geographical regions, and
research fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
