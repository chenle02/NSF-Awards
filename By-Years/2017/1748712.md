1748712 (Gonzalez). This workshop will convene U.S. experts from a diverse set
of disciplines to address specific science topics of the urban-climate system,
while facilitating a broader participation of students and post-doctoral
fellows. The workshop will be held in August 2018 in New York City. Specific
outcomes of the workshop are targeted to be (a) improved understanding of the
role of megacities in the global climate system, (b) strategies for scalable
climate-resilient urban environments, and (c) an outline of effective
technological and socioeconomic interventions to reduce atmospheric greenhouse
emissions from cities (via low carbon transportation, low carbon buildings, data
science). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes will be a documented research and
educational agenda, as well as road maps identifying: (a) scientific gaps,
collaborative research projects, and data sources to needed to implement the
agenda; (b) resources needed; (c) stakeholder involvement; and (d) scientific
and societal benefits. These discussions, expected road maps, and long term
actions will be designed to have significant benefits to the scientific
community, the urban planning community, and emergency responders in cities
across the U.S.
