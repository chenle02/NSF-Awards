The project will focus on research in the six areas of Robust Bayesian
Analysis, Default Prior Bayesian Methodology, Conditional Inference in Decision
Theory, Multivariate Estimation, Hierarchical Modelling, and Bayesian
Computation. In the first two areas, special emphasis will be paid to problems
involving testing and model selection. Bayesian approaches to these problems are
severely underutilized, primarily because robust or default prior analyses in
these areas have not been developed. In Conditional Inference, the primary focus
will be the study of situations in which Bayesian answers have a valid
conditional frequentist interpretation. Identification of such situations is not
only valuable foundationally, but also indicates situations in which adopting a
conditional frequentist approach can be highly advantageous. In Bayesian
Computation, emphasis will be on use of Markov Chain and other simulation
techniques for carrying out Bayesian integrations. Bayesian analysis is perhaps
the most rapidly growing approach to statistical analysis, because of its
ability to model and analyze even extremely complex situations, and because it
readily allows combination of multiple information sources. The chief
limitations of Bayesian analysis have been concern about sensitivity to
modelling assumptions, and the difficulty in carrying out Bayesian computations
in high dimensional problems. In this project we will attack the sensitivity
problem by developing Bayesian models that are inherently "robust," and by
creating powerful methods for selecting from among competing Bayesian models. On
the computational side, we will extend new techniques based on simulation that
have the promise of handling situations with hundreds or thousands of unknown
model parameters.
