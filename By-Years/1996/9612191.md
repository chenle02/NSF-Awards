9612191 Erim The objective of this study is to investigate the usefulness of two
state-of-the-art methods in the analysis of electrical signals recorded from
human muscles. These techniques are wavelet and time-frequency transforms, which
have yielded favorable results in data compression, nonstationary signal
analysis and noise removal; and fuzzy logic which has been successfully employed
in decision- making and control fields. These methods will be applied to two
main problems encountered in the analysis of signals recorded from muscles: a)
the identification of the activities of individual muscle units represented in
signals recorded via needle electrodes, and b) the analysis of the time-varying
nature of signals recorded during dynamic contractions via surface electrodes
attached to the skin over the muscle. The availability of powerful analysis
tools will enhance the research in these fields geared toward gaining a better
understanding of the control of muscles by the central nervous system, as well
as the development of reliable diagnostic procedures to be used in the clinical
environment. The initial year will be devoted to the implementation of the
techniques proposed to be employed in the study, and to the application of these
to specific signals recorded from muscles. It is hoped that this year will serve
to provide the principal investigator with expertise in these new fields and
help to establish her as an independent researcher. It is further hoped that the
work carried out during this year will produce the preliminary results necessary
to demonstrate the applicability of the mentioned techniques to the
investigation of muscle signals, and that it will lead to the proposal of at
least one full-blown study structured according to the findings and conclusions
of the present study. ***
