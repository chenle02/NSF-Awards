Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-9907363&lt;br/&gt;David Y.H. Pui, U. of
Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;Partial travel support will be provided for contributors at
the European Science Foundation (ESF)-NSF Symposium on "Nanoparticles:
Applications in Materials Science and Environmental Science and Engineering", to
be held in Dublin, Ireland on September 6, 2000. The meeting will bring together
U.S and European scientists in the fields of aerosols, materials, environment
and health. The objectives are the presentation of the most recent findings in
nanoparticle and related nanotechnology, evaluation of the research trends and
opportunities, and enhancement of the long-term U.S.-European collaboration
especially among young scientists and engineers in both regions. The ESF
sponsored network on nanoparticle research will be the co-organizer. The
symposium will consists of plenary review lectures given by senior researchers
and poster sessions by young researchers. Twelve young researchers will be
selected from the U.S. nanoparticle community for invited poster presentations,
and they will receive partial travel support. A publication with the extended
abstract proceedings will be prepared after the &lt;br/&gt;
