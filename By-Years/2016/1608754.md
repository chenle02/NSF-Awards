The Digital Imaging and Vision Applications in Science (DIVAS) project will have
strong significance and importance toward advancing the prosperity and welfare
of the country by creating a pedagogical and programmatic 'onramp' of
computational materials that empower natural science majors to engage in
authentic computational problems. DIVAS will ultimately increase the number of
skilled computationally trained scientists entering the workforce, addressing
the critical shortage of these workers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;DIVAS' goal is to
develop, use, and test instructional practices and curricular innovations that
will engage and train STEM undergraduates in computation and computing related
to image processing. The scope will be to assess practices and innovations in
the traditional classroom environment, in informal training 'boot camps', and in
undergraduate research settings for their impact on student self-efficacy,
computational competency, and intended and actual career paths. The project team
will use an established instrument for assessing self-efficacy in computation
and will develop a new tool to assess computational competency across a wide
range of educational settings. Growth in self-efficacy, computational skills,
and career choice will be assessed each time a student engages in a DIVAS
innovation. This collaborative project will establish and strengthen
partnerships with key academic institutions and organizations and will
prioritize practices and innovations for adoption within a broader DIVAS
network. DIVAS will test the effectiveness of educational interventions
occurring in the traditional learning environment, in informal training
environments, and in professional settings.
