With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation (CRIF:MU) Program, the Department of
Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) will
acquire an X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector and low-temperature system.
This instrument will support a large variety of research projects, including:
supramolecular approaches to novel materials and processes; metal-catalyzed
polymerization; metal-mediated organic transformations; and new catalysts for
the cation-olefin cyclization, enantioselective domino reactions, and natural
product synthesis. The instrument will be used by a large number of users in the
Chemistry Department as well as other programs such as Environmental Sciences
and the School of Pharmacy. Similarly, the instrument will impact the research
training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from many disciplines at
UNC-CH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and
precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about
the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to neighboring molecules. These
studies will have an impact in a number of areas, especially synthesis of
important organic and inorganic chemicals and polymeric materials.&lt;br/&gt;
