Diatoms are microscopic, single celled plants that are responsible for much of
the biological productivity in the ocean. Their absolute requirement for silica
makes them unique among the phytoplankton and the interaction of light and
silica in regulating the cell division (or growth) of these plants will be
addressed in this research. Dr. Olson will collaborate with Dr. Chisholm from
M.I.T. and a post doctoral researcher to examine several questions regarding the
exact nature and number of block points in the diatom cell division cycle that
are controlled by light and silica availability. The specific strategies for
dealing with these limitations will be studied using cell cytometry in a highly
integrated cell biological approach to marine biology.
