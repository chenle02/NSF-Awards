Experimental and theoretical studies of poly-Si thin films are conducted. The
primary thrust is directed towards: (1) enhancing fundamental understanding of
high field I-V behavior, including switching; (2) extensive characterization of
temperature coefficient of resistance in low and high doping limits; (3)
achieving comprehensive understanding of TFT operation in poly-Si, including the
inversion mode operation; and (4) modeling the effect of poly-Si emitter
contacts used in bipolar applications.
