In modern transmission and recording channels, it is often required to map the
data onto a sequence with special properties. These properties are dictated by
various practical aspects such as self-clocking, limitations on the intersymbol
interference, and bandwidth constraints. Since most channels are noisy, the
transmitted data should have error correction capability as well. The classical
coding schemes for noisy modulation channels are based on using two
independently designed codes: one for error correction and the other for
modulation. Although these two codes may be optimal with regard to their
respective goals, the combined code may be far from optimal when used over the
channel. The research studies the relation between modulation and error
correction properties which will enable viewing these two properties inseparably
from each other. Efficient codes designed specifically for noisy modulation
channels then will be developed.
