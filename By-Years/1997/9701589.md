ABSTRACT Malikov 97-01589 The three topics of the proposal are: Harish-Chandra
bimodules over affine Lie algebras, localization of admissible representations
to the moduli of vector bundles and a Lie algebra of the group of homeomorphisms
of the circle. The main tools to be employed are the Bernstein-Beilinson
technique of localization of g-modules and related ideas originating in modern
physics, for example Kazhdan-Lusztig tensoring and vertex operator algebras The
last decade has seen a spectacular interplay of ideas coming from quantum
physics and mathematics. This proposal is about the fusion of these ideas. The
results might find application in conformal field theory, representation theory,
geometry and low dimensional topology.
