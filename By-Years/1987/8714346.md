The research program involves an experimental and analytical investigation of
the quasi-static and impact energy dissipation characteristics of structural
systems containing metallic tubes as energy dissipating elements. The specific
objectives of the research include the following five tasks. In Task 1, the
energy dissipation characteristics of clusters of unstiffened and stiffened
tubular assemblies will be optimized with respect to their intertubular boundary
conditions, their radius to wall thickness ratios, and their strain-hardening
and strain-rate properties. Task 2 is concerned with establishing the importance
of the initial elastic response of tubes subjected to impact loading resulting
in an elastic-viscoplastic response. In Task 3, non- uniform tubular collapse
modes will be studied. Task 4 will investigate the behavior of composite (foam-
filled) metallic tubes under large deformation conditions. Finally, Task 5 will
generalize the one-dimensional structural shock-wave theory developed in
previous NSF funded research to two dimensions and employ it to model the impact
experiments of Task 1. This research will fill a void in this area of impact
mechanics and provide results directly applicable to the development of more
efficient and effective metallic energy dissipating systems. Such systems have a
life saving potential when employed in safety applications where kinetic energy
must be dissipated in a controlled manner such that decelerations remain within
allowable limits.
