Doughty&lt;br/&gt;Upon the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia, several
Precambrian lithotectonic assemblages were truncated along the western margin of
Laurentia, but present data are too sparse to unambiguously identify the
matching continental blocks, and the Siberian platform, Antarctica and Australia
are possible matches. This project is aimed at strengthening the geochronologic,
petrographic and structural data for selected sites in northwest US in order to
narrow the possible matches. Results, combined with existing and new similar
data from other continental blocks are expected to clarify the nature of Rodinia
and the subsequent evolution of the fragments of Rodinia after continental
breakup.&lt;br/&gt;
