The goal of this research project is to continue molecular, genetic and
biochemical analyses of the char-1 gene complex from the soil nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans. Char-1 is the structural gene for choline
acetyltransferase, the enzyme which synthesizes the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine. Previously obtained evidence suggests that the choline
acetyltransferase protein in C. elegans may consists of multiple structural and
functional domains, and there is interest in determining the organization of the
gene and the structure of the protein. In addition, investigations on the
spatial and temporal control of choline acetyltransferase will be performed
during neural development. C. elegans is being used for these studies because of
its simple nervous system, its ease of genetic analysis, and the availability of
the technique of "transposon tagging" to clone genes from this organism. This
recent approach has been utilized to "tag" and clone part of the cha-1 complex.
Antibodies directed against specific regions of the choline acetyltransferase
molecule will be isolated. The isolated regions will be used in biochemical
studies of choline acetyltransferase structure and in anatomical studies to
analyze the development of acetylcholine-utilizing neurons. The information
obtained about the normal gene and enzyme will be used to analyze mutants
defective in neural structure and neurotransmitter function.
