This award supports a detailed geological investigation of the Sirius Formation,
Antarctica, in order to determine: 1) its relation to alpine glaciers and ice
sheets; 2) its age and stratigraphy; and 3) the source of the enclosed marine
microfossils. The results of this research will provide a critical test for the
leading hypotheses of the origin of the Sirius Formation and, thereby,
contribute significantly to resolving Antarctic Ice Sheet response to Tertiary
climate warmth. Given the important role that the Antarctic Ice Sheet plays in
global climate, this new knowledge will significantly aid resolution of global-
scale paleoclimate problems, principally by constraining interpretation of the
deep sea oxygen-isotope record. This data will also permit the testing and
tuning of ice sheet models.
