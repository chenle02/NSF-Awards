The objective of this work is to prepare very large molecular and ionic capsules
and investigate their molecular recognition properties. A number of calixarenes
and alkyl substituted resorcinarenes and pyrogallolarenes will be or have been
prepared and the self assembly of these materials into pentamers and hexamers
will be studied. The spherical assemblies thus formed will be characterized by a
number of methods. These spherical assemblies will then be systematically
presented with potential guest molecules and mixtures of potential guests to
gain information about their molecular recognition properties. Lastly, hexameric
assemblies with very long alkyl "tails" will be tested for their ability to form
even larger assemblies via hexamer-hexamer interactions through these
tails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Jerry L. Atwood of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri-Columbia. Dr. Atwood will
explore the synthesis of spherical molecular and ionic capsules. Tetramers of
phenols related to naturally occuring compounds can self assemble into a variety
of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedral shapes. The resulting spherical
assemblies have defined internal volumes, hence the term molecular capsules,
capable of recognizing and distinguishing other molecular guests. Such
assemblies may have practical applications for drug delivery or the removal of
contaminants from mixtures. Students trained as a result of working on this
project will gain experience in inorganic materials research as well as
supramolecular organic chemistry, hence they will have skills needed by both the
specialty chemicals and pharmaceutical
industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
