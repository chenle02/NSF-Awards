9318829 Wilson An experiment involving capture of low-energy polarized neutrons
in hydrogen will be carried out, and the circular polarization of the resulting
gamma ray measured. This will provide information on details of the nucleon-
nucleon interaction, specifically relativistic effects in the meson exchange
current mechanism which dominate the nuclear capture process. This is a
collaboration between US and Russian scientists and will be carried out at a
research reactor in Russia ***
