In talking about the past or about a movie, we often describe things in terms of
discrete events, breaking continuous activity into meaningful parts. A child
asked about a day at school might first describe reading, then recess, and maybe
lunch. If asked further about recess, the child might divide it into smaller
parts like soccer or tag or talking to friends. Psychological studies show that
events and their sub-events play discernable roles in how we understand stories,
for example, or remember them later. However, little is known about how this way
of structuring of experience guides ongoing perception and comprehension. In
research supported by the National Science Foundation, Dr. Jeffrey M. Zacks
studies how events and sub-events drive ongoing perceptions and later memories.
His work incorporates perceptual judgments, tests of memory, reading, and he
constructs computer models to make his hypotheses explicit. Dr. Zacks's research
uses novel methods for the real-time study of perception of dynamic events. The
broader impacts of this work include training graduate and undergraduate
students in these methods and the tools used to implement them. These results
also contribute to the ongoing development of tools for procedural learning and
for navigating video.
