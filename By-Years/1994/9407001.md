9407001 Cooke The aims are to organize and conduct a conference in October, 1994
bringing together researchers of varied background on the subject of motor
proteins, and to produce a reference work on the subject. From their beginnings
over 10 years ago, the intent of the Biophysical Discussions has been to discuss
areas that have been heavily influenced by biophysical approaches. As was
successfully done with past meetings in this series, papers will be submitted
prior to the conference. Fifteen to twenty full Discussion papers will be
solicited by invitation. Some 40 more two-page papers will be invited for
presentation in plenary poster sessions. Formal discussions, poster sessions,
and evening workshops will all build on the understanding that people have come
to the meeting informed of the contents of the Study Book. Following the meeting
these papers will be published with a transcript of the recorded debate. ***
