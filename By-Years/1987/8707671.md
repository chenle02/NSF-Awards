The objective of this project is to study problems with partial information
arising in situations involving computer communications from the point of view
of systems and control theory. The main case of interest is that of distributed
database systems. This research focuses on a study of concurrency control and
recovery protection against aborts and crashes as control problems for discrete
event systems. These problems are characterized by the issue of partial
information, with communication playing a central role. The goal of the project
is to investigate the appropriateness of state models for posing questions of
control and communication and for formulating and analyzing proposed solutions.
In particular, a study will be made of the applicability of the theory of
Ramadge and Wonham for supervisory control of discrete event systems to these
problems. This work should contribute to a better understanding of control and
system-theoretic issues in discrete event systems.
