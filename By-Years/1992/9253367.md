Science-By-Mail is a mentorship program between scientists and youth whereby
youth have a subscription for three scientific challenge packets each year,
create solutions, and receive responses from a personal scientist. Science-By-
Mail brings the excitement of science discovery into classrooms and homes of
children around the country and provides them with positive, approachable role
models of professional scientists. A grant of $622,088 over three years will
allow us to strengthen and expand this program nationally, focusing especially
on increasing participation by minority youth and scientists. Specifically,
support is requested for the design and development of 12 new challenge packets;
to increase participation to 47,900 youth, 4,500 scientists, and 26 regional
chapters; promote increased corporate and other private-sector involvement in
the program; and to conduct an annual evaluation. The AAAS will aid in the
recruitment of volunteer scientists. In addition, we will work together with the
National 4-H Council to pilot the program within that organization (with a
membership of 5.4 million), focusing particularly on minority youth. Anticipated
income form the expansion of Science-By-Mail will make the program self-
sufficient at the end of the grant period.//
