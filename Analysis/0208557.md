This project is about the longest increasing subsequence problems in
combinatorics, which can also be interpreted as last passage percolation
problems in probability/statistical mechanics. We consider a maximal passage
time in a 2-dimensional lattice with a random time assigned at each lattice
site. The basic interest is the probabilistic properties of the maximal passage
time as the size of lattice becomes large. Other equivalent forms of questions
include a card game, random growth models in 2-dimension, interacting particle
systems, queuing theory, directed polymers and so-called ``vicious'' random
walks. Recent progresses show that there are interesting connections of this
field to the random matrix theory. Random matrix theory has been an active field
of research in both mathematics and physics for last 50 years. We would like to
understand more on this connection and also investigate further relations
between these seemingly different fields. This project is a further work in this
direction.

From a greater framework, the subject of this project can be regarded as a work
on the basic properties of a maximization process in a random environment when
the size of system becomes large. Such process could be growth of crystal, shape
of fire front of paper burning, or fastest passage in a computer or cellular
network. These problems are also subjects in statistics, statistical physics,
and engineering. One of the main goal of this project is an investigation of
various universal properties, which are independent of the microstructure of the
models, of a class of systems when the size of model becomes large.
