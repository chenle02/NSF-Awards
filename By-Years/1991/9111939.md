The broad objective of this research is to provide a better understanding of the
combustion process in self-sustaining reactions through investigations of the
temperature profiles in the combustion zone. The nature of the combustion
process dictates the width of the combustion zone, rate of heat generation, and
the combustion temperature of the process. The CO2 laser to be purchased with
this equipment grant will allow the ignition process to be more carefully
controlled. The underlying motivation for most of the research in this field is
the potential use of combustion to synthesize new or superior materials. The
process must be well understood and its parameters clearly delineated in order
for its application to be compatible with the new trends to produce on a large
scale specially tailored materials.
