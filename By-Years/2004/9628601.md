KARNIADAKIS DMS-9628601 The present proposal is a request by the Division of
Applied Mathematics of Brown University to NSF for the acquisition of equipment
in order to improve the network infrastructure and modernize the general-use
workstation laboratory at the Center for Fluid Mechanics Turbulence and
Computation. This upgrade of our current facilities is necessary for the optimum
use of local computing resources as well as those available at the national NSF-
sponsored centers. The acquisitions will particularly enhance the use of the
parallel computer (IBM SP2/24-nodes) installed last year at the Center. The
Center provides computational support for the research in several mathematical
sciences projects. These include: parallel algorithms on spectral and spectral
element methods, high-resolution simulations of supersonic combustion, modeling
and simulations of dispersed two-phase flows, low-dimensional dynamical systems
modeling, and mathematicals models for vision and image processing. The Center s
facilities will also be used to support activities of the new Program in
Scientific Computing at Brown University as well as by faculty from Clark
Atlanta University to support a collaboration on computational mathematics
sponsored by the Leadership Alliance Program.
