Significant new experiments are planned to further elucidate the nature of the
hexatic phase that the investigator identifies in the melting of the two-
dimensional electron layer. Theories of the electron-ripplon interaction will be
tested, the polaron state will be looked for in this system, and Bragg
scattering of laser light from the electron dimples will be studied. Although in
the crystal phase the electron velocity is large enough that the dimples don't
form, the possibility exists that the dimples can form in the hexatic phase
where the density of dislocations is small. Further study of the correlations in
the classical electron fluid will be made. A search will be made for two-
dimensional superconductivity in this layer since a small wake in the helium
surface as an electron moves in an electric field provides an attractive
potential for electron-electron pairing via this electron-ripplon coupling mode.
