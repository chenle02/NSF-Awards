This award supports cooperative research in high temperature superconductivity
between Milton Torikachvili of San Diego State University and Sergio Moehlecke,
Oscar F. de Lima and Sergio Gama at Unicamp in Campinas, Brazil. In addition,
Brian Maple of the University of California at San Diego will make available his
extensive laboratory facilities for a three-way collaboration. They will make
high quality thin film, single crystal and sintered specimens of known high
temperature superconductors, search for new superconducting compounds and study
the properties of the superconducting state. Torikachvili has worked with some
very good Brazilian and U.S. scientists in superconductivity. This work will
continue the collaboration with the Unicamp group and should be the beginning of
a fruitful cooperation in a vital and timely area in which Brazil has made
important advances. The facilities in Brazil are adequate for this work and the
addition of Maple's laboratory makes the sum total of facilities outstanding.
