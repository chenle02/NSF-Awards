Research will be directed towards developing more accurate methods for the
calculation of molecular vibrational excitation cross sections for electron
scattering at low energies. A new method of calculation, the first-order, non-
degenerate adiabatic method, which was previously used to provide improved cross
sections for vibrational excitation of hydrogen will be extended to permit
calculations on more complex molecules. Calculations will be compared with
experimental results.
