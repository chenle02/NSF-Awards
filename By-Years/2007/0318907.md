&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the proposed NSF Summer Institute on
Nano Mechanics and Materials are: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) to offer training on
the fundamentals of nano mechanics and materials for graduate students,
practicing scientists, engineers, and professors;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) to
provide networking opportunities for researchers and leaders in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lead instructors are known
for their research and teaching excellence. Together with networking
opportunities, the proposed Institute will provide a training opportunity for
participants in an important area of technology that is not available at this
time. These courses will help those in the basic sciences to understand how
nanosciences may impact marketplace products. Hence, the proposed Institute will
significantly impact education, research and technology. The broader impact will
be the multiplying effect of this training. Participants may launch their own
initiatives in nanotechnology, such as curriculum development or enhancement,
initiation of new research ideas, and products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
