This grant will support nuclear physics research by a faculty member and
several undergraduate students at the State University of New York at Geneseo
for three years. Experiments to determine the precise nature of nuclear reaction
mechanisms involving heavy ion projectiles will be carried out at a large
university nuclear physics laboratory, the University of Rochester, during the
summer months. The data analysis will be carried out during the academic year at
Geneseo. Earlier data from experiments at Florida State University will also be
interpreted within the scope of this grant. The grant is part of the NSF
Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program.
