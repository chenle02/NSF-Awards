The objective of this project is to develop an approach to better design of
systems for decontamination of groundwater than is now generally in use for
remediation of aquifers contaminated by seepage from hazardous wastes sites. The
procedure being developed in this project is directed toward optimizing the
number and location of wells and for determination of the pumping rates to be
used during the remediation process. It will also include an algorithm for
including installation and construction costs in the economic description of the
proposed system. The proposal leading to this award was submitted in accord with
the NSF Program Announcement: Research Initiation Awards, NSF 88-99. Results are
expected to provide an approach that can be used to improve the engineering
design of systems for decontamination of groundwater aquifers. It is expected to
have an advantage over procedures now being used for determination of the
number, location and pumping rates of remediation wells. Results of this
research may also be applied to engineering design of systems to protect
aquifers from potential contamination by seepage from hazardous waste disposal
sites.
