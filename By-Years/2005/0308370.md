This project addresses current limitations in automatic information extraction
technology. Specific objectives are to: 1. use bootstrapping techniques to
greatly increase the number of types of entities and relations that can be
extracted and the rate at which one is able to create new extractors, 2. improve
the performance of supervised training for entity and relation extractors by
using bootstrapping to add additional training features and by applying new
supervised learning techniques, including new perceptron and discriminative
training techniques, 3. address meta-data issues of provenance, confidence, and
temporal extent of facts, focussing particularly on the construction of a model
of the expected lifetime of facts based on a longitudinal corpus of Web data.

The outcome of the project will be scientific understanding and technology for
automatic information extraction from free text, making it possible to convert
large document collections into formal databases suitable for automated
processing. This will represent a significant enhancement in the utility and
societal benefit of digital libraries and the World Wide Web. Project results
will be disseminated in the form of publications and publicly available code for
information extraction and learning of extractors.
