9704246 Xiao This award provides support for the acquisition of a state-of-the-
art vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) to be shared by a number of
complementary and interdisciplinary research programs in the area of novel
magnetic materials in the Departments of Physics and Astronomy and Chemistry and
Biochemistry at the University of Delaware. The instrument will provide
sensitivity at the level of 10-6 emu for DC measurements in fields to 90 kOe and
temperatures between 4 K and 1000 K, and sensitivity at the level of about 10- 7
emu for AC measurements in fields to 100 Oe. Current research programs that will
immediately benefit from access to such a facility include: l) studies of spin
polarized transport in trilayer tunneling junctions, 2) studies of
magnetostriction in nanostructured materials, 3) studies of permanent magnets
and small magnetic particles, and 4) studies of the magnetic properties of novel
ferromagnetic aerogels and magnetic aerogel- based nanocomposites. %%% These
programs address issues of importance from the standpoint of fundamental
materials physics and chemistry, as well as potential device applications. In
all these studies, a high sensitivity, variable frequency VSM magnetometer with
high and low field measurement capabilities at high and low temperatures is
imperative. The VSM proposed here represents the most cost effective way to
accomplish the widest possible range of research objectives. The University of
Delaware will provide a 50% cost sharing. The moderate investment by NSF will
have a major impact on our research and benefit a large number of students. ***
