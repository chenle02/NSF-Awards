9302906 Chapin We propose a workshop (1) to synthesize current information and
hypotheses about the patterns and causes of diversity in arctic and alpine
tundra, (2) to develop predictions about the impact of global change on future
biodiversity of tundra, (3) to develop a framework for understanding the
ecosystem consequences of tundra biodiversity, and (4) to discuss experimental
approaches for testing these hypotheses and approaches. *** Such a workshop is
important to address the functional consequences of biodiversity in a rapidly
changing world. It is particularly appropriate to address these questions in
tundra, where low biodiversity may make the system vulnerable to any changes in
biodiversity which occur, where the communities are simple and small enough to
manipulate diversity and observe the ecosystem consequences, and where
manipulations simulating climate change have caused a substantial decline in
species richness in less than a decade. %%%
