Direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) powered vehicles are foreseen as the choice of
the future. However, the development of DMFC has been hampered by several
technical challenges such as anode poisoning and permeation of methanol through
the polymer electrolyte membrane into the cathode compartment. Approximately
100-150 mV loss in cell voltage can be attributed to the presence of methanol in
the cathode compartment; part of the loss is attributable to the mixed potential
phenomenon, and part to the inactivation of the cathode catalyst. Therefore, it
is desirable to develop a membrane electrolyte that will prevent or minimize the
permeation of methanol. This proposal addresses certain approaches toward
minimizing methanol permeation through membrane modifications. A compounded or
laminated membrane that will exhibit reduced methanol permeability, while
maintaining facile proton transport will be developed using a combination of
certain inert polymeric materials and perfluorosulfonic acid polymers. Membranes
found to have adequate ionic conductivity and reduced methanol permeability will
be tested in a PEM fuel cell with methanol as the fuel.
