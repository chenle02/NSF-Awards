Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Pellmyr/Seagraves&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
expand dissertation research on the circumstances leading to cheating in
mutualistic interactions by testing explicit hypotheses on geographically
structured coevolution and history. The obligate pollination mutualism between
yuccas and yucca moths is one of the classical examples of coevolution, and an
excellent model system to explore mutualism reversal as it includes derived non-
pollinating 'cheater' moths. Using this interaction, three specific predictions
will be tested on how local adaptation drives variation in plant-moth
interactions and coevolution. The project will specifically focus on
phylogeography and floral morphology of the host plant Yucca filamentosa.
Phylogeographic analysis based on AFLP data will be performed across the plant
range, and the results used to test hypotheses that involve comparisons with
existing data sets on floral trait variation and moth phylogeographic patterns.
This study will provide one of the first data sets to extract both the
historical and adaptive components of a mutualism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
