This proposal seeks to acquire instrumentation needed to facilitate genomics
research on the Purdue University campus. Purdue University has undertaken
several important initiatives over the past 7 years that have provided
substantial strength to genetics research. These include the construction and
renovation of significant laboratory space, establishment of an
interdisciplinary graduate training program in genetics, and the hiring of
several genetics faculty with expertise spanning a broad and exciting range of
topics. This growing momentum has now appropriately positioned Purdue University
for the establishment of the Purdue Genomics Laboratory (PGL). Such a
laboratory, once equipped for high throughput genomics data generation and
analysis, will serve three important objectives: To support genomics research
efforts of 8 primary users, to serve as a student training facility in support
of a NSF-sponsored graduate training effort in plant genetics, and to facilitate
collaborative linkages for the application of DNA-based methodologies to plant
improvement. The instrumentation needed to meet these objectives includes an
electronic autoradiography system, an automated DNA sequencing system with
molecular biology labstation, a gel documentation system, CHEF mapping systems,
thermocyclers, -80C freezer equipment, and plant growth chamber facilities. This
equipment, once in place, would allow the initiation of several large-scale
genomics research projects in important plant and fimgal genomes that, to date,
have not been well-characterized. At present, the lack of these facilities on
the Purdue campus are all that stand in the way of these valuable research
endeavors.
