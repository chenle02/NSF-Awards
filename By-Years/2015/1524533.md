Terrestrial Gamma-Ray Flashes (TGFs) are very intense, but short-lived, bursts
of radiation related to lightning and thunderstorms. Atmospheric electricity
researchers have known about TGFs for decades, but are now better able to study
the causes and impacts of these events due to new and improved instrumentation.
One example is the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) which was launched on a
satellite and now gives researchers an unprecedented view of TGF events.
However, relating what is seen in space to what is happening within a
thunderstorm is not straightforward. In this research project, the investigator
plans to analyze the satellite data with a goal of determining the
characteristics of TGFs and their source regions within thunderstorms. Improved
knowledge of TGFs has implications for lightning safety, especially related to
radiation exposure for air travelers. This project will also represent the first
award for an early-career scientist.

The researcher plans to analyze the data by first constructing a set of modeled
TGF events and then comparing how those should "look" to the satellite sensor
versus how they are actually "viewed". The overall purpose of the research
program is to use all information about TGFs from ground based radar
observations, lightning data, LF radio data, GBM TGF gamma-ray data, and
theoretical models to constrain the properties of the observed TGF population
for fitting the entire GBM sample. Three main questions are posed: 1) Can one
start from an assumed population of TGFs and reproduce the sample of GBM-
detected TGFs, including number and properties versus offset from the nadir? 2)
What constraints can be placed on the population characteristics? 3) What
constraints can be placed on TGF beaming?
