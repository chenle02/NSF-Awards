This group of outstanding researcher propose to continue their studies in to
probabilistic potential theory. A new definition of capacity and co-capacity
based on Kuznetsov measures is used. Since this does not use the assumption of
duality, a general framework for potential theory is expected to emerge.
Specific problems to be worked on include transformations of Kuznetsov processes
that preserve the Markov property, relationships of homogeneous random measures
and entrance laws, existence of right processes with given hitting distributions
and general theory of h-transforms of bi-Brownian motions.
