This award provides one-half of the support for the operation of the Pinon Flat
Observatory (PFO) in southern California. The other half of the PFO operational
support is to be provided by the U.S. Geological Survey. PFO is a research base
and observatory run by the University of California at San Diego for the purpose
of developing and testing seismic and crustal deformation instrumentation and
for using these sensors to monitor tectonic activity associated with the major
fault systems in southern California.
