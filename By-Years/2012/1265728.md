The PI will address important problems in combinatorics and representation
theory using new tools in symmetric function theory. The proposed program will
develop the theory of dual equivalence graphs, a powerful, combinatorial tool
for establishing the Schur positivity of quasisymmetric functions, and provide
new applications to important classes of functions. The program will deepen the
connection between dual equivalence graphs and crystal graphs while generalizing
dual equivalence graphs to other classical&lt;br/&gt;types, thereby expanding
the applicability of the dual equivalence graph machinery to representation
theory of classical groups. The program will also introduce a new family of
symmetric functions that will provide a combinatorial understanding of the
stable Kronecker coefficients, which, in turn, should lead to a better
understanding of the Kronecker coefficients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symmetric
function theory plays an important role in many areas of mathematics including
algebraic combinatorics, representation theory, Lie groups and Lie algebras,
algebraic geometry and the theory of special functions. Results in this area
have applications to many other areas of mathematics as well as to physics and
computer science. In addition to solving important, long-standing problems in
symmetric functions, the proposed program will develop versatile new tools with
which to tackle fundamental open problems and deepen our understanding.
