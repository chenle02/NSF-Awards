Wyatt The primary goal of this research is to design and test analog VLSI
systems for applications of real-time machine vision. In real-time machine
vision the sheer volume of image data to be acquired, managed and processed
leads to communications bottlenecks between imagers, memory and processors, and
to very high computational demands. The goal is to determine how the advantages
of analog VLSI--high speed, low power and small area-- can be exploited and its
disadvantages--limited accuracy, inflexibility and lack of storage capacity--can
be minimized. The work is concentrated on early vision tasks, i.e., tasks that
occur early in the signal flow path of animal or machine. Proposed designs
include chips for camera velocity estimation, depth from stereo, image
segmentation and smoothing, surface reconstruction, wide-range brightness
adaptive imaging, and automatic fiducial mark alignment for wafer fabrication.
MIT's earlier designs have shown that the typical subsystem is physically very
small and will perform one or more computationally intensive image-processing
tasks at hundreds-to- thousands of frames per second using only tens-to-hundreds
of milliwatts.
