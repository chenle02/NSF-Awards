9529671 CONTE This research will use specific molecular marker compounds
(biomarkers) derived from terrestrial plants (e.g.&gt;C22 n-alkanes,n- alkanols,
and n-alkanoic acids, terpenes and their derivatives) to "fingerprint" biogenic
carbon from different continental source regions and to assess the magnitude and
variation in aeolian inputs and deep ocean fluxes or terrestrially-derived
biomarkers in the atmosphere, rainfall and surface waters near Bermuda and the
"molecular signature" of the main continental source regions (2) to investigate
the meteorological and climatic controls on the magnitude and variability of
aeolian fluxes from these source regions, (3) to determine the time-varying
pattern of deep ocean fluxes of terrestrial biomarkers and to investigate the
upper ocean processes that link aeolian deposition and deep ocean sedimentation,
and (4) to determine the interannual variations in deep ocean sedimentation
patterns for recent years of climatic extremes (e.g. ENSO, subSaharan drought
events), to quantitatively assess how terrestrial biomarker sedimentation
patterns vary with changes in the North Atlantic climate system.
