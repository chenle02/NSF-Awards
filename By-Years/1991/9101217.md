Professor George D. Sturgeon and other members of the Chemistry Department at
the University of Nebraska are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93, eight
undergraduate students will spend twelve weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects range from mass spectrometry and solid
state NMR of zeolites to investigation of organic molecular recognition and
immobilized enzymes. Students will participate in weekly seminars to discuss
their results, visit local industries, and attend local cultural and sporting
events as a group.
