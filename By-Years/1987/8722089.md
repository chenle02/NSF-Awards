The Graduate School of Oceanography at the Univ. of Rhode Island will acquire
several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared
use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with
the R/V ENDEAVOR, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the
university. A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1988 is
in support of NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumenta- tion will also
increase the capabilities of the ship and of the University to support research
and engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -Shipboard Remote
Sensing Computer and image display equipment to provide scientists on board with
near real-time data collected from satellites, -shallow-water CTD for making
precision measurements of seawater Temperature and Conductivity as a function of
Depth, -a CTD deck control unit, -a fluorometer for measuring chlorophyll and
other pigments in the water column, -water sampling bottles, and -a
decompression computer for enhancing safety of at-sea SCUBA diving operations.
The instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the
organization to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
