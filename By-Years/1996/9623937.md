9623937 Amenta Many contemporary social movements, such as the pro-choice, civil
rights, and New Left movements have engaged increasingly over the past twenty
years in litigious tactics. These movements have also employed a moderate
reformist rhetoric that has been paralleled by organizational shifts from
radical grassroots groups to professional organizations. The impact of the
social movements on public policies has varied greatly across the fifty American
states. This study examines the American lesbian and gay movement in an attempt
to explain generally changes in forms of collective action within social
movements and the resulting policy outcomes. The first stage of the research
examines two morality policies (the decriminalization of consensual sodomy
between adults in private and the passage of lesbian and gay right ordinances)
historically and quantitatively over time and across the fifty American states.
Drawing on the welfare state and social movement literature, this research
explores the impact of social movement activism, democratic politics and public
opinion on these two policies. The second stage of the research, which includes
examination of movement documents and interviews with activists and state
actors, compares forms of collective action across three states (Vermont,
Louisiana and New York) that vary on policy outcomes, Religious Right strength,
and access to the polity. ***
