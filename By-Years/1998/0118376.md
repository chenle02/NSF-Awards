Abstract: Water Distribution Infrastructure Management System: an Analytical
Decision-Making Framework for the Planning of Rehabilitation Integrating
Statistical failure Models

The overall objective of this research is to enrich the state of decision-making
as it applies to water pipes assets management and rehabilitation programs. The
essential questions are: (1) what actions should be taken to ensure that the
physical assets are managed in a cost efficient way? (2) when should such
actions be taken?

The proposed research expands upon the current studies conducted at Polytechnic
University's Urban Infrastructure Institute (UII) in cooperation with European
research centers. It will focus on the evaluation of degradation models, and on
the development of an analytical framework for risk management using New York
City as a case study.
