The PIs will conduct paleomagnetic and geochronological studies of Brunhes-age
lavas from two composite volcanic sections in southwest Iceland: the Eyjafjoll
and the Hengill-Grafningur- Ingolfsfjall volcanic systems, which have been
mapped in detail and whose ages span the last 0.8 Ma. Improvements in the K-Ar
method now permit accurate dating of tholeiitic lavas as young as 40 ka a K-Ar
based timescale for these composite volcanic sections will be established.
Paleomagnetism of these sections, including paleointensity determinations, will
be used to describe the complete paleomagnetic vector in Iceland for the past
0.8 Ma, to determine to what extent the average Brunhes paleomagnetic field in
Iceland behaved as a geocentric axial dipole (GAD), to document possible
deviations for the GAD approximation, and to distinguish patterns of
paleomagnetic secular variation for different periods in the Brunhes chron. From
the K-Ar ages and major and trace element compositional data the PIs will
document the duration, character and periodicity of volcanic processes within
the neovolcanic zones of Iceland. In particular they will examine the timescale
for crustal accretion at the tip of a propagating rift and within a dying rift,
as analogs for spreading ridge segment evolution.
