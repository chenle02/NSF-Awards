The field of topology possesses powerful tools for constructing or obstructing
the existence of geometric spaces and continuous maps between them. Here,
"continuous" describes a mapping of one space to another that can be thought of
as bending and compressing, but without breaking. For example, a torus (the
surface of a doughnut) can be compressed without tearing onto the surface of a
sphere in a manner that does not deform continuously to a constant map to a
single point. However, any continuous map in the opposite direction, taking the
sphere to the torus, may be deformed without tearing to a mapping onto a single
point. Classic tools of topology do not address questions of size or diameter in
such constructions, and this project seeks to study those questions by bringing
other ideas of topology and geometry to bear. Broader impacts of these projects
include mentoring of grant-supported graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects emphasizes notions of distortion
within metric topology, and will bring to bear techniques of differential graded
algebras, geometric packing constructions, cobordism, and embedding theory. Some
of these issues, including embedding, have entered the study of high-dimensional
data through studies of dimension reduction and persistent homology. Algebraic
and geometric aspects of topology are both involved in these investigations, and
among the known issues arising in quantitative geometric topology are questions
of complexity and decidability in the logical senses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
