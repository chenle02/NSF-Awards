This is an award to provide support for research on the biological degradation
of chlorinated hydrocarbons that are of significance with respect to
contamination of water. The specific compounds being investigated are 1, 1,
1-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride. Previous work has
shown that these compounds can be degraded aerobically by methane and propane
oxidizing bacteria but has neglected the competitive effects of the growth
substrate and the chlorinated hydrocarbons on the rate of degradation. In this
work, the effects of methane and propane levels on the degradation rate of the
target compounds will be determined and the results applied to developments of
model sequencing batch reactors for degradation of those compounds. A
mathematical model that can be utilized in the engineering design of bioreactors
for treatement of wastes containing chlorinated hydrocarbons is the expected
result of this research. Successful completion of this research will provide
information that is essential for design of high-rate, aerobic biological
systems for destruction of chlorinated hydrocarbons of pollutional significance.
