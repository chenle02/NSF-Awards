Support for the Board on Physics and Astronomy will permit it to continue its
activities. These include eight standing committees, four concerned with U.S.
participation in the international scientific unions for physics, astronomy,
optics and radio sciences, three concerned with the health and progress of
specific subfields of physics (Solid State Sciences, Atomic, Molecular and
Optical Sciences, Plasma Science), and a committee on Radio Frequencies. Reports
are prepared and distributed which result from these efforts.
