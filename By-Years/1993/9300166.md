The eastern U.S. is a major source of ozone and ozone precursors to the North
Atlantic region. Previous studies have shown that emissions from this region
significantly affect levels of NOx and hydrocarbons over the Western North
Atlantic Ocean, and recent measurements indicate that transport of ozone
produced over the eastern U.S substantially alters the ozone budget of the
temperate North Atlantic region. However the total impact of anthropogenic
emissions on the photochemistry of this region is currently poorly understood. A
primary reason is a paucity of information on NOx (NO + NO2) and total reactive
nitrogen levels over the central and eastern North Atlantic, which results in
uncertainty as to the ultimate fate and impact of anthropogenic emissions on the
regional ozone budget. This project seeks to address this problem through
measurements of NO and NOy (total reactive nitrogen oxides) at a site in the
Azores. The location is ideal for observation of aged emissions transported from
eastern North America and is suitably isolated from European impacts.
Measurements would be made in conjunction with a currently-planned CO (carbon)
and O3 (ozone) monitoring program, and would take place in concert with the
other measurement programs in order to assess seasonal variations. The resulting
data would be used to quantify anthropogenic impacts on NOx and ozone levels in
the North Atlantic troposphere.
