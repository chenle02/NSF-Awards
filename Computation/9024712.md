The diffusion of impurities in semiconductors must be modeled accurately to
achieve the shallow junctions and high densities required for very large scale
integration. A five -species kinetic model has been proposed to explain the
observed nonlinearities in dopant profiles without ad hoc assumptions and a
research code written to implement the model in three dimensions. Much work
remains to analyze the resulting reaction-diffusion PDE system mathematically
and to develop computationally efficient algorithms to solve equations
numerically. Specific tasks include investigating existence, uniqueness, and
stability for solutions to the five species reaction-diffusion system; comparing
various integration techniques with the backward difference formula currently
used; comparing several matrix-free iterative techniques such as GMRES and BCGS
with the incomplete orthogonalization method; finding a suitable preconditioner
that is natural; developing an efficient adaptive grid refinement strategy;
addressing theoretical questions of convergence and stability for the discrete
method; and finally, parallelizing the algorithm. This project has been
motivated by the need of developing smaller semiconductors for very large scale
integration. Progress in this project has direct consequence in computer
hardware design.
