This award provides funding to support the participation of graduate students
and other early-career researchers in the Second Drexel Waves Workshop, held
March 30-31, 2023 at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. Wave propagation
problems are ubiquitous in natural and engineered systems, arising in contexts
such as fluid motion, optics, the motion of pedestrians and vehicles, systems
from quantum physics, and more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fifteen researchers have
been invited to deliver lectures on wave propagation problems of high current
interest. The invited speakers have expertise including mathematical analysis,
modeling, asymptotic theory, and high-performance scientific computing. Specific
topics discussed include fluid mixing problems, stability and metastability of
coherent structures, and stochastic effects on wave propagation. The conference
webpage is located at https://www.math.drexel.edu/~ambrose/drexelwaves/secondDWW
.html.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
