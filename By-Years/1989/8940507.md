This one year supplement to NSF Grant No. INT-8509253 between V. Vujovic,
University of Novi Sad and Aly Shabaik, UCLA, was approved by the
U.S.-Yugoslavia Joint Board for Scientific and Technological Cooperation in May
1988. Supplemental support is recommended to complete the joint research project
on optimization of working conditions in metal deformation in view of occurence
of material workability potential.
