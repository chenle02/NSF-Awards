9708000 Hughes This grant provides $69,900 as partial support of the costs of
acquiring workstations, PC's and hard disk and tape drive mass storage for the
International Seismological Center (ISC). The ISC is the international
organization charged with assembly of final seismological observations including
solutions of hypocenters and calculations of magnitudes of global seismic
events. These data are currently published in the Bulletin of the ISC and the
Regional Catalogue of Earthquakes in both hard copy and on CD-ROM. This
computational equipment will allow the ISC to develop routines for interactive
analysis and retrieval of seismic data via the Internet so that the
international seismological community can have more rapid access to available
data products in their studies of deep Earth structure and for earthquake hazard
assessment. ***
