This award supports cooperative research on tectonic subsidence history between
Dr. Teresa Jordan of Cornell University and Dr. Felisa Bercowski of the National
University of San Juan, Argentina. The history of Andean mountain building in
the late Cenozoic period is contained in exposed strata in the San Juan province
in Argentina. This stratigraphic record was influenced by tectonic processes
which can be interpreted by modern techniques such as magnetic polarity
stratigraphy and fission track dating. Information will be extracted from
existing chronological studies and will be coupled with petrographic, diagenetic
(physical and chemical changes since deposition), and facies (appearance and
composition) studies. Professor Bercowski will study theory and application of
data analysis methods which will be applied in her laboratory. Prof. Jordan will
have the opportunity to work with a geologist living in a natural geological
laboratory. This collaboration provides an opportunity for both scientists to
study Cenozoic non-marine stratigraphic and tectonic history as well as those of
the Carboniferous and Cambrian ages. This grant is supplemental to funding
provided by the Earth Sciences Division of NSF and extends the international
cooperation between Dr. Jordan and Dr. Bercowski.
