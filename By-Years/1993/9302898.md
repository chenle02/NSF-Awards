It is now well established that zoospore-producing fungi that are able to
weaken fiber and disrupt lignified tissues of forage are an integral part of the
anaerobic microbial population of the rumen of herbivores. These fungi produce
cellulases, xylanases and other enzymes that break down the complex polymers of
plant cell wall material. To date, isolations of anaerobic zoosporic fungi have
been limited to rumen fluid and feces. However, there is ample evidence to
suggest that these fungi are able to survive and grow outside the host animal.
The objective of this project is to isolate, examine and characterize zoosporic
fungi from natural anaerobic environments such as ponds, marshes and landfills.
%%% Results from this project would be used to set up experiments to determine
the possible role of these fungi in the degradation of naturally-occurring
recalcitrant fibrous material.
