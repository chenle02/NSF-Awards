This research will investigate the development of the cultural landscape around
Lough Gur, Co. Limerick, Ireland. It will be primarily based on analysis of lake
sediments and archaeological sites from the Neolithic the Medieval period. These
materials are particularly well suited for testing several hypotheses concerning
vegetational and erosional changes resulting from human impact on the
environment through time. The overall hypothesis states that Post-Boreal changes
in the vegetation accompanied by erosion reflect local prehistoric and historic
farming. Subsidiary hypotheses are: That the locality of vegetation disturbance
in the lake catchment changes through time and can be traced by paleomagnetic
analysis of the lake sediment. That the elm population was primarily affected by
tree cutting during the early colonization of lighter soils by humans. That the
relative frequency of algae in the sediment corresponds to fluctuations in lake
catchment settlements. And that the elm decline is an outcome of disease and is
not associated with erosion.
