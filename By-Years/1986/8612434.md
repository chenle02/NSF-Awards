The synthesis of complex molecules provides the driving force for the
development of new synthetic strategies. This research, in the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program, is centered around the development of highly
regio- and stereoselective synthetic methods. A major area concerns the
development of methods based on the cyclization of chains so constructed as to
allow cleavage or detachment of the cyclized appendage, thus controlling regio-
and stereochemistry of carbon-carbon bonds formed by addition at both ends of an
unactivated double bond. Other areas of interest to this research concern the
development of a general method for the formation of polypropionate- derived
sequences of any stereochemistry. Finally, the possible design of molecules
which might produce chiral induction in catalytic hydrogenation is considered.
Dr. Stork's prior research has resulted in the publication of nineteen technical
articles.
