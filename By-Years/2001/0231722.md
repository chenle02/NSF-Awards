This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
laser treatment to crystallize amorphous quasicrystalline (QC) coatings on
thermally sensitive engineering substrates. Application of these materials has
been limited by the high temperature-annealing requirement, which restricts
their deposition of super alloys and ceramic materials only. In the program, it
is proposed to develop laser treatment of amorphous sputter-deposited QC
coatings to provide localized thermal energy to the coated region only. This
will enable the amorphous-to-crystalline conversion, while not degrading the
load-carrying capability of the underlying substrate materials (Aluminum,
Titanium, and bearing steel allows). The spectral reflectance of a-QC sputtered
coatings will be measured to select the appropriate laser (and wavelength) for
processing, laser glazing trials will be conducted, and then the microstructure
and mechanical/tribological properties of the crystallized QC films will be
characterized. Results will be briefed to major diesel engine manufacturers.

Quasicrystalline materials offer a unique combination of material properties;
low friction, high hardness, and low thermal conductivity, which makes them
ideal coatings for non-galling tools for aluminum forming, engine drive-train
components, and aluminum engine block cylinder surfaces.
