The basic physical mechanism by which earthquake triggering occurs has remained
difficult to prove even on the most basic level of whether the key mechanism is
static or dynamic stress transfer. The importance of other processes that might
be set off by the initial stress change, such as microfracturing, afterslip,
pore fluid flow, or viscoelastic relaxation, are also unknown.

The work in this project focuses on the most basic question of whether static or
dynamic stresses are most important for the triggering of near to mid-field
aftershocks. Previous work in this area has found that both static and dynamic
stress changes may explain the azimuthal distribution of aftershocks. This study
focus on examining whether the creation of stress shadows, a phenomena that is
predicted by the static triggering but not by the dynamic triggering model, can
be substantiated. Preliminary results indicate that stress shadows may not
actually exist, supporting dynamic triggering. The decay of aftershock density
with distance from the mainshock fault for mainshocks of different magnitudes
should likewise be influenced by the type of triggering mechanism. The study is
finding that aftershocks may occur at distances up to or exceeding seven to ten
fault lengths. This also supports dynamic triggering, which is substantially
stronger at these distances.

Determining whether aftershocks are triggered by static or dynamic stresses is
important for a number of issues related to earthquake hazard estimation,
including estimation of the distances to which earthquakes of different
magnitudes might be expected to trigger aftershocks, determination of whether
mainshocks can ever be expected to depress regional seismic activity (e.g.
create stress shadows), and determination of whether the directionality of an
aftershock pattern can always be expected to follow the directionality of the
mainshock rupture. Through investigation of the aftershock triggering process
the investigators also hope to gain insight into how earthquakes nucleate.
