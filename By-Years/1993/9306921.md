9306921 Bloomfield This research planning grant for women supports studies
exploring the potential role of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) in
mediating the response of bone to changes in mechanical strain. Previous
investigators have developed valuable animal models to quantify and describe in
detail the nature of the bony response to increases in loading experienced by
bone, as well as to the decreased loading of various immobilization treatments.
Little is known, however, about cellular or molecular mechanisms for the
subsequent gain or loss in bone volume routinely observed with these conditions.
Specifically, how do bone cells perceive strain and then transduce that
mechanical signal to a biochemical factor which then initiates increases in bone
formation activity (in the case of increased loading) or suppresses formation in
favor of resorption (in the case of decreased loading)? The planning activities
of this proposal will provide training in two primary tools essential to this
line of research: bone histomorphometry and molecular biology techniques to
isolate and quantify mRNA for IGFs from bone tissue. ***
