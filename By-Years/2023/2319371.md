The project aims to develop and apply tools coming from algebra to identify
attacks embedded within legitimate communications streams and online fora. The
research will enhance statistical methods and Artificial Intelligence to detect
and combat threats. Specifically, the research will work with unlabeled data and
will be applicable in environments that cannot support learning on training
data, such as new domains or previously unseen threats. The project will provide
training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, preparing
them for their future careers in STEM fields. The research on detecting outliers
in data, recovering missing data, and detecting hidden constraints will have
many applications across the sciences.

The project aims to design a self-adaptive linear-time algorithm to separate
signals, find hidden constraint equations, and detect similarities in high-
dimensional data (tensors). This collaborative research of the three
investigators and student participants will focus on three independent tasks.
The first will extend signal separation and outlier prediction to a continuous
spectrum. The second will refactor algebraic structures into tensor networks for
uniform algorithms. The third will devise faster (linear-time) solutions to
matrix systems to enhance practical range. Analysis of high-dimensional data
often runs afoul of the curse of dimensionality: as the number of independent
parameters increases, the time needed to search neighbors grows exponentially.
Also, the meaning of outlier becomes blurred as notions of far apart and close
together are less distinguishable, and traditional statistics tend to identify
large subspaces. The new algebraic markers will detect structure in any
dimension and be quickly computable.
