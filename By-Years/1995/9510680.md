9510680 Phillips This theoretical research is co-funded by the Chemistry
Division and the Division of Materials Research. The focus is on electron
transport in organic metals. In particular, the following systems will be
studied: the magnetic and transport properties of organic porphyrin conductors;
the temperature dependence of the conductivity in potassium- containing
electrides; and, the construction of a room- temperature single electron
transistor using carbon-sixty. %%% This interdisciplinary theoretical research
project is funded by the Chemistry and Materials Research Divisions. The focus
is on electron transport in organic metals. The properties of these materials
requires an interdisciplinary approach for which the prinicipal investigator is
uniquely qualified. Successful completion of this research will contribute to
the design of new classes of materials for electroactive applications. ***
