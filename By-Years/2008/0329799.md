A grant has been awarded to Dr. Richard E. Triemer of Michigan
State&lt;br/&gt;University and Mark A. Farmer of the University of Georgia to
complete a treatise on the euglenophyte genus Euglena and to produce updated
treatises for the genera Phacus, Lepocinclis, Trachelomonas and Strombomonas.
Euglenid flagellates represent one of the earliest diverging lineages of
eukaryotes and are closely related to a group of disease causing organisms, the
trypanosomes. Sometime before 410 million years ago the ancestor of modern
euglenophytes acquired a chloroplast from a green alga via a secondary symbiotic
event. Since that time the euglenophytes have diverged into a number of species
distributed among several genera, the five largest ones being Euglena, Phacus,
Lepocinclis, Trachelomonas and Strombomonas. This study will use molecular and
morphological features and compare these to historical descriptions to
characterize numerous euglenoid species and redefine their proper placement
among these genera. Despite the importance of euglenoids to evolutionary
biologists, ecologists, and the research community in general, few scientists
have more than a passing knowledge of the group. The proposed research would
generate a modern, illustrated treatise of the photosynthetic euglenoids, which
would be widely available through conventional and electronic media, thus
creating an invaluable resource for protozoologists, phycologists, limnologists,
and ecologists. The questions relating to the genus and species concept in
euglenoids are common to most protists. Our comprehensive approach using a
combined morphological and molecular analysis to develop a phylogenetic species
concept will be of great significance for other protistan groups. &lt;br/&gt;
