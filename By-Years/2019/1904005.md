Through this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Professor
James Larrabee at Middlebury College to carry out fundamental studies of three
metallohydrolases using magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy. These
metallohydrolases are able to detoxify chemical warfare agents and thus are of
current importance for society. MCD spectroscopy allows the researchers to
monitor changes that occur in the active sites of the enzymes when they are
attached to nanoparticles and/or genetically modified and it provides clues
about the chemical origins of the changes in their activity. This research could
provide a scientific basis for creating improved bio-remediation agents. The
funded research is conducted at Middlebury College by undergraduate students.
Research experiences strengthen the interest of undergraduate students in
furthering their science education and the pursuit in careers in science.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the research project is to attach three
metallohydrolases to silica, alumina or magnetite nanoparticles. Earlier studies
conducted in the Larrabee lab were on the free enzymes, not on the enzymes
attached to nanoparticles. The enzyme attachment to nanoparticles could improve
both the activity and stability of the enzymes. The Larrabee research group also
studies mutant forms of the enzymes that have enhanced activity. The active
sites of the three enzymes are chemically and spectroscopically similar. The
research group of Professor Larrabee studies the enzymes in the form in which
they contain Co(II) ions. MCD spectroscopy is used to study the changes of the
metal environment caused by the binding of the enzymes to the nanoparticles or
by mutations. The outcome of the research could be used to make these enzymes
more useful as bio-remediation agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
