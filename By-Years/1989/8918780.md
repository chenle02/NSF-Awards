The local structure of complex problems is being studied. It has been shown that
certain NP-complete problems satisfy a linear difference equation that is
similar to the wave equation of mathematical physics; some immediate
consequences of this have already been deduced. It has been proved that local
search algorithms starting from an arbitrary poor configuration, under certain
conditions, converge to the average cost of the system in O(n) iterations. The
solution of the equation and its application to the analysis and design of local
search algorithms like simulated annealing and Kernighan-Lin search are being
studied. Extensions of these techniques to interior point methods are being
developed. A hypothesis has been proposed regarding these neighborhood
structures for which local search algorithms will generally be most successful.
Several tests are being conducted to verify this hypothesis. These include a new
local search algorithm for the traveling salesman problem that, unlike existing
algorithms of the same neighborhood size, is expected to be successful even when
the triangle inequality is not satisfied and/or the distances between cities are
asymmetric.
