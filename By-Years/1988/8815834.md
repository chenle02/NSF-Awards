The general purpose of these studies is to obtain a better understanding of
parameters governing ultra-short pulse generation, propagation, and nonlinear
interaction in semiconductor thin films and active waveguides. Results of such
studies are expected to facilitate the design of future high-rate optical
communication and signal processing devices. Topics of particular current
interests are: ultrafast gain and loss dynamics in diode lasers, limitations on
pulse formation and propagation in semiconductor waveguides, femtosecond carrier
dynamics in InGaAs and InGaAsP, and nonlinear coupling phenomena in active
waveguides. The proposed work is primarily experimental; and an important aspect
is the development of novel femtosecond diagnostic techniques. Specific goals
are outlined in three sections. (a) Wavelength-tunable studies of sub-picosecond
gain and absorption nonlinearities in GaAlAs and InGaAsP diode lasers. (b)
Dynamic index of refraction changes in active semiconductor wave-guide devices.
(c) Improved femtosecond diagnostics for the long-wavelength regime.
