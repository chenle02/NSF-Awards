0105023&lt;br/&gt;Haxton&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the activities of a
group of investigators to&lt;br/&gt;study the scientific opportunities, as well
as facility features and&lt;br/&gt;requirements, of a possible US underground
laboratory. Recent meetings and workshops have indicated considerable enthusiasm
for such a possibility. A steering committee has been formed that will direct
these activities and facilitate activity involvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
