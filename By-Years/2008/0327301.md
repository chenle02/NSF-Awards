This research seeks to expand the boundaries of contemporary labor studies
scholarship by drawing attention to labor-related forms of movement activity
occurring outside traditional collective bargaining frameworks. It contends that
fully understanding the dimensions and possibilities of labor transformation
requires scholars and practitioners to fundamentally alter established analytic
suppositions. The central questions are: 1) How might analyzing the labor
movement as a social movement, with respect to goals, power, strategy and
success, open new avenues of inquiry and contribute to current labor movement
theorizing? 2) Do community based labor organizations, represent new mechanisms
by which movement rebirth might occur? The project design consists of three
phases: 1) mapping the dimensions of the "new" labor movement to identify the
scope, type and quality of activity emblematic of labor revitalization; 2) in-
depth case study of exemplary activity focusing on the organization's goals,
analysis of power, the strategies and tactics, and the means used to measure
success; 3) evaluating the effectiveness of the organizations' methods to
determine whether they represent viable alternatives to traditional forms of
labor movement organizing. The work is based on seventy-five interviews with
labor leaders, community activists, labor scholars, union organizers and workers
throughout California and extensive observation of three community-based
organizations in Los Angeles. The broader impact of this dissertation project
lies in its potential to contribute to the theoretical and practical goal of
applying a social movement lens to analyses of the contemporary US labor
movement. In so doing, it seeks to advance union and community organizing
practices by drawing attention to innovative forms of labor movement
organization and by highlighting the contributions of women and immigrant
workers who are playing a central role in creating them.
