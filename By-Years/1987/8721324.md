Accurate values of the elastic properties of candidate mantle phases are of
fundamental importance for placing constraints upon the mineralogy and chemistry
of the Earth's interior. Although clinopyroxenes and garnets are essential major
constituents of all contemporary models of upper mantle mineralogy, the elastic
properties of these minerals are undetermined for many relevant compositions.
The overall goal of this research program is to define the effects of chemical
composition and crystal structure on the elasticity of geophysically important
materials. The PI will determine the elastic properties of clinopyroxene and
garnet single crystals under ambient conditions by Brillouin scattering
measurements, will initiate an experimental program to determine the elastic
properties of minerals at high pressure by Brillouin scattering measurements on
samples compressed in a diamond anvil cell. The aim of these experiments is to
obtain pressure derivatives of the bulk and shear moduli for the mantle
minerals. Extremely few reliable values of such properties are presently
available. These results will provide an improved basis for testing
mineralogical models of the Earth's upper mantle and transition zone, and will
greatly enhance our understanding of how chemical and crystal structural changes
affect mineral elasticity within silicate solid solutions.
