Successful animals tend to make efficient decisions in their daily activities in
terms of effort spent, risk taken and benefit gained. In contrast, poor
decisions affecting fitness are characteristic of anxiety, depression and many
forms of mental illness that contribute to behavioral dysfunction. A grasp of
the neural bases of decision is therefore essential to any unifying framework
that models the organization of normal and abnormal behavior by the brain.
Critical to the neural bases of decision is a description of how the nervous
system integrates sensation, internal state and learning. &lt;br/&gt; A simple
neural network model has been derived for cost-benefit decision-making in
foraging from studies of behavior and nervous system in the simple predatory
sea-slug, Pleurobranchaea. Within the context of the model, the feeding motor
network is usefully conceived as a "goal-directed neural network" whose state of
excitation is regulated by sensation, nutritional state and learning. This
quality confers a role as a central, computational element for the cost-benefit
algorithm that organizes expression of behavior.&lt;br/&gt; Rationale and
experimental plans are outlined to elucidate how appetant stimulus properties,
satiated state and food-avoidance learning act through the feeding motor network
to influence decision in the motor network mediating both orienting and
avoidance turns. Specifically, investigations will be aimed at explaining the
neural bases for switching between orienting and avoidance turns, how this
switch is determined by sensation, appetite and learning, and how avoidance
decision may suppress feeding behavior. Studies will be carried out with
conventional electrophysiological recording methods on well-tested physiological
preparations. Results will have broad integrative significance to understanding
how animals make successful behavioral decisions that balance perception of
available resources and risk against their own needs, and will provide a simple
model for approaching the neural circuitry for similar value-based decision-
making in more complex animals. Undergraduate students, including minority
members, are involved in these laboratory research activities. Research related
materials from this lab, including videos, photographs and software, are
disseminated for public information on the neural basis bases of behavior in sea
slugs on a website written for accessibility by undergraduates and
laypersons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
