The establishment of the embryonic body plan during the development of many
animals results from the asymmetric distribution of molecules or organelles in
the egg. One particularly clear example is the specification of anterior
development in Drosophila embryos. The messenger RNA of the bicoid gene is
localized at the anterior margin of the egg during oogenesis; following
fertilization the bicoid protein activates the expression of anterior-specific
zygotic genes. Experiments in this proposal are directed toward learning how
bicoid RNA is localized during oogenesis, including molecular associations of
the RNA and the cellular mechanisms of localization. Proposed experiments
include an investigation of molecular interactions that cause bicoid RNA to be
associated with the cytoskeleton or other large organelles, particularly the
involvement of microtubules in this process. The function of the swallow gene in
bicoid RNA localization during oogenesis will be investigated in experiments to
learn whether swallow protein is associated with bicoid RNA, and to identify
functionally important parts of the swallow protein. A search of the group of
maternal effect genes with early arrest phenotypes will be made for other genes
whose products are involved in bicoid RNA localization. The time course of
bicoid RNA localization will be monitored through the construction and
expression of an inducible RNA that is localized via the bicoid pathway,
allowing tests of the idea that bicoid RNA is transported to the oocyte by an
active mechanism.
