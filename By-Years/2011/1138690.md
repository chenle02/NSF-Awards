Successful interactions with the environment require some change in behavior to
stimuli when their significance changes. Higher neuronal responses have been
documented in several brain regions to a significant stimulus, compared to
presentation of a non-consequential stimulus. A brain region involved in hearing
and that undergoes profound changes (plasticity) during learning about the
significance of sensory stimuli is the primary auditory cortex (A1). The
experiments of this proposal will begin to reveal the molecular machinery
allowing tone-guided behavior and learning-induced plasticity in A1 as rats
learn to collect food reward after hearing a tone. It will use a combination of
established and cutting edge methods: behavior, to assess learning in rats, will
be combined with optical blood flow imaging to identify parts of A1 that respond
to a reward-predicting tone and to one that does not, with Arc antisense
oligodeoxynucleotide intracranial infusions in A1 to prevent synthesis of Arc
protein specifically in A1, and with electrophysiological recordings to assess
A1 neuronal responses to tones. It is predicted that rats with suppressed levels
of Arc in A1 will learn to collect a food reward after hearing a tone, but will
perform poorly the next day. In addition, learning-induced plasticity in A1 is
expected to be impaired. To control for non-specific effects of the infusions,
the project will compare the behavior and electrophysiological responses to
those of rats that have received a scrambled version of the
oligodeoxynucleotides. The findings will contribute to understanding the
molecular underpinnings of auditory learning and consolidation of associated A1
plasticity. This research will help scientists at the undergraduate, graduate
and postdoctoral level acquire highly integrative thinking and skills. It will
also establish, by collaborating with local minority-serving colleges, a website
for neuroscience education with grade-appropriate content for students
K8-college, including those with hearing impairments.
