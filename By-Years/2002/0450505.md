The focus of this research involves nine goals. Major aspects include: 1)
synthesis of new, mixed selenium-, silicon-, sulfur-and tin-containing 4-6- and
8-10-membered rings; 2) synthesis of bicyclic 1,2-dichalcogenins; 3) sulfur-
containing mouse semiochemicals, new (mercaptomethyl)silanes, and artifact
formation with SPME fibers; 4) total synthesis of lentinic acid from shiitake
mushrooms; 5) synthesis of biologically relevant 1,2-diselenolanes; 6) synthesis
of 5-heterobicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes and 2-thiabicyclo-[1.1.0]butanes; 7) synthesis
of selenium analogues of biologically active organosulfur compounds; 8)
microwave characterization of small organoselenium compounds; 9) Allium
chemistry: synthesis of optically active ajoene and S-2-fluoro-2-propenylthio
derivatives. With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
is supporting the research of Dr. Eric Block in the Department of Chemistry at
SUNY at Albany. Professor Block will focus his work on seeking to answer
fundamental questions relating to the chemistry of the elements sulfur and
selenium, important constituents of biological systems. The project has broader
impact in the pharmaceutical industry and in the area of human health. Further,
the project is an excellent venue for the training of undergraduates, graduate
students and postdoctoral colleagues.
