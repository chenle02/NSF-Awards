This project will improve the ability of the Thermosphere Ionosphere
Electrodynamics Global Circulation Model (TIE-GCM) and the thermospheric
extension of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM-X) to simulate
middle and upper atmospheric odd nitrogen, specifically nitric oxide (NO). The
relevant NO chemistry scheme used by these models needs significant updates in
rate coefficient and quantum yields based on recent improvements in laboratory
measurements. TIE-GCM simulations of equatorial NO compare poorly with
observations. Data from the Student Nitric Oxide Explorer (SNOE) data will be
used to tune the model chemistry within the remaining uncertainties of the
improved lab results. The effect of the modified NO chemistry on simulated
winds, temperature, energetics, and minor species will be evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt; Accurate prediction of thermospheric odd nitrogen is crucial, as it
influences the response of the thermosphere temperature and density to solar
cycles and storms. A version of the widely circulated GLOW model including these
updated parameters and processes will be of benefit to the community while
implementation of the revised NO chemistry in TIE-GCM and WACCM-X will enable
more accurate simulation of the impacts of thermospheric NO variations. In
addition to the research, outreach activities to college and high school
students will be carried out.
