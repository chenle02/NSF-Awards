Comprehensive measurements of temperature, winds, and gravity wave structure at
two sites, Mt. Haleakala Hawaii and the Artic Lidar Observatory for Middle
Atmosphere Research (ALOMAR) in Northern Norway, are used to quantify key
parameters aspects of the momentum transfer between the middle and upper
atmosphere. Emphasis is placed on quantification of the role of instabilities in
gravity wave dynamics, quantification of momentum transport and deposition, and
determinations of mean forcing by gravity waves in the two regions. The
methodology includes operation of lidars, optical interferometers, imagers, and
radars, with subsequent numerical modeling to permit quantification of the
response to instability dynamics on gravity wave amplitudes, on the mean flow,
and on the momentum flux. Observations at two sites, one polar and one
equatorial reveal the adaptability of the methodology to regions of very
disparate ambient, or mean-flow conditions that are modulated in part by
weather.
