This proposal deals with the relatively new field of flow cytometry, in which
lasers are used to excite unique but complex signal patterns of individual cells
and particles in order to quantify and characterize the identification of
cellular organisms. This technique obviates the need for time consuming,
laborious identification by microscope. Flow cytometers have been introduced to
the biological oceanography field to help identify the presence and extent of
phytoplankton species. Oceanic phytoplankton may well be the most important
element in the global food chain. It is also one of the major photosynthetic
producers of CO2, the critical component affecting the global carbon cycle. It
also is a prime contributor to the build up of CO2 in the atmosphere. Thus the
measurement and quantification of phytoplankton is critical to our understanding
of life on earth. Although flow cytometry has moved the scientist from the
microscope to the world of rapid quantification, the data produced by flow
cytometers is copious and must normally be processed ashore. This proposal is to
apply artificial neural systems to flow cytometry to provide real time, at sea,
data analysis, hardware and software to significantly ease the burden of
analysis of the data and accelerate research into the life processes in the
oceans. ANS systems are capable of rapidly recognizing patterns such as those
produced by flow cytometry. KTAADN intends to use the services of James Bay Inc.
a firm specializing in ANS to help define the necessary software. In particular
they propose to use, NetMaster, an ANS system, developed by James Bay as a basis
for the system architecture.
