This project proposes a causal relationship between investments in knowledge
(i.e., R&D expenditures) and in physical capital (i.e., machinery and
equipment). The basic idea is that a successful completion of R&D projects,
i.e., innovations, necessitates physical investments which embody the new ideas.
Only then can the innovator generate a flow of profits from the new idea. This
will be embedded in an industry equilibrium framework, suggesting that the
evolution of industry (in terms of prices, quantities, entry and exit, R&D
expenditures, etc.) can be explained via the mechanics of R&D innovations
implementations. In particular, one can explain why R&D expenditures cause (in a
statistical sense) physical investments, and why they are less volatile.
