Compositionally disparate or bimodal magmas simultaneously occupying the same
chamber have been inferred since the very beginnings of igneous petrology. This
award supports a series of field-based investigations, centered around the
diabase sills of Antarctica, some of which are perhaps the best examples of
bimodal fractionation (solidification front instability-Ä±SFI!), and augmented by
experimental and analytical investigations, to delineate the physics and
chemistry of SFI. Similar, complementary field studies will also be undertaken
at the Stott Mountain, Oregon, and Zora, Pennsylvania involving, silicic lenses
in gabbro and voluminous bulbous granophyre at their upper contact of a large
diabase sheet.
