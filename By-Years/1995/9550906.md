This project focuses on the inclusion of a Hewlett-Packard GCD, a capillary gas
chromatograph with an electron ionization detector, in a newly developed
chemistry curriculum. The two guiding principles in developing this new
curriculum are (1) courses should be discovery-based with students being
actively engaged in scientific inquiry and (2) the boundaries which have
traditionally separated the subdisciplines of chemistry should be removed. The
new curriculum includes a 1-semester, discovery- based introductory course and
is followed by intermediate and upper-level courses that continue to illustrate
the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry. The Hewlett-Packard GCD is a dual use
instrument in that it may operate as a capillary GC or as a GC/MS. As such, this
instrument will fill two important gaps in instrumentation and will be
extensively used in four of the eight core courses required for the new
chemistry major, as well as in advanced electives and in independent research
projects. A significant number of majors from other disciplines also enroll in
two of these four courses, extending the impact of the inclusion of this
instrument in the new curriculum beyond the doors of the chemistry department.
