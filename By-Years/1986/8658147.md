This research is aimed at understanding the dynamical properties of chemically-
reacting systems. Specifically, it is aimed at: (1) multi- phase reactors
studying fluid flow-through trickle bed reactors, attempting to understand flow
phenomena such as phase separation and channeling which can cause disfunction;
(2) bioreactors, using the notion of a cell as a reactor to build a kinetic
model for cholesterol uptake and usage by endothelial cells; and (3) studying
cell function and pathogenesis, by drawing together work on the theoretical
basis of membrane diffusion and reaction networks.
