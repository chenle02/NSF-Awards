This project involves the theoretical and numerical development of a new method
of calculating resonance energies and widths, together with the application of
the method to atomic resonances. The resonance parameters, including partial
widths and resonance channel wave functions, are determined by searching the
complex momentum plane for the poles of the multichannel Schwinger T matrix.
Steps in the project include (1) implementation of a multichannel iteration
procedure, (2) development of multichannel Green's functions stable in all
complex energy regions, (3) study of the numerical behavior of the Schwinger T
matrix denominator in the complex energy plane and (4) characterization of
higher atomic resonances. Applications will be made to the resonance states of
beryllium, helium and H-.
