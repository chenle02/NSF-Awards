The research aims to develop a definition of plastic strain for finite
deformations. A set of multiaxial experiments will be conducted at large
deformations to come out with a satisfactory prescription of plastic strain. The
experiments will test the validity of a recently proposed, new, prescription of
finite plastic strain.
