This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Program, is for continuation of studies of the factors that affect long-range
electron transfer in biological systems. Genetically engineered mutants of yeast
iso-1-cytochrome c, which have histidine residues substituted for the native
amino acid at various sites on the periphery of the protein, will be used for
these studies. Introduction of redox active, luminescent ruthenium complexes, by
complexation at these histidine sites, allows for the spectroscopic monitoring
of electron-transfer to, or from, the metalloenzyme over well-known, fixed
distances. A recently developed laser flash-quench technique will be used to
determine the electron-transfer rates. This technique has two major advantages
for these studies over previous methods. First, it allows for study of the
protein with the native iron, rather than a metal substituted version, and
second, it permits the study of a much wider range of transfer rates. In a
second phase of the research, similarly modified human myoglobins will be used
for the study of the coupling of single electron transfers to multielectron
events such as generation of a ferryl (Fe=O) species. The overall objective of
these studies is to determine the mechanism by which the electron moves from the
donor to the acceptor over distances of 10 angstroms and greater. %%% Electron
transfer is one of the most important processes in biological systems. An
intriguing aspects of these electron transfers is that the electron donor and
acceptor are frequently separated by large distances. Whereas theories of
electron transfer over short distances, where overlap of donor and acceptor
orbitals can occur, is well developed, the mechanism by which the electron moves
over long distances is not well understood. Studies such as these may ultimately
result in better treatment of certain physiological disorders and in new methods
of solar energy conversion.
