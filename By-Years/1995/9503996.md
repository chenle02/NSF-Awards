9503996 Brown In this project the effort will be concentrated on (1) building an
active vision system that uses PUMA or SARCOS manipulators to control the
camera's position, and (2) using and extending existing techniques for
recovering shape from images of a curved object's occluding contour. Because the
camera moves around the object in a continuous fashion, camera position control
and model-building will be modeled as two continuous, interdependent processes
that occur simultaneously and operate in real-time. The work on camera position
control will focus on controlling the camera's position in real-time, and on
imposing as few camera and manipulator calibration requirements as possible. The
work on model-building will focus on developing real-time curve tracking methods
that can handle the connectivity changes of occluding contour curves, and on
implementing and evaluating existing shape-from-contour techniques. This
research will provide a better understanding of the practical issues in moving a
camera to build models of curved objects with complex surface geometry. ***
