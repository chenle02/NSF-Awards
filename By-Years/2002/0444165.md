This award renews support of the Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center at the
University of South Carolina at Columbia. The deer mouse (Peromyscus
maniculatus) and congeneric species are among the most abundant and widely
distributed North American mammals. They are found in a variety of natural
habitats within a range that extends from Alaska to Central America. Several of
the most common species are used frequently as models to study fundamental
processes underlying speciation, adaptative physiology, behavior, and community
ecology. The Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center, established in 1985 is a reliable
source of Peromyscus and related materials for the national scientific and
education communities. The Center currently houses seven species of Peromyscus
and more than 35 distinctive mutant or otherwise genetically defined stocks,
primarily of the deer mouse. The Stock Center supplies researchers and educators
with live animals and with selected biological materials, including fresh or
preserved tissues, molecular probes, and libraries of cloned Peromyscus DNA. It
also functions as a clearinghouse for information by sponsoring an Internet
database, maintaining a reference collection of reprints, standardizing the
genetic nomenclature for the genus and publishing a semi-annual Peromyscus
Newsletter.
