This award will enable collaborative research between Professor Christopher
Wronski of Pennsylvania State University and Professor M. Hirose of Hiroshima
University, Japan. They will study amorphous silicon based materials with the
following four areas of focus: 1) the fabrication of amorphous superlattices
with sharp interfaces and low defect densities; 2) systematic material
characterization; 3) modelling of amorphous semiconductor superlattice
properties; and 4) materials design and device applications. The expertise and
facilities brought together by this program will provide a powerful arsenal of
techniques for establishing and understanding the synthesis of ultrathin
multilayer semiconductor superlattices and unraveling the role of interfaces in
these materials. Such understanding should promote application of these
materials in a wide variety of solid state and optoelectric devices. The Center
for Electronic Materials and Devices, Pennsylvania State University and the
Research Center for Integrated Systems, Hiroshima University will provide
complementary expertise and experimental capabilities to this project.
