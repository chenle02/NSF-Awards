This project from Cal State L.A. is designed to educate teachers to be leaders
of hands-on science instruction in their elementary schools. The two workshops
will train a total of fifty teachers to become science mentor specialists in
using hands-on science materials and to understand the physical science concepts
appropriate for elementary schools. The workshops will provide the mentor
teachers with lesson plans and well-organized kits of materials for each hands-
on unit, as well as raining in the use of these materials and how to educate
teachers about them. The mentors will correlate the physical science units their
school curriculum and inservice teaches at each grade level. There will be two
teachers from each school represented so that each teacher will inservice half
of the teachers at their school. Thus the program will develop a total school
program of hands on physical science. Each participating school will provide a
stipend to the teacher for conducting the inservice of their colleagues, release
time for such activity, and cost share the science kits which will be given to
each school. Project evaluation, problem sharing, and long range planning will
be accomplished at two support sessions for all mentor teachers scheduled during
the school year. Additional support will also be provided by the PIs at their
individual schools during the year as they attempt to improve the teaching of
science in their school. The cost sharing will be 38% of the NSF portion.
