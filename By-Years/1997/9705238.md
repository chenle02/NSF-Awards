ABSTRACT - CTS 9705238 Linda J. Broadbelt Northwestern University A new approach
to modeling heterogeneous catalytic reactions and predicting their rates is
proposed. Transient techniques of characterization, such as temperature-
programmed desorption and reaction (TPD, TPR), yield quantitive information on
the energetic heterogeneity of real catalysts. The TPD profiles are reduced to
sets of parameters identifying binding energies of chemisorbed species. Those
are included in reaction mechanisms, and rates of reaction are thus predicted.
This work's goal is to prove the outlined concept by utilizing TPD data from
supported and single-crystal nickel catalyst, and verifying predictions against
rate data for the methanation of carbon monoxide.
