This project is providing instruments that improve five areas of a cell biology
laboratory. An incubator and muffle furnace aid efforts to determine composition
of cells. A photomicrographic microscope with capability to detect fluorescence
is used to locate specific antigens by using FITC-antibodies. A cryostat is used
to section fresh tissue that, selectively stained, is used to identify the
cellular locations of specific molecules. Oxygen probes with accessories are
used to follow electron flow rates in mitochondria and chloroplasts. A recording
UV-VIS spectrophotometer enables undergraduates to do absorption spectra and to
analyze enzyme reactions. Finally, electrophoresis chambers and a densitometer
are used in the analysis of isozymes and the characterization of DNA. The
objective is to raise the level of involvement of sophomore biology students in
investigations of cell function. Early involvement of students in cell biology
experiments is expected to result in higher scores on senior exams in the cell
biology/molecular section of the Graduate Record Examination. The grantee
institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-
Federal sources.
