This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the
xylose isomerase (XI) enzyme from a marine bacterium as part of a process to
convert biomass to ethanol. Xylose isomerase converts xylose, the second most
common sugar in biomass, into xylulose. Xylose is not fermented to ethanol by
brewing yeast, but xylulose is. Previous XI enzymes are unable to work in
conjunction with fermentation due to incompatibilities in pH and inhibiting
compounds. The successful Phase 1 proposal identified this marine XI as capable
of performing Simultaneous Isomerization and Fermentation (SIF) of xylose to
ethanol. High efficiency conversion of xylose to ethanol can improve overall
process yield by 20-40%. The Phase II project will optimize the production of
the enzyme in native and high-productivity heterologous hosts leading to a low
cost source of the new enzyme. The optimized enzyme will be further
characterized and then produced in a 200 liter bioreactor to demonstrate
scalability leading to commercialization.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable the cost-
effective commercial production of cellulosic ethanol. Ethanol from local
cellulosic biomass is a sustainable transportation fuel that reduces greenhouse
gas emissions by an average of 87% according to the Argonne National Lab?s GREET
model. The toxicity of tailpipe emissions are also reduced relative to
petroleum-based fuels. As a domestic source of fuel, cellulosic ethanol adds to
U.S. energy security and strengthens our economy. By creating jobs and recycling
dollars into the U.S. economy, cellulosic ethanol improves the trade deficit and
lessens the dependence on foreign petroleum. By developing a low-cost enzyme
that is added directly to the fermentation, difficulties with genetically
modified fermentation organisms are avoided. This not only simplifies the
ethanol production process, but also reduces the GMO content of co-products that
may enter the food chain.
