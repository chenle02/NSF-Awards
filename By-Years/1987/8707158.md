An international workshop on Plant Development will be held in Vallombrosa,
Italy from July 20 . 23, 1987. This conference is being cosponsored by the
Italian National Research Council and the European Molecular Biology
Organization. The objectives of the workshop are to promote research in the area
of plant development by encouraging the exchange of ideas and skills between the
more traditional developmental biologists and their more molecular counterparts.
The workshop will include discussions of the induction of developmental
programs, the mechanisms of morphogenesis, the regulation of gene activity in
development, and the use of transposon.tagged mutagenesis as a means of
isolating developmental mutants. The participants including the ten invited US
participants are leading members of the scientific community, and the workshop
promises to be very productive.
