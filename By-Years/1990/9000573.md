This research addresses two discrete problems that have arisen in the automated
machinery that performs the die and wire bonding operations in microelectronic
manufacturing with very high throughput. The problems in machine design are a
result of inadequate fundamental understanding of problems in heat transfer and
metal to metal and metal to semiconductor bonding partly due to diffusion at the
material interface. The research considers each of these problems and addresses
the solution through a combined experimental program with physical/numerical
modeling. Laboratory facilities are available for the experimental research and
access to large scale computers is available for the numerical modeling.
