9614405 De Silva It is proposed to conduct a petrological and geochemical study
of the volcanic products of the little-known but potentially globally
significant 1600 A.D. eruption of Huaynaputina (southern Peru). This eruption
resulted in complete destruction of the local communities and caused a breakdown
of the socioeconomic fabric over a large area of southern Peru for over a
century. On a broader scale, the magnitude of this eruption is consistent with
previous speculative correlations with major perturbations of the environment in
the early 17th century recorded in proxy records. Specific objectives of this
study are to elucidate the nature and magnitude of the eruption, characterize
and decipher the petrological and geochemical properties of the magma, and
assess the possible global impact of the eruption. These objective will be
realized through a multi-faceted approach involving field mapping, documentation
and sampling of products, physical volcanology and bulk through microscale
petrology and geochemistry. A particular effort to evaluate the pre-eruption
volatile budget from studies of glass inclusions in phenocrysts will also be
made.
