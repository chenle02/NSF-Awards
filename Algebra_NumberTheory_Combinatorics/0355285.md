Abstract for award DMS-0355285 of Mao

This work concerns some problems in the theory of automorphic forms. The PI will
use the theory of automorphic representations to study a computational number
theory problem, and develop an algorithm for L-values based on a relation
between L-values and Fourier coefficients of half integral weight forms. The PI
and others will investigate the generalization of this relation to L-values of
automorphic forms on higher ranked groups. The PI will continue development of
the theory of relative trace formula with S. Rallis.

This research is in the area of number theory. Number theory has its historical
roots in the study of natural numbers. It is among the oldest branches of
mathematics. Within the last half century it has become an indispensible tool in
diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
communication systems.
