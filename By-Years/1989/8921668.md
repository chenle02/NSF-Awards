Numerical and analytical methods will be applied to the problem of time
dependent flows of viscoelastic fluids. The formulation will include allowance
for multiple internal relaxation times of the fluid. The method will accommodate
memory-type fluids with free surfaces. Numerical simulations of polymer
processing will be carried out with a previously developed Eulerian-Lagrangian
system. The simulations are aimed at mold filling, an inherently unsteady
process of considerable importance in the polymer processing industry.
