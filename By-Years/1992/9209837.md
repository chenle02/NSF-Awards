This is a one year cooperative study proposed by Dr. David Allara, the
Pennsylvania State University, and Professor Yu-Tai Tao, Institute of Chemistry,
Academia Sinica supported by the AUT (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science
Program. This project proposes to study the polymer chain structures at
polyethylene interface using new methods of infrared spectroscopy, x-ray excited
photoelectrons, and ion mass spectrometry. The approach is a new one using state
of the art techniques. The scheme of crystalline polymer film formation has
important applications for adhesion and surface modification. Dr. Allara is a
physical chemist and Dr. Tao of the Institute of Chemistry, Academy of Sinica,
Taiwan, has expertise in chemical synthesis. The collaboration is mutually
beneficial and the results can advance our understanding of the structures and
interactions of thin polymer interfaces.
