9401186 Borcherds This award supports research on vertex algebras, generalized
Kac-Moody algebras, quantum rings, and moonshine. Some generalized Kac-Moody
algebras can be constructed using vertex algebras; in particular the monster Lie
algebra is such an algebra and was used to prove Conway and Norton's moonshine
conjectures. There is strong evidence that there are many similar algebras and
this will be investigated. Quantum rings are a generalization of vertex algebras
which include the space of field operators of a free field theory as another
special case. This concept will be further explored by the principal
investigator. Conformal field theory is an important physical theory describing
both two-dimensional critical phenomena in condensed matter physics and
classical motions of strings in string theory. Besides its importance in
physics, the beautiful and rich mathematical structure of conformal field theory
also has interested many mathematicians. New relations between different
branches of mathematics, such as representations of infinite-dimensional Lie
algebras and groups, Riemann surfaces and algebraic curves, the Monster sporadic
group, modular functions and modular forms, elliptic genera, and knot theory, is
revealed in the study of conformal field theory.
