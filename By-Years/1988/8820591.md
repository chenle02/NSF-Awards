The underwater environment of the Antarctic dry valley lakes is an exception to
the usual paradigm concerning the light regime of planktonic microalgae. In most
ecosystems, phytoplankton experience light variability on a range of time scales
related to the vertical mixing rate. In the permanently ice-covered dry valley
lakes, it is hypothesized that a hydraulically stable water column results in
extreme constancy of light intensity and spectral quality. This project will
characterize the photophysiology of distinct phytoplankton populations in Lake
Fryxell with respect to the non-fluctuating physical regimes. The research will
examine the stability of the physical environment, habitat preferences for
distinct vertically stratified populations, time kinetics of photoadaptation,
diel rhythmicy of photosynthesis and the physiological mechanism responsible for
observed photosynthesis versus irradiance patterns. Since these populations are
relatively stable in space, they will provide a model system for studying
photoadaptation as it occurs over the growing season.
