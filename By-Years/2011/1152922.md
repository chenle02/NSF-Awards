This award by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program
supports work by Professor Richard Robinson at Cornell University - endowed to
investigate the fundamental chemical principles governing chemical
transformations of nanoparticles. The PI will investigate chemical
transformations of nanoparticles using state-of-the-art experimental methods
including a new, advanced in-situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) tool that
is designed for synchrotron studies. The proposed work will attempt to uncover
new information on bond formation kinetics, including amorphous and crystalline
contributions, dynamic changes in oxidation states, coordination chemistry, band
structure, and local structure. These experimental results will be correlated
with first-principles computations of formation energies, electronic structure,
and diffusion coefficients to build a more comprehensive understanding of
chemical transformations of nanoparticles.

The broader impact of this proposal, and the long-term goal of the proposed
work, is to establish a toolkit of post-synthetic methods for designer
nanoparticles. The proposal integrates several educational initiatives with the
research efforts. The PI will develop his national outreach efforts by
participating in new films on the hidden world of the nanoscale. The PI's local
and regional outreach efforts include mentoring graduate students through the
Sloan diversity fellows program, and incorporating undergraduates into his
research activities.
