This research will separate the information pertaining to uncertainties in
seismic hazard prediction into two groups: random information and fuzzy
information. The random information is that due to factors which are random in
nature, e.g., the earthquake sequences (random occurrence of events) and the
ground motions associated with an event. The fuzzy information is that due to
lack of information or knowledge which causes imprecision, e.g., wear
attenuation relation, mathematical model for hazard, and geological and
geotechnical site characteristics. While factors involved with the random
information can be handled by probability theory, the imprecision problems could
be handled within a fuzzy mathematical model based on the theory of fuzzy sets.
