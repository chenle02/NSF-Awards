Proposal ID: AST-0239709&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Pennsylvania State University
&lt;br/&gt;PI: Abel, Tom&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Tom Abel will use his CAREER
award at the Pennsylvania State University to directly calculate the formation
and evolution of the first stars in the universe. The primary goals are to
realistically simulate the formation of the first stars up to the zero-age main
sequence, study their impact on their host galaxies, and derive realistic
predications of observable characteristics. Novel numerical techniques,
including the addition of three-dimensional radiative transfer into a general
adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, will be developed. The numerical
techniques developed for this purpose will be applicable to a multitude of other
astrophysical problems such as the formation of Population I and II stars,
cosmological reionization, chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium,
galaxy formation, supermassive black hole formation, gamma ray burst afterglows,
and supernova remnants. All new numerical codes will be released to the
scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to his research, Dr. Abel
will continue to produce animations for the public, and develop visualizations
for students and the public that make use of state-of-the-art immersive
technology. He will also develop courses on numerical astrophysics and cosmology
that will train students to apply public N-body and radiation hydrodynamics
codes to model a variety of astrophysical phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
