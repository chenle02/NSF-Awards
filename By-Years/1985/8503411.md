This research performs experimental and analytical investigations into the
statistics of the scatter in time-to-failure data from creep rupture tests.
Available experimental data in creep rupture show considerable scatters and
variations. Mechanics research, thus far, has not quantified the nature of such
scatters or accounted for it in the design of structures. The research consists
of two parallel phases. The first phase is an experimental investigation into
the statistics of rupture in biocrystals and other simple structures. The second
phase is the construction of microstructurally-based analytical models which
will allow probablistic predictions of time-to-failure. The results of this
research will provide new and fundamental insight into the probablistic aspects
of the creep rupture process in simple crystalline structures and will help to
lay the foundations to understand the actual nature of the creep rupture of
complicated poly-crystalline structures.
