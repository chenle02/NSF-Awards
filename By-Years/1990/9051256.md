New IBM PS/2 computers are being acquired to be used primarily in three
undergraduate courses. The first course is an introductory course in atmospheric
science and includes a three hour laboratory each week. It draws large numbers
of non-technical students. The other two courses are advanced courses in
climatology and meteorology, each requiring mathematical skills at the calculus
level. The computers execute the PC-McIDAS software that has been developed
under the Unidata program and sponsored by NSF. The software takes in a wide
variety of real-time weather data, including satellite images, radar
information, conventional meteorological data and forecast information. The PC-
McIDAS is used extensively in the introductory course's laboratory sessions to
exemplify a broad class of weather phenomena, and is also available for student
special projects. In addition, other software will be adapted and written for
the introductory and the advanced courses that will assist students in 1.
developing mathematical skills, 2. understanding scientific notation, and 3.
understanding a variety of physical problems by using simple models on the
computers. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
