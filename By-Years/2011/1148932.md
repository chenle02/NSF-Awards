The objective of this project is to increase the quantity and quality of
American Indian students pursuing careers in Science, Technology, Engineering
and Mathematics by: 1) Developing and sustaining new STEM degree programs; 2)
improving STEM instructional and research methods; and 3) building student
capacity. The methods for accomplishing this objective will include: 1)
Expanding curriculum, strengthening the Natural Science degree program, and
developing an Associate in Science degree program in Natural Resources; 2)
providing professional development opportunities for STEM faculty through
workshops, conferences, and classes; and 3) increasing opportunities for student
research, internships, workforce placement, and increased global
awareness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaach Lake Tribal College will develop capacity
to transform the way math and science is viewed on the reservation by promoting
the integration of hands-on research activities and culturally infused STEM
education that will greatly contribute to increasing the number of STEM
graduates needed to meet local and national workforce demands.
