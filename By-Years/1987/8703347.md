The research develops the conceptual framework and preliminary implementation
of a technical economic model for evaluating the cost-effectiveness and economic
implications of alternative technologies. A database from an operational dynamic
input-output model of the U.S. economy, plus some new technological projections,
are used with the optimization model for the computation of several scenarios.
One objective is to introduce (a) more dynamic elements into the input-output
model, and (b) other criteria where cost-minimization is not the operational
basis for the choice among technologies. A second objective is to demonstrate
the capacity to absorb process level data effectively into the data work. At
least two scenarios are to be computed with the model, using the new data
incorporated into the existing database, to demonstrate the selection among
technologies and to analyze the underlying reasons.
