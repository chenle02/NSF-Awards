Energy stress has a profound effect on yeast metabolism and can promote aerobic
formation of ethanol with high specific productivity. Oxidoreductive metabolism
induced by elevated concentrations of glucose cuts in sooner when the cells are
further stressed by depressed levels of potassium ion. Although this opens new
approaches for ethanol with aerobic instead of anaerobic conditions, progress is
slowed by inhibition as ethanol accumulates. It cannot yet be demonstrated that
both high ethanol productivity and high concentration can be achieved. This
research uses auxostat mode of continuous culture with self-adjustment by the
organisms of their feed rate. State-of-the-art computer control stabilizes the
cultures. This work includes, 1. testing of various strains of yeast; 2.
investigate effects of energy stress on Zymomonas, a bacterium used commercially
to produce ethanol; and 3. operate with flocculating yeast to establish high
reactor cell densities. Ethanol produced by microorganisms already competes with
ethanol made from petroleum and promises to assume an expanding role in
automotive fuels. Greater productivity and a rugged aerobic process would lower
costs. Preliminary work demonstrates outstanding productivity per cell but
cannot maintain it as ethanol accumulates to inhibit the process. This is an
important, real effect, and the challenge is to extend it to commercially
relevant ranges of ethanol concentration. This research tests other yeasts and a
bacterium, Zymomonas, to exploit new insights into a region of physiology that
has had little attention. The novel computerized continuous culture apparatus
feeds the cells at a rate determined by their own metabolism. This is unique in
displaying growth rate responses to changes in conditions and leads to efficient
screening of key experimental factors.
