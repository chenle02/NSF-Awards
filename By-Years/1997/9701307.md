ABSTRACT-DMS 9701307 Semmes This project is largely concerned with notions of
"complexity", i.e., concrete measurements of how complicated a given object is.
Finite and combinatorial notions of complexity play a basic role in computer
science, but one can also see analogous ideas at play in traditional areas of
mathematics, in connection with analysis, geometry, and topology, for instance.
In the present project we take much of our inspiration from the ideas and
methods of real-variable harmonic analysis, but the structures that we consider
will be predominantly geometric in nature. In asking what is "complexity" one
should also ask what is "simplicity". Traditional mathematics offers a rich
variety of answers to both questions, and these answers are often connected to
various forms of computational efficiency. In this proposal we shall mostly be
concerned with notions of geometric or combinatorial structure in which there
are some nontrivial rules or patterns but perhaps also moderate amounts of
bending, breaking, or other disturbances. In particular, we would like to
develop new methods for identifying, measuring, and comparing forms of structure
in ways that are flexible enough to accommodate substantial distortion.
