The NSF-REU program at the Roswell Park site presents upper-division science
majors pre-graduate-school summer experiences. Participants are selected from
applicants across the United States with an emphasis on the admission of
underrepresented minority candidates and women. Selected graduate faculty
members of the Roswell Park Division of the State University of New York at
Buffalo serve as major advisors for the fifteen students admitted to the
program. The scientific field that NSF REU participants enter is in the general
area of molecular and cellular biology. Student efforts will be full-time in
scope and offer a pre-graduate research experience in the lifestyle of a
graduate student in the basic sciences. This is a key factor in a student's
decision-making process before choosing a field of study and formally applying
to graduate programs. The culmination of a 10-week laboratory experience is the
student oral presentations in a Mini-Science Conference and poster session.
Other experiences scheduled during the summer include attendance at the NSF
distinguished seminar series, a career counseling sessions, and weekend cultural
and social activities. Evaluation data demonstrate that such programs are highly
effective in encouraging students to pursue scientific careers.
