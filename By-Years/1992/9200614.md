The award provides partial support to organize and publish the proceedings of
the "Engineering Foundation Conference on Dispersion and Aggregation:
Fundamentals and Applications" (March 15-20, 1992 in Florida). The objective of
the Conference is to bring together researchers, users and equipment
manufactures from different disciplines to shear new developments in the field.
The basic principles of dispersion and aggregation are similar in paper and
pulp, paints, minerals and other industries. Outstanding university researchers
and industry representatives will have the opportunity to review the state-of-
the-art and new technology in this field.
