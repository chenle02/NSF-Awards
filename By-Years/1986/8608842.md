This award provides partial support for a week-long conference on "Choices for
Our Generation: Ethics at the Cutting Edge of Science and Technology." Selected
in a national competition, 90 outstanding students from diverse disciplines meet
with senior leaders from academia, industry, government and non-profit
organizations for small group discussions as well as general plenary sessions
with keynote addresses by nationally-known figures. The conference them focuses
attention on the ethical choices students face as they move into positions of
increasing responsibility. Applicants prepare papers on specific topics where
scientific and technological research and development affect and are affected by
these choices; these papers serve to focus the small group discussions during
the week. Publication and follow-up activities will reach university students
nationwide; the academic science, technology and society (STS) community;
science and technology practitioners and policy-makers; high school teachers;
and interested members of the general public.
