An integrated set of basic analytical and research tools is necessary to improve
laboratory education in the Environmental Science Department. This project
introduces students to techniques used in modern environmental analyses and
provides them with experience in multidisciplinary environmental problem-solving
-- essential elements of environmental science education. This project focuses
on equipment needed for standard environmental measurements on water and
sediment as well as ancillary equipment that enable students to have full use of
a recently acquired atomic absorption spectrometer. Specifically, this new
equipment enables the department to (1) offer a new, midlevel laboratory course
on environmental methods and analysis, called "Environmental Measurements"; (2)
establish facilities for student research leading to the senior thesis and other
projects; and (3) enhance the laboratory accompanying the "Introduction to
Environmental Science" course that the department currently offers. Laboratory
study focuses on local environments including the Hudson River, the North River
Sewage Treatment Plant, and Black Rock Forest.
