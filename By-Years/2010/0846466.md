Objective: The objective of this research is to develop a new class of optical
frequency metamaterials that leverage magnetic dipole transitions in Lanthanide
ions for photonic device applications.

Intellectual Merit: Recent metamaterials research has expanded the range of
materials and phenomena available for photonic devices. Whereas most
metamaterials exploit artificial magnetic resonances in lossy metallic
structures, this program explores the natural magnetic dipole transitions in
Lanthanide ions. Enhancing these quantum magnetic resonances promises to enable
the development of continuous, low-loss, isotropic metamaterials. Such
metamaterials would have direct application in the areas of nanoscale
lithography and imaging. Moreover, metamaterials incorporating Lanthanide ions
offer the intrinsic gain necessary to realize amplification in newly proposed
designs for nanoscale optical circuits and lasers.

Broader impacts: Lanthanide ions are light emitters in a board range of
technologies from fluorescent lighting and color displays to lasers and fiber-
optic amplifiers. This program leverages the societal and technological
relevance of Lanthanide materials to: (i) advance cutting-edge research in the
applied areas of optical devices and solid-state lighting, and (ii) improve the
education of students from a diverse range of ages, backgrounds and disciplines.
Specific plans include: (1) development of new interdisciplinary course on the
"Art & Science of Light"; (2) continuation of summer workshop series to promote
hands-on laboratory training; (3) expansion of SearchLight Project to raise
awareness for energy and environmental implications of lighting; (4) development
of new educational modules in collaboration with NSF-supported GK-12 "Physical
Processes in the Environment" program for the Providence Public School system.
