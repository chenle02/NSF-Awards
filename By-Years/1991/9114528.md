A program of experimental research is directed to the study of atomic and
molecular processes in intense short-pulsed radiation fields produced by multi-
gigawatt pulsed lasers with durations of 150 fsec to 100 psec. Objectives
include: (1) examination of the role of coherence in above-threshold ionization
(ATI), by utilizing novel 2-color radiation fields where the phases of the two
colors are locked together, and by creating very wide bandwidth chirped pulses
for ionization studies; (2) an attempt to observe and study novel laser-induced
molecular bound states, formed and stabilized by the intense laser field
(existence of such states was suggested by the recent discovery of bond-
softening, or above-threshold dissociation, in intense laser-molecule
interactions); and (3) a study of the interaction of atoms with single cycles of
infrared optical radiation, using recently developed technology to produce and
control coherent radiation pulses consisting of a single optical cycle.
