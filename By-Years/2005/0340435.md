This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to fabricate an
innovative multi-morph actuator. The feasibility of a micro-mirror actuating
technology that can produce a MEMS deformable mirror (DM) with unprecedented
capabilities will be researched. Conventional deformable mirrors suffer from
inadequate speed, large size, and lack of integrated control electronics. A new
actuator design should drastically reduce the power consumption for a DM, which
should increase greatly the amount of integration possible with CMOS drive
electronics. This extremely low voltage should allow the mirror segments to be
assembled onto sub-micron circuits, which drive the mirrors and include
integrated high-bandwidth position-feedback circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
unique high-force multi-morph actuator should find use in a number of MEMS
devices that are based on existing actuation technologies. This micro-mirror
technology should also be suitable a variety of other optical applications
requiring the high speed switching of micro-mirrors such as in
telecommunications and in display technology.&lt;br/&gt;
