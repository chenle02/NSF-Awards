Traditional formal theoretical analyses of spatial voting applied to large
elections have focused almost exclusively on elections in which voters make
their choices simultaneously. In many cases this is an accurate portrayal and
although voting may take place sequentially over a period of time, voters
typically make their choices without the knowledge of the choices made by those
who have voted earlier. However, there are other notable large elections in
which groups of voters make choices with knowledge of the choices made by
earlier voters in the same election. In this investigation, the researchers
focus on a particularly interesting case of sequential voting: presidential
primaries in the United States. In the presidential primary system voters in
states that have later primaries know the outcomes of the primaries in earlier
states when they make their choices. However, the nomination of the party is a
function of the votes in both early and later states. Thus, voting that
determines the nomination, because of the primary system, occurs sequentially.
In this research the investigators focus on two ways in which sequential voting
is different from simultaneous voting and the possibility that the voting
process leads to different outcomes as a consequence. First, there is the
possibility for information aggregation during the sequential voting process
that is not possible under simultaneous voting. Second, when voting is
sequential there is the unique possibility for candidates to withdraw from the
election during the voting process. The current research extends an earlier
investigation of information aggregation by examining the role of differences in
risk preferences on the voting behavior and candidate selected. The research is
then extends the theoretical model to consider the effects of candidate exit on
these factors. The research consists of experimental tests of the theoretical
predictions.
