The community ecology of hydrothermal vents has only begun to be investigated
by examinations of the physiological ecology of adaptations in component vent
biota and descriptive analyses of species occupation patterns. In Dec 1994,
these scientists initiated a project at 9√ù50' N on the East Pacific Rise to take
true advantage of the power of the deep submersible ALVIN to conduct
experimental interventions in this deep sea environment, testing hypotheses to
explain observed patterns of community development in space (zonation) and time
(succession). During 3 cruises over 13 mo, 352 basalt settlement blocks were
deployed in each of 4 zones (Tubeworm, Bivalve, Suspension feeder, and
Periphery) at 3 vents to test experimentally how recruitment patterns are
influenced by larval supply, physiological adaptations, and species
interactions. This renewal award involves transplantation and recovery of the
123 blocks still remaining on the seafloor, on which sufficient colonization and
growth will have occurred to enable the test of how biological interactions
modify development of zonation and succession patterns after the early
colonization phase. The focus will be specifically on the role of ( I )
competition for space among tubeworms (Riftia vs. Tevnia and Oasisia; and
mussels vs. Riftia), (2) suppression of larval colonization by adult mussels,
(3) predation by crabs and fishes in mediating interactions between competing
guilds (grazing gastropods vs. sessile space occupiers), and (4) historical
faunal occupation in repressing community change as venting fluxes wax or wane.
Analysis of how different biological interactions influence community
development along the environmental stress gradient with distance from venting
source has fundamental ecological significance because the spatial gradients in
physiological stress and environmental productivity in vents are confounded in
the opposite way from the rocky intertidal and virtually all other communities
from which comes our present understanding of how biological interactions vary
along environmental stress gradients. The project will also address whether
larval settlement is altered by the species composition and cover of pre
existing biota, a theme specific to objectives of the RIDGE LARVE (Larvae At
Ridge VEnts) Project and fundamental to the Temporal Variability component of
RIDGE.
