This award supports a Science Coordination Office for Astrophysical Research in
Antarctica (SCOARA) to facilitate an intellectual partnership between the NSF
and scientific community with the goal of achieving maximum quality and
efficiency for the support of astrophysical research at the U.S. Amundsen-Scott
South Pole Station. Funds are provided only to facilitate the coordination
outlined below, maintain shared scientific equipment, and operate the machine
shop to meet the needs of the science projects and the station. No funds are
provided for activities that are covered by the individual investigator grants.
The SCOARA, comprised of principal investigators involved in cosmology and
astrophysics projects at the station, will enable the scientists to work
together for: (a) providing community organization, coordination, and expert
sharing of scientific support for approved South Pole Dark Sector science
projects, (b) outfitting and staffing the shared Dark Sector machine shop, (c)
keeping the shared scientific equipment at the Pole in good working order, (d)
providing expert science winterover support shared among the projects, (e)
conducting weekly teleconferences for Principal Investigators or their designees
to address on-going and emerging issues related to the science projects at the
Pole, and (f) educating, organizing, and coordinating the community in response
to discussions about the limited support resources at the South Pole. With
respect to the broader impacts, the proposed Science Coordination Office will
focus on fostering, amongst the community, the goal of maintaining worldwide
leadership, at the cutting edge of modern science, of the U.S. Antarctic
astronomy and astrophysics programs. SCOARA will have an impact on understanding
how the worldwide astronomical community might expand observations to sites in
Antarctica where observing conditions might be even better than at South Pole.
In addition, SCOARA would make it easier for new astrophysics projects (e.g.,
projects that receive new funding from NSF) to begin their operations at South
Pole. This will be especially useful for smaller projects that are often
associated with younger investigators. Finally, SCOARA also has obvious
advantages for addressing education and public outreach issues, being better
suited to organize outreach around a common theme relative to the efforts that
individual projects could make separately.&lt;br/&gt;
