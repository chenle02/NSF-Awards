9729405 Whitesides The research undertaken is composed of two parts: new
materials and methods of fabrication will broaden the range of capabilities in
MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) design, providing new capabilities and
offering systems which are easier to manufacture and are more cost-effective, in
comparison with traditional Si-based micromachining. This portion of the project
focuses upon the demonstration of the value of new classes of materials
(especially organic polymers) and on new methods of fabrication (especially
microprinting, micromolding and related techniques). The second part of the
effort will focus on the development of pumps, valves and fluidic couplers in
polymeric materials to exploit their lack of mechanical rigidity, on the
development of surface modification techniques to avoid clogging and surface
contamination, and on techniques for rapid prototyping of microfluidic systems
in plastics, glasses and silicon/silicon dioxide. ***
