1. Optical emissions from photoexcitation of atmospheric radicals and molecules
in the gas phase. Ultraviolet light is used to excite fluorescent radiation from
atmospheric gases or from free radicals produced by photofragmentation of
atmospheric gases. Measurements of the cross sections ("efficiencies," in a
sense) for the corresponding optical absorptions and fluorescences, along with
associated spectroscopic data, can be used for designing detection techniques
and for monitoring the rates of chemical reactions of these radicals or
molecules. 2. Optical characteristics and formation processes of aerosols
studied by ultraviolet excitation . This is a study of gas molecules adsorbed on
the surfaces of experimentally generated aerosol particles. Ultraviolet light is
used to excite fluorescent spectra both for detection of the adsorbed species
and for studying their chemical behavior in the adsorbed state. The general
objective is to advance the understanding of the heterogeneous chemistry of the
atmosphere, i.e., chemistry involving interactions between the atmospheric gases
and particulate matter.
