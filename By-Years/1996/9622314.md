This award will provide funding for networking and computing equipment that
will be dedicated to support research in engineering. Equipment includes
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) hardware (three switches along with the
appropriate set of workstation network interface cards), as well as computer
workstations. This hardware will enable researchers to establish an ATM-based
cluster computing platform on an isolated subnet of the university network. A
laboratory will be developed for the study of cluster-based computing and its
application to multidisciplinary design problems. The equipment will be used for
collaborative research projects that will contribute to the advancement and
expansion of the knowledge and technology based in the emerging area of
Integration Engineering (IE), particularly with respect to development of ATM-
based cluster networking strategies for Concurrent Design. ATM is becoming the
defacto standard for multimedia communications for Wide Area Networks and will
be crucial for the success of the Information Superhighway. The ATM-based
cluster computing platform will create an industrial microcosm in which
integrated, concurrent engineering design strategies and unique networking
protocols will be developed and tested. This laboratory will be used for: (1)
development of an ATM-based networking framework for Integrated Design that
supports Collaborative Design and Decision-making; (2) development of design
strategies to reduce integrated system complexities (system reduction
strategies); (3) development and testing of decomposition-based strategies that
accommodate discrete as well as continuous variables for optimal system design;
(4) improvement of infrastructure modularity through incorporation of embedded
expert systems capabilities; (5) implementation and verification of transport
and network level protocols for the IE environment; and (6) further development
and testing of the design strategies and communication protocols for industry
applications.
