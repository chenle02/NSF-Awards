1144025&lt;br/&gt;Perelman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of this
EAGER project is to develop a safe and relatively inexpensive multispectral
molecular sensing optical technique based on Spatially Offset Diffuse
Reflectance Spectroscopy (SODRS), capable of non-invasive, reliable detection of
brown fat and measurement of its mass and metabolic activity in humans. Until
recently it was believed that adults did not have brown fat and only recent
studies performed at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Joslin
Diabetes Center (JDC), Harvard Medical School and at the University of
Maastricht, Netherlands show that more than half of adult men and women may have
enough brown fat in their bodies to burn off substantial amounts of white fat
responsible for obesity. The studies also suggest that brown fat can play an
important positive role, since obese people and people with high blood sugar
have less brown fat than lean people and people with normal blood sugar. If
indeed brown fat is common in adults, then finding ways to promote its
activation could provide an important paradigm for preventing or treating
obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. During the proposed one year
EAGER pilot project they will develop and build a prototype SODRS molecular
sensing instrument capable of detecting brown fat through approximately 1 cm of
superficial tissue in humans.
