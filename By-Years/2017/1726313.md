This award provides support for the Young Professionals Forum at the 12th
Pacific Rim Conference on Ceramic and Glass Technology (PACRIM 12), held in
conjunction with the Glass & Optical Materials Division Meeting (GOMD 2017),
Waikoloa, Hawaii, 21-26 May 2017. The focus of this symposium is on recent
societal challenges affecting Ceramic and Glass Technology, including but not
limited to energy, health, and environmental aspects. This symposium will bring
together young researchers and scientists from the Pacific Rim to discuss new
approaches and challenges in materials synthesis and to provide a platform for
intensive exchange of ideas, knowledge, and networking.

The award supports participation in the Young Professionals Forum of early
career scientists as well as students. The PIs will seek to encourage
participation by attendees from underrepresented groups, in particular. The
program supports the exchange of scientific information and knowledge in the
technical sessions through oral and poster presentations.
