Funds are requested for three years to continue a survey of parasites of
mammals of Bolivia begun in 1984. Collections will concentrate on parasitic
nematodes but will include other helminths, ectoparasites, and protozoa.
Specimens representative of various taxa will be collected and preserved using
standard methods. Collections will include formalin-preserved alcohol- stored
specimens for standard morpho-taxonomy and identification and frozen specimens
for molecular analyses. The primary objectives of the proposed research include:
1) Secure data (specimens) for both morphologic (taxonomy) and molecular
analysis (systematics) that would otherwise be lost or not be preserved
adequately for these analyses; 2) Obtain additional materials and data for
comparison and inclusion in ongoing studies of host- parasite coevolution; 3)
Continue collaboration with workers and students in Bolivia on studies of the
parasite fauna of Bolivia and to encourage Bolivian students to study in the
USA; 4) Provide access to researchers interested in parasites of neotropical
mammals by processing and accessing into the UCD Nematode Collection those
samples of Helminths collected in Bolivia since 1984; 5) Enter these data into
the micro-computer database of the UCD Nematode Collection in a form compatible
with the GIS system presently being implemented at the American Museum to allow
fast and easy access to information on parasites and their hosts. The diversity
of the mammalian fauna of Bolivia is poorly known; thus, the parasites of this
region are even less will known (eg. less than 30 references exist concerning
parasites of wild animals of Bolivia). Funds are requested at this time for work
on the parasites of mammals in Bolivia partly because of the window of
opportunity afforded by the presently funded NSF grant to Anderson, Yates, and
Cook (BSR-8408923) for continuation of their survey of the mammalian fauna of
Bolivia in the Valles and Yungas regions. These researchers have established a
protocol of time- frames and collection areas. The areas in which the expedition
will travel are biologically unknown, and funding of this proposal will allow
unique and irreplaceable data on diversity of parasites of these mammals to be
accumulated, processed, stored, and accessed in an efficient manner. In
addition, inclusion of material obtained from geographic areas that were not
visited in 1984-1987 will allow further tests of hypotheses of coevolution and
zoogeography.
