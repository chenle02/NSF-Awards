Many structures (buildings, bridges,....) are supported on deep foundations such
as driven piles. In some types of structures the piles are driven at small
horizontal spacings and are subjected to horizontal loadings. Examples of such
structures include offshore oil production platforms and bridges subjected to
lateral loads from wind and ocean currents. No reliable design method exists for
such cases and, as a result, the designs currently used are probably
conservative in most cases, i.e., larger than necessary amounts of money are
spent to ensure that failure does not occur. The level of uncertainty is such,
however, that excessive movements sometimes occur and lead to distress in the
structure that is supported on the piles. Recently, several series of full scale
lateral load tests were performed using pile groups so that reliable information
is now available to use as a check on the accuracy of analyses. This project
involves the first attempt at a full-scale numerical analysis in three
dimensions, of pile groups, using the socalled finite element technique. It
should provide a level of insight not previously possible. It may provide a
design tool for major foundations and data to be used in simplified analyses for
less complex cases.
