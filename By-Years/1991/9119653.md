Technical Narrative: This proposed conference, organized by the American
Institute for Maghrib Studies, the University of Tlemcen, Algeria, and Mohammed
V University, Morocco, is scheduled for 21-26 June 1992 in Oran, Algeria. The
conference objectives are to raise awareness of current environmental problems
in North Africa; to identify the most critical problems and stimulate further
research on these problems; to elucidate their causes and consequences; and to
explore ways to mitigate or resolve these problems. A multidisciplinary series
of presentations is planned by twenty-four scientists from the United States,
Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia who will present their research results. Papers
presented at the conference will subsequently be published in French and
English. This conference on environmental problems in North Africa fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
in the United States and North Africa to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
