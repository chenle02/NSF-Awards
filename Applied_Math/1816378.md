Space-time phenomena as varied as turbulence, phase-field dynamics, surface
growth, neuronal activity, population dynamics, and interest rate fluctuations
are modelled by stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE). In comparison
with partial differential equations (PDE), SPDEs are advantageous because they
allow modelers to explicitly incorporate space-time randomness and capture the
effect of random fluctuations inherent to systems with many degrees of freedom.
However, they are trickier to numerically solve than PDEs and require new
specialized techniques. Indeed, since SPDE solutions are very rough,
straightforward adaptations of numerical PDE methods often lead to
approximations that do not accurately represent the behaviors of the actual
solutions. To address this issue, the project develops a new numerical method,
called Spectrwm [spek-trum] (signifying spectral random walk method), that is
tailored specifically to SPDEs. REU students are included in the work of the
project.

Spectrwm is a family of Markov jump process approximations for SPDEs. As such,
these approximations can be viewed as infinite-dimensional analogues of random
walk methods for Brownian motion. Aside from their mathematical interest, these
methods address in a natural way several issues encountered when simulating
SPDEs, including long-time simulation, accurately representing the effect of
multiplicative noise, and approximation of their path-dependent expected values.
by suitably constructing them, Spectrwm is faithful to the domain of their
solution. The investigator and his collaborators aim to use probabilistic
techniques to quantitatively understand the finite- and long-time behavior of
Spectrwm methods for well-posed SPDEs with reflecting boundary conditions, and
to develop accelerated variants of Spectrwm methods for a wider range of SPDE
problems, including ones that are classically ill-posed or where the operators
of the underlying processes are not well understood. As a major byproduct, the
project lends insight into SPDEs themselves: the nature of the Kolmogorov
equations associated to SPDEs, the influence of boundaries on SPDE solutions,
metastability in SPDE solutions, and renormalizations for classically ill-posed
SPDEs. REU students are included in the work of the project.
