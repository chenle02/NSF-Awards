9352537 Shikha This project allows the incorporation of computer-based
instruction in economics, with emphasis in economic statistics. Specific goals
include hands-on experiences for undergraduate students in the field of
statistical methods, different statistical packages, development and maintenance
of an economics data base, and incorporation of different simulation techniques
and case scenarios in the analysis of basic economic principles. The project is
expected to upgrade the course content in introductory economics and statistical
methods, introduce students to different statistical and software packages, and
help them become better prepared for higher academic or professional careers.
Students are also able to use the computer lab for empirical research and
analyses, and the use of computers is being extended to other courses in
economics.
