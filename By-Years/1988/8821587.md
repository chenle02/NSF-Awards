Dr. William Glen, who is undertaking this project under the direction of Dr.
Weart, is continuing his study, supported under previous NSF grants, of a series
of current interdisciplinary debates that were prompted by the discovery of
chemical evidence suggesting a meteorite impact at the time of mass extinction
in the fossil record 65 million years ago. Such extinctions, subsequently
postulated as periodic, were explained by three new alternative astronomical
hypotheses, all designed to cyclically shower the earth with comets. A number of
additional hypotheses have also been advanced that address various aspects of
the biosphere, atmosphere, and lithosphere bearing on mass extinctions. Dr. Glen
has produced a stage-specific data base including a large number of oral history
interviews of the participants of the debates over the development of these
competing theories. These interviews and other documentary data have aided in
understanding how perceptions form and alter as arguments evolve. They also
serve in assessing various models of science and have lent themselves to the
analysis and taxonomy of the upheaval resulting from these debates. The
interviewing and collecting of primary historical materials has been essentially
completed. Dr. Glen is currently completing a major survey of members of 9
professional societies related to the theories under debate. Under this grant,
he is analyzing the data he has collected to date, conducting a few focussed
followup interviews, examining the "pre-history" of these debates, and preparing
a final study of this history. These results, when published, will provide major
source material for the history, philosophy and social science of science.
