NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY Phillips, John IBN-9507826 Dr. Phillips' research will
investigate the use of the earth's magnetic field to determine geographic
position. Previous studies of migratory/homing orientation have provided
evidence for the involvement of a specialized magnetoreception mechanism in the
"map" component of homing, and for effects of small changes in magnetic
inclination or intensity on migratory/homing orientation. Studies of map-based
homing (i.e., true navigation) will be carried out under controlled laboratory
conditions where the response to manipulation of individual parameters of the
magnetic field can be investigated. Two forms of orientation that involve the
earth's magnetic field will be studied, i.e., magnetic compass orientation
(requiring only compass information) and long-distance homing or true navigation
(requiring both map and compass information). This will make it possible to
distinguish effects of experimental manipulations on the map or geographic-
position sense from effects on the compass. In addition, a graphical model of
bicoordinate navigation developed for this work will be used to estimate the
local gradients of magnetic field parameters in the vicinity of the animal's
home from their behavioral responses to experimental manipulation of these
parameters. These estimates can then be compared with future measured values of
geographic variation in the magnetic field. Dr. Phillips' research will provide
information about the sensitivity of biological systems to weak magnetic fields
which will contribute to the current debate concerning possible effects of
artificial sources of EMF (power lines, electrical appliances, etc.) on human
health.
