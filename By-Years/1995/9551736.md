The Mechanical Engineering Laboratory at the university has the primary
responsibility for introducing mechanical engineering undergraduates (nearly 55
percent all engineering majors) to the measurement and analysis of physical
properties. This one semester laboratory is a hands-on experience. It offers
each of the undergraduates an extensive exposure to basic issues of measurement
and experiment in the areas of dynamics, fluid mechanics, statics, and
thermodynamics. While it is imperative that students continue to be directly
familiar with the fundamental aspects of mechanical measurements, it is believed
that more needs to be done to educate them for the current state of
experimentation in industry and academia. This project augments the Mechanical
Engineering Laboratory structure with the following equipment: motion sensors
and signal conditioners, power supplies, oscilloscopes, data acquisition boards,
IBM-compatible 486 personal computers, and data analysis software.
