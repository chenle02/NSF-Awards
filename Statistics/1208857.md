This project is focused on structured high dimensional regression with the term
structure meant to distinguish the methods from other methods such as l1
minimization methods. Generally speaking, this structure is assumed a priori and
is chosen on the basis of finding an interpretable solution to a regression
problem. In this project, structure often refers to spatial structure found in
areas of application such as neuroimaging or astronomical data. The project has
two principal goals. First to develop scalable, flexible algorithms and software
implementations for fitting such structured models. Secondly, to understand the
statistical performance of such models as well as the algorithms used to fit
such models.

The results of the research proposed in this project will allow researcher in
the field of neuroscience to improve neuroscientists' ability to predict
behavior based on fMRI or other spatio-temporally structured data.
