Evolved stars of masses similar or slightly greater than that of the sun evolve
through the so-called red giant region. They are cool, luminous stars, and they
lose mass via strong stellar winds. The winds form circumstellar shells of gas
and dust, known as planetary nebulae. The Principal Investigator proposes to
study this kind of mass loss and the formation of planetary nebulae. Both
observations and theory will be part of this work. The emphasis will be on the
physics and chemistry of the mass loss process.
