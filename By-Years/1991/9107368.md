The topology of simply-connected algebraic surfaces and other smooth
4-manifolds will be studied. Questions such as the following will be addressed:
How do algebraic surfaces behave under connected sum? Which 4-manifolds are sums
of algebraic surfaces? How can Donaldson's invariants be defined topologically?
These are all questions at the forefront of research in four-dimensional
manifold theory. A manifold is a very natural geometric object, being locally
like Euclidean space, although globally more highly connected. Since the space
of general reativity theory is a four-dimensional manifold, questions such as
these may even have cosmological significance.
