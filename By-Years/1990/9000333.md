In the summer of 1988 the principal investigator measured microseismicity in
and near the hydrothermal vent field of the Endeavor segment of the Juan de Fuca
Ridge. A very surprising result was the large number (hundreds) of seismic
events that were observed. The principal investigator thinks he has made the
first observation of long duration tremor associated with a submarine
hydrothermal field. The large number and unusual nature of these events make
this data set unique. The principal investigator will: 1) construct a number-of-
events vs. relative magnitude curve for as many events as possible; 2)
characterize the spectra of the events; and 3) analyze the time variability of
the events and compare with high-frequency data from near an active hydrothermal
chimney.
