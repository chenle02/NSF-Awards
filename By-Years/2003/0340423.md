This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project involves direct
measurements aloft of aerosol light absorption in the visible range (678 nm)
using a novel photoacoustic (PA) instrument during the Coastal STRatocumulus
Imposed Perturbation Experiment (C-STRIPE). Airborne measurements for C-STRIPE
will be made from the Office of Naval Research Center for Interdisciplinary
Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (ONR/CIRPAS) Twin Otter research aircraft over
three weeks in July 2003 off the coast of Monterey, California. Flights will
also be performed over the heavily polluted San Joaquin Valley, California
continental area to examine black carbon emanating from smoke and
urban/industrial plumes. By addition of this new capability to the C-STRIPE
airborne instrument suite the P.I. will provide a unique qualitative measurement
of aerosol light absorption aloft to assess aerosol-cloud interactions in terms
of radiative forcing and cloud dynamics. An important airborne intercomparison
experiment will also be conducted between this PA instrument and two other
distinct techniques for measuring ambient atmospheric light absorption due to
aerosols. Results from this study should increase understanding of climate
forcing by aerosol impacts on radiative forcing in haze and/or cloud layers -
major uncertainties currently limiting the representativeness of global climate
models.
