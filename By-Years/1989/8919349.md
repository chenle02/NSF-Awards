The International Symposium on Affinity Chromatography and Biological
Recognition represents the biennial convocation of investigators in the area of
affinity chromatography and related fields. This is an area that has assumed
increasing importance with the advent of recombinant DNA and other advanced
biotechnology techniques. The purpose of the meeting is to allow the leaders of
the field, along with many new investigators who have just entered the area, the
opportunity to exchange information in both a formal and informal way. This
interchange has resulted in many important collaborative projects and the
symposium now represents the premier meeting on this subject. The results of the
meeting will be published in a symposium issue of The Journal of Chromatography.
