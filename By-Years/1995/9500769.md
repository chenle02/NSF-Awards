This award supports work in geometric group theory. The principal investigator
will continue to study groups as geometric objects and to extend these ideas to
handle geometric questions involving pairs consisting of a group and a subgroup.
In particular, he will determine the structure of finitely presented subgroups
of a hyperbolic group. He will also study the quasi-isometry types of various
groups. A group is an algebraic object having a multiplication defined on it.
Groups can have an infinite number of elements or a finite number of elements.
In the case of infinite groups, they are often studied by associating with them
finite objects of some type. In the case of this award, the central them has
been to consider a finitely generated group as a geometric object through its
Cayley graph. This work has connections to several areas of mathematics, as well
as computer science.
