This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2003.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "The role of actin-microtubule
interactions in cell motility." All of the molecules mediating microtubule-actin
interactions and how they are regulated are largely unknown. This research
project is identifying proteins that can simultaneously crosslink microtubules
and F-actin and characterizing their role in cell locomotion, which is essential
for understanding the mechanisms underlying critical biological processes such
as embryogenesis, developmental growth, and tissue repair and maintenance.
