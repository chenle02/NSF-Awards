This is a 3-year observation and modeling research project aimed at
characterizing incident, energetic protons from ground-based wide-field
spectroscopic observations of H emissions, the so-called proton aurora. The
modeling effort will combine a comprehensive proton transport code with a
radiative transfer model to assess the contamination of H Balmer Doppler
profiles from nearby proton aurora. Two high resolution (&lt; 0.1 nm) imaging
spectrographs (CESAR and HiTIES) will be deployed, first at Poker Flat and then
separated by 325 km, and data from these will be combined with measurements from
the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) as well as from the PFISR
facility spectrograph to verify the theoretical predictions. This will allow for
accurate derivation of mean energy and energy flux of the incoming protons from
the H Doppler profiles and this result will be validated with complementary
radio and space-based observations. The improved analysis technique will be
employed, specifically, to quantify the energy changes of the incoming protons
during active times such as during substorms. The research project will be
mainly conducted by postdoctoral fellow in collaboration with and under the
guidance of an international team of senior scientists with a broad range of
expertise. An interdisciplinary team of modelers and experimentalists from
several institutions in the United States and the United Kingdom will work
together on this project.
