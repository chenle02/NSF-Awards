Modern localization systems such as the Global Positioning System have widely
demonstrated vulnerabilities to signal-spoofing and jamming attacks. With the
advent of autonomous cyber-physical systems such as self-driving cars and
unmanned aerial vehicles, the ability to securely estimate, track and verify
one's location is increasingly critical, indicative of a strong need to realize
localization systems that are resilient to modern day cyber-physical attacks.
This project pursues this vision by evaluating and understanding the bottlenecks
in realizing a secure wide-area localization system, and offering solutions to
overcome them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop methods to enhance
the security of existing localization systems with both near- and long-term
deployment strategies. The project seeks to design several attack detection and
mitigation techniques that can be implemented on currently deployed devices
without requiring significant modifications to existing infrastructure. The
project will also develop novel technologies that leverage and build robust
recovery mechanisms using a combination of advanced signal processing, machine
learning, and sensor fusion techniques. Holistic experimental evaluations of
cyber-physical attacks against popular localization systems and their fail-safe
technologies will likewise be conducted, alongside the evaluation of location
spoofing attacks across geographic areas and networks due to the
interdependencies and retroactions of today's networked systems. The project
will explore the tension that exists between building a wide-area localization
system that is both scalable and secure, thereby laying a foundation for future
research in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
