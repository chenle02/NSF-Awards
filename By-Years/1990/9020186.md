This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
studying the impact of deforestation on nutrition and health of households in
Nepal. The project will measure the health and nutritional status of
reproductively active women, pre-adolescent girls, preschool children and
infants in a controlled comparison of two groups: one living in a heavily
forested, and one in a deforested area. Methodologies include women's health
interviews, anthropometric measurements, food frequency and forest food
checklists, observations of women's forest gathering, and key informant
interviews. The main contributions include assessing the dietary importance of
forest products and looking at cultural pattern of intrafamilial household food
distribution. This research is important because it will produce knowledge of
the dietary importance of wild forest foods that will complement our knowledge
of cultivated food use. This information will be useful to planners of
reforestation projects as well as economic development planners.
