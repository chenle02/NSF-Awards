9313946 Balakrishnan Artificial neural network based controllers for nonlinear
systems will be studied int he project. Two main objectives of this project are
to formulate neural network controllers based on adaptive critic designs and
stochastic representations of uncertain nonlinear systems. Hamiltonian and its
derivatives which occur in the formulation of optimal control problems are
proposed in the adaptive critic design. A constant network configuration
controller and an online-modified network configuration controllers are proposed
based on neighboring optimal control theory. The stochastic representations of a
plant are proposed to be based on filtering theory. Furthermore, classes of
problems are described on which these network controllers are proposed to be
investigated. It is hoped that the results of this study will substantially
improve understanding of the adaptive critic based neuro controllers and the
stochastic neural network representations of uncertain nonlinear systems. ***
