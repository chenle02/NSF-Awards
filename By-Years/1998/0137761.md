Fellows: Data Mining Algorithms for Business Intensive
Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal, framing business intelligence
applications as concrete theoretical problems, develops data mining techniques
for applications in customer management, wireless mining, and product
affinities. The work, studying clustering measures, alternate embedding
techniques, and computational complexity, involves designing computationally
efficient algorithms that find approximately good answers. The scalability and
I/O efficiency of proposed algorithms will also be studied. Two problems are
mentioned for: (1)Identifying wireless communities and product affinities: the
Maximum Edge Bi-clique problem and&lt;br/&gt;(2) Customer segmentation, text
clustering, new clustering measures that combine inter and intra distances:
&lt;br/&gt;the Conjunctive Clustering problem. The algorithms can be applied to
various areas, including e-commerce. Results from this work are expected to
impact (3) Customer relationship management by segmenting the customer
population to target marketing programs more effectively and (4)Cell phone usage
data to enable wireless companies to discover patterns in wireless
access.&lt;br/&gt;
