0117886 Lea/Abstract

Funds are provided for the PI to continue his work on linked Mg/Ca
paleothermometry and Delta 0-18 in planktic foraminifera to further the
understanding of climate variability in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans on
millennial and orbital time scales using four cores from Ceara Rise, Cariaco
Basin, Galapagos Platform and Carnegie Ridge. The PI will deconvolve the
temperature and salinity paleorecords in the tropical western Atlantic and
eastern Pacific by measuring the Mg/Ca and d18-0 in foraminifera from these four
sites. The PI also hopes that the results of the proposed research will enable
him to address issues related to the Pacific-Atlantic salinity differences on
millennial. and orbital time scales.
