9305053 Moyer The State System of Higher Education (SSHE) of Pennsylvania on
behalf of its member institutions, proposes to connect the 14 System
Universities (at 22 sites) to the Pennsylvania Research and Economic Partnership
Network (PREPnet). Since it is not economically feasible to individually connect
each site to PREPnet, the sites must first be connected as a single entity to
gateway to PREPnet. PREPnet will in turn provide access to NSFNET, the Internet,
and other national networks. The educational institutions that will participate
include: Bloomsburg University, California University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney
Univ., Clarion Univ., East Stroudsburg Univ. Edinboro Univ., Indiana Univ. of
Pennsylvania, Kutztown Univ., Loch Haven Univ., Mansfield Univ., Millersville
Univ., Shippensburg Univ., Slippery Rock Univ., and West Chester Univ.. The
network will provide a consistent statewide architecture for NSFNET access for a
broad variety of entities engaged in education and research. This cooperative
network will provide gateways to regional, national, and international networks
and will be consistent with their standards. It will further the institutions'
work in enhancing the state's economic development through a well-educated
workforce, accessible training opportunities, and research and development
partnerships. Another goal of the network is to facilitate collaborative
projects and sharing of resources between institutions, including those outside
the state. The universities need greater functionality and network speed to be
able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with
being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty
research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the
schools to explore innovative educational resources. ***
