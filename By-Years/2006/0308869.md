The introduction of chemical means of eradicating pest species intensified
agricultural production, but at the cost of rapid evolution of resistant
organisms. Our observation of the evolution of novel tolerance to the herbicide
RoundUp. In the common morning glory, Ipomoea purpurea, provides an excellent
example of human-mediated evolution. We have evidence from a preliminary
greenhouse study that there is genetic variation among maternal lines of Ipomoea
purpurea for tolerance to RoundUp. We will further investigate the evolution of
this trait by studying the genetic control of herbicide tolerance and the
potential constraints on its evolution. The experiments will examine how
tolerance is inherited by performing greenhouse crosses and subsequent progeny
analyses. The potential for constraints on the evolution of tolerance will be
investigated by comparing relative fitness of herbicide tolerant and susceptible
individuals in the absence of herbicide in the field. The broader impacts of
this study are manifest to U.S. agriculture. Since use of RoundUp is increasing
markedly, it is critical that evolutionary analyses of its use be completed. An
understanding of the genetic basis and fitness costs of tolerance to this
herbicide will be of broad importance.
