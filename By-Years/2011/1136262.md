Building on a successful S-STEM scholarship program, called MOSAIC, St. Joseph's
College is expanding its well-regarded teacher training program through a Noyce
Scholarship project entitled "STEM EMPOWERS." In this program, first- and
second-year students carry out education-related internships at various local
science-related institutions or in on-campus outreach programs. In their junior
and senior years students compete for a Noyce Scholarship in a program that
includes teacher preparation as they complete their STEM majors. Experienced
STEM professionals who are seeking to change to a teaching career are also
supported as they seek a Masters in Mathematics Education degree. These 26 new
teachers seek employment as science or mathematics teachers in local high
schools in high-need school districts. Since St. Joseph's college attracts a
large number of women and students generally underrepresented in STEM
disciplines, the new teachers can serve as positive role models to their
students while effectively educating them in STEM subjects.
