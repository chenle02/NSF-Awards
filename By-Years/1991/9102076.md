This is an SGER proposal concerned with the laser-assisted deposition of
diamond. The P.I. proposes to deposit diamond from gas mixtures containing CO by
use of a dual laser system. A short wavelength CO laser will cause vibrational
excitement of the CO. Ohio State has one of the four short wavelength CO lasers
in the world. A second, ArF laser will promote photolytic decomposition. If
successful, the technique could lead to development of a clean, high rate and
controllable diamond deposition process using far lower temperatures than other
processes.
