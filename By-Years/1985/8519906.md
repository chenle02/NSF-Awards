Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMPVPE) and polypropylene (UHMWPP)
polymer gel fibers, if properly oriented, can yield good mechanical properties
comparable to some of the strongest materials such as steels and carbon fibers.
The gel UHMWPE fibers show high strength in the longitudinal direction but their
strength in the lateral direction is somewhat limited. To improve dimensional
stability and achieve uniform mechanical strength, a combination of biaxial
orientation and cross-linking of the fibers is underway. This fundamental,
experimental study, when completed, is expected to find a broader use of gel
UHMWPE fibers in aerospace and marine applications.
