The objective of the proposed research is to develop a system for calculating
velocity flow fields of mesoscale features in the ocean. The proposal is an
innovative approach to satellite data analysis, and potential commercial
application of the proposed technique is very good. The proposed research will
use temperature data from NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
(AVHRR) and an automated analysis system to track mesoscale oceanographic
features, such as eddies, and to calculate flow velocities. This system
potentially will be of great interest to the shipping industry, the offshore oil
industry and to future weather forecasting systems.
