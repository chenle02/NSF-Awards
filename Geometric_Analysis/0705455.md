The PI, Christopher Bishop, will study problems in two and three dimensional
geometry which come from classical complex analysis, the theory of
quasiconformal mappings, hyperbolic geometry and computational geometry, with a
particular emphasis on interactions between these areas. In recent work the PI
has shown that ideas from hyperbolic and computational geometry could help
resolve a question of classical analysis: how to efficiently compute conformal
maps onto planar domains. This work will be extended to new settings, and will
be used to study problems arising in computational geometry, e.g., efficient
generation of meshes with desirable properties. The PI will investigate the
possible application of the carpenter's rule problem from computational geometry
to an analysis problem about deforming chord-arc curves. He will also continue
his work on the distortion properties of quasiconformal mappings and on the
conformal welding problem.

The PI, Christopher Bishop, will continue his investigations into the theory
and computation of conformal and quasiconformal maps. Conformal maps send one
region to another so that angles (but not necessarily distances) are preserved.
Quasiconformal maps may distort angles, but only by a limited amount. One of the
oldest and most famous examples is the Mercator projection which maps the
spherical Earth to flat piece of paper. This can't be done without some sort of
distortion, and for navigation it is more convenient to have angles preserved
than distances (so looking at a chart you know the correct direction to head, if
not the exact distance to be covered). Conformal maps also appear in many
applications where one wants to transfer a problem from a domain with
complicated geometry to a simpler one (such as a disk) where it is easier to
solve. Examples come from aerodynamics, fluid flow, vibrating membranes, heat
flow, electrostatics and many other problems. Conformal maps also play a
fundamental role within pure mathematics in areas such as dynamics, complex
analysis, probability and geometry. Because of their importance, there are
numerous techniques for computing conformal maps numerically, but different
methods work best in different situations and often a method fails for
sufficiently complicated regions. The PI has developed an algorithm that is
guaranteed to work for a large class of regions, and is able to estimate the
time needed to achieve a given accuracy. The algorithm is based on new
connections between geometric concepts from computer science and non-Euclidean
geometry arising in pure mathematics. Under the current proposal the PI will
seek to turn this theoretical algorithm into a practical method, investigate
generalizations more complicated regions and to higher dimensions, and apply the
method to problems arising from computer science.
