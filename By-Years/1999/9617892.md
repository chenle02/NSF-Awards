9617892 Harvey The use of molecular organic markers has provided valuable
information on a wide range of inputs and processes which occur in the worlds
oceans and sediments. What is often absent from these observations, is
quantitative information on the relationship of biological processing in the
water column and sediments to the molecular signal which is ultimately preserved
in the geological record. Such information may be particularly important for the
long chain alkenones, a group of compounds present in several species of oceanic
and coastal prymnesiophyte algae which are now being widely used to detail both
recent and historical records of sea surface temperature. Recent disparities in
temperature predictions and isotopic signature have been observed, yet no
mechanistic information is available on the alkenones and related lipids after
initial cellular biosynthesis to document diagenetic effects. This work will
focus on the two major routes for the alteration of alkenones, alkenes and alkyl
alkenoates in marine systems: zooplankton grazing and microbially mediated
processes. The project will provide fundamental information on the synthesis and
fate of the alkenones and related lipids in the marine water column and surface
sediments and validate the potential for these compounds or their degradation
products to provide a quantitative measure of sea surface temperature in present
and past oceans. ***
