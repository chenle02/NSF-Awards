The BOREXINO collaboration proposes the construction of a real time liquid
scintillator detector for the detection of low energy neutrinos including the
monoenergetic Be-7 source at 0.86 MeV. The proposed detector would utilize an
active volume of 100 tons of ultra-pure liquid scintillator contained within an
ultra pure nylon inner vessel surrounded by a water shield and viewed by 1650
photomultiplier tubes. The project is proposed by an international collaboration
from USA, Italy, Germany and Russia. It will be sited in the Laboratori
Nationali Gran Sasso, an international underground particle physics laboratory
in Italy. The project is approved for siting in the Gran Sasso Lab contingent on
a demonstration, the Counting Test Facility (CTF), is currently under
construction and should begin operation later this year with results expected
beginning in early 1995. The US groups, led by the Princeton University group,
propose to undertake responsibilities for the containment vessel and
scintillator purification system for both CTF and BOREXINO. ***
