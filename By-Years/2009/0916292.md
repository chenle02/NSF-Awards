In the United States, Congress has in place a number of institutions and
services to provide members and committees with up-to-date, expert knowledge.
The acquisition of expert scientific testimony for congressional members and
committees costs Congress over $2 billion per year. Clearly, science and
technology testimony is important to legislative and policy making bodies. This
project studies the quality of expert scientific testimony. The challenge we
propose to address is this: Can the quality of the expert testimony of
scientists, engineers, and technologists be improved through the introduction of
new ideas and new technologies of peer review and peer production? In the design
of the proposed system we will integrate new insights and techniques of peer-
production from studies of Open Source Software development; game-based co-
production of useful information by non-experts; and, an emerging subfield of
knowledge management, online expertise sharing between experts and non-experts.
The combination and extension of these techniques will provide new tools for
exploring online, peer-production processes.

The research results will create a set of concrete tools for providing science,
technology, and engineering input into legal, legislative or policy decision
making processes. In terms of the possible, pedagogical impacts of the project,
its budget and plan have been developed to foster collaborative working
relationships between faculty, staff, graduate students, undergraduates,
university and non-university based scientists and engineers from a diverse set
of fields.

Information provided to or discovered by Congress has a profound effect on the
legislative process. The acquisition of policy information for its members and
committees costs Congress well over $2 billion per year of which about $100
million is spent on House and Senate committees. If the proposed project is
successful, we will have a set of concrete, implemented proposals to show how
Congress and the communities of science, technology, and engineering could be
better integrated using tools and techniques of information technology. In terms
of the possible, pedagogical impacts of the project, its budget and plan have
been developed to foster collaborative working relationships between faculty,
staff, graduate students, undergraduates, university and non-university based
scientists and engineers from a diverse set of fields, in addition to,
potentially, congressional staff and members of Congress.
