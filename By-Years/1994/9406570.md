9406570 Hanna West Shore Community College requests support from NSF for a
connection of its campus network to Michnet and NSFNET. Michnet is the midlevel
network located in the state of Michigan that will provide operations and
network information services. It will give West Shore Community College a 56
thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
million bits per second) National Backbone network. The College needs greater
functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries,
and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail
system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a
unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational resources.
