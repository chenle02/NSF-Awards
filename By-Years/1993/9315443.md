9315443 Triman The general approach outlined in this research involves the study
of seven plasmid-encoded 16S rRNA mutations; each mutation disrupts a specific
G-C basepair in or near a region of Escherichia coli 16S ribosomal RNA involved
in interaction with a ribosomal protein. Genetic and biochemical studies of
these mutations will include (1) site-specific mutagenesis to introduce
compensatory changes, (2) analysis of chemical and enzymatic probing of mutant
rRNA with and without the appropriate ribosomal protein bound, and (3)
characterization of the expression of the mutations under conditions in which
one or more chromosomal rRNA operons have been inactivated. The goal of this
work is to elucidate the role of specific nucleotides in the structure and
function of 16S ribosomal RNA. %%% The aim of this study is to improve our
understanding of the molecular mechanism of protein synthesis. The focus of our
work is an RNA molecule found in the ribosome, the site of protein synthesis in
all living organisms. The general approach outlined in this proposal involves
the use of genetic and biochemical techniques to investigate the structure and
function of 16S ribosomal RNA from bacteria. Genetic studies involve the
introduction of mutations at each of seven positions in 16S rRNA and the
characterization of the effects of these mutations on protein synthesis in
bacteria. Biochemical studies include experiments designed to test the ability
of mutant 16S rRNA to bind purified ribosomal proteins. The goal of this work is
to understand the importance of specific 16S rRNA nucleotides in the structure
and function of the ribosome. ***
