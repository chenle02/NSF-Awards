9360753 Ramanujan This project is to develop a new approach to clustering
workstations, called the network shared memory approach. It has three specific
advantages over other approaches: (1) it is capable of delivering performance
that is at least an order of magnitude better than that attainable using
existing techniques for clustering workstations; (2) it greatly simplifies the
programming task by providing a shared memory abstraction to the programmer; and
(3) the cost of attaining this performance and programmability is several times
lower than that of commercially available shared memory parallel processors of
comparable computing power. The results of this work can be applied to cluster
workstations into a high-performance parallel computer at a fraction of the cost
of commercial parallel computers. ***
