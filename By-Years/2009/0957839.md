This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor Nancy S. Mills and colleagues Jessica
Hollenbeck, Laura Hunsicker-Wang and Adam R. Urbach from the Department of
Chemistry at Trinity University will acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped
with a broad band probe. The instrument will be used to support research
activities such as: 1) probing the conformational flexibility of designed
ankyrin-repeat proteins; 2) studying the cooperation of intermolecular
interactions within the framework of a rigid DNA duplex in complexes containing
polyamide ligands; 3) examination of the pH dependence of the redox behavior of
Rieske proteins through chemical modification of potential titratable groups to
characterize modified amino acids; and 4) evaluation of interactions of lithium
counterions with antiaromatic dianions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to
chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will
have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and
biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as
research.&lt;br/&gt;
