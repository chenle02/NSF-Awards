The International Conference on "Impacts of Natural Disasters" will take place
on July 10-12, 1991, at the University of California, Los Angeles Campus. The
objective of the conference is to provide an interdisciplinary, international
forum for the discussion of the physical, social, environmental and other
impacts resulting from extreme natural events such as floods, hurricanes,
earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions and other phenomena. Proceedings
will be published of the presentations made on the local, regional and
international impacts of natural disasters, on the available mitigation
measures, and on the research needed to develop better and more effective
mitigation actions and policies, especially for international cooperation in
research projects between the United States and other countries.
