EIA-0103660&lt;br/&gt;Naren Ramakrishnan&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Polytechnic
Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NGS: A Microarray Experiment Management
System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to develop systems
software relating to the management of microarray experiments for studying
hundreds of genes in given organism simultaneously. This is a multidisciplinary
collaboration between computer scientists who will perform the computer science
research part of this project and will develop the computer systems software,
and biologist who will use the microarray experiment as a driving case for the
systems software to be developed under the project, and then they will be the
users of the developed management infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;
