The security architecture of consumer operating systems is currently undergoing
a fundamental change. In platforms such as Android, iOS, and Windows 8, each
application is a separate security principal that can own data. While this
distinction is a vast improvement over traditional user-focused security
architectures, sharing data between applications results in an unexpected loss
of control of that data, potentially exposing security and privacy sensitive
information. This research improves the security of these modern consumer
operating systems by providing a holistic view of data protection. In
particular, this work proposes a new operating system abstraction for
transparently tracking and controlling access to all data, allowing policy to
determine if a reader is given the true value, a fake or modified value, or no
value at all. To efficiently and practically accomplish this goal, this work
combines several existing and new techniques to track and control access to
data. The new abstraction provided by this work not only solves a significant
problem affecting modern consumer operating systems by enabling applications to
retain pervasive control over their data, but also more broadly provides a new
abstraction on which a variety of new security solutions can be built.
