This project seeks to establish a method for understanding how innovation
networks affect broad economic outcomes. We know that innovation happens in a
network environment and has network effects; that is, a firm, scientist, or
individual developing a new product or process is affected by the decisions and
findings of other innovators, and in turn has that same effect on others. For
example, an innovation in one specific area may spur a large number of related
innovations. The project will use data from patent applications to develop
measures of the network links between broad classes of patents. The team will
then seek to incorporate these measures into a model of overall economic growth
to consider questions about the implications of new technologies for overall
productivity growth and employment. They also want to develop predictions about
the ways in which public and private R&amp;D affect the macroeconomy in
different ways, and tools that may help to determine how industrial policy can
affect the competitiveness of the US macroeconomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team
uses data from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for the years from
1975 to 2009. They are modeling the network structure of innovations across
types of innovation, and are including measures of innovation quality. The goal
is to determine how a patent in one area increases (or decreases) the
probability of innovation in other areas. The network description will be used
to measure the size of spillovers (including first-order and second-order
effects). Variation generated by the network will be used to investigate
implications of new technologies for employment/output/wages across cities. The
innovation network will also be integrated into a structural model of resource
allocation in the aggregate economy. The PIs will determine where university and
public research lab patents sit in the innovation network; they will use the
result to consider whether there are systematic differences between the network
effects of publicly funded R&amp;D vs. privately funded R&amp;D.
