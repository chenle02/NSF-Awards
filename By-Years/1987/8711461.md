This proposal requests funds for the development of a dynamic cell surface
imaging system. Specifically, the principal investigator proposes to capture
three-dimensional information defining the form of a cell surface in digital
form and use it to compute a perspective view of the cell surface. The resulting
images depict surface topology directly, appearing much like scanning electron
micrographs. This technique will be extended along several dimensions. Although,
currently the time resolution of the technique is limited to 0.5 s by the low
signal-to-noise ratio and fixed scanning rate of conventional video cameras,
this can be overcome. The useful depth of interference reflection microscopy
(IRM) will be increased by at least ten-fold by computing relationships between
monochromatic images at different wavelengths. Methods will also be devised for
combining IRM with other image formation modalities. Computer graphics products
will be employed to decrease the computing time, costs, and complexity of
computer-enhanced IRM. The development of such a technique is likely to lead to
new knowledge concerning cell behavior.//
