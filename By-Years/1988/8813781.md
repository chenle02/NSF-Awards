Mathematicians at Furman University will develop and pilot test an experimental
one variable calculus course which builds and analyzes realistic models of
dynamic processes, including 'chaos'. The course restructuring will start with
sequences of real numbers, difference equations and end with differential
equations. Global and qualitative behavior will be stressed by use of the
computer. There will be modeling with symbol manipulation, discrete mathematics
and numerical mathematical packages. The grantee is providing almost 60% of the
cost of the project with purchase of equipment and in-kind services.
