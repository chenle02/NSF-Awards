This award will support a U.S.-France Joint Seminar on Algebraic Homotopy
Theory, to be held in Luminy, France in July, 1988. The conference organizers
are Dr. Haynes Miller, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Dr. Jean-
Michel Lemaire, University of Nice. Three topics will be stressed, each
currently very active and each of special interest to both French and U.S.
topologists: (1) Algebraic homotopy theory; (2) Maps between classifying spaces;
(3) Modular forms in algebraic topology. The last topic is currently a major
area of interaction between topology and other disciplines (mathematical physics
and number theory). Significant collaboration has already been initiated between
U.S. and French workers in each of these three areas, and it is hoped that this
conference will promote and consolidate these efforts. Publication of
proceedings is anticipated.
