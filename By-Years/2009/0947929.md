TITLE: New GK-12: Growing the green collar workforce for the 21st
century&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Iowa State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will support graduate student fellows who will act as the human
interface to motivationally communicate to middle school teachers and students
the excitement and innovations that are the scientific underpinnings of today?s
technologically savvy, modern society. The rationale for this program is the
need to solidly ground this country's educators and young students in STEM-theme
pedagogy. In the long-term such research-based education and training is a
prerequisite for facing the emerging societal challenge to generate technologies
that will maintain a sustainable standard of living, which ultimately will be
dependent on renewable sources of energy and industrial materials. This program
builds on Iowa State University's established scholarly infrastructures that are
designed to be interdisciplinary and address key technology gaps for harnessing
renewable energy sources (solar energy) and generate carbon-based energy and
chemicals using atmospheric CO2 as the ultimate carbon-source. This
interdisciplinary research integrates core themes that are grounded in STEM
research, which include the fields of plant sciences, agro-engineering,
biocatalysis, biochemical pathway discovery and metabolic engineering,
bioinformatics, biomaterials, chemical catalysis, and mathematics. Broader
impacts of the project include increased professional development opportunities
for middle school science teachers; expanded educational and career
opportunities for K12 students in STEM disciplines, especially those from
underrepresented minorities and economically disadvantaged; benefits to US
economy resulting from well-trained, globally competitive workforce; and
recruitment of female and underrepresented minority graduate students to
associated academic programs.
