Many types of research in psychology involve the use of computers for
generating stimulus materials and encoding and analyzing empirical results. In
order to adequately instruct and train students in conducting research in
psychology it is essential that they be exposed to computer-based experiments.
The University of California at Riverside is establishing a computer-based lab
for the undergraduate research methods course required of all undergraduate
psychology majors in the Psychology Department. Demonstrations and experiments
on cognition, perception, human-computer interaction, social psychology,
psycholinguistics, and learning and memory are being developed and implemented
for undergraduate labs in research methods. In addition, the equipment is
available for instructional demonstrations for courses in these topical areas of
psychology.
