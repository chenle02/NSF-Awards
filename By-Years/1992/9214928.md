The Engineering Foundation's Conference is an international meeting cosponsored
by the Engineering Foundation and NATO, to be held in Ventura, California,
August 16-21, 1992. The conference will have about 50 invited speakers from the
USA, Europe and Japan. The topics to be featured at the meeting will include:
Materials modification and manipulation by STM/AFM, Nanolithography, Physical
and chemical properties of nanostructures and clusters, Transport properties of
nanostructures, Nanoelectronics, and Molecular devices and molecular
electronics. The conference will serve as a forum for an interdisciplinary
exchange of knowledge and ideas. The aim is to accelerate the optimization and
modification techniques, to help delineate the fundamental mechanisms involved,
to lead to a better understanding of the physical, chemical, and electrical
properties of nanostructures, and to point to novel applications. The conference
proceedings will be published in the NATO Advanced Studies Institute series by
Kluwer Publishers. The object of this proposal is to provide funds for travel
support of graduate students.
