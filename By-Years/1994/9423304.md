Abstract N. Aubry CTS-9423304 CCUNY At high Reynolds numbers, the number of
excited degrees of freedom or active modes in a flow exceeds the capacity of
available computers so that many turbulent flows of industrial and geophysical
importance cannot be computed. This work seeks to address theoretical and
modeling issues in the fully develop, high Reynolds number regime of flow. This
work is aimed at the prediction of the most appropriated modes to describe the
turbulence (that is, the smallest number of modes needed among all possible
representations). This is done by eliminating most modes and their energy
spectra through mappings deduced from symmetry considerations. This can be
viewed as an alternative to "subgrid scale modeling". The technique will be
applied to a turbulent channel flow for which high resolution numerical data are
available. The predicted representation of the flow will then be used for
turbulence modeling.
