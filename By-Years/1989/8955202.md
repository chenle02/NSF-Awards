This collaborative project of Southern Illinois University's Colleges of
Science and Education with the surrounding school districts, is designed to
increase both the amount and the quality of science education in southern
Illinois elementary schools. It will provide summer teacher training and a
variety of follow-up activities during the school year, and ongoing support from
the university scientists. For the inservice training, two options will be
available to the teachers. The first option will be a five week course, which
includes a two-week practicum; the second option will be a more condensed two
week course. The five-week course will involve thirty teachers each summer for
three summers, and the two week course will involve thirty teacher each summer
for the last two summers of the grant. Teachers involved in the more extensive
course will act as mentors for the teachers involved in the shorter program. The
inservice will focus on techniques of promoting active learning through
experimentation and on the processes and concepts of science in order to foster
teachers' competence and confidence in their ability to teach these subjects.
During the summer laboratory component teachers will work with small groups of
children using a process-oriented science curriculum. At the same time, parent
volunteers will be trained to assist these teachers during the school year with
the teaching of their new science program and to support their efforts in the
community. This project will, therefore, be developing a model for how
scientists working with the education faculty of their university and with
school system administrators, teachers, and parents can have a major impact on
the teaching of science at the elementary school level. The cost sharing will be
54% of the NSF portion.
