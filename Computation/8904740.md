This group research is concerned with development of symbolic algorithms and
combined numeric/symbolic algorithms for integrating the trajectories of
nonlinear control systems and of mechanical systems of coupled rigid bodies
using piecewise nilpotent approximations. The results of this research will be
useful to other areas where combined/numeric algorithms are important, such as
in the design of robots, aircraft, and satellites.
