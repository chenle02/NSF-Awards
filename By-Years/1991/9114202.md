This is an international travel award to permit the investigator to attend the
Latin American Congress on Human Behavior in Seismic Areas at the National
University of San Juan, Argentina. The central themes of the conferences are:
(1) the cultural impacts of earthquakes; (2) seismic risk and regional and urban
planning; and (3) education programs in seismic zones. The investigator, who is
fluent in Spanish, will share insights gained from the conference with the U.S.
research community through a report and interactions at future meetings. The
conference will be held in San Juan, Argentina on September 22-26, 1991.
