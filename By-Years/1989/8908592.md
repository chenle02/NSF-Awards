The PI will investigate the use of distributed H-infinity control design methods
in a practical approach to feedback control design for highly flexible systems.
Infinite dimensional transfer functions will be used directly for control
designs based on the theory of A. Tannenbaum, C. Foias, G. Zames, and H. Ozbay.
This theory provides a way of computing H-infinity optimal performance and
controllers which provide this performance for infinite dimensional systems.
However, the controllers are infinite dimensional, often with infinitely many
unstable poles. Therefore, she will use a characterization of all suboptimal,
stabilizing controllers to find finite dimensional controllers which provide
satisfactory performance. She will perform mixed sensitivity designs and designs
for robustness to parameter variations and unmodelled dynamics for flexible beam
models of a booster vehicle. She will explore implementation and numerical
issues involved in applying the distributed H-infinity techniques.
