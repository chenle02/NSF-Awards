This award is for the purchase of a multiple degree of freedom, high precision,
light weight stereo camera head. The same equipment is being purchased at three
other institutions in a shared research effort. Research topics include gaze
control and target tracking, stereo and motion analysis, landmark-based
navigation, automatic acquisition of object and environmental models, hand-eye
coordination, dextrous manipulation with multi-fingered hands, real-time
perception and manipulation. System software, algorithms and subsystems will be
shared across the institutions. The University of Maryland will be purchasing
equipment to support a multi-institutional shared research effort in active
vision for robot navigation and manipulation. Other members of the consortium
are the University of Rochester, University of Pennsylvania and the University
of Massachusetts. Each institution will acquire the same state- of-the-art
binocular camera head of high precision and high speed, and will share in the
development of systems software and application software.
