Title: The Design of VoIP Systems with High Perceptual Conversational Quality
PI: Benjamin W. Wah

Abstract This research is on the design of real-time two-party and multi-party
VoIP (voice-over-IP) systems that can achieve high quality when the interactive
conversation is perceived by human listeners. It focuses on the fundamental
understanding of conversational quality and its trade-offs in strategies for
scheduling the playback of speech frames received, concealing frames lost in the
network, routing packets that carry speech frames using an overlay network, and
admitting new connections in multi-party conversations. The perceptual quality
of a conversation over a network connection depends on the one-way listening-
only speech quality and the mouth-to-ear delay incurred from the mouth of a
speaker to the ear of a listener. When there are network delays, a conversation
perceived by a listener consists of speech segments that are separated by
alternating short and long silence periods. This asymmetry leads to low
perceptual quality in multi-party VoIP because some speakers appear to be more
distant than others, whereas some respond slower than others. In this research,
we develop a statistical method to collect subjective test results and a
classification method to automatically learn and generalize the results to
unseen network and conversational conditions. We study network-control and
scheduling algorithms for improving the asymmetry in silence periods and the
quality of speech segments received.
