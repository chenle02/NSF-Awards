Computer Applications to Enhance Inquiry-Oriented Instruction in Biology The
general problem of scientific-technical literacy as well as the enhancement of
inquiry-oriented laboratory instruction in biology is addressed. Specific goals
are to increase scientific literacy, reasoning skills, and the number of
students succeeding in introductory biology courses. Also, these goals will be
achieved by developing, evaluating and integrating into the curriculum a set of
computer applications designed to reinforce biology concepts with laboratory
activities. Efforts will be focused on an introductory biology course at a
2-year college that serves a nontraditional undergraduate population. Student
populations will include more women, Hispanics, Native Americans and older
students. The resultant inquiry-based model of laboratory instruction is also
expected to be used as a model for computer technology in bio- science
education.***//
