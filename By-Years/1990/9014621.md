The objective of this project is to develop a formal framework for the
specification and analysis of real-time systems, and tools to support them.
Since the correctness of a real-time system depends on not only how concurrent
processes interact but also the time at which these interactions occur, the
formal framework must be capable of modeling delays due to process
synchronization as well as contention for shared resources. While most current
real-time models capture delays due to process synchronization, they abstract
out resource-specific details by assuming idealistic operating environments. On
the other hand, scheduling and resource allocation algorithms used for real-time
systems ignore the effect of process synchronization except for simple
precedence relations between processes. To bridge the gap between these two
disciplines, a specification language called Communicating Shared Resources
(CSR), and a priority-based process algebra called the Calculus for
Communicating Shared Resources (CCSR) are being developed. CSR supports the
high-level description of real-time systems, whereas CCSR provides the resource-
based computation model of CSR and a prioritized strong equivalence for terms
based on strong bisimulation. Based on CCSR's formal framework, three tools to
analyze process behavior will be developed: a simulator, a model checker and a
mechanical theorem prover. The tools will be integrated in a single analyzer to
be used at different stages of proving that a specification is correct.
