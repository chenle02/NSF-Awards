A program-development workshop on ocean engineering, marine biotechnology and
mariculture will be held in Santa Barbara, or some other suitable location. The
workshop will draw on expertise from the Institut Francais de Recherche pour
L'exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER), the Marine Biological Station, Roscoff and
the new French, Mediterranean Institute of Technology (MIT), as well as that
from U.S. Institutions (University of California, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, the University of Maryland, the University of Hawaii and others).
The goal of the workshop will be to review recent research in ocean engineering
and marine biotechnology in the U.S. and France, in order to explore possible
synergistic relationships that might be developed between ocean engineers and
marine biotechnologists in France and the United States. We will define
innovative new research goals for the future. A summary and report will be
prepared by French and U.S. organizers, entitled, "Ocean Engineering, Marine
Biotechnology and Mariculture--A Franco-American Perspective."
