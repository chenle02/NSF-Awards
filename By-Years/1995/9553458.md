GER-9553458 Carroll Virginia Tech seeks to establish a Graduate Research
Traineeships program to encourage women, minorities, and persons with
disabilities (Trainees) to pursue the PhD in Computer Science with
specialization in Human-Computer Interaction and Networked Information. Unique
program features include: * inter-institutional recruiting arrangements with
Norfolk State University and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State
University (historically black universities) as "feeder" schools, and an
aggressive plan for retention of Trainees; * practical experience and research
in five different settings (1) three new HCI labs -- encompassing interactive
technologies, usability evaluation methodology, and networked multimedia
information, all created under a recently awarded NSF Research Infrastructure
grant; (2) a wide range of development and experimentation in Computer Science
curricula, course content, and instructional technology, supported by a recently
awarded NSF Educational Infrastructure grant; (3) the Accessible Computer
Laboratory, Virginia Tech's computer facility for disabled students, created and
managed by the Computer Science Department; (4) the Interaction Consulting
Service, and outreach program to help the University community learn, adapt, and
apply the newest HCI design and evaluation technologies to their development of
software and courseware; (5) the Blacksburg Electronic Village, an ambitious
community- networking project; * liaisons with foreign institutions and the
computer industry to provide opportunities for international and industrial
training experiences.
