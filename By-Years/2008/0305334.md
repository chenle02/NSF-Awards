SGER: The Development of Responsive Binders for Particle
Clusters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory
research focuses on chemical additives that can manipulate the net interparticle
force within clusters of nanometer and micrometer-scale particles. We will
exploit the fundamental physical chemistry that governs the adsorption
characteristics and conformation of polymeric binder molecules in order to
achieve attractive or repulsive contributions to the overall cluster cohesivity.
These binders will respond to external triggers (thermal, optical, or chemical)
that will enable the user to tailor the cluster strength. In this manner, we
hope to enable an unprecedented degree of control over the processing behavior
of particle systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three categories of research are
proposed:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Evaluation of candidate chemistries for responsive
binders. &lt;br/&gt;(2) Development of strategies for applying these responsive
binders to particle assemblies.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Measurement and analysis of the
effectiveness of these binders in modifying processing characteristics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research have significant potential to
impact broadly many aspects of particle science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;
