The impacts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs emitted by vegetation on
atmospheric chemistry are under increasing scrutiny, especially since they play
a central role in photochemical smog formation. Past investigations have focused
on hydrocarbon components of VOC's, but recently large quantities of oxygenated
hydrocarbons (OHC's), such as methanol and acetone, have been found in the air
of rural forests, leading to questions about their origins and roles in
tropospheric chemistry. Preliminary measurements indicate that methanol can be
emitted by leaves at high rates, similar to that for isoprene emission, and that
conifer buds emit substantial quantities of acetone, suggesting that vegetation
is a significant source of volatile OHC's. The proposal addresses several key
questions. 1) How much methanol and acetone are emitted by various species of
plants? 2) What different plant parts (e.g., buds, leaves, bark, etc.) emit
methanol and acetone? 3) How do environment, phenology, season, and plant stress
influence methanol and acetone emissions? The effects of environment and
stresses will be examined in controlled laboratory experiments. Fluxes of OHC's
from different plant families will be assessed as part of the Rural Oxidants in
a Southern Environment (ROSE II) study in a southeastern forest (summer 1992),
and from field surveys in the boulder area. Fluxes will be measured using bud,
leaf, branch, and stem enclosures with OHC analysis by gas chromatography. This
work will provide the first comprehensive overview of plant methanol and acetone
emissions, which will be useful in atmospheric modeling of tropospheric
chemistry, particularly of rural areas, and will provide estimation of natural
sources of atmospheric methanol before methanol-containing fuels come on line.
