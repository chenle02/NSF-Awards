9416946 Ruckle This award supports a three-year cooperative research project
between Dr. William Ruckle of Clemson University and Dr. Kensaku Kikuta of
Toyama University. The objective of this cooperative research project is to
study search games on weighted graphs and their applications. Some of their
activities will be to (1) construct various search models on weighted graphs;
(2) find formulas for solutions to games on certain kinds of graphs; (3) find
methods to reduce games on complicated graphs to games on simpler graphs of less
developed and developing economies; (4) find methods to compute approximate
solutions; (5) find upper and lower bounds to the value of certain games on
graphs; and (6) reduce the complexity of searches. This proposal brings together
research scientists from two countries working on applied mathematics. By
combining their expertises, the two groups can achieve a deeper understanding
and more rapid progress than can either group alone. Therefore, this proposal
fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
