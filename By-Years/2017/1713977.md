In today's communication networks, most data flow through wireless links which
are particularly vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. While currently available
cryptographic algorithms provide useful protection against computationally
limited eavesdroppers, the ever-increasing computational power of adversaries
necessitates techniques that provide stronger forms of security guarantees.
Information-theoretic physical layer security provides unconditional security
guarantees that are valid even against computationally unlimited adversaries.
The goal of this research is to advance information-theoretic physical layer
security to address practical issues arising from user misbehavior, conflicting
user interests, lack of complete network state information; and to devise
practically implementable codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the application of
information-theoretic physical layer security to multi-user wireless channels,
alignment emerges as a powerful tool to achieve the maximum possible secure
degrees of freedom for the network. Optimal alignment for the purposes of
security may be interpreted as a form of one-time-pad communication in the air
with no need for explicit exchange of keys; security is bootstrapped from the
randomness in the physical channel and from the willingness of the users to
cooperate. The goal of this research is to develop techniques to make such
secure alignment schemes more robust to user misbehavior and to the lack of
channel state information; more practical by making connections to polar coding
to develop explicit codes; and more widely applicable to modern wireless
networks with multi-antenna nodes. Specifically, this research investigates the
cases of 1) deviating users who do not follow agreed-upon optimum protocols; 2)
combating helpers and selfish users who have conflicting interests; 3) vector
channels arising from use of multiple antennas and the associated channel state
information issues; and 4) explicit code design using polar codes and relating
polar alignment and signal alignment.
