Recently developed optical methods of holographically generating coherent
ultrasonics will be employed to produce coherent sound waves with extremely high
frequencies that are continuously tunable. These features, coupled with the
ability to optically inject acoustic probes without mechanical contact, makes
the proposed technique well suited for the non-destructive evaluation of
materials.
