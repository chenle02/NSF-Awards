9501723 Bayer This awards supports the research of Professor D. Bayer to work on
methods for computing in both algebraic geometry and topology. In algebraic
geometry he will focus on the connections between toric varieties and integer
programming. In topology he will study methods to compute on 3-manifolds. He
hopes to use the interplay between topology and algebraic geometry such as the
interpretation of the Haken normal surface as a Hilbert basis for a polyhedral
cone. Finally he proposes to develop virtual reality software for direct
manipulation of 3-manifolds. The research starts out in algebraic geometry and
then moves on to topology. Both are among the oldest parts of modern
mathematics, but both have blossomed to the point where they have, in the past
10 years, solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, Algebraic
Geometry treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest of equations,
namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but
also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those
fields, but it has applications to many areas of engineering as well. The
research supported in the present proposal shows the importance of this once
purely theoretical area for robotics and manufacturing. Topology studies the
properties of objects that are invariant under transformations that do not tear
the surface. It is extensively used in such areas as Physics and Chemistry where
the shapes of objects are fundamental to determine their properties. ***
