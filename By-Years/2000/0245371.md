0245371&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is
proposed to address several problems at the interface of analysis with geometry
and physics. A first problem is the development of stable analytic methods.
Stable methods have emerged as essential for the study of singularities and
oscillatory integrals, and for the basic problem of finding canonical metrics in
differential geometry. Canonical metrics are expected to be equivalent to the
notion of stability in the sense of geometric invariant theory, and the relation
between this global notion and stable estimates is to be investigated. The
second problem in the proposal is the development of Feynman rules for string
scattering amplitudes. Feynman rules had been unavailable due to a geometric
difficulty encountered for two-loops or higher, namely ``supermoduli". But the
situation is now much more promising, thanks to the recent success of Eric
D'Hoker and the PI in overcoming this difficulty in the simplest case of two-
loops. The third problem in the proposal is the construction/identification of
integrable structures in supersymmetric gauge and string theories. A basic tool
is a new Hamiltonian approach to soliton equations developed by the PI in
collaboration with Igor Krichever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are core problems
in theoretical physics and applied mathematics. The search of natural laws at
their most fundamental level relies more and more on geometric principles and
symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;The problems addressed in the present proposal - stability
and canonical metrics, Feynman rules for string theory, soliton equations - are
essential to the understanding of the two theories which have led research in
both mathematics and theoretical physics for the last two decades, namely string
theory and supersymmetry, together with their underlying geometric
structures.&lt;br/&gt;
