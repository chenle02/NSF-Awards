9627018 Westrom This is an after-school, informal science, engineering and
technical advancement program for students in grades four through twelve. FSEA
brings together students, volunteer mentors from business and industry, and
teachers in activities centered around members working in teams designing,
building, and testing FSEA hands-on projects making science, mathematics and
technology "come alive." The goal for this project is to bring FSEA up to full
implementation status and to expand the number of FSEA chapters to at least 300
and the number of students to at least 9,000. The anticipated outcome will be a
national model implemented on a broad scale whereby small and large businesses
participate with local schools in delivering technical education.
