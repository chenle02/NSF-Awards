This award supports a doctoral symposium at the 3rd ACM Conference on
Recommender Systems (RecSys 2009) to be held in New York, NY October 22-25,
2009. During the last decade the commercial importance of recommender systems
has grown, spurring the creation and growth of this conference. RecSys is the
leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and
practice on recommender systems. The doctoral symposium will help students
refine their dissertation projects so that they can make stronger contributions
to the solution of critical intellectual challenges in recommender systems. The
doctoral symposium will help develop a cohort of recommender systems researchers
who will contribute to future academic and industrial research. By helping
doctoral students to appreciate each other?s different perspectives and form a
cohort across those boundaries, we can extend the rich interdisciplinarity of
the field and foster commercial and intellectual innovation for the future.
