9514234 Stomp This award provides support for purchase of equipment required for
the establishment in the U.S. of a collection of diverse isolates of Lemna, also
known as duckweed. Lemna is a monocotyledon that grows as a free-floating plant
in slow moving lakes and stream and is of considerable potential for basic
studies in the biology of plants and for more applied uses as a source of animal
feed and specialty chemicals. The collection consists of about 1000 strains
collected by Dr. Elias Landolt of the University of Zurich over the course of
his scientific career; these isolates represent all 32 known species of Lemna
and most of the geographic range of the organism. The collection is being moved
to the U.S. where it will be made available to other researchers by the awardee.
