0118046 Talley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will produce a printed and an
online atlas of the Indian Ocean WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment)
Hydrographic Program (WHP) data. The goals of the Indian Ocean WHP were similar
to those for the other basins -to obtain basic hydrographic and chemical tracer
data to allow basin-wide estimates of transports. Specific goals included
obtaining as much information as possible about Indian Ocean overturning and
quantifying the throughput of near-surface water from the Pacific to the
Atlantic. The project requires acquiring and processing the Indian Ocean WHP
data sets from the WHP Office (WHPO), assisting the WHPO if needed in completing
these data sets, gridding, plotting each of the WHP parameters, providing online
access to the preliminary graphics for interaction with the individual
investigators, final drafting of the plots, and forwarding to the International
WOCE Project Office in Southampton for printing. Online atlas development will
proceed in parallel with that for the Pacific, Southern Ocean and Atlantic. The
printed WHP atlases will likely also contain maps showing the mean flow and
statistics from the Lagrangian float and drifter measurements. If included, the
mapped values will be provided by the float and drifter groups. &lt;br/&gt;
