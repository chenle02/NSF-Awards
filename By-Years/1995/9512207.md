ABSTRACT 9512207 WEBB A request has been made for funding to help provide
partial travel assistance and accommodations for five U.S. researchers in the
field of radiative transfer in order for them to participate in the First
International Symposium on Radiative Transfer to be held August 14-18, 1995 in
Kusadasi, Turkey. This symposium is being sponsored by the International Center
for Heat and Mass Transfer (ICHMT). The Symposium will assemble for the first
time scientists and engineers from a broad range of disciplines for the purpose
of interdisciplinary cultivation of technical ideas related to radiative
transfer. For example, it is anticipated that related fields such as remote
sensing and astrophysics will be represented. The invited participants selected
for support by the requested funds will include three established and two
emerging scientists in the field of radiative tpansport. Their attendance will
lend stature to the Symposium, provide exposure to the multidisciplinary group,
and ensure that the US is adequately represented in such a significant technical
event.
