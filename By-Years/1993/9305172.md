9305172 Zeng This research continues successful theoretical developments
supported under previous NSF funding on multiple seismic energy scattering.
Here, the researcher will extend the numerical simulation of the multiply
scattered wave in a non-uniform absorption and scattering medium, explore
various factors affecting the observed seismic coda decay, study the effect of
anisotropic scattering processes on the seismic scattering wave decay,
incorporate a depth-dependent velocity structure, compare seismic scattering
effects between realistic heterogeneous models, and apply the theoretical
results to real data. The work will have important application to the estimation
of the coda magnitude and site amplification, to the Q variation as a possible
precursor to earthquake prediction, to the study of crustal heterogeneity and
rheology structure and to the extension of the coda study to the early strong
part of the earthquake shaking which progressively damages buildings. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
