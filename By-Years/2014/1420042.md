Both the United States and Europe are preparing for a larger population of older
people in the near future. In the United States, the population of adults 65 and
older will increase to 88.5 million in 2050, which is more than double the
current number. It is expected that by 2050, 35% of Europeans will be over 60
years old, and 11% will be over 80 years old. This is a dramatic increase from
current levels of 20% and 4%, respectively. In order for older adults to
maintain their independence and function well in an increasingly technological
society, it is important for them to be able to retain and develop motor skills.
This project comprises a transnational team of investigators from the
Netherlands, Germany, and the United States with extensive expertise in the
study of motor skill acquisition across the lifespan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
aim of this project is to delineate age differences in the brain and behavioral
mechanisms of motor skill learning. The researchers will collect motor
performance and neuroimaging data to identify brain regions contributing to
skill learning for young and older adults. In addition, they will assess
participants on a range of characteristics such as fitness level, cognitive
capacity, health status, and other variables to identify factors contributing to
individual differences in successful learning for older adults. They will also
evaluate if and how exercise, transcranial brain stimulation, and observing
others learn facilitate motor skill acquisition for older adults. Identifying
age differences in the mechanisms of skill acquisition, and critically
evaluating interventions for their potential effectiveness at improving skill
learning abilities, will help to maintain work productivity, health, and daily
function for older adults.
