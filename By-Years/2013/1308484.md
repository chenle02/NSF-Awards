The Chemical Measurements and Imaging Program in the Chemistry Division and
Chemical and Biological Separations Program in the Chemical, Bioengineering,
Environmental, and Transport Systems Division support Profs. Stephen Jacobson
and Adam Zlotnick at Indiana University to develop nanofluidic devices to study
transport and assembly of virus capsids. To improve measurement precision and
accurately characterize particle properties, their approach is to measure single
particles multiple times and with pores having different dimensions. In this
project, simian virus 40 (SV40) is used as the model system. The T=1 SV40 capsid
is composed of 12 pentamers and assembles with and without nucleic acid (RNA and
DNA) present. Profs. Jacobson and Zlotnick and their students use resistive-
pulse sensing, which provides single particle sensitivity in real time and at
biologically relevant concentrations. Resistive-pulse sensing combined with
rapid on-device mixing permits observation of early time points in the assembly
process and the ability to probe pentamers, intermediates, and fully formed
capsids without the use of chemical labels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
provides a fundamental understanding of how virus-like particles assemble, which
is critical in a number of fields, e.g., medicine, biotechnology,
nanotechnology, and materials. The measurement techniques developed in this
project can be applied to understanding a range of naturally occurring and
synthetic assembly systems. Undergraduate and graduate students have the
opportunity to develop state-of-the-art nanoscale fabrication, imaging, and
measurement techniques. The project also teaches elementary students about
millimeter, micrometer, and nanometer length scales and high school students the
concepts of separation and diffusion at the micro- and nanoscale.
