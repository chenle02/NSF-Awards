9223453 Tubbesing This award provides partial support for the Fifth National
Conference on Earthquake Engineering (5NCEE), which is part of a series of
national conferences on earthquake engineering. The 5NCEE, which will be held in
Chicago in July, 1994, will provide a valuable service to the National
Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program by offering guidance on future research
needs in earthquake engineering and related fields. The conference will also
provide a context for researchers and practitioners in relevant technical
disciplines to come together to exchange experiences and ideas. The conference
proceedings should be a valuable source of information to help facilitate future
advances in the field of earthquake engineering. ***
