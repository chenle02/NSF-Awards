In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry
Division, McHale will use resonance Raman (RR) techniques to study
intermolecular interactions in the condensed phase, particularly the effects of
solvent dynamics on charge transfer processes. Raman excitation profiles will be
time-analyzed in systems such as betaine and triphenylmethane dyes, as well as
in two-chromophore systems. Results will be compared with those from ultrafast
spectroscopy experiments. To isolate solvent dynamics from energetics, isotopic
substitution of the solvent will be employed, and other parameters such as
polarity, viscosity, and polarizability will be investigated. %%% The results of
this research will lead to a better understanding of the influence of a solvent
on chemical reactions which are occurring in it. This work will also contribute
to understanding how to control chemical reactions in solid or liquid phases by
using different solvents or using lasers to initiate or enhance the reaction.
