Rivers and their tributaries form networks that integrate the far reaches of
Earth's landscapes, linking our homes, farms, cities, and wilderness areas.
These rivers are ever-changing, sometimes near-imperceptibly and sometimes
dramatically adjusting their forms to carry the water and sediment supplied by
rainfall, snow/ice melt, and erosion of the surrounding landscape. Both natural
and human activities can alter the balance of water and sediment entering
rivers, causing them to erode downwards into their beds when water supply
outweighs sediment supply, or to deposit sediments and raise the level of their
beds when sediment supply increases beyond what the water can carry. Wickert and
his team will develop a theory to predict these river-system changes, and
incorporate it into a computer model that includes rainfall and runoff, lakes
and wetlands, and processes that shape rivers. They will test this theory and
model using data from rivers in Minnesota, USA, and Salta, Argentina. These
rivers' bed elevations have changed by tens to hundreds of meters during past
glacial cycles and by several meters over the past 200 years in response to
changing climate and land use. Controlled experiments on small-scale rivers
conducted at the Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory will supplement these field-
based tests. The proposed outcome of this work is an efficient, physics-based,
predictive model to simulate river-network evolution in response to climate and
land-use change. The project will train undergraduate students, graduate
students, and postdoctoral scholars. The team will work with the Ojibwe people
to broaden participation in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wickert and his group
will develop and test theory and models to simulate river-network response to
changes in water and sediment supply. They will codify river-tributary networks
into mathematical networks that additionally incorporate valleys, lakes, and the
surrounding hillslopes. They will then couple and solve equations describing
alluvial-river dynamics across these networks to predict the complex response of
rivers to external perturbations. These equations will underlie a new numerical
model, to be tested against field and laboratory data and driven by records and
simulations of sediment inputs and water discharge. This model will enable us to
rapidly simulate alluvial-river response to drivers of geomorphic change,
thereby improving our ability to both reconstruct past river dynamics and
forecast the impacts of environmental change on rivers into the
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
