9322525 Badiru The research addresses the development of a performance
measurement methodology for design integration in manufacturing systems. The
methodology uses a hybrid model of a state-space representation and expert
system. The design process is based on the Pahl and Beitz systematic approach to
design. The Triple C model of project management is used to facilitate the
communication, cooperation, and coordination required for design integration.
Many conceptual integration approaches are available in the literature. Most
existing approaches lack a quantitative performance measure to drive integration
efforts. This performance measure is a unique, quantifiable approach to
evaluating design integration. This research facilitates the implementation of
the concurrent engineering concept in design and manufacturing.
