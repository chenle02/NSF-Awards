This project is expanding the instructional equipment associated with an
intermediate optics laboratory for junior and senior physics majors at
Pennsylvania State University. New experiments are being introduced that employ
modern optical tools for quantitative measurement, replacing a number of the
more traditional experiments which have relied on visual observation of
interference/diffraction patterns. For the most part, the experiments apply
multichannel detection to perform unique experiments in polarimetry and
spectroscopy, with the intent to demonstrate the fundamental principles of
optics and to convey the excitement of research at the forefront of optical
physics. The principles and concepts demonstrated in the laboratory include the
interaction of light with matter: the Fresnel equations, reflectance,
transmittance, dispersion, absorption, dieletric functions, birefringence,
optical activity, thin film interference, multilayer films, and diffraction
gratings. The laboratories are teaching one- and two-dimensional Fourier
analysis, coordinate transformations, matrix manipulations, Jones and Stokes
vector treatments of polarized light, and Muller and Jones matrix representation
of optical elements, including polarizers and retarders. This complements
selected traditional experiments which are retained in interference and
diffraction.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal
sources.
