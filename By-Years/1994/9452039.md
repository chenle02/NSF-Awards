9452039 Liu The purpose of the microprocessor development system is to introduce
undergraduate students to state-of-the-art development tools and to provide them
with hands-on training on the design of microprocessor-based circuits. A network
consisting of six PC's, each equipped with an 8086/8087 emulator, a logic
analyzer and a universal IC programmer, is being implemented as the development
system. Students in microprocessor laboratory courses are able to use this
system to develop application programs, debug microprocessor-based circuits,
integrate software and hardware, and test the integrated systems. These
effective development tools also enable students to design complicated
microprocessor-based projects, thus providing a greater flexibility for students
in choosing their senior design projects.
