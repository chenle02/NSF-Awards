This research investigates community-based environmental protection agreements
that have been implemented for watersheds in the United States. The research
uses a transaction cost framework to analyze the factors constraining and
facilitating cooperation among the administrators, politicians and interest
groups that negotiate policy agreements cutting across many political
jurisdictions. The project consolidates information from more than 2,000
watersheds, interviews a large number of stakeholders from a sample of those
watersheds and then uses case study methods to intensively study a handful of
watersheds. This research provides an enhanced understanding of the ways in
which cooperative agreements can be tailored for specific institutional settings
and environmental domains.
