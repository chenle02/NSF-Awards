Information personalization refers to the automatic adjustment of information
content, structure, and presentation tailored to an individual user. The goal of
this research project is to develop a modeling methodology for information
personalization. The methodology developed in this project termed PIPE
("Personalization is Partial Evaluation") makes no commitments to a particular
personalization algorithm or format for information resources. Instead it
emphasizes the representation of information systems in a way that allows their
subsequent personalization. With this methodology, web sites and other
information resources can be modeled and personalized for users' information-
seeking goals. The specific activities conducted in this project include (1)
characterizing the types of information systems for which this methodology is
applicable and (2) constructing "personable" information system designs. The
first activity is approached by defining how information systems are constructed
and the representations they afford. The second activity involves the definition
of a "personability" metric for evaluating information system designs. Human-
computer interaction methodologies and systematic procedures for evaluation need
to be enhanced to provide the needed input for the model formulation and
validation. The results of this project will help define "personable information
spaces" rigorously. With a formal model for personalization, we can design
better information systems that can help users achieve their information-seeking
goals.
