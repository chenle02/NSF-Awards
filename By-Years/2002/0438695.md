The American Physical Society (APS), in coordination with the International
Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), organizes the World Conference on
Physics and Sustainable Development. The conference is to be held in South
Africa on October 31 - November 2, 2005, as part of the celebration of the World
Year of Physics. The conference includes several themes, including health,
education, and economic development, that will be examined in light of physics
past contributions to these areas. Specific action initiatives are anticipated
to emerge, with an overall goal of creating sustainable development and building
scientific capacity. Substantial participation is expected from physicists from
developing countries as well as from the developed world.
