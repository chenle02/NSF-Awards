This grant provides renewed funding for the participation of junior faculty in
the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Summer Institute. For more than
thirty years, NBER's Summer Institute has offered an ideal environment for
developing new ideas and forging collaborative work relationships. Summer
Institute brings together economists and scholars in other fields from
universities, government, and international organizations for a few days or a
few weeks of seminars, workshops, conferences, and cooperative research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Summer Institute is four weeks long, and includes at
least 50 sessions organized and co-organized by over 80 individuals. There are
more than 1,750 attendees from over 300 universities and non-academic
institutions, and in 2012 more than twothirds of the individuals who attended
Summer Institute were not NBER affiliates. While there are many presentations of
work nearing completion, emphasis is placed on the workshop aspects of the
program where new ideas are raised, preliminary research ideas are developed,
and plans for joint or coordinated research efforts are established. Efforts are
made to include a wide variety of new participants, and to reach out to women
and minorities. Calls for papers are circulated widely and are available on the
NBER website. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The NBER Summer Institutes
generate timely and influential research on important economic policy questions
related to such topics as international financial stability, economic
productivity and technology, enviornmental regulations, social security policy,
and educational policies. The workshops are an invaluable part of the research
infrastructure in ecobnomics and assist the research of a large number of
economists.
