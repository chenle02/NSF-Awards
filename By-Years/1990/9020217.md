The proposed research will investigate variation in mitochondrial (mt) DNA
molecules among geographic samples of the North American cyprinid fish
Cyprinella lutrensis an among other species belonging to the C. lutrensis
complex or species-group in the continental United States. The research is
designed primarily to infer hypotheses of phylogenetic or genealogical
relationships within C. lutrensis and among C. lutrensis complex species. Goals
to be realized by achievement of the primary objective include (i) an assessment
of whether cryptic species within the C. lutrensis complex exist in the Trans-
Pecos and other regions in Texas, and (ii) an assessment of the biogeographic
events which led to the current distribution of C. lutrensis and related species
in the continental United States. Goal (i) is of importance relative to the
inventory of fauna endemic or native to the a United States and to ongoing
attempts within Texas and the southwestern United States to protect and preserve
native organisms. Goal (ii) will ultimately provide hypotheses of geological
events which occurred in the central and southwestern regions of the continental
United States during pre- and post-glacial times.
