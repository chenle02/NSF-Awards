The project, building on the success and best practices of prior ATE projects,
advances a grade 9-12 STEM Academy model by creating, implementing, and
evaluating a career pathway and course sequence in digital engineering
technology &amp; design. The project further scales this blended instructional
model for national dissemination and engages minority students historically
underrepresented in STEM careers from 30 urban, suburban, and rural Connecticut
high schools. The curriculum being developed is embedded with experiential
learning to build competency and workforce readiness across all fields of
technology supported by the ATE Program. Project activities include: program
development and improvement, educator professional development, and curriculum
and educational materials development for national dissemination. The project is
also conducting a comparative study to examine student STEM interest and
engagement and the development of 21st century competencies and skills for
successful transition from high school to college in Academy vs. non-Academy
project sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project responds to a critical national
workforce need - a highly educated and competent technical workforce prepared to
compete effectively in the global economy, and has the potential to revitalize
the learning environment in 30 Connecticut high schools with diverse student
populations, through the creation of a career pathway in digital engineering
technology and design.
