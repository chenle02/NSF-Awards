Title: CPA-G&V Intelligence Augmented Visualization PI: Kwan-Liu Ma, University
of California at Davis

Abstract: Visualization has become an indispensable tool in many areas of
science and engineering. Advanced visualization techniques allow scientists to
view and explore their computational results, but truly effective systems allow
the discovery of unexpected and often subtle aspects of the data. Such
discoveries can only be made by those intimately familiar with the generation of
the data. Adding to the visualization system the capability to learn from the
domain experts in complex data analysis tasks can facilitate similar tasks and
increase the utilization and efficacy of the system. This research aims to
create such a new visualization technology that is anticipated to significantly
lower the cost of visualization.

The investigators study how to integrate ?intelligence? into visualization
systems to automatically handling simple or repetitive tasks, and to effectively
assist users in performing complex tasks involving large, high-dimensional data.
Only high-level, goal-oriented decisions need to be made by the user, making
cutting-edge visualization technology directly accessible to a wide range of
application scientists. One research task is to select suitable machine learning
methods for representative visualization tasks. Two demanding visualization
applications, turbulent flow analysis and social data analysis, are used in this
study. The other critical task is to consult domain experts for understanding
the visualization task requirements and visual language, followed by the design
of an appropriate user interface for each visualization task. The research
results can therefore help realize truly coherent and usable visualization
systems and broaden the base of potential users of visualization technology.
