This project introduces topics in data abstraction and concurrent programming at
the lower division using the programming language Ada. The curriculum changes
are supported by state-of-the art equipment and software. The laboratory
equipment includes: four (4) SUN 3/50M workstations connected to a SUN 4/280S
Server through an Ethernet connection and dial-up connections for external
users. In addition to curriculum changes at the lower division, this project
introduces workshops for students who have completed the lower division so that
Ada can be phased into upper division courses as well. This award is being
matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
