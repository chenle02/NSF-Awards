This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Dr.
Joseph P. Dinnocenzo at the University of Rochester, who is studying the
reactions of molecules from which a single electron has been removed.
Investigations of these reactive species will provide fundamental information on
acid-base reactions and should lead to new methodology in synthetic organic
chemistry. The experiments to be carried out by Dr. Dinnocenzo will comprise two
related investigations of cation radicals. The first is designed to provide a
detailed understanding of the kinetic acidities of tertiary amine cation
radicals and alkylaromatic cation radicals. Preparation, characterization, and
proton-transfer studies of isolable cation radical salts will afford kinetic and
thermodynamic data that will help to identify the similarities and differences
between cation radical deprotonations and those of neutral, closed-shell organic
molecules. The second investigation is designed to elucidate the scope,
mechanism, and synthetic applications of cation radical reactions for
cyclopropanes having unsaturated substituents.
