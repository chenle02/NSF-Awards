9703476 Green The objective of this symposium is to provide a specific unique
focus on the science and technology of nondestructive evaluation applied to
materials characterization. Properties of interest include microstructure,
residual stress, dislocation density, porosity, and cure state. This symposium
gathers together the technologists of nondestructive methods with mechanical
engineers and materials scientists both to explore the applications of
nondestructive characterization and the solutions to the problems encountered.
Papers include research and applications for aging infrastructure, resonant
ultrasound spectroscopy, on-line measurements for process control, precision and
accuracy of nondestructive characterization measurements, advances in computed
assisted tomography, non-contact ultrasonics, and microwave advances and
applications. Research and applications in the nondestructive testing and
evaluation of material characteristics such as yield strength, ductility,
elastic modulus, grain size, microstructure, texture, fiber placement, and
residual stress are discussed. Of considerable interest are state-of-the-art
developments where the complex nature of materials has been recognized.
Furthermore, discussions on the applications and possibilities for multi-
technique measurements of interdependent parameters and the evaluation of the
data through sophisticated computer analysis are encouraged. The proceedings of
this symposium will be published as a bound volume entitled ONondestructive
Characterization of Materials VIII.O %%% Advances in nondestructive evaluation
are important to the application of new and advanced materials, manufacturing,
and the monitoring of infrastructure performance and useful life. ***
