This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, addresses the question of the mechanism of oxidative coupling of
methane over oxide catalyst surfaces. The use of in situ Raman spectroscopy to
identify potentially active forms of oxygen such as peroxide, superoxide, and
oxo species is a principal focus of this work. Isotope labeling experiments will
be used to help to identify intermediates, as well as to ascertain rate
determining steps in the oxidative and non-oxidative coupling reactions of
methane over oxide and zeolitic catalyst materials. Coupling of methane to form
aromatic products is also being examined in this research. The conversion of
methane, an abundant hydrocarbon resource, into more useful chemicals and fuels
is an important goal of heterogeneous catalysis science. The thrust of this
research project is directed toward developing an understanding of the detailed
mechanism of methane conversion on oxide catalysts, primarily via oxidative
coupling reactions. Raman spectroscopic probes will be developed and used to
provide this understanding. The outcome of this research project could have
significant impact on this technologically and environmentally important
process.
