This project will support travel to the conference "Forms of Homotopy Theory:
elliptic cohomology and loop spaces", at the Fields Institute in Toronto in
September 2004. The purpose of the conference is to bring together researchers
from several groups which have recently made substantial progress in the
homotopy theory related to string theory, particularly elliptic cohomology and
string topology. The subject has recently attracted some impressive new talent,
and the purpose of the proposed project is to support participation in the
conference by postdocs and graduate students.

Elliptic cohomology is a rich mix of seemingly distant areas of mathematics and
physics. The way in which elliptic cohomology brings these areas together is
still mainly a matter of phenomenology, hinting at deep and beautiful
theoretical mechanisms which properly explain the observed connections. Recently
there has been progress towards a deeper understanding of elliptic cohomology by
several groups of researchers. The conference will bring these researchers
together.
