Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spatio-temporal structures and patterns have been
observed in many natural processes. For instance, travelling pulses arise in
models of the propagation of nerve impulses in myelinated nerve fibers;
oscillating, spatially localized structures have been observed in granular
media, clay suspensions, and chemical reactions; defects that are embedded in an
oscillatory medium occur as spiral waves in chemical reactions and as surface
waves in fluid containers. The goal of this project is to investigate the
emergence of such patterns and their stability with respect to small
perturbations. The work aims to further our understanding of specific model
equations as well as to establish results that apply more
broadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is divided broadly into three parts.
In the first part, the investigator analyses Hopf and Turing Hopf bifurcations,
which may lead to oscillons, in forced and unforced reaction-diffusion models.
The main approach is to use, and extend, spatial-dynamics techniques together
with geometric blow-up methods. The second part is to study the existence and
stability of fast multi-pulses in the discrete FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. The
strategy is to extend techniques from geometric singular perturbation theory
near nonhyperbolic slow manifolds from the finite-dimensional setting to the
case of ill-posed functional differential equations with advanced and retarded
terms. In the third project, the investigators and collaborators study the
nonlinear stability of contact defects, the interaction of source-sink pairs and
of contact defects, and the linear stability of planar spiral waves. Spatial-
dynamics techniques are used to derive expansions of the resolvent kernel of the
linearization about a defect, which are then converted into pointwise estimates
of the associated Green's function using Laplace transforms.
