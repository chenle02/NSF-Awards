This project concerns research in algebraic geometry, the geometric study of
solutions of polynomial equations. This subject has seen major developments in
the last few years. One of the most striking is the invention of modern
invariants counting the number of curves with certain properties in spaces that
are expected to be related to our current universe's space-time. A major
breakthrough came from understanding that the computation of some of these
invariants can be understood in terms of solutions of certain equations related
to the geometry of so-called mirror spaces. While the initial description of
these invariants was geometric in nature, work of Kontsevich and Costello
suggests that an algebraic approach would lead to increased flexibility and more
efficient computation. The goal of this project is to expand that work and
define the invariants in such a way that existing results on the Homological
Mirror Symmetry conjecture will automatically imply that existing numerical
predictions on curve-counts are correct.

Kevin Costello introduced in 2005 a categorical generalization of Gromov-Witten
invariants, defined for all genera. Despite considerable interest, very little
is known about these invariants. The first calculation of them, for the
universal family of elliptic curves, was achieved by the PI in 2017, in joint
work with Junwu Tu. In this project the PI expand the current understanding of
these invariants. The PI will complete ideas originally proposed by K. Costello,
and then use the resulting theory to compute B-model Gromov-Witten invariants of
positive genus for higher dimensional varieties, including the quintic
threefold. This will verify the validity of the mirror symmetry predictions in
higher genus. The main approach will be to replace the geometric spaces with
algebraic structures called categories of matrix factorizations. This is of
independent interest in itself: the invariants of these categories should be
closely related to the Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten invariants, but such a
relationship is not explicitly known.
