In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Ahmed H. Zewail of the California Institute of Technology will
continue a series of investigations in his research program on the dynamics of
molecular energy redistribution and reactions. Four specific areas are planned
for investigation: 1) Study of the intramolecular vibrational energy
redistribution (IVR) in reactive and non-reactive systems with particular
attention given to mode specificity, its nature and time scale, the roles played
by rotations and collisions, and the influence of symmetry; 2) study of the
reaction rates and intermediates of elementary systems, emphasizing the effects
of total energy, mode specificity, and the role of angular momentum; 3) study of
the elementary dynamics in complex systems, with applications to organic and
organometallic systems; and 4) theoretical investigations of IVR, reaction rates
and molecular dynamics. These investigations are at the forefront of
contemporary physical chemistry, dealing with fundamental aspects of chemical
reactions and dynamics on a molecular scale.
