0322308&lt;br/&gt;McGovern&lt;br/&gt;This is a Dissertation Proposal by Dr.
Thomas McGovern for Ragnar Edvardsson, CUNY Hunter College, to do ethnohistoric
and archaeological research on Northwestern Icelandic fishing sites from the
Medieval period. The proposed research will shed light on a very important
period in Icelandic history, the development of commercial fisheries. Utilizing
data from the archaeological record the PI hypothesizes a more dynamic
interaction between society and nature than previously described in Iceland from
analyses of the historic record alone. This research potentially could provide
deeper insight into 13th century societal influences on fish stocks that could
have implications for contemporary fisheries management worldwide.
