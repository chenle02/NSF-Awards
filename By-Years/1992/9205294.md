The Department of Mathematics at the Florida State University will purchase a
Silicon Graphics IRIS 4D/310VGX graphics supercomputer, which will be dedicated
to the support of research in fluid dynamics, dynamical systems, and
applications of geometry by members of the department. The equipment will
support high end graphics software needed for research on dynamics of galaxies,
time dependent shock layer flows, dynamics and structure of the earth's magnetic
field, and simulation of jet noise generation. This research is being conducted
by four mathematicians; Christopher Hunter, McKenizie Professor of Mathematics;
David Kopriva, David E. Loper, and Christopher K. W. Tam.
