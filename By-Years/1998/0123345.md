This is a detailed computational analysis of the elementary reaction steps
leading to the growth of planar and curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) and subsequently to carbon particles. Thermodynamic properties are
computed by means of density functional theory (DFT) using BLYP and B3LYP
functionals. Vibrational analysis is performed on the optimized geometries
followed by determination of entropies and heat capacities. Uncertainties are
assessed by comparing the results with higher-level computations using the
complete basis set (CBS) method. Kinetic parameters at the high-pressure limit
are determined by transition-state theory, while pressure dependence of
chemically activated reactions is analyzed with quantum Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel
(QRRK) theory. Competitive reactions of PAH radicals with acetylene, hydrogen,
oxygen, and hydroxyl are assessed. The data predictions are incorporated into an
existing kinetic model and tested for benzene, acetylene, and ethylene flames
using data previously generated on flame structures in these systems including
mole-fraction profiles of planar and curved PAHs and fullerenes.
