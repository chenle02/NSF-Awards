This project is concerned with mathematical techniques fromnatural language
processing systems- specifically, fromunification-based grammar formalism- to
help in the design odata and knowledge bases. These techniques include the use
offeature theory, features logic, hyperset theory, and type systemsfrom
polymorphic functional programming languages. The goal ofthe project is to use
these techniques to move knowledge and datamodels closer together, while
providing for at least some aspectsof heterogeneity in knowledge bases.
