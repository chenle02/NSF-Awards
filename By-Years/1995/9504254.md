Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems
Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly sponsored by the
Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs. Work to be
performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project
named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean
and its impact on global change. The primary goals of SHEBA are: (1) to develop,
test and implement models of arctic ocean-atmosphere-ice processes that
demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate, including
its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the
interpretation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis of
the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model input, model
validation and climate monitoring. This work will develop, construct, and
prepare for deployment a 35-GHz cloud monitoring radar which will be built
specifically for autonomous operation at the main SHEBA ice camp. This unique
instrumentation will be useful in addressing an identified scientific issue of
SHEBA: the sea arctic cloud-radiation feedback mechanism. Vertical profiles of
cloud structural and microphysical properties will be measured continuously and
under conditions when no other sensors are able to provide comparable
observations. Some of these properties are cloud boundaries, the existence of
multiple layers and optically thick layers, ice crystal fallspeeds, and, with
information from other systems, characteristic ice particle size, concentration,
and mass content.
