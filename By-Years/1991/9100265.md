This project will bring 12 undergraduate students to the intelligent Systems
Lab of American University for 8 weeks during the Summer of 1991 to do research
into the design and use of expert systems and neural networks. The focus will be
on a synergism of expert systems and neural networks techniques as applied to
real world problems, particularly in the biomedical area. During the first 2
weeks students will receive training in the use of expert systems and neural
network tools, followed by 6 weeks of intensive research. Six faculty members
from the Computer Science and Information Systems department will direct the
student research and generally act as mentors.
