This project allows a student to conduct dissertation research in Italy on an
alternative psychiatric treatment program. The student will study the program
called "Democratic Psychiatry", a system whereby patients are
deinstitutionalized and the treatment focuses on reorienting the patients'
understanding of society and their illness. The hypotheses to be tested focus
upon the degree of similarity between the patient's model of his or her illness
and the prevailing institutional model of the illness: the more congruent the
understanding of patients and practitioners about the problem, the more likely
the patient will be improved. Methods to be used include intensive interviewing
of personnel and participant observation in a Mental Health clinic, and
interviews with a stratified random sample of 25 patients including life
histories, and discourse analysis. A standard psychometric instrument will be
used to evaluate treatment outcomes. This project is important because it
studies the process whereby patients and practitioners negotiate, redefine, and
reinterpret the reality of the illness and its betterment (as opposed to the
view that the illness is caused by external factors and cured by technicians
acting upon a passive patient). As such it contributes to current theories of
the culturally determined, interactional nature of illness, in specific, and of
human behavior in general.
