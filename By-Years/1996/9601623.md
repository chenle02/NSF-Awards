CTS - 9601623 Arup L. Sengupta Lehigh University ABSTRACT The grant will allow
the purchase of several instruments including atomic absorption
spectrophotometer, capillary electrophoresis chromatograph, mercury porosimeter
with surface analyzer, epiflourescene microscope and thermometric calorimeter.
The on going research activities in environmental, geo-environmental and
contaminant hydrology areas at Lehigh University will greatly benefit from the
acquisition of the instruments. Specifically, these instruments will help
accomplish the following two objectives: first, to characterize the key physical
and chemical properties of a wide range of particulate matters including soils,
natural and synthetic sorbents, metal precipitates, sludges and microorganisms;
and second, to analyze trace concentrations of environmentally important
chemicals, namely, heavy metals, organic solvents, dissolved cations and anions,
pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Also, increased opportunities
for inter-disciplinary research are likely to follow. ***
