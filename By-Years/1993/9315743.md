9315743 Zahalak This award will partially support travel costs associated with
the visit by Professor George Zahalak of the Department of Mechanical
Engineering at Washington University, St. Louis, to conduct collaborative
research with Dr. Peter Hunter of the School of Engineering at the University of
Auckland in New Zealand. The research will focus on the modification of an
existing biophysically-based model of skeletal muscle for application to cardiac
mechanics. The Distribution-Moment (DM) Model will be modified in order to
account for the specialized mechanics of cardiac muscle. Success will result in
a mathematically tractable model based on biophysical cross-bridge theory, and
should lead to integration with current information on fiber architecture
resulting in a model for cardiac function including features of activation,
mechanics, energetics and metabolism. Dr. Hunter's extensive experience in
cardiac biomechanics will complement Dr. Zahalak's background in the modelling
of contraction dynamics.
