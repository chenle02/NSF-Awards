9706473 Spear The goal of this project is to collect data on the distribution of
trace elements in garnet and coexisting metamorphic minerals from two localities
- western New Hampshire and western Maine. This data will be integrated with
observations of the major element zoning and reaction history analysis using
different thermodynamics algorithms (Gibbs method) modified to incorporate trace
elements. Trace element zoning will be characterized using the electron and ion
microprobe. Two- and three-dimensional x-ray maps will also be obtained.
Progressive metamorphism will be modeled as an equilibrium recrystallization
process and predictions made of the zoning in garnet. PI will also evaluate the
extent to which equilibrium is attained as trace elements partition during
metamorphic reactions through garnet and staurolite zones.
