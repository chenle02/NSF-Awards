Recently, reconstructing full and detailed 3D models for large-scale urban
environments has become the crucial technology for many applications and offers
a natural platform for different services. Although conventional structure from
motion (SFM) techniques have been engineered to their maturity, they normally do
not utilize rich global structures of urban scenes, including regularity,
symmetry, and self-symmetry; and the very repetitive shapes and textures
ubiquitous in urban scenes make detecting and matching features extremely
challenging for the conventional techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
develops a novel approach for inferring highly accurate 3D geometry from an
individual or multiple 2D images of an urban scene. It takes full advantage of
the rich global symmetry and regularity in urban scenes by leveraging powerful
computational tools from modern high-dimensional convex optimization. The
developed method can accurately recover the regular 3D geometry and 2D texture
of the scene directly from the raw image pixels/regions without relying on
extracting any intermediate local features. The research includes developing a
set of useful tools and a full system that can significantly improve the
efficiency and scalability of 3D modeling of large urban scenes and give
significantly more compact representation of the 3D geometry and 2D appearance,
enabling online real-time rendering and
visualization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research results from this project can be
easily integrated into and significantly improve the current computer vision
course on 3D reconstruction. The associated technologies can be useful for a
very wide range of commercial applications such as online or mobile visual
search, visual guidance, navigation, or surveillance, virtual tourism, and
augmented reality etc.
