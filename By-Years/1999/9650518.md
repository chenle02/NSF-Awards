This project supports the department's use of a Nd:YAG-pumped dye laser and the
associated electronics equipment in the undergraduate chemistry program.
Incorporation of a pulsed, tunable laser into the teaching and research
laboratories reflects contemporary research activities in physical and inorganic
chemistry. The new instrumentation has a major impact on the upper-division
teaching and laboratory courses. Beginning with the spectroscopy laboratory of
the physical chemistry sequence, students learn the basics of lasing and tuning,
collecting signals, data acquisition, and instrument-to-computer interfacing.
They then apply this know-how to collecting the absorption spectra of Neon and
Argon. Building on this experiment, students measure and assign the one- and
two-photon absorption spectra of phenanthrene. In the senior-level inorganic
laboratory, students use the equipment to investigate the long-range electron-
transfer kinetics through metalloproteins. Here, they learn the fundamentals of
transient absorption and emission spectroscopy. Additionally, the laser system
may be used extensively in two undergraduate research laboratories, one that
focuses on inorganic photochemistry and the other, on materials research.
