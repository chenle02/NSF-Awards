The I/UCRC for Dielectrics and Piezoelectrics will engage in the continuous
exploration for new functional dielectric and piezoelectric materials and new
strategies for integration that expand fundamental understanding, that drive the
evolution of existing technologies, and that provide the pathways for disruptive
innovation. The CDP?s collective expertise merges conventional dielectrics,
organic composites, electrochemistry, thin-film science, and microelectronic
materials and methods. The center?s faculty members offer fundamental academic
insight and experimental flexibility to generate the science push towards next-
generation materials, while industry partners from across the supply chain bring
unique insight regarding new product concepts and consumer needs to establish a
technology pull for next generation devices.

The I/UCRC for Dielectrics and Piezoelectrics aims to develop a diverse human
capital and enhance scientific research, infrastructure, and societal impact
through engagement with industry. Through targeted recruiting efforts, the CDP
plans to integrate a diverse group of faculty and students in the Center,
particularly participants from underrepresented groups (females and minorities)
and veterans. In addition, the center intends to develop relationships with
strategic international institutions to enhance the research capabilities of the
CDP and to provide international research opportunities for graduate students.
Center research and human capital development targets impact of our nation?s
energy, transportation, security and medical infrastructure by advancing
materials that underpin critical technologies for these sectors.
