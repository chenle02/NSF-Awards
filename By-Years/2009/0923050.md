Computational Science and Engineering Parallel Cluster&lt;br/&gt;Project
Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, acquiring a new computational science and
engineering cluster, seeks to provide the faculty and students regular access to
a modern, on-campus parallel computer for their research. Servicing Mechanical
and Aerospace Engineering, Physics and Space Science, Marine and Environmental
Engineering, Oceanography, and Mathematical Sciences, the project aims to
continue conducting research involving parallel computing in a wide variety of
disciplines. Due to its age, an existing Beowulf Cluster acquired in 2001 has
proved insufficient to conduct the current research and more powerful computing
resources are sought. The proposed instrument consists of a 48 node cluster
where each node has 2 quad-core 2 GHz CPUs. The computing power of this machine
will enable the large-scale simulations needed in the application areas of ocean
modeling, space weather, and material science. In these areas researchers have
simulation codes, but need increased computing power to do the required runs.
The new machine is expected to allow greater fidelity simulation on important
application, such as the impact of space radiations on astronauts and electronic
components on satellites. Other applications need the increased computing power
and are beginning to parallelize their codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: This project contributes to increase on-campus access for students to
develop their parallel programming skills. Building on past experience, careers
in high performance and parallel computing will be encouraged. The students will
be trained more in depth in the area and Parallel Computing will continue to be
part of research at the institution.&lt;br/&gt;
