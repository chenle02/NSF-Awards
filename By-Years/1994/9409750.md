9409750 Ma This Research Initiation Proposal is to synthesize and process
macroscopic, dense, nanophase metals and alloys for a systematic study of the
fundamental properties of non-equilibrium materials. Emphasis will be given to
their densification and deformation behaviors and mechanisms, as well as their
kinetics of microstructural evolution and thermodynamic stability. Efforts will
be directed towards obtaining large samples which will then allow traditional
mechanical tests to be conducted. Extraordinarily high pressures during
consolidation will be used to enhance plastic deformation during densification
in order to obtain the advantages of small grain size with reduced chances of
grain growth. ***
