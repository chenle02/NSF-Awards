The project revolves around the idea that learning physics is the most effective
in an interactive learning environment involving two related components that are
usually kept separate: a real-world experiment and a computer-based
visualization. In this project, we will create a learning environment that
combines microcomputer-based laboratories (MBLs) with immersive virtual-reality
technology. While MBLs will provide students with the possibility of real-world
experimenting and data collection, supported by real-time graphing tools,
virtual reality technology will be used to support the visualization of both
visible and invisible physical processes and abstract concepts (e.g., vectors of
forces, field lines or energy levels) underlying the same experiment students
observe in MBLs. The research objective of the current project is to investigate
how different aspects of computer-based visualization, supported by immersive
virtual reality and MBLs, affect and interact with student-generated
visual/spatial representations and students' qualitative understanding of
abstract physics phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts,
the project will bring new insights as to how to use visualization to facilitate
student' conceptual understanding. In addition, the project will give a
theoretical basis for design and evaluation of educational materials involving
different visual/spatial representations. Tools and materials we develop in the
project will make it easier for faculty around the country to develop students'
visualization skills and qualitative reasoning in introductory physics
classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational objective of the proposal is to
develop educational software and curriculum materials in the area of
introductory mechanics with a focus on visualization processes, which allow
students to participate actively in their own learning and to construct
scientific models.&lt;br/&gt;
