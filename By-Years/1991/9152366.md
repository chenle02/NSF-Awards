The Department of Chemistry is purchasing equipment to enable undergraduate
students to study solids in a general chemistry course. The laboratory
experiments include the synthesis of superconducting oxides and their subsequent
analysis using x- ray powder diffractometry. This solid state laboratory is also
used by advanced undergraduate students in studies of crystal structure and
phase analysis.
