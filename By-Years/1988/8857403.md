Dr. Wie has been selected as a Presidential Young Investigator. He is active in
fundamental research on materials science of III-V compound semiconductors. In
the research program for he National Science Foundation he will pursue studies
to include the growth of III-V heterojunction materials, million electron volt
ion beam processing of semiconductors, and thin film oxide superconducting
materials. Techniques utilized in the research include Raman spectroscopy,
phonon frequency shift techniques, electrical characterization, x-ray
diffraction, Hall spectroscopy, deep level trap spectroscopy, and organometallic
vapor deposition. The research in this grant will have impact on the processing
and characterization of semiconducting and superconducting materials technology.
The interactions with industry which are inherent with Presidential Young
Investigator grants will have implications for national competitiveness in the
electronics field.
