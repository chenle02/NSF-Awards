This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
development of a miniaturized and inexpensive solid-state electrochemical carbon
dioxide gas sensor for environmental air quality control, based on a novel-
sensing concept, utilizing solid polymer electrolytes and thick film device
miniaturization techniques. Carbon dioxide emissions are a global issue. In
addition, CO2 monitoring and control in offices, homes, indoor sport arenas,
enclosed parking garages and schools are of growing importance. The method of
infrared spectroscopy is predominantly used in commercially available carbon
dioxide monitors. Although the infrared spectroscopic system offers acceptable
precision, it is large and relatively expensive. To the best of our knowledge no
solid state, room temperature electrochemical carbon dioxide sensor is
commercially available for environmental air quality control applications. The
proposed novel electrochemical sensor, which could be configured as a handheld
or a panel mount room device or for surface mounting on air ducts, will be
reliable, inexpensive and compact and will yield an enhanced response signal at
room temperature, utilizing miniaturized thick film sensors for CO2 monitoring
in environmental applications. The feasibility of the proposed novel concept
will be demonstrated and the best catalyst material and thick film sensor design
parameters will be identified.

The potential commercial applications for the proposed solid state, room
temperature electrochemical carbon dioxide sensor include: A) Indoor
Environmental Quality (IEQ) control applications where demand control
ventilation based on CO2 concentration of residential, commercial and industrial
spaces occupied by people, could improve energy efficiency while simultaneously
improving the indoor environment. B) Agricultural and bio-related process
applications. The growth rate and development of plants can be improved by
controlling the concentration of carbon dioxide. C) Food packaging industry. In
the meat packaging industry, a high concentration of CO2 in the packaging
inhibits bacterial growth and retains the natural color of the meat. D) Medical
applications where an inexpensive electrochemical sensor could be used to
measure the concentration of carbon dioxide in an exhaled breathe and could be
incorporated in breathing systems.
