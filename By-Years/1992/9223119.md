An innovative method to control and enhance turbulent heat transfer through the
use of Lorentz force is proposed. Properly directed, the force control
turbulence production in the boundary layers. This approach is called magnetic
turbulence control (MTC). The feasibility of the method has been demonstrated in
experiments on flat plate turbulent boundary layers with Reynolds number (based
on momentum thickness) 1700. Measured turbulent stress was reduced by 90%.
Laser-sheet flow visualization confirms the substantial reductions in turbulent
motion at y+ = &lt; 15. One of the attractive features of this approach is that
through the proper selection of E and B fields and the introduction of the
conducting fluid, very small power consumption is needed. In the proposed
research, MTC will be extended to thermal boundary layers in water. Correlations
between electromagnetic field strengths, heat transfer and shear stress will be
determined. A further area of investigation may be the effect of MTC at
increased Reynolds numbers.
