A series of workshops for 20 middle schools teachers each will be offered, one
per semester over the next 2 academic years. The topics covered will be
Acoustics, Optics, Electricity and Newton's Laws. Participants will be given a
collection of experimental apparatus together with a manual with a detailed
discussion of the series of experiments that can be performed with the
apparatus. Emphasis in the workshop will be on the study of physics through
experimentation using the techniques of prediction, experimentation and
observation discussion and concept formation and modelling these teaching
techniques which teachers can use in their classrooms. Follow up activities will
include a physics demonstration program to be given co-operatively by the
workshop director and the participating teacher for the students in the schools.
Cost sharing is 31%.
