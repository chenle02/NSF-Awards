For a product to be designed properly, it must be able to be manufactured in
sufficient quantity, in reasonable time, and at appropriate costs for its
market. The apparel industry is failing to fulfill any of these requirements and
individual firms are going bankrupt at an alarming rate. CAD/CAM vendors are not
designing the appropriate technology for technical design or patternmaking
segment, and not considering the domain expertise already inherent in the
industry. Stylometrics TM, an image codification language, representing pattern
styles as operational primitives, was designed to fill the missing gap of a
3D/2D P.D.S. (Pattern Design System). The investigator will research the
feasibility of computer supported decision-making in the apparel industry, using
this foundation language.
