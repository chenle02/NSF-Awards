This project is part of the Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant
program. A relatively junior minority scholar is supported to advance her
capacity to conduct research in the area of gender as a factor in African-
American adolescent's school performance. The PI will consult with several
leading scholars in this area of research at the University of California,
Berkeley, and at Princeton University, and will code and analyze data from an
existing survey of adolescents at a high school in Washington DC. The questions
to be asked will help assess the relative importance of gender, race and class
as factors explaining the differentials in school performance. This project is
important because it supports a promising minority scholar in her field of
study. Through relatively small investments in their future careers, the
Foundation hopes to stimulate the research productivity of minority scholars.
