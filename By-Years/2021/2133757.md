The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is the acceleration of the development of innovative industrial design
concepts involving complex turbulent fluid flow using computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) software. Although CFD software has broad applications in several
industries, the companyâ€™s particular interest is in bodies with strong vortical
wakes such as bio-inspired renewable energy extraction devices and electric
vertical takeoff/landing (eVTOL) vehicles. It is anticipated that the project
may lead to the timely and cost-effective design of energy extraction devices
without the need to build and test prototypes during the design phase. The
project may also enhance the safety and operating envelope of urban air mobility
vehicles. The proposed cloud-based CFD software will provide startups and
smaller companies (without access to high-performance computing resources) with
the ability to perform CFD analysis in reasonable timeframes. The proposed novel
reformulation of the Navier-Stokes equations will also have a lasting impact on
the education of the next generation of engineers and scientists as they gain a
better understanding of the advantages of the new set of equations for turbulent
flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
I project seeks to develop a fast high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) software for predicting unsteady flow separations over complex geometries
at large Reynolds (Re) numbers without any heuristic turbulence modeling. The
software will build upon prior work by the proposer who developed a novel
flexion-based Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method for high Re turbulent flows.
The LES method uses the flexion (vorticity curl) vector as the primary dependent
variable in the Navier-Stokes equations to better track sharp vorticity-gradient
regions in high Re flows. The method also uses hyperviscous dissipation instead
of a parameterized sub-grid model for unresolved small-scale turbulent motions.
The flexion-based LES method will be extended to complex geometries by coupling
it with a vortex panel method for the body surface. The vortex panel method
leads to accurate predictions of the shear stress on wall boundaries from the
wall vorticity without the computationally demanding requirement of a fine mesh
to resolve the thin boundary layers that occur in high Re flows. The proposed
approach represents a new technique of using panel methods, which have a rich
history in aerodynamics, to provide boundary conditions for large eddy
simulations of the vortical wake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
