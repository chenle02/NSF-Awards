This project is revitalizing the teaching of microbiology by implementing two
novel approaches at the undergraduate liberal arts college level. The aim is to
make connections between original questions in organismal and environmental
biology, and the new molecular techniques that may be used to answer them.
First, the microbiology laboratory course is being reconfigured to focus on
enrichment, isolation, and culturing of metabolically and physiologically
diverse microorganisms. This approach is motivated by the declining appreciation
of microbial diversity by students who will be the scientists of tomorrow. The
project seeks to familiarize students with methods to grow and handle strict
anaerobes, phototrophs, thermophiles, and others. At the same time, training in
techniques with which all microbiologists must be familiar, such as aseptic
technique, quantitation of microbes, and isolation techniques, will be
incorporated. Second, Microbiology is being linked to our Molecular Biology
course through the use of molecular methods to identify microbial isolates.
According to various estimates, perhaps less than 1 percent of bacterial species
have been cultured in the laboratory; hence, microbiologists today are turning
to other means for identifying microorganisms. The project introduces students
to methods for amplifying ribosomal RNA genes by the polymerase chain reaction,
cloning the amplified fragments, and sequencing the cloned fragments using
thermal cyclers. With their sequence data, students can search databases,
including a ribosomal RNA database, in order to identify isolates from
Microbiology or organisms from enrichments or other samples. There is expected
to be an increased interest in independent research by the students on the basic
biology of "difficult" microorganisms. This expectation is based not only on the
availability of equipment to study them, but also on a heretofore undeveloped
appreciation of their significance.
