The research objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with
Industry (GOALI) award, executed jointly by Purdue University, Haynes
International, and Special Metals Corporation, is to investigate the causes of
surface defects in electroslag remelting (ESR) of nickel superalloys. During
ESR, a liquid slag cap sits on top of a liquid metal pool which is fed by molten
metal drops falling through the slag. As the process proceeds, slag-metal
interactions can embed slag patches in the metal and can form regions in which
the metal is in contact with the mold; both defects cost time, materials, and
energy. We will develop a numerical process model to predict the behavior of the
slag-metal interface throughout the process, the final surface roughness, and
the bulk ingot characteristics. Also, Purdue student interns will collect data
from industrial processes to determine the defect structure in the slag and the
surrounding metal. This study will bring to light the possible formation
mechanisms of this expensive class of defects, which understanding will be used
by industry to design control strategies and to improve yield and lower costs
and energy usage.

This GOALI project will strengthen ties among the organizations through
collaborative research and placement of students and faculty in industrial
internships. These companies expect that most of their new development work will
be in response to the energy sector, which has requirements for higher
temperatures and pressures and more corrosive environments. Realization of these
plans will only be facilitated by proper alloy and process design, which this
proposal will aid. The partners are tightly connected and the collaborations are
designed to expose students to cutting-edge process technology vital to the
nation's economy and security. The PI will spend part of a summer at the Haynes
research lab, each company will hire a summer intern from Purdue each year, and
the PI will include undergraduates researchers in the project.
