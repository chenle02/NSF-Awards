9362014 Bradley The goal of this project is to develop a computer based single
cell image analysis system based on the company's novel gel microdrop (GMD)
technology. This project combines the company's proprietary GMD technology with
recent developments in other fields such as fluorescent dye chemistry,
microscopy, digital processing, and optics. The core GMD technology allows
identification, analysis and separation of single cells based on cell function
such as growth, drug susceptibility, protein secretion, enzyme activity, or
metabolite production, or cell composition parameters such a surface markers,
internal proteins, or nucleic acid sequences. Using a commercially available
image analysis system, this project intends to demonstrate feasibility by
imaging a model hybridoma secretion assay which will both identify hybridomas
secreting higher amounts of antibody and allow recovery for use in biotechnology
applications. In Phase II, the company expects to optimize a single cell image
analysis system for use in drug discovery and bioprocessing research. ***
