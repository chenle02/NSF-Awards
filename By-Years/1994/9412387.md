9412387 Tessier University of Akron Dr. Claire Tessier, Chemistry Department,
University of Akron, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry Program for the preparation of main group and
transition metal heterocyclynes. Cyclyne ligands are cyclic polyalkynes. The
first goal of the research is the synthesis of cyclynes with three alkynes, two
phenyl groups and a heteroatom in an 11 membered ring. The heteroatoms to be
included in the ring include main and transition metals. The interaction of
these heterocyclynes with further transition metals will be investigated,
particularly in regard to the formation of complexes in which a transition metal
is complexed within the cavity of the ligand. The geometric constraints of the
cavity and ring may force a metal-metal bonding interaction between metals in
the ring and those in the cavity. Unsymmetrical compounds which contain two
metals are being exploited to activate small molecules like carbon monoxide and
as non-linear optical materials. This study will form a new class of such
complexes by forming a metal containing ring of atoms which contains a cavity
which a second metal may enter. The two metals will be close enough to interact
with each other, and this may yield new systems capable of activating small
molecules and give rise to unique optical properties.
