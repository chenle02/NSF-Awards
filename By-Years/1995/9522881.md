The specific aims of this research are to develop novel catalytic and
enantioselective cyclization methods, to investigate the scope and selectivity
of zirconocene-mediated cyclometallation of dienes with dialkylmagnesium
reagents, to study the range of functionality that can be tolerated by this
catalyst system and to develop new chiral tantalum catalysts for
cyclometallation reactions. With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program
supports the research of Dr. Robert M. Waymouth of the Department of Chemistry
at Stanford University. Professor Waymouth will focus his work on developing
catalytic methods for the stereo- and enantioselective construction of
polycyclic rings using transition metals. Many antitumor, antibiotic and
antifungal agents are chiral and contain polycyclic rings. Efficient synthesis
of enantiomerically pure pure molecules with these structural subunits remains a
formidable but central challenge to organic synthesis
