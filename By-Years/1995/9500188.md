9500188 Wunsch II The Department of Electrical Engineering at Texas Tech
University will purchase computer simulation and visualization equipment which
will be dedicated to support research in eingineering. The equipment will be
used for several projects, including in particular neural network methods for
control, system identification, prediction, image compression, and image
analysis. These projects have in common high computational requirements in
simulation, and difficulty in data analysis requireing special visualizaiton
tools. The equipment selected is especially designed with these needs I mind.
Furthermore, the manufacturer has an agreement with one of the leading neural
network small businesses. This allows simulation of some of the most
sophisticated and dirfficult neural network designs on their computer. This
company has agreed to additional cost sharing in the form of a free site licence
for this project because they believe in it and are interested in seeing the
results. This additional cost sharing is above and beyond the required
insititional commitment.
