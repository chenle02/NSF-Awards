Jian Li Spectral Analysis of Gapped or Missing Data

This research focuses on the spectral analysis of gapped or incomplete data
sequences. The gapped or missing data problem usually arises when contiguous
data measurements for a long time are hard to obtain or the measurements during
some intervals are not useful due to strong interference or jamming and must be
discarded. Spectral analysis of gapped or incomplete data sequences holds
promise to advance many fields including astronomy, communications, medical
imaging, radar, and underwater acoustics.

This research involves the development and application of efficient and robust
spectral analysis algorithms for incomplete data sequences. The goals of this
research are to devise and evaluate statistically sound and mathematically solid
spectral analysis methods for various applications that involve the spectral
analysis of gapped or incomplete data sequences, to gain both practical and
theoretical insights into the algorithm properties including accuracy,
resolution, convergence, and computational complexity, and to understand the
impacts of large gaps or large numbers of missing data samples on the algorithm
design. It is anticipated that the results of this study will significantly
impact the advances of many practical applications.
