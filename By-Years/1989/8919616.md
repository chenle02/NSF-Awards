ABSTRACT The purpose of this longitudinal study is to describe the acquisition
of the semantics of the tense and aspect system by adult learners of English as
a second language. Pilot research indicates that learners achieve native-like
command of the morphosyntax of the tense and aspect system before they acquire
native-like semantics. This study will document the differential development of
morphosyntax and semantics by long-term observation of learners. Natural and
experimental language samples will be collected from twenty learners of English
over a period of one year as they move from beginning to advanced levels of
proficiency. These samples will be analyzed with respect to English to determine
how target-like the interlanguage system is, on the one hand, and independently,
to understand the internal characteristics of the developing system, on the
other. In addition, the emerging semantics will be compared across learners to
ascertain the extent of target and native language influence and the
universality of the developing systems. Besides describing one facet of language
acquisition, the results of this study will contribute important new information
about the nature of interlanguage semantics and provide evidence about the
ability of the adult mind to acquire language.
