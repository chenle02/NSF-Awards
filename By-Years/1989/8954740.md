The goal of the program is to establish a model science program for
undergraduate elementary preservice teachers designed to meet the needs of
minority students, especially the Hispanic and Black populations. The project
has four major components: one the recruitment and retention of minority
students who are interested in becoming specialists in the teaching of science
to young children; two the revision of thirteen science and education courses in
the elementary school teacher preparation program and general science major;
three the development of field placements in elementary school science
classrooms that have substantial minority enrollments; and four the
dissemination of information on such a model science program for future
elementary school teachers. In addition to serving the 270 currently enrolled
preservice teachers, this program will target fifteen newly admitted minority
students per year, who will have been given full scholarships by the
institution. In order to improve the retention rate of these students, the
project will also develop a number of support programs such as the Summer
Vestibule Program, special tutoring opportunities, mentorships, and
multicultural sensitization seminars.
