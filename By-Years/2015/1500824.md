Insights into language are enriched through cross-disciplinary investigation.
The Indigenous Place Names, Language, and History conference will bring together
experts in biology, traditional ecological knowledge, archaeology, linguistics,
museum studies, cultural anthropology, education, ethnohistory, art, music, and
indigenous law to share information from many perspectives on Tlingit (tli)
language and culture. In addition to social scientists and humanities experts,
the conference will include equal participation and presentations from Tlingit
speakers and other tradition bearers who hold keys to contextualize linguistic
and cultural findings. Under the direction of Alice Taff of Tlingit Readers,
Incorporated, this Clan conference will generate knowledge on place names from
coastal Southeastern Alaska from Yakutat south to Ketchikan.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference proceedings and presentations will be archived
at the SeaAlaska Heritage Institute, Alaska State Library, and
clanconference.org websites. The session will be available for viewing at
