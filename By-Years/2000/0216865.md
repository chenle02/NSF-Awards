The funds provided by the NSF Instrumentation for Materials Research program
support Michigan State university with the acquisition of a unique micro-
compounding molding system to support research in emerging new bio-based
materials and polymers, and related educational programs. The equipment will be
used in support of research which includes: (i) investigation of fundamental
phenomena in newly developed bio-based materials and polymers, (ii) optimization
of processing parameters at the micro-scale - - to establish structure,
property, and performance relations and (iii) expansion of the integration of
research and education in the area of polymer blending, polymer compounding and
nanocomposites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds provided by the NSF
