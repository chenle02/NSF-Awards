ABSTRACT OPP-9630072 MASCHNER Recent research in the lower Alaska Peninsula and
Unimak Island has demonstrated that this area is critical to our understanding
of the development of Aleut society and human adaptation to climate change and
landscape evolution in the region. A broad regional approach to these problems
depends on large-scale systematic archaeological survey. Because of the expense
of doing survey in this remote region, satellite images, aerial photography, a
Geographic Information System and statistical modeling, combined with field
controls, will be employed and tested. If successful, this method will greatly
facilitate the discovery of archaeological sites and enhance our understanding
of regional ecology and human adaptation in the North Pacific region.
