ABSTRACT CTS-9417527 L. Collins It is proposed a Direct Numerical Simulation
(DNS) method to analyze the effect of turbulence on the aerosol formation and
coagulation of titanium dioxide pigment particles. Quantitative predictions of
the rate of nucleation, particle collisions, growth rates, and the final
particle size distribution will be obtained by calculating the coherent
turbulent structure and using microstructural aspects of the two-phase flow
system. The computational results will be compared to the experiments performed
at the DuPont Co. The proposed method, if successful, will open a new approach
to understand and predict the turbulent flow aerosol reactors, with application
to advance materials. ***
