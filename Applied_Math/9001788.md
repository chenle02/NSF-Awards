This proposal is to continue research in several areas of nonlinear applied
dynamics. Excitable systems---systems which can be triggered by a small stimulus
---arise as models of several physiological and chemical phenomena. It is
proposed to study such systems, with an emphasis on understanding the periodic
and aperiodic behavior that is seen. Another project is studying models of
polymerization reactors with multiple initiators, in collaboration with some
chemical engineers. The emphasis is to model industrial processes as completely
as possible and understand behaviors of reactors under different operating
conditions so as to effect control, and in particular, prevent catastrophic
runaway of reactors. It is also proposed to continue work on understanding the
stability of standing-and travelling-wave solutions of parabolic differential
equations.
