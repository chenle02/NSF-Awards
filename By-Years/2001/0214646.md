This study will use multiproxy study of cores from the Soledad Basin off Baja CA
to determine if bottom water oxygen changes over the last 10,000 years are
caused primarily by productivity changes in surface waters or changes in
ventilation of subsurface waters. Proxies to be measured include planktic
foraminifer assemblages, oxygen isotope ratio of Globigerina bulloides and N.
pachyderma, sediment Mo abundance, and Mg/Ca in benthic foraminifers. Chronology
will be provided by AMS 14C and 210Pb. Sample resolution for most proxies will
be 100 years. Mo measurements and sea surface temperature estimates will be done
at multidecadal sampling resolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
