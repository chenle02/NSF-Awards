Summer Institute For Science and Mathematics Teachers at Fermilab is a three
year project for 180 high school biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics
teachers to enhance their professional competence. Morning sessions will include
lectures to strengthen teacher's backgrounds and expose them to new ways of
approaching topics in their current classes. Plenary sessions will present
special topics on current scientific and mathematics research and societal
problems related to science and technology. After labs will be devoted to
current methods of computer application in data collection. Four graduate credit
will be awarded by Aurora University.
