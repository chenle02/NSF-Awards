9408826 DellaPenna A long-term goal of this research is understanding the
functional significance of developmentally regulated, polyuronide modifications
in plants. As part of prior NSF funding, the Beta- subunit of polygalacturonase
(PG1) was purified; cDNAs encoding the protein were isolated and characterized.
Beta-subunit mRNA accumulates to high levels in developing fruit and is to a
large degree temporally separated from catalytic PG2 expression. Homologous
sequences have been identified in a wide variety of plant species suggesting a
broad functional role for the protein in plants. The current working theory is
that the Beta-subunit defines a new class of bifunctional plant cell wall
proteins that interact both with structural components of the wall and catalytic
proteins, to localize and/or regulate metabolic activities within the cell wall.
This hypothesis can now be tested in transgenic tomoto fruit in which Beta-
subunit expression is inhibited by antisense RNA. The proposed research will
further address long- standing questions of how pectin-degrading enzymes are
targeted and regulated in plants and what the functional significance of pectin
degradation is in various tissues and cell types. ***
