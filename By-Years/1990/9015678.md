The transfer of material from one star to another in close "interacting binary"
star systems appears to proceed at a highly uneven pace. The evolution of these
systems depends sensitively on the average mass transfer rate. Therefore a
clarification of the nature of these modulations is important to an
understanding of both the origin and fate of these systems. The Principal
Investigator (PI) has received NSF support in the past to modernize and automate
the 16-inch telescope at Indiana University to conduct measures of star
brightnesses (photometry) more accurately and efficiently than in the past. The
PI now plans to use this equipment as well as a 40-inch telescope at U.S. Naval
Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona to conduct coordinated observations every
available clear night for three years of a sample of stars from three classes of
interacting binaries: cataclysmic binaries, dwarf novae, and "Algol" binaries.
The processes to be studied occur over timescales of days to years. The research
includes tests of the "hibernation theory" of nova evolution, the determination
of the relationship of the "supermaxima" to other features in the light curves
of dwarf novae, and the search for activity cycles in Algol systems.
