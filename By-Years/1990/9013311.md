The principle objective of this project is to support the distribution of
GENESIS, the GEneral NEural Simulation System developed over the last several
years in Professor Bower's laboratory. In particular the objective is to
establish and maintain the necessary hardware, software and personnel to support
offsite users of the GENESIS system. The support of offsite users encompasses
several areas. First, standard software support will be provided, including
access to new versions of GENESIS, existing documentation of both the simulator
and specific simulations developed using it, and comprehensive user "bug"
reports as they are reported. In addition to supplying the basic GENESIS system
to offsite users, Professor Bower and his staff will also provide a centralized
source through which both bug fixes and extensions to the GENESIS platform can
be distributed. They intend also to establish a centralized site through which
researchers will be able to communicate interactively in developing simulations.
Finally, due to the modular structure of the simulator and its component parts,
they will establish a central site through which new computationally interesting
models, simulator graphical tools and basic simulator "elements" can be shared
and distributed by GENESIS users.
