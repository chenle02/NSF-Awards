This biology-based interdisciplinary project offers an opportunity each year to
nearly 40 undergraduates, drawn from diverse subdisciplines of science and
humanities, to engage in research in anaerobic bioconversion. This research is
of value in educating the liberal arts students, many of whom will become
decision makers at various levels in the private and public sectors, to a number
of societal problems connected with the disposal of solid wastes. Through field
research and laboratory experience, students investigate the physical and
chemical composition of biomass (local municipal solid waste, agricultural and
animal wastes) and the biological and physical parameters of the anaerobic
process that converts the waste biomass into useful chemicals and fuel. Using
modern laboratory equipment, science and nonscience students cooperate in
generating data on anaerobic digestion. The grant is providing a gas
chromatograph, fermentors, photo- micrographic equipment, and a system for
computerized data collection and analysis. With these tools the students are
studing such topics as the microbial colonization of the biomass surface, the
amount and composition of gases/chemicals produced, reduction of total/volatile
solids, and resource economics. This interdisciplinary approach to learning
sensitizes science majors to societal concerns, as well as influencing non-
scientists to develop a regard for science and an appreciation of its potential
for helping solve many of the problems faced by the citizens of a modern
technological society.
