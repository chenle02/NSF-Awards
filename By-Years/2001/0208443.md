A tomographic technique will be used to map solar wind structures, determine the
extent of their interactions with the Earth, and locate their origins in the
solar corona. The basic input data are interplanetary radio scintillation
measurements supplied by the Solar Terrestrial Environment Laboratory of the
Nagoya University (Japan). These are combined with a sophisticated numerical
magnetohydrodynamic model of the heliosphere in order to reconstruct the
trajectories of propagating interplanetary disturbances. This technique will be
applied in real-time to ground and space-based data, and the results will be
made available to the international community through the NOAA web-site. This
study will allow the visualization of the extensive region between the Sun and
the Earth with a novel level of completeness.
