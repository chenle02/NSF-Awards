The investigators are creating a two-semester introduction to the principles and
practice of mathematics for students at an average college or university who
wish to study a significant amount of mathematics, including majors and minors
in mathematics, computer science, and many science and engineering disciplines.
This course is being designed as an alternate (to the standard calculus
sequence) route into the mathematics curriculum, one which stresses breadth and
includes much of the modern mathematics and applications which are currently
"homeless" in the mathematics curricula of today's colleges. The Phase I design
will be overseen by an advisory/editorial board and author team with a wide
range of mathematical expertise, education, and writing experience.
