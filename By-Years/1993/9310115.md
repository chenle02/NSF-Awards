Ha Four fault simulators and automatic test pattern generators (ATPGs), produced
in research projects at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, are being developed
and enhanced so as to bring them into a state for distribution to general users.
These tools are: 1. FSIM, combinational circuit fault simulator; 2. HOPE, a
synchronous sequential fault simulator; 3. ATALANTA, an ATPG for stuck-at faults
in combinational circuits; and 4. SOPRANO, an ATPG for stuck-open faults in
combinational circuits.
