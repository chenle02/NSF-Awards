IBN-9723562 PI: Saidel Some animals live at the interface between the two
different environments of air and water and demonstrate sensory specializations
for detecting signals from the two environments. One such example is a fish that
lives just below the water surface and feeds at the surface, while needing to
escape predators (such as birds) that strike from above the surface. This
project investigates how different objects above the fish may be lead to
behaviors of feeding or of escape, depending on size, motion, and presence in
the visual field of both eyes. Videotaping of behavioral responses to diverse
targets will be used to characterize the features important to these opposite
responses. Anatomical studies suggest that this fish has an unusual visual
pathway connecting to a special visual center in the brain, and this work will
examine the details of connections of this visual pathway from and to other
visual centers. This integrated multi-disciplinary approach to a novel visual
system will have impact on our understanding how brain structure is related to
behavior, and by being in the category of Research at Undergraduate Institutions
it will have a substantial impact on getting undergraduates interested and
trained in high-quality research in neuroscience.
