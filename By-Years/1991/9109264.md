This is an Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award for 12
months duration. The Principal Investigator will investigate kinetics of Phase
Transformations in Alloys using a realistic microscopic Hamiltonian. The
Hamiltonian is derived from the effective medium theory of chemical binding. The
project is designed to help the principal investigator acquire expertise in the
techniques used to studying kinetics of phase transitions and critical
phenomena.
