The principal investigator will add a Hewlett Packard 310 computer and data
acquisition system to the existing materials testing and fluids mechanics
laboratory. Students in the Department of Technology will conduct experiments in
fan performance measurement, flow blockage, and tensile measurements. In a
unique experiment structure the students will study the principles of computer
aided data acquisition first. Using existing software, the students then will
conduct experiments in measuring the performance of fans, to include computer
calculated performance curves. Finally, the students will be given an open-ended
experiment to design, write the software and prepare computer generated reports.
This structure, covering experiments from "canned" to open- ended, will provide
the student with an excellent understanding of computer-aided experimentation.
