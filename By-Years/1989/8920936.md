A workstation cluster will be provided for researchers at Boston University for
research in the Department of Computer Science. This equipment is provided under
the Instrumentation Grants for Research in Computer and Information Science and
Engineering program. The research for which the equipment is to be used will be
principally in the area of reconfigurable reliable data storage, but will also
be used for database management, performance analysis, knowledge acquisition,
and database query optimization.
