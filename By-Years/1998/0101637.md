This project supports the development of seven new manufacturing degree programs
in the Pittsburgh area through a coalition known as PRIME - Partnership for
Regional Innovation in Manufacturing Education. These manufacuring programs
address twelve core competencies as identified by the Society of Manufacturing
Engineers. The coalition includes two-year and four-year institutions and
approximately fifty industrial partners. The project consists of the adaptation
of exemplary material from other manufacturing programs and the development of
twenty modules in engineering materials, manufacturing processes, quality and
metrology, computer applications in manufacturing, and programmable logic
controllers. An active, collaborative learning approach of exploration, dialog,
and application is being incorporated in the modules. Industry-supplied projects
for collaborative student teams are being developed, and newly-equipped
laboratory instrumentation is networked for cross-institutional use. Web-based
conferencing facilitates regional collaborative teaming
opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;
