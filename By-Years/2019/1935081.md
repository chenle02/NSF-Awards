This award will provide travel support for graduate students and early career
mathematicians from the United States to participate in the graduate school
"Latin American School on Algebraic Geometry and its Applications" (ELGA)that
will take place in Talca (Chile) from December 2 to 13, 2019. This will be the
fourth edition of the ELGA series: the previous events were held in Buenos Aires
(Argentina, 2011), Cabo Frio (Brazil, 2015) and Guanajuato (Mexico, 2017). ELGA
is a major mathematical event in Latin America and a focal meeting point for the
algebraic geometry community. Ph.D. students and postdocs will have an
opportunity to take intensive graduate courses from the world leaders in the
field, to build an international network to facilitate collaboration and
mentorship, and to disseminate their research to Latin American audiences. The
website of the conference is http://inst-mat.utalca.cl/~elga/ Over the course of
two weeks, courses by Jean-Pierre Demailly (University of Grenoble), Igor
Dolgachev (University of Michigan), Angela Ortega (Humboldt University), Vincent
Pilloni (Ecole normale superieure de Lyon) and Claire Voisin (Institut de
Mathematiques de Jussieu, Paris) will cover a wide range of topics of current
research in algebraic geometry, including hyperbolicity properties and entire
holomorphic curves in algebraic varieties, automorphisms of varieties, Prym
varieties and Prym maps, automorphic forms and, finally, obstructions to
rationality and stable rationality of complex projective varieties. Each course
will also include two hours of tutoring sessions led by advanced graduate
students. Ten additional talks by a combination of senior and junior researchers
are intended to give a panoramic view of algebraic geometry and closely related
subjects.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
