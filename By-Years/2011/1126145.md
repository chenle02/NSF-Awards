This Major Research Instrumentation grant supports the acquisition of an Applied
Biosystems 3500 Genetic Analyzer to support research and undergraduate education
at Texas A&amp;M International University (TAMIU), a Hispanic serving
institution in South Texas. The acquisition of a genetic analyzer will enable
the PI and students to collect sequence data and score a variety of molecular
markers, which will facilitate the construction of phylogenies, determine the
genetic structure of populations and provide a greater understanding of the
neuroendocrine and transcriptional mechanisms underlying complex social
behaviors. In addition to the PI's research program, the requested equipment
will advance the projects of numerous faculty, both at TAMIU and surrounding
colleges and universities. These faculty represent a great diversity of research
disciplines, including: genetics, microbiology, soil science, environmental
limnology, ecology, plant biology, and bioinformatics. Situated on the border in
South Texas, TAMIU serves a predominately Hispanic community; a group
historically underrepresented in science and math professions. Increasing the
participation of these students in cutting edge original research is critical to
broadening diversity in the sciences and enhancing the nation?s technological
and economic competitiveness. Results from this research will be disseminated
through regional and professional conferences, publications in scholarly
journals, as well as communicated to the general public in interviews with the
media, write-ups in lay publications, and lectures to non-professional
societies. The equipment supported by this proposal will provide outstanding
educational benefits to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students at
TAMIU and the surrounding area, enhancing the current curriculum and fostering
the creation new courses in genomics and bioinformatics.
