RF technology developed for cellular phone and global positioning systems (GPS)
was used in a SBIR Phase I project to design and build an amplitude modulator
and a frequency synthesizer. Thus, new RF technology was found to be feasible
for use in reducing the cost of NMR instrumentation substantially. In SBIR Phase
II newly available RF components are used to evaluate, design, and build an NMR
console. New audio digital signal processing capabilities will be explored,
which are currently available from certain computer manufacturers. The research
will enhance the demodulation sections of NMR receivers and lower the number of
components (and hence cost) without diminishing performance.
