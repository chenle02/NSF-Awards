Generative Model of Feature Interactions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
extends work in the area of Generative Programming, which explains how programs
in a domain are designed from features. A generative programming model is both
constructive and predictive because it tells us how to synthesize programs in a
domain with particular properties. A program's design can be specified as a base
program plus a set of features, which are units of program functionality.
Programs consisting of features can be formalized mathematically as an algebra
with suitable composition operators. Research in generative programming shows
that evaluation of algebraic expressions synthesizes the target program, and
expression optimization optimizes the program's design.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feature interaction occurs when one or more features
modify or influence another feature. We focus on interactions that are static
and structural: how a feature influences (or changes) the source code of another
feature. Our research contributes to a Science of Design by showing how feature
interactions obey algebraic laws that lead to highly structured programs that
are amenable to synthesis, optimization, and evolution. We will demonstrate
practical applications of our work: (1) refactoring Java legacy applications
into feature-based designs (so that features can be more easily added and
removed), and (2) realizing a form of on-demand modularization, where a query
specifies a particular concern and our theory tells us how to extract software
that satisfies that query.&lt;br/&gt;
