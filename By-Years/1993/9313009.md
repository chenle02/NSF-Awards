Vincent Vilker 9313009 This work is directed toward development of an economical
synthesis of oxygenated hydrocarbons using active cytochrome P-450 immobilized
on a working electrode. The immediate objectives are to determine
stoichiometries, product distributions, and kinetics of the hydroxylation of
hydrocarbons by NADH-driven P-450, to develop modified electrodes for the
regeneration of P-450, and to compare products, rates, and yields of the NADH
and electrochemically regenerated cytochrome P-450. Two forms of cytochrome are
studied: P-450cam and P-450soy; the similarities and differences are examined.
Hydrocarbon substrates include norcamphor, -pinene,
1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin), decahydronaphthalene (decalin), and
naphthalene. Regiospecificity and stereospecificity are examined, turnover rates
on the cytochrome are measured, and models of the process are developed. This
should lead to an energy-efficient bioelectrochemical process that combines the
efficiency of electrocatalysts with the specificity of enzymes, thus producing
good yields of high-value products with little unwanted side reaction. The
project is done in collaboration with the duPont Company.
