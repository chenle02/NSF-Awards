This project extended computer interfacing, i.e., computer control over
external devices, to undergraduate women science majors. A logical building
block approach is used in the fundamental course, Computer-Assisted
Experimentation, wherein student gain experience with microcontroller-based
systems, AST computer with digital and analog I/O boards, and communications
systems. These will include an introduction to robotics and remote monitoring.
The expertise gained in the fundamental course is applied in the automation of
data acquisition and data treatment in many experiments in the upper-level
laboratory program. Women students, in particular, need to actually carry out
automation in order to be confident, creative and productive in today's research
labs. The acquisition of multiple sets of equipment and software permitted a
number of students to gain crucial hands-on experience in both the fundament
course and the applications in the overall lab program. The institution
contributed to this project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
