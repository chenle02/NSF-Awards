The proposed effort will create a series of skill-building materials aimed at
meeting the special needs of blind students studying mathematics. These
documents will be in braille, audio tape, and ink print, aimed at blind
students, their mainstream teachers, their resource teachers and their parents.
These materials will allow more blind students to develop their full potential
in mathematics and science. In addition, computer based tools will be developed
for the quick generation of useful tactile diagrams.
