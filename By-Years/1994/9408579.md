9408579 Haussler This award will support research in the development of
statistical methods, algorithms and software for the analysis of protein and RNA
sequence data based on generalization of the hidden Markov model. Specifically
the investigators will use and develop Hidden Markov Models, Stochastic Graph
Grammars, and Markov Random Fields. These methods would have applications to
inverse folding, multiple alignment and database searching in molecular and
structural biology. This award is supported by programs in Computational Biology
and the Theory of Computing.
