9316283 DePaolo The proposed research will develop and test a new approach to
using isotopic variations in metamorphic rocks to measure bulk cation
diffusivities, rates of metamorphic reactions, and durations of metamorphic
conditions. The objective is to apply petrological and isotopic tools
concurrently and complementarily. The research comprises two parts: (1)
developing numerical codes to simulate one-dimensional isotopic redistribution
in layered metamorphic rocks; the codes are used for generic experiments of
isotope behavior, and for modelling in specific field situations, and (2)
applying the exchange model to upper amphibolite facies, garnetiferous gneisses
of the Tehachapi Mountains, southern California.
