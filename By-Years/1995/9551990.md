The interdisciplinary study of energy production and use presents important
opportunities to combine technical and liberal arts education in the
undergraduate curriculum. In particular, the recognition of energy conservation
as a policy option and the rise of an associated engineering subfield has raised
a new range of locally relevant questions for scientific, engineering,
political, and humanistic study and has also generated technical means for
investigating them inexpensively in real-world situations. The faculty
responsible for energy studies at the college is acquiring the capability for
monitoring thermal and electric energy flows in typical commercial and
institutional rooms to support (1) undergraduate study of basic physics and
engineering related to energy production and use, (2) student experience with
design of field investigations and deployment of instrumentation, and (3)
energy-related field projects for upper-level undergraduates.
