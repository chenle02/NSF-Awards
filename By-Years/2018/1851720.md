This award funds a conference that will bring together a wide range of
researchers who are interested in new approaches to management of common
resources. The group will include political scientists, economists,
sociologists, ecologists, biologists, and anthropologists who all study the
ability of groups to self-organize to solve social dilemmas. The goal is to
better understand how individuals behave when faced with social dilemmas and how
social context and institutions support or fail to support resolution of social
dilemmas. Topics include the provision and protection of public goods,
international conflict, and alternatives to direct government control of
resource management decisions. The conference includes junior researchers,
including graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and assistant
professors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
