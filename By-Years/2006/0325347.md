This project studies Social Knowledge Enhancement Cycles, in which the
intellectual efforts of many people lead to the valuable accumulation of new
knowledge. For example, people write books, which go into
libraries,&lt;br/&gt;are found and read by other people, some of whom write more
books, which go into libraries, etc. Similarly, in "recommender systems" people
see movies, rate them using software that combines those ratings with those of
other people to make recommendations of other movies, which people see and rate,
etc. These cycles, though different, both leverage communal effort to produce
and accumulate various kinds of knowledge in&lt;br/&gt;society. To study this
whole class of cycles, this research performs an extensive "design space
analysis", identifying common structure, typical variations, and underlying
dynamics. In parallel, the research develops two new concrete examples: one to
share sensemaking efforts of people gathering information on the web, another to
facilitate reuse of intellectual work done in online discussion groups. The
ultimate goal is&lt;br/&gt;to enhance the ubiquitous information gathering,
sensemaking, distillation, dissemination and creation activities important for
research, education, knowledgeable consumer behavior, an informed citizenry, and
enlightened public policy.
