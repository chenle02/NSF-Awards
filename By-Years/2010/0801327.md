This project investigates some of the mod p aspects of the p-adic Langlands
program, and their applications to more classical problems in number theory.
Just as the Langlands program relates several areas of study (Galois
representations, automorphic forms, and the representation theory of reductive
groups over local and global fields), the p-adic Langlands program studies the
relations between deformations of Galois representations, p-adic Hodge theory,
the p-adic representation theory of reductive groups, and cohomology with p-adic
coefficients. However, the p-adic program is only in an embryonic stage, and
there is very little by way of general conjectures, let alone theorems. It is
natural to consider the reduction mod p of the p-adic objects involved in the
p-adic Langlands program, and when one does so one is led firstly to questions
involving generalizations of the weight part of Serre's conjecture. The PI
proposes to generalize this conjecture to arbitrary reductive groups, and to
prove some special cases. The PI also proposes to prove the first cases of the
Sato-Tate conjecture for modular forms of weight greater than
2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Langlands program is a branch of
mathematics that includes ideas from number theory (the study of equations in
whole numbers), representation theory and analysis. The number theoretic part of
the program consists of a vast set of interlinked conjectures relating the
solutions of equations in whole numbers to other apparently unrelated
mathematical objects. Recently, it has become clear that this part of the
Langlands program should generalise to what is known as a "p-adic Langlands
program". This new program does not, as yet, have a precise conjectural
formulation, and the PI proposes to investigate the correct formulations of the
conjectures that should make up the program, to prove cases of them, and apply
them to more classical problems in number theory.
