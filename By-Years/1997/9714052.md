Abstract - Lee This effort explores a possible dynamic relationship between the
propagation speed and surface properties of turbulent premixed flames. Both
flame surface properties and propagation speed are measured directly in fixed
burner geometries. Recent findings of several researchers show that the rate of
increase of the turbulent flame surface area is substantially lower than that
for the observed flame speeds, casting doubt on Damkohler's assumption that the
flame speed is proportional to the wrinkled flame surface area. This study
addresses the source of this discrepancy and also gives fundamental insight into
the mechanisms that cause the flame speed to increase as flame surface
properties change with increasing turbulence. Two burner geometries are used: a
pulsed-flame flow reactor that produces a freely propagating turbulent premixed
flame, and a coaxial jet flame burner that stabilizes highly-turbulent premixed
flames. Diagnostics include high-speed photography, conditional laser Doppler
velocimetry for flame speed measurements, and two- and three-dimensional imaging
for flame surface properties.
