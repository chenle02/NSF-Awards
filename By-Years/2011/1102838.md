This project examines fundamental properties of tropical convective rainfall and
its complex relationship to large-scale atmospheric conditions. The work builds
on previous work by the same group which found that several important properties
of tropical precipitation including frequency of occurrence, variance, and
intensity, show simple behavior when treated as functions of bulk atmospheric
water vapor content divided by a critical water vapor value related to
temperature-dependent saturation specific humidity. The work is divided into
four topics: 1) Observational constraints on representations of moisture,
convection, and their interactions; 2) distribution tails associated with
transport processes and their implications, particularly for extreme
precipitation events; 3) Issues in precipitation simulation, moist
teleconnections and convective margins, and 4) Methods for parameter sensitivity
estimation/optimization with a focus on precipitation processes in regional
climate issues.

The behavior of convective precipitation in the tropics is of immense practical
importance, as the source of moisture for the large portion of the world's
population residing in the tropics. Yet despite its importance the nature of
tropical convection remains mysterious, as convective rainfall is governed by
complex interactions between large-scale atmospheric conditions and the
properties of small-scale convective clouds. Research conducted here seeks to
improve understanding of tropical convection and its representation in weather
and climate models, and such improvements have great potential benefit for
decision makers confronted with the impacts of tropical climate variability
(including El Nino events) and tropical climate change.
