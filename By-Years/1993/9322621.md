9322621 Basu This SGER grant explores a method of processing (spray forming) to
create oxidation-resistant stainless steel alloys. A fine grain size is
required, and this is accomplished by spray forming and introduction of highly-
stable precipitates of aluminum nitride and titanium boride to resist grain
growth. The stainless steel produced is expected to have superior high
temperature oxidation resistance due to its ability to form thin continuous
silica layers that act as diffusion barriers between the exterior chromia layer
and the bulk alloy. %%% This research could lead to the development of
processing methods to produce less expensive, highly oxidation-resistant
stainless steels that contain lower concentrations of chromium. ***
