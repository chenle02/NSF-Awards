This two year award will support research in computational geometry and
development of an associated software package in a novel area of three
dimensional modelling called alpha-shapes. It is expected that this
qualitatively new kind of volume visualization software will be useful to many
disciplines. The research component of this grant will be carried out under the
direction of Dr. Herbert Edelsbrunner, who developed the concept of alpha-
shapes. The software development will be coordinated by Ping Fu of the National
Center for Supercomputing Applications, an NSF supercomputer center with long
and successful experience in workstation software development.
