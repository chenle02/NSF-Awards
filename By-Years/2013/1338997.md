Researchers have developed a software framework that helps to automatically
define, acquire and consume cloud based services. A simple prototype
demonstrating some of these features was successfully demonstrated at a recent
cloud computing conference. Researchers are now looking to address some key open
questions and create a more robust version of this prototype or a "cloud broker"
tool that will enable users to select the best suited service (or a combination
of services) from the plethora of services/providers in the market. Unlike much
of the existing work, this will involve (automated) negotiation between the
service provider and the consumer to arrive at a machine understandable and
processable service-level agreement (SLA). Such a system addresses a key
identified gap in existing cloud technology. The research team plans to use
Semantically Web (W3C standard) languages to build the prototype. They have
developed ontologies and rules to describe cloud services, requirements,
security and privacy. This solution may have the ability to capture and leverage
federal cloud standards currently in development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Customers
are currently acquiring cloud services manually by hiring consultants to review
and compare the services and conditions (terms, pricing, compliance, security
etc.) being offered by the cloud providers, establish SLAs, and then monitor
SLAs during usage. This is a very time consuming and human intensive process
which reduces return on investments and impacts security and privacy. As a
result, large organizations with complex enterprise policies are unable to use
full potential of the cloud. There is a market need for a well-researched,
tested solution that addresses these barriers to cloud adoption.
