Wabash Valley College is developing an interactive multimedia laboratory to
improve industrial training in two-year Applied Sciences programs. Faculty from
the College's Electronics and Diesel Hydraulics programs are developing a new
inter- departmental course that focuses on a team approach to problem solving,
using the multimedia laboratory to simulate the principles and functions of
robotics, hydraulics, and programmable controllers in today's workplace.
Computerized interactive video tapes are being developed to supplement the
instruction. Interactive media allows the student to see and manipulate key
equipment and the processes used in a manufacturing environment. The multimedia
laboratory is to be shared with other departments in the Applied Sciences field
and with area high schools.
