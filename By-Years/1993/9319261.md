9319261 Kowalski The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Process
Analytical Chemistry at the University of Washington has invented a new sensor
design called a flow probe. The flow probe incorporates sampling sample pre-
treatment and regent chemistries, and analytical detection into a micro-sized
device. This project funds the development of a calibration software package to
provide the tensorial calibration needed for field development and testing of
the sensor systems. Funds for this project are being provided by the U.S.
Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Restoration and Waste Management.
The Program Manager recommends the University of Washington be awarded $486,000
for two (2) years with the funds provided by the U.S. Department of Energy.
