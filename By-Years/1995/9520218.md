9520218 Yura Design guidelines will be developed for connections between
concrete filled steel tubular columns and steel beams in large structural
systems suitable for seismic applications. The main variables included in the
research are square and round tubes and various degrees of strengthening beyond
the plain filled tube detail. The strengthening will concentrate on utilizing
the strength of concrete within the panel zone. At least 8 reasonably full size
test specimens will be designed and tested, first monotonically, then
cyclically. The object will be to develop practical connections for seismic area
that minimize welding and stiffener details. Since there are currently no design
guidelines for such connections, the research is vital to the development of
hybrid and composite civil infrastructure systems. This is a project supported
under CIS solicitation "Research on aomposite NSF - 94-154. ***
