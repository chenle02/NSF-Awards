The goal of the project is to create new avenues of interdisciplinary
collaboration among students in the natural, social, and mathematical sciences
through instruction in advanced computerized methods of data acquisition,
analysis, and modeling. The project involves the departments of Biology,
Mathematical Sciences, Physics and Chemistry, Psychology, and Social Sciences,
and emphasizes computer-based research methods common to these departments.A
common laboratory will house a network of Macintosh computers, software, and
associated data acquisition boards including three powerful and versatile
software packages, LabVIEW, STELLA II, and SYSTAT. Students will be introduced
to the technology in an interdisciplinary laboratory course, "Computers in the
Sciences". Skills and knowledge gained in this setting will be applied in
various disciplinary laboratories, for which numerous experiments and exercises
have already been designed and trial-tested in courses as diverse as Principles
of Macroeconomics, Personality, and Neurobiology. Senior students will use these
computing tools in their thesis projects, which will be presented in a new
interdisciplinary seminar.We seek to generate an atmosphere of interdisciplinary
collaboration using new laboratory technologies which students are likely to use
in both graduate research and work settings. Students will be prepared to take
their places in both basic and applied research projects which require an
interdisciplinary perspective.
