This proposal deals with a study of the use of beam-enhanced deposition
techniques in the growth of high temperature superconducting thin films on a
variety of substrates. Argon or oxygen ions from a Kaufman ion source will be
directed onto the surface of a YBa2Cu3Ox thin-film during deposition by
sputtering, low pressure CVD, and PECVD. Studies of this technique on other
thin- film systems have demonstrated the capability of ion-beams to alter the
properties of deposited films. This work aims at having a positive impact on the
technology of high-temperature superconductor thin-film growth by using ion-
beams to significantly alter film qualities, increase the incorporation of
oxygen into the growing films, and possibly improve the annealing requirements
for these materials.
