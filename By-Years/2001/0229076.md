Abstract

Proposal : IIS-0229076 Institution: Columbia University PI: Kate Wittenberg

This project, entitled "Teaching and Learning Anthropology: Using Scalable
Digital Library Platforms and Innovations in Approaches to Content" is a
collaborative effort of Columbia University and the London School of Economics,
UK. Starting from a focus on concrete learning outcomes, the primary aim will be
to develop a series of digital tools, methods, and approaches with the potential
to change the teaching and learning of anthropology. Once the investigators have
developed a series of teaching methods and tools, they will then embed them in a
digital learning environment for wider use. This environment will comprise a
stable, flexible, and scalable digital library infrastructure, and it will allow
for customized use across a wide range of academic fields . The project results
will be made available on an "open source" basis, for use in diverse cultural,
technological, and educational settings at the undergraduate level.
