This project will develop, analyze, and implement algorithms for solving
mathematical programming problems. It is planned to focus on simplex algorithms,
interior point algorithms, and methods that combine them. The research on
simplex algorithms will be directed towards solving network flow problems
including maximum flow, minimum flow, generalized network flow problems, and
multicommodity flow problems. The research on interior point algorithms will
concentrate on solving structured linear programs, exploring large step path-
following algorithms, solving nonlinear programming problems. This research will
involve theoretical analysis of the algorithms and their implementation and
empirical testing. Extensive areas of society where operations research is
required will benefit from this project.
