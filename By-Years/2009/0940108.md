This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This Faculty Development Award supports the effective integration of research,
teaching and outreach. Research goals are to investigate the structure and
activity of augertoxins and turritoxins derived from venomous marine snails.
These disulfide-rich neuropeptides are expected to demonstrate ion channel and
central nervous system activity. The education and outreach goals include
developing a suite of programmatic materials on the diversity of marine snails
and the complexity of their peptide toxins. These materials will be developed in
collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History. The Discovery Corps
Fellowship Program supported postdoctoral and professional development models
that combined research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps
Postdoctoral Fellows are eligible to apply for this Faculty Development Award.
