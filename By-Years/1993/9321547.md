9321547 Key This three-year program will quantify the individual energy streams
that make up the arctic surface radiation budget, and will relate the observed
radiation distribution to synoptic-scale wind, pressure, and moisture patterns.
It will be the first effort to produce a comprehensive radiation climatology for
the Arctic. The arctic surface energy budget, particularly that of the Arctic
Ocean, has been identified as a major component of the global climate system
that is potentially sensitive to climate-scale perturbations due to feedback
mechanisms involving the surface albedo, the stability of the lower troposphere,
and water vapor transport. The project includes four main tasks: (1) The
analysis of solar and long-wave radiation data obtained directly at manned
observing sites in the arctic. (2) The calculation of radiative fluxes at the
surface and at the top of the atmosphere using a satellite-based cloud data
product from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). (3)
For selected months, the ISCCP-derived fluxes will be compared to the
corresponding synoptic regime, and (4) a study to assess the effects of the
sampling and analysis procedure on the radiation statistics and their temporal
variability will be undertaken. ***
