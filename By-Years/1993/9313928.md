The Principal Investigator has collected Helium/Tritium samples on a
hydrographic cruise along longitude 165 degrees East, designated as line P13 in
the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). In this project the PI will
analyze these data, collect samples along a similar line at 110 degrees West
(P18), and integrate the He/Tr data with other WOCE data to further study
processes of Pacific ocean circulation. Principal focus of the study will be on
upper ocean ventilation, water mass formation, water mass exchange processes,
and rates of oxygen utilization and primary production.
