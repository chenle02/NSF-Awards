Atmospheric flows such as mid-latitude jets are, in general, time-dependent so
that a comprehensive stability theory for these systems must address the
influence of temporal variation in the background flow on the growth and
structure of perturbations. Another important application of time-dependent
instability theory is in relation to the growth of initial errors in tangent
linear models. In this project, the PI plans to pursue further the non-modal
stability theory he and his group developed for time-varying flows to study
deterministic stability problems related to the origin and maintenance of upper
level short waves. In addition, the PI will investigate the statistical mean
structure and dynamics of synoptic scale variance through stochastic forcing.
The project has the potential of obtaining new insight into linear instability
with time-varying flows that may provide new understanding for mid-latitude
synoptic weather phenomena such as storm tracks.
