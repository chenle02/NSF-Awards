9724915 Levine This award supports a research planning visit in preparation for
long-term collaborative anthropological field research in Qinghai Province,
China. The goals of the planning visit are to identify three communities for
future study and to refine research hypotheses related to the integration of
nomadic pastoralists into China's economy and to the processes of economic
differentiation and the ways in which households adapt to periods of economic
variability.
