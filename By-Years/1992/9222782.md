This study is the first phase of a longitudinal study of organizational and
contextual influences on academic research groups in U.S. science and
engineering. The study will examine how research groups are organized and how
they change over time; how contextual variables influence group structure,
functioning, and performance; and how contextual and group variables together
influence members' careers, work-related attitudes and values, and research
behavior (including problem selection, research style, productivity, quality,
and risk tolerance). The main purposes of Phase I are to operationalize major
concepts and develop measures, field test data-gathering techniques, devise a
sampling plan, design data management and analysis systems, and address and
refine the research questions through analysis of preliminary data, This will be
done through face-to-face interviews, questionnaires, and an examination of
documents for approximately fifty-five researchers and their teams, drawn from a
national sample of scientists and engineers in four fields. This project
addresses fundamental questions about the social organization of academic
research and thus should be of interest to a wide audience, including federal
decision makers, scholars interested in the social organization of science, the
community of researchers and practitioners concerned with higher education, and
social scientists interested in groups, organizations, and work life. The
immediate products of Phase I will be a detailed final report, an executive
summary, and a one-page abstract of the project (25 copies of each) for NSF, and
an academic paper (based on cross- sectional data) reporting on differences in
group characteristics and performance among research teams.
