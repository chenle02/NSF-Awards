This grant will support the adaptation of recent advances in astrophysical
radiative transfer studies to address several outstanding problems in aeronomy.
Specifically, the PI will study: (1) multidimensional radiative transfer,
including optically thick resonance lines in the aurora, geocorona, and
twilight, as well as the problem of atomic oxygen measurements using resonance
lamps; (2) molecular band simulation with correct accounting for non-LTE
effects; and (3) optimization of large 1-D problems requiring the solution of
several hundreds to perhaps thousands of individual 1-D problems. Using the
Accelerated Lambda Iteration (ALI) method, the PI will approximate the full
scattering integral to explore rapid, accurate solutions to difficult radiative
transfer problems in astrophysics. These methods will lead to the development of
codes to address problems on aeronomical interest.
