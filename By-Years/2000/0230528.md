Integer programming is a powerful technique for solving problems that are
combinatorial in nature, such as staff scheduling problems. To ensure that the
assumptions underlying integer programming models are satisfied, one must
typically apply strong simplifying assumptions to the system under study.
Discrete event simulation is a powerful technique for estimating the performance
that can be expected from complex systems. One can model virtually arbitrary
complexity in (discrete-event) simulation models. This CAREER award aims to link
these two management science techniques in an attempt to provide a powerful
optimization approach that allows great model complexity. The approach to
linking these methods requires that the simulation satisfies various structural
properties, and that this structural information can be communicated to the
integer program. The focus of this research is in identifying general conditions
under which the linkage will be successful, identifying methods to reduce the
computational requirements of the approach, and exploring various application
methods and areas.

In addition to potential contributions to the theory of management science,
potential applications of this research include call centre staffing and
ambulance allocation. In the call centre staffing problem one wishes to assign
staff to shifts in a way that minimizes staffing costs, while ensuring that
customer service is satisfactory. Many call centres exhibit complex customer
routing and other characteristics that mean that simulation is the preferred
method for predicting customer service for a given staffing level. It may be
possible to achieve satisfactory customer service at less cost than is currently
the case. In the ambulance allocation problem, one is trying to determine when
and where to place ambulances to ensure satisfactory response time performance
to calls. Again, simulation may be needed to predict response time performance,
and again, it may be possible to achieve satisfactory response time performance
at less cost than is currently the case.
