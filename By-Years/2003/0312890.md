&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A highly secure information network can be
build using quantum cryptography by distributing the data encryption keys using
single photons. Such a network would be immune to any technological advances in
computing technology as the key is encrypted on a quantum physical level. This
project focuses on a novel dynamically reconfigurable multi-user quantum key
distribution (QKD) system using an optical fiber Sagnac Interferometer. The
project will include an experimental demonstration of a four user QKD system
that allows multiple quantum encryption links to be established in the same
physical optical network. Theoretical studies will focus on the security of the
Sagnac Interferometer based multi-user QKD network and its immunity to malicious
eavesdropping. In addition, the multi-user QKD network in this project will
provide a physical platform that allows the system to simulate the effects of
eavesdropping. &lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
