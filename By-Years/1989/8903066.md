In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project between Teodor
Ast, University of Belgrade, V. Kramer, Jozef Stefan Institute and Robert G.
Cooks, Purdue University, the investigators will continue their mass
spectrometry studies of polyatomic ions. Specifically the group will study
organic ion/molecule reactions, metastable ions and ion/surface interactions.
Complementary research is proposed. Ion systems will be examined under high
energy and gaseous conditions (Yugoslavia) versus low energy and solid
conditions (U.S.A.). The experiments will advance efforts to characterize
organic ion structures by mass spectrometry. This project was approved by the
U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is
supported through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the
governments of the United States and Yugoslavia. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. Grants
are made to the principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia, but include
dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav
scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
