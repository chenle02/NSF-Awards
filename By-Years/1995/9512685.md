Abstract/Kostinski The objective of this research is to examine time-series
simulations and measurements of hydrometeor backscatter polarization matrices in
order to investigate their potential meteorological applications. Previous
results show that a deeper understanding of the microphysics is possible by
interpreting the polarization scattering matrix as an operator rather than a
list of polarimetric variables derived from the associated covariance matrix. In
particular, it is now known that the time-series of the polarization matrix
eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be used to define meteorologically useful
variables related to the shape and canting of the hydrometeors. Our goal then is
to further extend this research in order to achieve the clearest possible
separation of size, shape, and orientation information. Such knowledge may well
have implications with respect to the application of polarization techniques to
several practical problems including, for example, the discrimination among
hydrometeor types (e.g., rain vs. hail), improved characterization of raindrops
for better rainfall estimation.
