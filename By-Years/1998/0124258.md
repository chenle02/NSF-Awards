The PIs will combine recent compilations of optical properties of various
atmospheric-borne minerals and their regional distribution in order that dust
optical properties reflect the mineralogy of their source region. They will
address the following questions: (i) How does the composition of a dust plume
vary along its trajectory away from the source region, as the size distribution
changes with the preferential deposition of larger particles? Is the fraction of
certain minerals enriched with distance from the source? (ii) What is the
horizontal distribution of atmospheric concentration and deposition for
particular minerals, e.g., carbonates, clays such as illite and kaolinite, and
hematite? (iii) What is the radiative forcing by dust aerosols and the climate
response if the mineralogy of the source region is accounted for? (iv) What
regional errors in forcing and the associated climate response result from
assigning optical properties of far-traveled Saharan dust to each source region?
(v) What is the radiative effect of treating particles as external mixtures?

To address these questions the PIs will undertake modeling that includes the
effect of subgrid scale fluctuations of surface wind upon dust emission. The
work is important because it will enhance our understanding of the role of dust
particle mineralogy upon climate.
