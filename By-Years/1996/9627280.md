9627280 Dhondt Cornell's Laboratory of Ornithology will develop the "Cornell
Nest Box Network (CNN)". This is an educational/research project that will
enable lay people to participate in scientific research and it builds on a
successful NSF grant "National Science Experiments". For this project, CNN
participants will build and place nest boxes in their communities and monitor
the boxes gathering information on the breeding success of their occupants.
Participants will summarize and analyze their data and then send it to the Lab
for more comprehensive analysis. Lab biologists will analyze the compiled data
and report results in a variety of media including scientific reports and
popular newsletters. The CNN includes both an educational and research agenda.
Participants will learn about birds while participating directly in the
scientific process. The research questions, requiring huge, continent-wide
databases, will focus on the effects of acid rain on bird populations,
geographic variation in avian clutch size, effects of ectoparasites on nesting
birds and population dispersal, among others. The protocol will encourage group
participation and will be especially suitable for families. It will involve a
corps of trained "ambassadors" who will help sustain the project a local levels.
One of the goals of the project is to move participants up a ladder of science
knowledge from projects involving minimal knowledge and skill to those requiring
more. It also addresses national education standards that call for increased
opportunities for students to engage in extended inquiry and authentic research
activities. After the fourth development year, this research/education project
will become self-sustaining.
