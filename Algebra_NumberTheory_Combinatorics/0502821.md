The cohomology of locally symmetric varieties plays an important role in number
theory and in particular Langlands's program. One reason is that they are
examples of spaces exhibiting an action of both a Hecke algebra] and a Galois
group. A fundamental goal is to relate these actions and the corresponding
L-functions. In previous work, the principal investigator created a new tool,
L-modules, to study such cohomology. In the current project, the principal
investigator proposes to incorporate Hecke and Galois actions into L-modules. He
will also prove a "decomposition theorem" for L-modules and apply it to
construct cycles associated to sub-locally symmetric varieties.

The proposed research studies symmetry in geometry and number theory.
Applications of geometry and number theory abound, for example to cryptography
and crystallography. A symmetry in geometry is a transformation of space which
doesn't change distance, for example a rotation. In number theory a symmetry is
a transformation of a number system that transforms the sum of two numbers into
the sum of the transforms and likewise for the product, for example complex
conjugation. In both subjects, the most interesting objects are those which
remain unchanged under many symmetries. For example, in geometry the sphere is
invariant under all rotations, while in number theory the set of roots of a
polynomial equation with integer coefficients are invariant under all
symmetries. The investigator's research concern higher-dimensional objects which
possess both geometric and number theoretic symmetries, and the relations
between these symmetries.
