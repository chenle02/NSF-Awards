The Mathematics Department at Mount Holyoke College will purchase a micro VAX-
II, peripherals, and software in order to establish a mathematics computer
laboratory to be used in three ways. First, students in a course, required of
majors, called Laboratory in Mathematical Experimentation, will investigate
mathematical problems which are best attacked using a computer. Examples of
these are topics in chromatic polynormials and unimodality; topics dealing with
prime numbers; randomness; chaotic dynamical systems; the Mandelbrot set. This
laboratory will force students to come to grips with mathematical ideas through
experimentation and conjecture, ensure some proficiency with the computer, and
help foster precise thinking and writing. Second, in advanced courses students
can build on their experience in the laboratory to use the computer more easily
to work on interesting problems. Third, in senior independent work the
availability of the computer will increase the number and sophistication of
independent projects available to a student, and she will have had considerable
experience so that she can start the project at a higher level.
