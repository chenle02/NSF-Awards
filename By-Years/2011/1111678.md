The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry
Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Steven Kass of
the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, for combined IR and MS investigations
of new acids and base reactivity, H-bonding catalysts, and gas phase reactive
intermediates. The goals of this work are to develop structure-reactivity
relationships for a wide range of bioinspired catalytic acids and bases, and to
understand the fundamental principles by which a new class of chiral acids and
bases can be used for enantioselective reactions. These investigations will
include the determination of ionized amino acids and peptide structures, non-
bonding interactions, hydrogen-deuterium exchange sites, and the "mobile proton
controversy." The research will have broad ranging implications from
pharmaceutical development and the fabrication of nanomaterials, to a better
understanding of enzyme catalyzed reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts of the research include interdisciplinary training opportunities for
students, from experiment to theory and from organic synthesis to mass
spectrometry. The research is intertwined with many practical aspects of science
that could lead to huge societal benefits such as the preparation of new
medicines and the development of noninvasive detection methods for human
diseases. The PI is directly and intensely involved with the training of
undergraduates through an REU program, and through a summer research program at
the Minnesota Supercomputer Institute.
