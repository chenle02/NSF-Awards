This proposal in mathematical physics has as its goals: 1) to evaluate effects
of many-electron correlations in problems relevant to high temperature
superconductivity 2) to obtain accurate, non-perturbative estimates for
ionization problems 3) to study non-linear Skyrmion equations in relation to
symmetry breaking 4) to resolve a long standing conjecture about permanent
dominance in matrix theory.
