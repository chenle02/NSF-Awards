Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;In spite of the many types of kinetic and thermodynamic
information available through electrochemical techniques, few undergraduates
have the opportunity to carry out such experiments. This project seeks to
address this deficiency through the acquisition of a computer controlled
potentiostat. Use of the instrument is being implemented throughout the
chemistry curriculum beginning with Organic Chemistry and culminating in
undergraduate research. The project draws from a model developed by Holder at
Appalachian State University and adapts experiments from the research
literature. Experiments are selected which complement the material being covered
in a particular course, and which illustrate the usefulness of electrochemical
techniques for understanding molecular properties. The project is particularly
benefiting first generation college students, who comprise approximately 40% of
Coe's entering classes. An advisory committee of electrochemistry professionals
(from the University of Iowa, Cornell College, and Collins Printed Circuits) has
been formed to assist in evaluation and in the development of new experiments
suitable for use in undergraduate laboratories. The advisory committee includes
expertise from industry, biochemistry, material science, and environmental
engineering; the new experiments being developed include these interdisciplinary
areas. Students are expected to gain a broad understanding of the use of
electrochemistry to solve chemical problems. Dissemination will include
presentations at regional and national meetings, publication in the chemical
education literature and research literature, and creation of an electrochemical
education Web page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
