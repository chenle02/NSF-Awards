Recent research on wireless networks and mobile computing has concentrated on
single hop networks, where network nodes communicating directly to a fixed
infrastructure such as cellular or satellite systems. In ad-hoc and sensor
networks, multi-hop scenarios such as conference, hospital, battlefield, rescue
and monitoring scenarios are covered, where network nodes communicate via other
network nodes. Looking at the increasing importance of this area, IEEE MASS is
being organized. The thirteenth meeting is planned for October 10-13, 2016 in
Brasilia, Brazil.

This project supports travel to the IEEE MASS 2016 conference for US based Ph.D.
students who might not otherwise be able to attend for financial reasons.
Students will be exposed to the conference, a technical forum that is critical
for their professional maturity and development. The recipients will be chosen
by a committee of four senior researchers and preference will be given to
students from underrepresented groups.
