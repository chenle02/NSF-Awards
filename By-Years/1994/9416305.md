9416305 Sanderson ABSTRACT Interactive Learning Module for Manufacturing
Engineering Working in partnership with Apple Computer, AT&T, IBM, and Northern
Telecom Corporations, this Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Project has dual
objectives: (1) Using multimedia and distance learning technologies to present
case studies, expert commentaries, and manufacturing simulations, focusing on
advanced electronics and electromechanical product sectors; and (2) Using the
modular nature of these materials to widely disseminate them for use by industry
and other institutions so as to impact different geographical, technological,
corporate, and demographic sectors. Based on excellent facilities and proven
background in modular development enhanced by emerging video technologies and
well-chosen industrial partners, this project can potentially lead to future
means of manufacturing education. ***
