9406026 Molnar The PIs will use laboratory and numerical experiments to examine
convective instability of mechanically thickened boundary layers, in order to
understand mantle dynamics beneath growing mountain belts where crustal
thickening occurs. The thermal instability results from the lateral thermal
gradients resulting from the cooler root, and may result in some of the know
pecularities of mountain belts. ****
