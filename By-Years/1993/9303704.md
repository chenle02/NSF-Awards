The research entails questions concerning the properties of subvarieties of
projective space using the geometry of exterior differential systems and partial
differential equations. These methods may be instrumental in obtaining progress
on some important questions and conjectures in algebraic geometry. The research
also entails developing certain geometric features of certain algorithmic
systems. The overall approach to these questions are likely to have extensions
to other branches of pure and applied mathematics.
