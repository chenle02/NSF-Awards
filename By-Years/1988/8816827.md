Plants of many species, in quite different lineages, are characterized by the
regular production of hollow stems with septate nodes; bamboos are classical
examples, as are horsetails (the genus Equisetum). Among species of the grass or
bamboo family, hollow stems predominate over solid stems; among species of the
ancient horsetail family, all extant species produce hollow stems. In order to
examine the biomechanical properties of hollow stems, Dr. Karl Niklas of Cornell
University will use an engineering technique known as multiple resonance
frequency spectra (MRFS) analysis in the study of several species of horsetails
and of grasses. The mechanical rigidity, or flexural rigidity, of stems is
thought to be related to light-interception and to reproduction (either spores
or seeds borne on that stem). At issue is the hypothesized trade-off between
efficiency in construction (hollow stems presumed to be "cheaper" metabolically)
and safety from breakage (solid stems presumed to provide greater strength). The
mechanical properties of stems will be analyzed, and aspects of rigidity
quantified and measured, in an array of species from the grass and horsetail
families. Common features of hollow-stem construction in these two phyletically
distant groups of plants may well provide examples of convergent evolution.
