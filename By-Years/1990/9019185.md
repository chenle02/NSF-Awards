This research is to analyze body wave phases recorded over a period of several
months by a digital three-component local array operated in the Subandean
Province and East Peru Basin above the zone of flat subduction and resubduction
in the central Andes. The analysis will include a systematic interpretation and
inversion of body wave seismograms making use of a recently developed technique
for the deterministic calculation of synthetic seismograms. Dipping plate
structures outside the region of flat subduction will be studied by means of 3-D
ray tracing routines which incorporate conversions and reflections at first-
order discontinuities. The Andean system offers unique opportunities for the
study of many fundamental problems of continental dynamics including earthquake
hazard, and the fine structure and properties of the subducting slab, the
overriding lithosphere and the interface between them. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
