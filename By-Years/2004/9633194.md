9633194 Jaluria The material flow processes and the thermal history of the
optical fibers are two factors in determining the quality of the fiber in the
fiber drawing process. This project investigates innovation drawing control
techniques for the fabrication of optical fibers. A systematic experimental
study along with a detailed analytical/numerical model will be developed to
study the residual stresses, generation and diffusion of defects, fiber diameter
control, and the resulting refractive index variation in optical waveguides.
Innovative techniques will be developed for drawing three types of preform
materials and configurations, including the multi-layer case generally used in
practice to validate the developed models. The outcomes of the study are
critical to the future needs in fiber fabrication process. The research project
has a balance between theory and experiment, and will provide valuable findings
for the fiber fabrication industry.
