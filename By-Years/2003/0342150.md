Experience Learning Community plans to open a museum dedicated to science
fiction in the summer of 2004. The Science Fiction Experience (SFX) will be an
interactive, media-rich museum combining artifacts and information that immerse
visitors in science fiction's alternative worlds. They are implementing a
planning phase to assure that the museum's exhibits and programming content will
illustrate the relationship between science and science fiction. Specific tasks
during the planning phase include:

1. Conduct front-end research of the public's perceptions of science fiction vs.
science fact. 2. Conduct formative testing of proof-of-concept materials for one
of the museum's premiere exhibits, "Mars, Then and Now." 3. Convene leading
science and museum educators, scientists, science communications researchers and
science fiction practitioners to inform and shape the museum's exhibit concepts
and approaches relevant to the public's understanding of science through science
fiction. 4. Create and disseminate a document that will inform of the
development of exhibits and programs.

Advisors to the project include: Greg Bear, best-selling author of more than 30
science fiction books; Gregory Benford, Professor of Plasma Physics and
Astrophysics at the University of California at Irvine; David Ellis, President
Emeritus of the Museum of Science, Boston; Lawrence Krauss, Chair of the
Department of Physics at Case Western Reserve University; and Donna Shirley, for
manager of the Mars Exploration Program at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and
currently Professor at the School of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the
University of Oklahoma.
