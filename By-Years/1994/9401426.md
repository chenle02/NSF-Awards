9401426 Schmidt This award funds the number theory research of Prof. Wolfgang
Schmidt. Prof. Schmidt will work on the solution of tree congruences modulo
prime powers. He will continue his work on diophantine approximation refining
Roth's theorem into fields of positive characteristic. He is also interested in
forms of many variables, in particular a theorem of Birch concerning forms of
odd degree. This is research in the field of number theory. Number theory is
basically the study of whole numbers, but it extends to the study rational
numbers. Rational numbers are whole number ratios. We have known for several
centuries that not all numbers can be written exactly as whole number ratios,
but from the moment of this discovery, mathematicians have looked for ways of
coming close. This part of mathematics is called diophantine approximation, and
it is a critical piece of modern mathematics. ***
