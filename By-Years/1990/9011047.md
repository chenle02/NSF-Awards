Surface diffusivity and surface free energy of metals are important physical
quantities in phenomena such as nucleation and growth, corrosion, and fracture.
Values of these parameters appropriate for ambient temperature behavior are
based on linear extrapolations of high temperature measurements. This program
examines a new measurement technique for direct observation of surface
mobilities using the scanning tunneling microscope. Such measurements need to be
done on extremely well characterized surfaces, taking into account surface
segregation and effect of electrolyte composition. Consideration of temperature
dependence of the surface parameters is considered high risk as it requires new
scanning tunneling microscopy techniques.
