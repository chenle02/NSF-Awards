This international travel grant provides for roundtrip, coach airfare from South
Bend, Indiana, to Frankfurt, FRG, for the week of September 20-27, 1990. The
purpose of this grant is to assist Dr. Joan F. Brennecke so that she may present
a research paper at the European Federation of Chemical Engineering
(administered by DECHEMA). This meeting is held in Erlangan, Federal Republic of
Germany, on September 24-26, 1990. The paper is entitled "Fluorescence
Spectroscopy of Supercritical Fluid Systems with Entrainers." This paper
summarizes a new technique to investigate solute/entrainer interactions using
fluorescence spectroscopy, which gives information on the strength of
interactions, local entrainers concentrations, and sobent effect on reaction
rate. Many practical applications of supercritical fluid (SCF) extraction
require the use of entrainers (usually 1 to 5 percent of a component of
volatility intermediate between that of a solute and a SCF) to increase
solubilities and selectivities.
