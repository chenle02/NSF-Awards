Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this NSF project is to establish
structural tools for apple genomics.&lt;br/&gt;The apple, Malus x domestica
Borkh., is the most important deciduous tree fruit crop&lt;br/&gt;grown in the
United States. This project will focus on developing structural
genomic&lt;br/&gt;research tools with emphasis on flowering, fruiting, and
pathogen response in apple.&lt;br/&gt;The first phase of this project is to
construct an expressed sequence tag (EST) database&lt;br/&gt;of 120,000
sequences from flowering and fruiting tissues, and from tissues responding
to&lt;br/&gt;pathogen infection, specifically to the bacterial pathogen Erwinia
amylovora (the causal&lt;br/&gt;organism of fire blight disease) and to the
fungal pathogen Venturia inaequalis (the&lt;br/&gt;causal organism of apple scab
disease). These will then be used to generate a set of&lt;br/&gt;30,000 unigene
clones that will be subjected to 3' sequencing. An apple genome dataset will
be&lt;br/&gt;generated and integrated into a national Rosaceae Genome Database.
An&lt;br/&gt;educational and outreach component of this project will involve
developing web-based&lt;br/&gt;modules for use in educating high school teachers
and students on the concepts&lt;br/&gt;structural genomics.
