Darwinian evolution serves as a foundation for modern biology and is certainly
the crowning achievement of 19th century biological research. Despite it's
present centrality, Darwinian evolution by means of natural selection was not
widely accepted in the 19th century. There was, however, one major stronghold of
acceptance: Germany has long been considered " Darwinism's second home." Despite
this unique trait, historians of science have paid surprisingly little attention
to the German biologists who supported Darwinism, viz. German university
biologists. Most significantly, we lack a satisfactory account of German
biologists' strikingly un-Darwinian approach to evolution, which came to be
known as "evolutionary morphology." Dr. Nyhart is analyzing the fate of
evolutionary morphology in Germany from just before the publication of Darwin's
theory in 1859 to its eclipse around 1900. Using previously untapped archival
sources, the study is tracing the relationship between the morphologists'
theoretical commitments and their tenuous institutional position within the
university system. By taking this approach, Dr. Nyhart hopes to explain not only
the rise and decline of this particular research program, but also to illustrate
the extent to which institutional and disciplinary factors play a role in the
development of scientific knowledge.
