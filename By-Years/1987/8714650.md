This proposal represents a request for partial support for establishing the
first Conference on: COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTOR GROWTH, PROCESSING, AND DEVICES FOR
THE 1990's: JAPAN/U.S. PERSPECTIVES. The conference will be held at the
University of Florida during October 26- 28, 1987. The purpose of this
conference is four fold: (1) To discuss aspects of reliably producing high
quality products from compound semiconductors. (2) To review the current
capabilities of compound semiconductor materials processing techniques used to
fabricate device structures. (3) To assess the future critical needs and
research opportunities in compound semiconductor growth, processing, and
devices. (4) To identify appropriate areas of interaction, and co-operation
between the U.S. and Japan.
