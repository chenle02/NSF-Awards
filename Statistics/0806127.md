Many model search strategies involve trading off model fit with model complexity
in a penalized goodness of fit measure. Asymptotic properties for these types of
procedures in some conventional situations, such as regression and ARMA time
series have been studied. Yet, such strategies do not always translate into good
finite sample performance. Furthermore, such standard model selection procedures
encounter difficulties for nonconventional model selection problems as well.
This project aims at developments of a new model selection strategy, called
fence methods, in following four major areas of methodology research and
applications: (i) development of adaptive fence methods for high dimensional and
complex model selection problems using the idea of restricted maximum
likelihood; (ii) development of data adaptive fence methods for nonparametric
model selection problems such as penalized smoothing spline estimation; (iii)
development of fence methods for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping; and (iv)
development of user-friendly standalone software for implementing the fence
methods.

The fence idea is generally based on building a statistical fence, or barrier,
to carefully eliminate incorrect models. This is done by determining which
models are within variation of a goodness-of-fit measure of an anchor model.
Once the fence is constructed, the optimal model is selected from amongst those
within the fence according to a criterion which can be made flexible. For
example, the criterion can incorporate scientific or economic concerns. The
adaptive fence method may be viewed as comparing signals with noises to come out
with an optimal decision supported by the data. Given such a wide spectrum of
models that can be handled, the range of applications seems enormous. Of
particular interests are applications in human genetics, medical research and
surveys. To facilitate such translational research, the investigators plan to
freely disseminate available computer software to implement the fence methods.
