This Doctoral Dissertation project on the leadership styles of black
congressmen deals with a topic of considerable interest and importance to
scholars in political science. The project focuses on how leadership styles
relate to changing district characteristics and the need to crate, maintain and
satisfy biracial coalitions. At the core of this research is the attempt to
enhance understanding of issues involving the formation and maintenance of
biracial coalitions and minority representation. Employing a multiple methods
research strategy, the investigator combines interviews, participant
observation, and content analysis of secondary data sources. The objectives of
the study are: to identify differences in black leadership styles, and the
impact that these styles have in legislative and electoral arenas; to determine
how these styles relate to changing district characteristics and the formation
and maintenance of biracial coalitions; and, to describe how a subset of black
congressmen view and present themselves to their constituencies at various times
in their legislative careers. This study promises to increase our understanding
of legislative behavior and leadership styles of legislators.
