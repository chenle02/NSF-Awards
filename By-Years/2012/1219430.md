More than a million juvenile suspects are arrested annually and taken into
custody. Prior to any confessions or other statements, they must be informed of
their Constitutional rights against self-incrimination via Miranda warnings.
Juvenile warnings vary in how they are presented (i.e., oral, written, or both)
and in their reading levels. Using representative juvenile Miranda warnings,
this project is the first to examine how much juveniles understand and apply to
their decision-making about whether to exercise their Constitutional rights. The
project uses two relevant samples: at-risk youth in juvenile justice alternative
education and juvenile detainees in custody. The project also investigates
several misconceptions about Miranda warnings that can nullify any rational
reasoning about Constitutional protections. For example, many adolescents
believe that their silence can be used as incriminating evidence, which might
affect their decision whether to talk to police. Two aspects of Miranda
misconceptions are studied: (1) their initial beliefs and (2) any improvements
as a result of being Mirandized.

This research has far-reaching implications for public policy and appellate
court decisions. In 2010, the American Bar Association recognized the national
problem of providing juvenile suspects with Miranda warnings they could not
understand. This project should assist their initiative for by identifying
current problems in the administration of juvenile advisements. The U.S. Supreme
Court has recently decided several cases, which established that juveniles be
dealt with differently in light of their maturity and intellectual development.
In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court directly addressed juvenile Miranda issues,
holding that juvenile suspects are not "miniature adults" and that age is
relevant in considering the validity of Miranda waivers. The current research
will help to inform the state and federal courts regarding the potential
provision of additional Miranda protections for juvenile offenders.
