This research explores capital flows and the role of the US dollar as a global
financial factor affecting financial and investment decisions globally. The
project will shed new light in the field of international finance, connecting
academic research to the current policy debate. The research will investigate
whether borrowing in domestic currency insulates emerging market countries from
global financial conditions. The project will also assess whether global banksâ€™
dollar funding is still a source of financial vulnerability more than ten years
after the Global Financial Crisis and several ensuing regulatory changes, such
as the 2016 US reform of money market funds, the strengthening of capital and
liquidity measures, and interventions by central banks. The project will have
potential implications for both domestic and global financial policies and
regulations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a unique database of US investor flows
into emerging market securities containing information on the currency
denomination of the flows, the project will study how dollar appreciation
negatively affects domestic bond spreads, with an amplification channel through
investments in local currency bonds by US mutual funds. The project will further
consider important financial episodes such as the 2008 financial crisis, the
Taper Tantrum phase, and the COVID-19 shock to assess how the transmission of
the shock propagate to the real economy and whether non-US banks have become
more resilient to dollar shocks after more than ten years of regulatory
interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
