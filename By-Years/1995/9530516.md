9530516 Crosley This project addresses both atmospheric processes and
measurement techniques for atmospheric trace species, and employs both
experiments and modeling. The four main components are: 1) Quenching of
rotational levels of electronically excited hydroxyl radical near the
predissociation limit, and the measurement of nascent hydroxyl distributions in
multiphoton laser dissociation of water and nitric acid. These distributions are
pertinent to the analysis of water and nitric acid in the atmosphere using laser
photofragmentation. 2) The ultraviolet absorption spectra of nitric acid could
be very different in cold matrices than in the gas phase. Therefore, the
absorption and photolysis of nitric acid adsorbed onto a cold surface will be
studied. 3) A concept for the direct measurement of the chemical lifetime of
atmospheric hydroxyl radical will be developed via modeling. An excimer laser
would photolyze enough ozone to produce hydroxyl radicals at a concentration
about 100 times more than the typical ambient level. A probe laser would monitor
the hydroxyl concentration in the time following the photolysis pulse. The
modeling study will investigate the ability of this approach to furnish the true
chemical lifetime, and will establish the photochemical conditions of the
experiment. 4) The Principal Investigator will participate in missions devoted
to intercomparison of experimental techniques for measuring trace atmospheric
species, including ongoing efforts concerned with sulfur dioxide and hydroxyl.
