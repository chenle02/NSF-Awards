One of the most important regions where the upper atmosphere is coupled to
Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind is the auroral zone. Inside auroral
arcs, the primary transport of energy is in the form of accelerated charged
particles. Numerical models are now able to make specific predictions about the
time-evolution of the processes involved, but definitive observational tests of
the models is still lacking. The project will utilize new capabilities from
optical and radar instrumentation (Incoherent Scatter Radars) at three high-
latitude facilities: the Sondrestrom facility (funded by NSF) and the EISCAT
(European Incoherent Scatter radar) and ESR (EISCAT Svalbard Radar) facilities
funded by a European/Japanese consortium. The project will develop a systematic
observational framework for measuring local electrodynamic variability in the
ionosphere and will then utilize that capability to compare observations on the
time-dependent nature of magnetosphere-ionosphere electrodynamics with the
various models. The project will involve international collaborations with
European investigators associated with the EISCAT and ESR radars and will also
have an educational component for a U.S. graduate student.
