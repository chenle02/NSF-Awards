Under the direction of Dr. Anthony C. Woodbury, Ms. Christina M. Willis will
collect and analyze data for her doctoral dissertation. Her research concerns
Darma, an unwritten and little documented Tibeto-Burman language spoken by about
1,750 people in the Indian Himalayas near Nepal. Two main methods will be used
to collect linguistic data: direct elicitation of words and sentences through
interviews with native speakers, and audio- and video-recording of naturally
occurring language use, including formal storytelling, ceremonial speech, and
informal conversation. The data will be compiled into a grammar describing the
language's phonology (sound system), morphology (word structure), and syntax
(sentence structure). While reflecting recent advances in linguistic theory, the
grammar will emphasize a descriptive approach. It will be aimed at a scientific
audience, including sociolinguists and anthropologists. But it will be
accessible to teachers developing pedagogical materials. The recordings will
constitute a sound and video archive that will provide a documentary record of
the Darma language and its use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be
significant for linguistics and anthropology. The Darma grammar will aid in the
reconstruction of linguistic prehistory in the Tibeto-Burman language family.
The genetic subgrouping of Tibeto-Burman languages is unclear. For example,
scholars do not yet know how languages in the Himalaya region acquired features
typical of Austro-Asiatic, a language family found further south. The Darma
grammar resulting from this research will also help linguists and
anthropologists evaluate and extend theories of linguistic systems. The sound
and video archive will support the study of Darma language and society. Finally,
copies of both the grammar and the archive will be left with the Darma community
and are expected to contribute to plans by community leaders to develop a script
and produce materials to teach their language to future
generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
