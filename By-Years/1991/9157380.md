This is the first year base and matching amount funding of a five-year PYI
continuing award. The PI works on design of interfaces for collaborative
environments. The current research is on designs that allow one to see the
layout of many other collaborator's surfaces at a glance. This research aims to
provide a recursive system of indefinitely zoomable magnifying glasses through
which one can read, write, or create cross- references on an indefinitely
enlargeable (zoomable) surface. A number of algorithms for dynamically
displaying such information in 'real time' on unenhanced bit-mapped workstations
have already been developed by the author. The research will continue by
defining and implementing the basic collection of functions in the interactive
zoomable window system. Then, the system will be extended across a network,
thereby making available a shared information space which will allow an
arbitrary number of users to work in a common virtual environment, each possibly
enjoying a different view of this environment. The researcher will also build
applications, including multiscale graphical "yellow pages" and shared
spreadsheet systems, to test the real benefit of the implemented system.
