9554484 The city of San Antonio incorporates 15 districts that enroll 239,000
students. Of these, nine have agreed to forge a partnership they believe will
create a greater capacity to raise the quality of education for the children
they serve. To improve achievement of all students in mathematics and science,
they will work together to accomplish three strategic goals: Improve the quality
of teaching through site-based, teacher-customized professional development.
Make schools the centers of planning and actions to improve the quality of
teaching and learning. Attain city-wide coordination to align policies,
resources, and practices that establish high expectations and equal
opportunities in mathematics and science for all students. The San Antonio Urban
Systemic Initiative's conceptual model expands on the three strategies;
suggesting the elements of the model as a reform hypothesis. Summed up, it
implies that students will succeed in school if: student programs are enriched;
curriculum content is coordinated; partnerships with business, community, and
other stakeholders are established; parents are involved; planning is site-
based; community action is strengthened; teacher quality is improved; and
policies are aligned to support implementation and operation of the USI plan.
Undergirding these strategies is the formation of a unified multi-district
thrust. ***
