PI: Rogan, Elizabeth &lt;br/&gt;Proposal No.: 1540895 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
high level of technical development stimulated by the BRAIN initiatives is
drawing new researchers into the field from diverse disciplines ranging from
chemistry and genetics, to laser optics and neurosurgery. OSA has identified the
urgent need for a forum where these researchers can come together and discuss
optics in the brain at many levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will
participate in discussions of highly technical components of optical design and
optical interactions with tissue. They will also consider the motivating factors
in developing optical tools for neuroscience research across organisms, from
cells and flies to rodents and humans. This meeting will provide a forum for
presentation of results from projects related to the BRAIN initiative and Human
Brain Project, and will stimulate new ideas and collaborations that will provide
visionary direction for future projects. In addition this meeting will provide
an opportunity for students, trainees and young investigators to present their
work, and to hear and network with internationally-renowned invited speakers who
represent the broad diversity of this burgeoning field. This meeting will serve
to shape the careers of young trainees embarking on careers in which optics and
the brain converge.&lt;br/&gt;The Optics and the Brain meeting will be held at
the Pinnacle Vancouver Harbourside Hotel, Vancouver, Canada April 12-15, 2015.
