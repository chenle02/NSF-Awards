The Applied Ocean Physics &amp; Engineering Department at Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution will continue an instrumentation and technology
development project to design and construct an unmanned, untethered vehicle for
performing and servicing long-term deep ocean benthic experiments. This vehicle
has been named ABE for the Autonomous Benthic Explorer. Design criteria call for
it to be launched from any oceanographic research ship and be able to remain on
site for several months. During this time span it must period- ically move about
in its acoustic navigation net, taking pictures and making a variety of
scientific measurements. At the end of its mission, it is to be recovered on
command. ABE will complement and extend the capabilities of manned submer-
sibles, particularly DSV ALVIN, as well as remotely operated, tethered systems.
ABE shall have the ability to remain at a deep sea research site for long
periods of time or to return to a previously surveyed site to observe changes.
This development project is in anticipation of planned research initiatives
requiring long-term observations of seafloor features such as hydrothermal vents
and mid-ocean ridges.
