The Department of Defense (DoD) has funded the first-year development
activities necessary to create a two-year Community College Associate of Arts
Degree in Environmental Technology. Kansas State University (KSU), as one of the
recipients of the funding, has assembled faculty teams to write the curriculum
and a media production team to produce and disseminate it. Although it was the
original intent of the DoD, it is now apparent subsequent-year funding will not
be forthcoming. Consequently, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has a rare
opportunity to fund a program in which $840,000 of infrastructure is already in
place. For example, there are 20-plus committed community colleges prepared to
implement the curriculum and develop second-year courses. A national consortium
of industry supporters, such as AFL/CIO, Boeing, and Allied Signal Aerospace,
Inc., are on-board to advise on program development. State-of-the-art
technologies, such as satellite instructional delivery access, CD-ROM
development equipment, and media production equipment, have been purchased and
totally committed to this program. Current funding from the DoD is being used to
develop curriculum materials, but second, third, and fourth-year funding is
absolutely necessary to implement the curriculum. Full development and
implementation of the complete two-year environmental technology program will
not occur without NSF support. The proposal explicitly demonstrates the
infrastructures already created by DoD's first-year funding, and clearly
emphasizes activities necessary for program completion by subsequent-year
funding from the NSF.
