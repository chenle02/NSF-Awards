As of 2012, a fraction of the world's energy is supplied by nuclear power
plants. The interior environments of the reactors supplying this energy are far
from benign. Structural materials in nuclear reactors must withstand decades of
high temperatures and pressures, corrosive degradation, and damaging neutron
radiation in an environment where safety and reliability are paramount. Of
particular concern is radiation damage, which is known to cause unwanted
hardening and embrittlement in materials, leading to premature failure. Such
damage can be simulated quickly in the lab by focusing a beam of protons on a
sample; however, since the protons only penetrate the material to very shallow
depths, the testable sample size is limited to the micron scale. With such small
samples to work with, traditional materials science tests such as tensile
testing cannot be easily performed. To solve this problem, a collaborative
effort will be made with radiation damage specialist Dhriti Bhattacharyya at the
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation.

Using focused ion beam (FIB) milling techniques, micron-scale tensile specimens
will be manufactured and tested within a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In
addition to providing mechanical property measurements, these tests will allow
observations the material's local deformation in real time, providing a wealth
of information about the failure mechanism of materials in a reactor setting.
Microstructural investigations of tested specimens using transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) can also be
performed to provide further information about the deformation mechanisms
involved. Not only will micro-tensile testing have a wide variety of
applications in materials research as a whole, but it will also allow a greater
number of labs around the world to safely conduct research with small amounts of
irradiated and radioactive materials. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in
collaboration with the Australian Academy of Sciences.
