This project supports a workshop on Logic related to Computer Science and
Programming Language Theory to be held at the Mathematical Sciences Research
Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, from November 13 to November 17, 1989, in
conjunction with MSRI's 1989-1990 Program in Logic. Somewhat different from
other meetings in the booming research area between Logic and Computer Science,
this workshop will focus on the influx of ideas from Computer Science to Logic.
The idea is to bring together some of the best researchers in this
interdisciplinary field and encourage them to think about and focus in their
talks on the implications of their work for logic. It is hoped that the
proceedings of the workshop will be a useful Sourcebook for Current Research in
Logic Motivated by Computer Science.
