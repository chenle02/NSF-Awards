Representation theory is a branch of algebra studying symmetries, especially
symmetries of linear mathematical structures, using groups of invertible
matrices. Representation theory of finite groups has numerous applications to
other areas, including number theory and mathematical physics. In this project
the linear structures are themselves finite matrix groups, or more generally
matrix groups whose entries satisfy divisibility properties with respect to a
fixed prime number. Geometric and combinatorial techniques will be brought to
bear to study representations of these groups, especially in the important case
when the representing matrices themselves have entries in a finite
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More precisely, the central aims of this project are
to (1) investigate a new approach to representations of Weyl groups and
unipotent representations of finite reductive groupsin terms of a new basis of
the Grothendieck group; (2) investigate a new formulation of the character
formula for semisimple groups in positive characteristic; (3) study Hecke
algebras with unequal parameters in the framework of the theory of parabolic
character sheaves; (4) study strata of a reductive group; and finally (5)
investigate new W-graphs associated to involutions in two-sided cells of a
Coxeter groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
