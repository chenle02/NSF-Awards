This project concerns the development, analysis and application of numerical
linear algebra tools for the quantitative study of important properties of
large-scale complex networks, such as centrality, betweenness and
communicability measures. Specifically, the investigator and his collaborators
study efficient algorithms for the fast approximation of the entries of matrix
functions such as the exponential and the resolvent of adjacency matrices and
graph Laplacians, as well as their traces. While these matrices are quite
sparse, in the case of complex networks they behave very differently from the
matrices associated with regular lattices (grids), such as those arising from
discretizations of partial differential equations. Hence, there is a need to
develop new methods, both computational and analytical, to deal with these very
large-scale problems. The investigator brings together expertise in classical
numerical analysis and approximation theory, as well as methods from spectral
graph theory and modern network analysis, to enable efficient computations
involving large graphs. Potential applications include the analysis of social
networks, the study of biological and neurological networks, applications in
physics and operations research, and so forth.

Over the last decade or so, the emerging field of network science has had a
profound influence on such different domains as physics, chemistry, biology,
operations research, engineering and the social sciences. A deep understanding
of network structure and dynamics is of great importance also for Homeland
Security and for many businesses, including financial institutions and
e-commerce. Detailed, quantitative models of massive and complex networks are
now pervasive owing to the unprecedented availability of data on just about any
conceivable topic. Extracting useful information from these massive data sets
and networks requires fast and accurate algorithms. Such algorithms can be used,
for instance, to rank the `importance' of elements of a network, i.e., to
determine which nodes are essential for the proper functioning of a network.
They are also used to determine bottlenecks in a network, and critical
connections in a graph. The importance of these notions for crucial parts of the
infrastructure of a country, such as power or transportation grids, cannot be
overstated. The investigator and his collaborators develop fast computer
techniques to solve these and related problems.
