PI will test the assumption that Paleozoic crinoids had only ligamentary
articulations, rather than the muscular arms of modern crinoids, by a variety of
methods, including experiments and observations on modern crinoids, isotopic
analyses, and studies of fossil crinoids. This project will improve our
understanding of crinoid functional morphology and provide new information for
studying preservational and evolutionary patterns.
