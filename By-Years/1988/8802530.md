This proposal will study phenomena associated with the reflection and
transmission of high intensity light at nonlinear interfaces, and the
development of optical devices based on the observed effects. Because of its
giant nonlinearities, a dye solution will be investigated as the nonlinear
medium, using a CW argon laser. This offers a unique opportunity to test
existing theories on nonlinear interface effects, such as bistability, beam
trapping along the interface, intensity dependent k-vector. To study the more
complex dynamics of reflection at saturable absorption interface, the amplitude
and phase of reflected and incident ultrashort pulses will be measured, using
single shot diagnostic techniques. Femtosecond resolved fluorescence as well as
the reflection in amplitude and phase of a probe pulse will be used to monitor
the complex susceptibility of the nonlinear medium behind the interface. A new
time resolved femtosecond imaging technique will monitor the reflected pattern
of intensity dependent k vectors. Direct applications that will be investigated
include the nonlinear switch active and passive (important for mode-locking
applications), an energy or intensity limiter, and an induced symmetrical
waveguide.
