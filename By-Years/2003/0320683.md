Maize is probably the most diverse of all crop species. The most significant
practical consequence of the huge genetic diversity within maize is the
phenomenon of hybrid vigor (heterosis). Distantly related lines tend to produce
highly vigorous F1 hybrids, which are planted across the entire Corn Belt. Yet,
the molecular basis of hybrid vigor is not understood. However, analysis of
allelic regions between inbreds has indicated that the same interval differs in
sequence and gene content. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that hybrid vigor
could be explained on the basis of different, yet complementing, gene sets in
the two inbreds. To investigate the extent of occurrence of such plus-minus type
changes, the genomic organization of two gene-dense genomic regions, bz and
fie2-orp2, will be investigated in a group of 12 inbred lines, races, and
relatives of maize. Twelve size-fractionated, NotI BAC libraries will be
constructed and bz and fie2 clones will be isolated and sequenced from each
library. Thus, &gt;1 Mb of DNA sequence will be generated and deposited in
central sequence repositories. The distribution of polymorphism will be examined
with respect to differences among heterotic groups and to the potential role of
inbreeding in genome rearrangement. BAC data will be analyzed with population
genetic methods to contrast evolutionary histories between genes and examine the
relationship between linkage disequilibrium and
recombination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific deliverables are:&lt;br/&gt;1. BAC
libraries specific to the bz and fie2-orp2 regions from 12
accessions&lt;br/&gt;2. 1 Mb sequence data deposited in GenBank and
maizeGDB&lt;br/&gt;3. Characterization of gene presence/absence and
polymorphisms in the selected regions&lt;br/&gt;4. Analysis of recombination
rates across multiple accessions for the specific regions&lt;br/&gt;
