Through this collaborative proposal, the investigators develop numerical
analysis and improved surface Cauchy-Born methods to ensure their reliability
and improve their efficiency. The mechanical behavior and properties of
nanomaterials is dominated by the effects of surfaces, whose effects become
increasingly important with decreasing nanostructure size. Surfaces can cause
unique, non-bulk mechanical properties, including elastic strengthening (i.e.
smaller is stronger) and phase transformations, and can serve as the nucleation
point for defects such as dislocations and twins. Major extensions of the
numerical analysis of finite element methods for continuum elasticity and its
coupling to atomistic models is required to enable the surface Cauchy-Born
methods to accurately compute problems with surfaces (defects) and discrete
surface microstructure, because the complex multi-well energy landscape of real
nanostructures must be confronted.

Many important future nanotechnologies, such as nanoscale resonant sensors,
nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), and stretchable nanoelectronics, can be
improved by a better understanding of how localized nanoscale surface effects
impact their effective mechanical properties and reliability. In particular, the
numerical analysis of surface Cauchy-Born methods improves the representation of
the key atomic-scale surface physics that govern defect nucleation, elastic
strengthening or softening, and the failure mechanisms of surface-dominated
nanomaterials.
