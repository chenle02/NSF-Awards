A unique group of monoclonal antibodies that are specific for the
dicarboxylate, monocarboxylate, and glutamate/aspartate transporters of the
inner mitochondrial membrane of pea plants will be used to screen lambda gt11
libraries for cDNA clones of these transport proteins. A partial clone for the
dicarboxylate transporter has already been isolated and the work will initially
concentrate on this protein. Once full length clones are available, they will be
sequenced and molecular modelling techniques used to evaluate their structures
within the membrane. When a structural model has been obtained, it will be
tested by using antibodies and chemical modifiers, both targeted to synthetic
peptides, to confirm the model by evaluating that portions of the proteins are
exposed to the cytosolic and matrix face of the mitochondrial membrane. The cDNA
clones will be used to produce the precursor form of the protein by in vitro
transcription/translation and heterologous expression in bacteria. These
immature forms of the protein will be used to study the incorporation of the
transporter into the mitochondrial membrane. They also will be used in an
attempt to isolate and reconstitute the receptor protein that is responsible for
recognizing the transport protein and guiding its incorporation into the
membrane. Mitochondria are the living cell's energy factory. Movement of
molecules into and out of mitochondria plays an integral part in the cell's
energy metabolism. The mitochondrion has a very complex membrane structure which
has not been amendable to biochemical analysis. New techniques of molecular
biology are being used to understand the membranes in which energy is generated
and molecules are transported.
