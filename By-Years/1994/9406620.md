This experimental project will examine the validity and feasibility of using
membrane reactors to isolate intermediate reaction products and reduce the
formation of byproducts by selectivity enhancement. The model system to be
employed is the oxidation of toluene to benzyl alcohol while limiting
undesirable benzaldehyde. Membrane reactors offer promise in facilitating
environmentally benign chemical process conversion.
