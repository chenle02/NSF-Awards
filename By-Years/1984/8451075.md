The research is directed toward studying several fundamental problems associated
with evaporation of liquid droplets. The information obtained contributes to an
understanding of factors affecting droplet evaporation rates, and is relevant to
more fundamental problems associated with homogeneous nucleation, bubble growth
within superheated liquids, and Leidenfrost boiling of droplets. Specific
problems being studied are: homogeneous nucleation and bubble growth within
droplets which are miscible mixtures of liquids at elevated pressures;
evaporation of liquid droplets on hot/porous ceramic surfaces; and combustion of
droplets in near-zero gravity. The emphasis is on experiment, though some
analyses are also performed. The principal means of data acquisition is
photographic.
