9510553 Williams This doctoral dissertation research project investigates the
causes and implications of the distribution of land use "bads" through zoning in
cities. "Bads" are defined as land uses that produce negative spillovers to
surrounding property. Using data from cincinnati, Columbus, Indianapolis, and
Milwaukee, the project investigates the effects of electoral institutions on the
distribution of land use bads and the politics of bureaucratic/legislative
relations between the planning department and city council in distributing these
policy outputs. The research also explores the efficiency implications of the
distribution of land use bads. Efficiency of bad siting patterns is measured in
two ways--the effect of bad siting patterns on property values, and the effect
of bad siting patterns on the supply of public goods. This study is innovative
and contributes to a larger theory of public policy distribution in two
respects. First, it examines the distribution of bads instead of the more often-
studied goods. Second, by studying distribution in cities, it is possible to
take advantage of institutional variation that does not exist in the study of
distribution in the United States Congress, where institutional structures are
fixed. ***
