In the rocky subtidal of boreal and subarctic oceans, the shallow, algal-
dominated zone is replaced by a deep-water dominated by suspension feeding
invertebrates. Despite the pervasiveness of the suspension feeding zone, the
mechanisms restricting sessile suspension feeders to the deep-water habitats are
not understood. This research will address specific benthic and oceanographic
processes limiting the vertical zonation of suspension feeders in the Gulf of
Maine. In addition to providing information on the influence of plant-animal
interactions and hydrodynamic conditions on community structure, the research
should be one of the first large-scale studies to make the necessary connection
between events in the water column and the vertical zonation of benthic-pelagic
coupling and productivity in rocky subtidal environments.
