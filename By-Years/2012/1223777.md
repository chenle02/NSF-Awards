This project, a collaboration between Brown University and Providence Children's
Museum (PCM) focuses on investigating children's developing social cognition,
particularly about how and why knowledge mediates the development of diagnostic
reasoning. The research team will explore tools for use by informal science
institutions like children's museums, science centers, and zoos. These tools may
be used to support children's metacognition around diagnostic reasoning and
causal learning as well as more broadly along with caregivers' understanding of
their children's learning processes in informal science education (ISE)
settings. Deliverables include: (a) a workshop and research manual for museum
professionals; (b) a blog; (c) a cross-discipline literature review on
metacognition and making learning visible; (d) reports from focus groups and
interviews with caregivers and children at PCM focused on learning and play in
the museum context; (e) a range of tools designed to help children and their
caregivers become aware of their metacognitive processes; (f) exhibit labels and
other communication tools for visitors to the museum; and (g) a permanent Mind
Lab space at PCM that will be used to communicate the work of the partnership
and research to the public. These deliverables will inform the development of a
model of practice that ISE professionals can employ when working with children
and their caregivers with the goal of making their learning and learning
processes visible.

This research project will advance the field by building theoretical
understanding around children's reasoning and scientific thinking. It will also
build capacity among academic researchers and informal science education
researchers, educators, and administrators by providing empirical support for
pedagogical decisions and strategies employed on a daily basis.
