In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Helen O. Leung and Prof. Mark D.
Marshall of Amherst College and their undergraduate research students will
investigate pathways of chemical reactions through the analysis of rotational
spectra obtained via Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. Included in these
studies are the interactions responsible for bringing molecules together for
reaction. This involves the interplay between electrostatic and steric effects.
They will be explored in systematic studies of gas-phase intermolecular
complexes between protic acids and haloethylenes, the first signs of electron
rearrangement that signal the start of chemical reaction in complexes containing
the reactive hydroxyl radical, and the ultimate disposition of chemical energy
at the end of reaction by determining the partitioning of energy among the
internal degrees of freedom of sulfur dioxide produced in thermal extrusion
reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will contribute to a better
fundamental understanding of the basic principles responsible for the chemical
transformation of matter and could potentially have direct application to the
chemistry of the atmosphere and of combustion. Through it, Prof. Leung and Prof.
Marshall will provide their undergraduate research students with the opportunity
to perform demanding experiments where they learn to integrate and apply
material learned in the classroom and to communicate their findings through
presentations at national profession meetings and publications in the scientific
literature.
