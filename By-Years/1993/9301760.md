The effectiveness of ecosystem modeling at regional and larger scales hinges on
both the quality of the science underlying model formulation and the quality of
the information system. This award will support the development of an object-
oriented Ecosystem Information System (EIS) that addresses four key problems
that plague large modeling efforts: (1) separation of the logical attribute of
data sources from their implementation detail: (2) identification of key
similarities and differences between different sources; (3) maintenance of
numerous, large data set instances from various sources; and (4) maintenance of
consistency in data set usage by simulation systems that combine inputs from a
variety of sources. EIS development will included the active participation of
both information systems and ecosystem modeling specialists. EIS will include
two major components: a software support system and a collection of ecosystem
research components implemented in (i.e., converted to) the object-oriented
paradigm. The EIS software will be a robust distributed system that provides
users in separate laboratories access to a common information resource. The
research components to be implemented within EIS include important "public" data
layers (e.g. soils, elevation, remote-sensed imagery), unique data layers
derived through our research (e.g., climate hydrology, land cover), and locally
developed simulation components that produce and analyze various data layers.
The object-oriented paradigm supported by EIS will be readily extensible,
allowing users to easily add new data sources (object classes), data set design
and implementation will provide not only an example of how to build information
systems to facilitate user access, but also permit researchers in a variety of
biological disciplines to access an important collection of ecosystem
components. This award is jointly supported by the Database Activities in the
Biological Sciences and Ecological Studies programs.
