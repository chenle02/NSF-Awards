This grant is for partial travel support to present a paper at the IUTAM
(International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics) conference on
Laminar-Turbulent Transition, to be held in Toulouse in September of 1989.
Discussions with various European and Asian researchers have also been
scheduled. The focus of research of the investigator is boundary layer
transition, specifically the non-linear evolution of wave packets which
eventually lead to the occurrence of turbulence.
