Subsequent to the early conferences, remarkable advances in molecular biology
have opened new opportunities for enzyme technology, and today there is an even
greater interest in the use of enzymes for therapeutic, analytical and chemical
production purposes. The program of the 9th Enzyme Engineering Conference thus
focused on the recent advances in enzyme structure research, on site-directed
mutagenesis for alteration of enzyme structure and activity, on immobilization
techniques for both enzymes and whole cells, affinity chromatography, transport
effects in reactors, and enzyme production and purification. The 9th Conference
was considerably more focused on developments in the life sciences, in
anticipation of subsequent engineering applications. The 10th Conference
continues this general approach; however, it will incorporate additional
sections on engineering applications. This conference is scheduled to be held at
Kashikojima, Japan, on September 24-29, 1989. Funds are to help support U.S.
participant expenses.
