The Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute (MTBI) was founded in 1997 at
Cornell University and is currently housed at Arizona State University (ASU).
MTBI's main objective is to increase the representation of U.S. underrepresented
minority students earning Ph.D.s in the mathematical sciences. MTBI focuses on a
pool of participants primarily composed of students from "nonselective"
institutions and students who typically do not consider the possibility of
graduate school in the mathematical sciences. Over the course of 15 summers,
participants have generated 146 technical reports and a large number of refereed
publications while having a direct impact on the research programs of ASU's
graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, visiting professors, and regular
faculty. MTBI has enrolled a total of 328 first-time undergraduate students and
69 returning students in its summer program. Over this timeframe an additional
114 graduate mentors have participated. Sixty-eight participants to date have
earned Ph.D.s.
