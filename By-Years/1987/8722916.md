The objective of this research is the investigation of characteristics of
cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning in High Plains thunderstorms during the North
Dakota Thunderstorm Project, scheduled for the summer of 1989. Professor Helsdon
will use existing direction finders to obtain data on the time, location, stroke
multiplicity, polarity, and signal strength of the CG lightning. A graphics
display system will be developed to analyze the lightning positions with respect
to satellite and radar data. Lightning locations with respect to radar and
satellite image features will be analyzed and compared with previous results
from other regions of the country. The relationship between feeder cell
evolution and CG lightning characteristics will be investigated and the effects
of hail episodes on lightning characteristics will be analyzed. Finally, a test
for the effects of glaciogenic seeding of CG lightning will be made.
