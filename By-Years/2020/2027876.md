The broader impacts of this RAPID project will provide an effective means to
control and manage the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) originating from
non-biological objects. This effort will lead to rapid development and testing
of a new technology to be used against coronaviruses. The current COVID-19
pandemic has generated worldwide awareness for the need to decontaminate the
environment and to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus. As SARS-CoV-2
(the virus that causes COVID-19) was newly introduced into the human realm,
uncertainty remains regarding the virus's spread and ways of decontamination. It
has been reported that coronaviruses might survive over three days on common
materials such as plastics, ceramics, glass and stainless steel. Cleaning and
disinfection of environmental surfaces are important for infection prevention
and control of healthcare-associated infections. This includes requirements for
surface disinfection, airborne virus decontamination and skin decontamination.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed RAPID project will advance the development of
Cold Adaptive Atmospheric Plasma Decontamination as an efficient approach for
disinfection. The project will develop a disinfection system based on cold
adaptive atmospheric plasma (CA2P), in combination with rapid detection of the
contamination on these surfaces. The proposed concept is an adaptive non-thermal
plasma system. This plasma-based system will be capable of rapidly scanning for
viral colonies on the surface and simultaneously directing the CA2P beam for
viral kill. The system will also be tested for treatment of airborne viruses.
Compared to current disinfection methods based on wet chemistry (biocidal
chemicals), the proposed CA2P technique would not cause corrosion of materials
nor create toxic chemicals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
