This work seeks to develop a quantitative understanding of the variables that
influence the activity and selectivity of the reactions of hydrocarbons over
supported metals. The work is relevant both to the catalytic production of
hydrocarbons (including synfuels) and to the activation of hydrocarbons and
their conversion into more complex products for use as industrial feedstocks,
fuels, or other end uses. Simple hydrocarbons are studied over supported metals
having different physical morphologies in the presence and absence of coadsorbed
species. The adsorbed hydrocarbon species are characterized using transmission
infrared spectroscopy and the rates of transformation into more stable surface
species are monitored using in situ infrared techniques. Attempts are made to
measure the rates of carbon-hydrogen and of carbon-carbon bond scission and to
quantify the effects of particle size and morphology on the concentration and
inherent reactivity of adsorbed hydrocarbon fragments. The study emphasizes the
behavior of two-carbon hydrocarbons (ethane, ethylene, and acetylene) on
crystallites of nickel or platinum supported on alumina or silica.
