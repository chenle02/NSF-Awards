9404315 Cole Aspects of essentially nonlinear stability in the laminar boundary
layer will be considered in the framework of the asymptotic triple deck theory.
Disturbances in the free stream such as vorticity or sound result in wave
packets which undergo explosive growth. The nonlinear disturbances are described
by a forced Benjamin-Ono equation. Chaotic pulsations are expected to result on
the way to transition. The results here have their primary application to the
prediction of laminar-turbulent transition in boundary layer flows, such as
those on aircraft or in jet engines. The understanding and control of turbulence
will make more efficient designs possible. Similar disturbances have been
observed in the atmosphere where large nonlinear wave systems appear. The
theoretical work here can lead to a better understanding of the interaction of
topography and storms.
