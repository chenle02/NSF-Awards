A Whispering Gallery sphere of the order of 50-200 microns must satisfy a very
sharp resonance condition if the Q of the sphere (or cavity) is high. If a
biological entity is attached to the sphere through an Si-O-antigen complex,
then, when an antigen attaches, there will be a small shift in the effective
refractive index that the Whispering Gallery mode(s) sees. This conceit has been
used for sensitive biodetection. By placing such a device within a laser cavity,
it is possible to measure not a wavelength shift associated with the attachment
of the biological entity, but a mode beating shift. By converting a measurement
in the optical domain (wavelength shift) to a measurement in the RF (Radio
Frequency) domain, i.e., a shift in the mode beating, sensitivity of measurement
can be increased by several orders of magnitude.
