This award supports cooperative research on theoretical nuclear physics to be
carried out by Akif Balantekin, William Friedman and Kirk McVoy of the
University of Wisconsin at Madison in collaboration with Brazilian physicists
Maria Nemes at the University of Sao Paulo and Carlos Bertulani at the Federal
University in Rio de Janeiro. They will study electromagnetic processes in
heavy-ion nuclear reactions. The immediate goal of the research is to
investigate whether bremsstrahlung radiation carries specific information about
the nature of nuclear fragmentation in relativistic heavy-ion reactions. Also to
be studied are the limitations of the widely used Williams-Weizacker virtual
photon limit of the electromagnetic excitation process by comparing to a fully
quantum mechanical treatment. The idea to use bremsstrahlung radiation is a new
one so the investigation will prove to be timely and interesting. This work will
bring together a team with unique experience on both sides. Besides the mutual
benefit to the U.S. and Brazil, this research will be beneficial to the
community of nuclear scientists.
