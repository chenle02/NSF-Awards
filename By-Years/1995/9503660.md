Abstract Schofield CTS-9503660 The PI proposes to investigate the combustion
chemistries of As, Sb, Se, and Hg, four toxic metals, whose presence can be of
concern in coal combustion and incinerator effluents. From the measured profiles
of the atoms, oxides, and chlorides of these metals obtained from seeded
H2/O2/N2 or H2/O2/Ar flat premixed flames using laser induced fluorescence and
emission spectroscopic techniques, he plans to deduce their distributions and
those of other possible unidentified species containing these metals as a
function of temperature. This information can lead to relevant thermochemical
data such as bond energies and heats of formation for these species fop which no
reliable data presently exists and to mechanistic insights involving the
kinetics of these species.
