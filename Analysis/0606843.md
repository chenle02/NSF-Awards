Ninth Riviere-Fabes Symposium on Analysis and PDE University of Minnesota,
Minneapolis, Mn April 7-9th, 2006. Abstract

The proposal is to support the attendance of junior faculty, post-docs and
graduate students at this years Riviere-Fabes Symposium at the University of
Minnesota.

The symposium will center on lectures by 2 distinguished senior researchers and
3 leading younger researchers on topics of current interest in harmonic analysis
and partial differential equations. Past symposia in this series have had
considerable influence on the field and it is expected that this will continue.
