Gregory Grant, Department of Chemistry, University of Tennessee Chattanooga, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
for research on the complexation of heavy metals by crown polythioethers and
mixed donor ligands. The research will study the influence of ring size and
donor atom (sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen, oxgen) on the stability and structure
of metal complexes. Multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
including 199-Hg, 113-Cd and 207-Pb NMR will provide detailed structural
information about these complexes in solution.

Complexation chemistry has potential impacts in environmental remediation,
catalysis, medicinal chemistry, separations and electrochemical sensors. This
research project will provide fundamental understanding of the metal-ligand
interactions in these complexes. This award is made under the "Research in
Undergraduate Institutions Program" and emphasizes the intergration of teaching
and research at undergraduate institutions. Undergraduate researchers will learn
important skills in synthesis and characterization of these chemical compounds.
