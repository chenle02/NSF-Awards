ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A research program by Salvatore Torquato, the
principal investigator, and his colleagues in the Dept. of Chemistry &amp;
Princeton Materials Institute is aimed at studying the statistical geometry of
jammed hard-particle packings. Efficient and novel algorithms are developed to
generate monodisperse and polydisperse packings of hard spheres, hard
ellipsoids, and hard spherocylinders in two and three dimensions. In particular,
efforts are directed toward improving the Lubachevsky-Stillinger and Zinchenko
packing algorithms. A randomized linear-programming algorithm will be devised to
test for ``jamming'' categories in the generated hard-particle systems, as well
as extensions to deal with nonlinearities in the impenetrability constraints.
The generated jammed packings will be statistically characterized by using high-
quality scalar order metrics and by collecting Voronoi tessellation statistics.
Finally, the aforementioned tools and algorithms will be employed to investigate
the space of jammed structures, including the identification of the maximally
random jammed (MRJ) state and low-density jammed
packings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important scientific advances and outcomes are
likely to emerge from the proposed research. This multidisciplinary project
joins the statistical physics, materials science, geometry, applied mathematics,
and high-performance computing communities. Unifying these different
perspectives and goals is a challenging task, but one that offers great rewards
to the computational-science community in general. Because particle packings are
widely used as simple models for granular materials, glasses, liquids, and other
random media, the proposed research will have important implications for the
development of novel materials as well as nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;
