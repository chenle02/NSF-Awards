The proposed research deals with analytically verifying the satisfaction of
timing constraints of component interfaces in board level circuits. A
methodology, VITCh (VLSI Interface Timing Checker), that will allow the analytic
timing verification of realistic board-level circuits through new models of
behavior and verification is proposed. A hierarchial model of interface behavior
that allows the task to be decomposed to minimize overall complexity is also
proposed. The proposed model will allow efficient timing analysis of board-level
circuits and thereby enable the analytical verification of large and complex
circuits that existing approaches are unable to verify. A CAD system
implementing VITCh to provide a testbed for experimentally validating the model
and methodology is proposed as part of the project. The proposer attempts to
solve the timing analysis problem by decomposing the task into several subtasks
that can be executed concurrently. Each subtask is performed such that timing
constraints are verified during the process of circuit behavior enumeration and
eliminates the need to build and analyze composite representations of circuit
behavior. The research plan includes testing VITCh on circuits ranging from tens
to hundreds of components to establish the range of applicability of the
algorithm as a function of circuit size.
