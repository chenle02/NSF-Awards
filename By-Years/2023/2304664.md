With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN)
Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Neal Devaraj of the University
of California, San Diego will develop chemistries for generating dissipative
phospholipid vesicles that exist far from equilibrium and are driven and
sustained by the provision of chemical coupling agents (chemical fuels). A
phospholipid vesicle, also known as a liposome, is a spherical structure made up
of a phospholipid bilayer, which forms a closed container that can encapsulate
various substances such as drugs or nutrients. This work will study dissipative
phospholipid assemblies that are self-organized, dynamic structures that
continuously consumes energy from chemical fuels to maintain their structure and
function. This project will also support the creation of an educational outreach
component aimed at introducing the principles of chemistry and self-assembly to
high school students with backgrounds underrepresented in the sciences.

This project will develop and characterize dissipative lipid assemblies and
explore the role of chemical fuel addition on the formation, chemical
composition, and properties of the generated supramolecular structures. While
energetically costly, dependence on chemical fuel can endow supramolecular lipid
assemblies with the ability to regulate the size and morphology of the
structures formed to rapidly respond and adapt to external stimuli. If
successful, this project will enable us to better understand the molecular
underpinnings of supramolecular self-assembly for generating dynamic lipid
systems with tunable size, shape, and properties. The knowledge gained from
these studies will also shed light on the fundamental benefit and drawbacks of
maintaining nonequilibrium assembled states in lipid systems, and will
facilitate the construction of functional lipid materials with adaptive
behaviors.
