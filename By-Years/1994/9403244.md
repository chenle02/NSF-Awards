9403244 Fox This research aims to develop a system to be used as a model for
testing fundamental genetic hypotheses dealing with the evolution of insect diet
breadth, including host shifts and/or expansions. Evolutionary mechanisms
responsible for diet breadth will be sought using two sibling species of seed-
feeding beetle, Stator beali (a specialist restricted to the host plant
Chloroleucon ebano) and Stator limbatus (a feeding generalist associated with
more than fifty host plant species). The work involves documenting patterns of
intra- and inter-population variation in oviposition preference and host
suitability, and subsequently examination of genetic and environmental sources
of this variation using laboratory and field experimentation. %%% Performing a
genetic analysis of mechanisms responsible for insect diet breadth is important
to understanding sympatric speciation, incorporation of novel host plant species
into diet (particularly for introduced pests), maintenance of genetic variation
within natural populations, and development of reliable pest control practices /
techniques. ***
