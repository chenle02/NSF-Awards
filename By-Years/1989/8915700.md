This award provides partial support for the operation of a high-temperature
calorimetry laboratory facility in the Department of Geological and Geophysical
Sciences at Princeton University. The facility is the only one in the U.S.
devoted to high- temperature solution calorimetry of geologically significant
minerals and plays host to a steady stream of visiting scientists whose research
requires use of its unique capabilities. The support provided by this award will
specifically be directed at making the Princeton calorimetry facility better
able to accommodate the needs of visiting researchers. The thermochemical data
produced in this laboratory provides the thermodynamic cornerstone of mineral
phase equilibria necessary for an understanding of the solid earth.
