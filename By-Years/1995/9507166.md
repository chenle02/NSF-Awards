9507166 Ecker The experiments described in this proposal are designed to
identify new components and characterize existing components of the ethylene
signal transduction pathway that link perception of the gas with changes in cell
morphology and gene activation. The proposed studies will integrate genetic,
molecular and biochemical approaches to unravel the actions of ethylene in
sensitivity (EIN) genes in response pathway. More specifically, we aim to: 1)
Continue genetic dissection of the ethylene response pathway using mutation and
epistasis analysis; 2) Examine interactions among the ethylene response proteins
using biochemical and yeast genetic approaches, 3) Identify new genes whose
products functionally interact with EIN2 and EIN3; 4) Characterize the
biochemical properties of the EIN3 gene product. %%% The application describes
experiments designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of ethylene action in
plants. Plants utilize gaseous ethylene as an important stress signal to
regulate both development and metabolic processes. The long-term goal of this
project is to understand the mechanisms by which this simple hydrocarbon is
perceived and its signal transmitted to nucleus to affect general information
about signal transduction mechanisms in plants. ***
