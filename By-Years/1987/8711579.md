This research is aimed at determining the complexity of various analysis
problems for Petri Nets. The problems considered include the boundedness
problem, the containment problem, the equivalence problem, various fairness
problems, the liveness problem, and the reachability problem. Also considered
are problems about verification questions that can be expressed via various
temporal logics. The problems are considered with respect to several subclasses
of Petri Nets in addition to the general case.
