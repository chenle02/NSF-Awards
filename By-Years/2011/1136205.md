This engineering education research initiation grant will allow the research
team--consisting of engineers, computer scientists, and educational
psychologists--to explore using serious electronic games to teach engineering
students the concepts of system design in a context of sustainable energy. The
research team will use affordance theory to guide the development and measure
the impact on student learning in two different
environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of
this project will be to inform the design of alternative educational methods
that can be widely applied both in the engineering classroom and to better
inform a broad section of society about the choices and tradeoffs associated
with sustainable energy. The proposed educational medium has the potential to
reach a broad cross-section of students, many who are in groups currently under-
represented in STEM disciplines. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goal
of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce
with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for
society is enabled by building the capacity of the nation's citizenry for
addressing societal challenges through engineering.
