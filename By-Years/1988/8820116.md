First-order phase transformations, as typified by the martensite reaction, are
being examined. The interrelation of discrete dislocation and nonlinear
continuum diffuse interface models of interfacial core structure is investigated
theoretically and experimentally in model martensitic systems. A nonlinear
nonlocal continuum theory explores the competition between nucleation and
continuous modulation modes of first-order transformations. Transmission
electron microscopy investigation of ferrite interfaces assists in defining the
interfacial structure. Homogeneous nucleation experiments are performed in
submicron austenitic particles, using high magnetic fields to supply additional
thermodynamic driving force.
