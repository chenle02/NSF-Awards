This award is for support to develop a time dependent analytical theory of
three-dimensional glacier flow perturbations caused by small bedrock undulations
and/or variation in basal resistance. The theory will be used to analyze data
from the Siple Coast ice streams. The main objectives of the work will be: 1) to
elucidate the cause of a number of observed surface undulations and local
variation in the surface velocity field of Ice Stream D, and 2) to analyze
theoretically the time scales associated with the buildup and decay of surface
undulations and to test those theoretical concepts against measurements of
surface and bedrock undulations from Ice Stream C. These objectives contribute
to understanding how spatial variations in topography and resistance to slipping
contribute to the support of the ice streams, the control of their speeds and
their influence on changes in discharge from the West Antarctic ice sheet to the
ocean. This work will be done in conjunction with NASA- Goddard Space Flight
Center (Robert A. Bindschadler).
