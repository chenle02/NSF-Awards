Dr. Blitz will investigate how the interstellar medium evolves from the diffuse
state which is characteristic of most of its volume into the dense molecular
state from which stars are formed. He will perform detailed observations of
small molecular clouds without star formation which are found preferentially at
high galactic latitudes, and which appear to have ages of less than 3,000,000
years. These young objects are imbedded in the atomic gas sheaths out of which
the molecular clouds condensed, and Dr. Blitz hopes to identify the reasons why
some parts of the atomic gas becomes molecular in these relatively simple
clouds. He will make detailed comparative studies of the gas and dust associated
with two giant molecular clouds that seem to be in different evolutionary states
in order to understand how the structure of a giant molecular cloud evolves with
time. Dr. Blitz will also explore the role of the molecular gas in the nuclei of
Seyfert galaxies. In the fundamental stellar cycle, where the interstellar gas
is collected into stars ultimately to be enriched with heavy elements and
ejected back into interstellar space, one of the least well understood phases is
the evolution of the diffuse gas into dense, star forming molecular clouds. We
currently know very little about how the diffuse interstellar medium collects
itself into giant molecular clouds and how these molecular clouds ultimately
fragment into individual stars and clusters of stars. Dr. Blitz' research aims
to illuminate the physical mechanisms by which the interstellar medium is
prepared for the formation of new stars. That is, he seeks to understand how
diffuse gas ultimately forms dense proto-stellar cores, the evolution of which
as been aggressively investigated by many workers.
