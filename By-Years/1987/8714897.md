This research program consists of several projects with a common theme,
understanding the chemistry, dynamics, structures, and electronic properties of
condensed materials under high pressures and, often, extremes of temperature.
The research centers on five problem areas: 1. Melting and Other Phase
Equilibria of Simple Solids and Solid Mixtures at High Pressures 2. A Search for
Nitrogen Metal at Room Temperature 3. Unsaturated Carbon Compounds at Very High
Static Pressures 4. Shock-Decomposition Chemistry of Benzene and Electronic
Spectra from and behind Shock Fronts 5. X-Ray Diffraction under Extreme
Conditions The emphasis is experimental. However, many of the systems they study
are relatively simple in the sense that their properties can be modeled by
theorists. They attempt to determine how these materials behave at high
pressures with sufficient precision to test the accuracy of these models and,
thereby, to contribute to improving their understanding of how materials respond
to high stresses on the molecular level. //
