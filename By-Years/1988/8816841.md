This award provides one-half the funding required to purchase the materials
necessary to build two piston-cylinder devices for high-pressure research. The
high-pressure system will be installed and operated in the Department of Geology
and Geological Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. The Colorado School
of Mines is committed to providing the remaining one-half funding necessary. The
piston-cylinder devices will be used in experimental work needing simultaneous
high-pressure and high-temperature for simulating conditions of the Earth's
interior. Research projects on the genesis and evolution of magma during
continental rifting episodes and on the mass transfer processes associated with
magma movement at depth will make immediate use of the new pressure system.
