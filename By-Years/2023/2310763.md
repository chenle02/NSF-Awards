This award supports the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine
(NASEM) Committee on Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Sciences (CAMOS), providing
an independent forum for identifying and discussing issues in atomic, molecular,
and optical sciences among the research community, the federal government, and
the interested public, thereby serving as a unifying force in this diverse and
varied field. CAMOS's scope also includes appropriate cross-disciplinary areas
and consideration of budget and programmatic aspects of the implementation of
the decadal survey undertaken by federal agencies.

The NASEM CAMOS will operate as an ad-hoc committee to support scientific
progress in atomic, molecular, and optical sciences and to assist the federal
government in planning programs in these fields by providing advice on the
implementation of decadal survey recommendations. CAMOS will assess progress on
the most recent decadal survey of the field, and monitor the progress of its
recommended priorities and critical scientific and technical activities. When
requested by a funding agency and approved by the National Academies, CAMOS may
write reports to address issues associated with the Decadal report to provide
agencies with timely advice on agency progress and implementation.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
