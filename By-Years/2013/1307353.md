In organizations, groups are assembled to pool expertise and knowledge, solve
complex and critical problems, and advance innovation. Yet, managing social
dynamics in work groups is challenging, particularly when the groups are diverse
in terms of gender, ethnicity, or cultural backgrounds.

This research tests questions about work group dynamics derived from multiple
theories of social influence. The aim is to move beyond questions about the pros
and cons of diversity to understanding the processes by which demographic
differences may influence group dynamics and performance, which will have more
important implications for practice. The studies will explore such questions as:
How do societal-level status differences influence multidisciplinary groups'
social dynamics and performance? What types of social interactions facilitate
both equity and efficiency in groups?

The study will be conducted in multidisciplinary engineering laboratories that
are at the forefront of scientific and technological innovations. From a policy
standpoint, the attraction and retention of female and minority scientists and
engineers has been a concern in both academic and corporate settings. The
findings from the proposed research will have practical implications for
facilitating inclusive and productive working relationships in diverse teams.
