Support is provided for a conference which identifies new research needs and
opportunities in the field of dynamics of mechanical systems. This topic
involves machines, mechanisms, and robotics and has become an important factor
in designing today's high-speed precision machines. The workshop's objectives
are to recommend important generic areas of research for the next decade, to
identify and rank specific research problems within these generic areas, to
identify acoustics funding activity in various federal agencies and industry,
and to demonstrate the relevance and importance of these areas to the
competitiveness of U.S. industry. The workshop is being organized under the
auspices of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and will be held in
Denver, CO, on August 10-13, 1986.
