This Biology Department has identified an opportunity to improve and diversify
its laboratory capabilities in five upper division biology courses and in the
undergraduate student research program. This entire array of objectives will be
met by the acquisition of the components needed to build upon and complete a
sophisticated cytophotometer system with fluorescence capabilities; that is, a
functional unit which the Department had previously begun to assemble with their
own resources. The added laboratory activities will include measurements of DNA
content, cell cycle studies, and chromosome analyses in genetics; cytochemistry
and fluorescence microscopy in cell biology; fluorescence cytophotometry and
biotinylated DNA hybridization in molecular biology; microbe identification in
microbiology; indirect fluorescence and direct immunofluorescence in immunology;
and a number of qualitative and quantitative techniques and additional
undergraduate research options. Scientific advances in certain aspects of
biology which heavily utilize these techniques coincide very well with the
nature of the curriculum, faculty expertise, and student interest here. The
grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from
non-Federal sources.
