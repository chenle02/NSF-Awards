9634685 Vipulanandan One of the biggest problems faced by the U.S. today is the
rehabilitation/replacement of millions of miles of decaying underground
wastewater pipelines. The conventional method of open trench construction is not
only disruptive to urban life but also costly. The disruption and cost can be
reduced by using trenchless technology methods that are becoming popular in
recent years in the U.S. One of the most popular trenchless techniques is
microtunneling, a laser guided, pipe jacking process. For microtunneling, the
pipes must have higher compressive stiffness and strength to avoid failure
during jacking and higher pipe stiffness and strength compared to plastic pipes
to maintain alignment during jacking. In order to satisfy the installation and
service loading conditions and to resist crown corrosion, an ideal candidate for
underground wastewater pipelines must satisfy the following three criteria: (1)
High compressive stiffness and strength (axial), (2) High pipe stiffness and
strength (lateral), and (3) Good corrosion resistance. It is planned to develop
new sandwich pipes that satisfy these three criteria. In order to demonstrate
the concept of sandwich pipe, high corrosion resistant polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
pipes are selected as the outer and inner tubes to encase the filler materials
with good mechanical and/or bonding properties. Variety of filler materials
including polymer concrete and cement concrete will be investigated. ***
