The area of workflow and business process management is undergoing a significant
transformation, because of a shift from process-centric to data-centric workflow
design and specification. The goal of this project is to articulate key research
questions and directions that should be explored in order to maximize and hasten
the realization of the practical and economic value of the new data-centric
approach, through a workshop that brings together leading researchers and
practitioners in the area.

Emphasis will be placed on research questions that can lead to new advances in
workflow management applicable to e-government, medical workflow, and scientific
workflow. The workshop will produce a report which articulates (i) the
fundamental reasons why the data-centric approach can provide significant
increases in the flexibility and efficacy of workflows, (ii) key research
directions that need to be pursued to enable this approach, and (iii) ways to
incrementally realize this approach in the targeted application areas.
