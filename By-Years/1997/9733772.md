This CAREER award will support a four year program of research and teaching
activities. The research will address the issues of the contribution of the
strange quark sea to low energy nucleon properties and the origin of CP
violation. The strange quark sea contributions will be measured using parity-
violating electron scattering of polarized electrons from nuclei. Experiments
will be carried out at the MIT-Bates Linear Accelerator Center (on the proton
and deuteron) and at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Center (on the
helium nucleus). These experiments will result in a determination of the strange
quark sea contribution to the magnetic moment and electric form factor of the
proton. The origin of CP violation will be probed through the measurement of the
branching ratio of a rare kaon decay to be carried out at the Brookhaven
National Laboratory. The teaching aspect of this proposal includes the
development and incorporation of learning modules using mathematical symbolic
manipulation software into several physics classes at the advanced undergraduate
level. Postdoctoral fellows and graduate students will be educated through
active contribution to the research projects funded by this award.
