The objective of this proposal is to continue current processing and
interpretation of 5 Gbytes of land-sea wide-angle reflection/refraction seismic
data recorded in an expanding spread configuration of the 1986 GLIMPCE project
in Lake Superior. The specific geophysical objectives are: (1) to extract,
identify, and analyze events returned from Moho and sub-Moho depths, to test the
correlation between the reflection and refraction Moho for both P &amp; S
phases, (2) to examine the nature of seismically transparent and layered crust
at the crust-mantle boundary, and (3) to determine the seismic velocity
structure within the Keweenawan rift. The more geological objectives are to
determine: (1) the evolution of the Keweenawan rift, (2) if true oceanic crust
exists along the rift's axis, (3) if there is a true continent/ocean boundary,
and (4) a comparison of these results with modern rifts.
