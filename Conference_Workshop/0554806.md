This conference is held at the University of Florida, from March 9th through the
11th, 2006. It is referred to as Ord06/UF

This conference is the ninth in a series initiated in 1998; these conferences
have involved some aspect of Ordered Algebraic Structures. Ord06/UF concentrates
on the role of frame theory in the subject. Ord06/UF, like its predecessors in
the series, brings together 25 to 30 mathematicians from various parts of the
globe, including graduate students and those who have recently received their
PhD degrees. A published proceedings of Ord06/UF is planned.

For as long as there has been academic training of mathematicians, research and
instruction have sought to abstract as a means towards understanding of the
concrete and the particular. Thus, the arithmetical properties of numbers became
abstracted to the theory of groups and rings, these being algebraic constructs
invented to ``explain'' why the real numbers, for example, behave the way they
do. Another school of researchers seized upon the geometric notion of distance
between numbers or points in space to develop the abstract concept of a
topological space, which establishes a sense of proximity without measurement of
distance. In both of these generalizations the aim has consistently been to
capture a greater catalogue of phenomena by the act of abstraction, and not to
create an esoteric replica of the instance that prompted the abstraction. In
this spirit the Ordered Algebraic Structurist has taken the natural ordering of
real numbers, together with its arithmetical and topological aspects, and
developed the lattice-ordered group and ring. The contributors to Ord06/UF,
broadly, have in common an interest in how a lattice-ordered group may best be
described by functions which take on most of their values in the real numbers,
and in which features of the construct are carried over to the algebra of
functions. In this tracking of properties, topological spaces and their
generalization to frames have increasingly played an important role. The notion
of an algebraic frame, in particular, has a dual identity, enabling one to
simultaneously capture topological and arithmetical properties, and, moreover,
how one set of properties influences the other.
