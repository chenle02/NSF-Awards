This research in mathematical and computational gravitation seeks to make
Einstein's equations more useful for observations of the cosmos which will be
coming to us within the next decade. Professor York will focus on the study of
formulations of the Einstein evolution equations that are mathematically
rigorous and useful for large-scale numerical implementation and for systematic
analytic approximation. There are also significant improvements in the initial-
value equations, the canonical action principle, and the Bianchi identities.
This work will exploit the methods of hyperbolic partial differential equations
from the mathematical literature, generalized so as to apply to Einstein's
theory. Development of certain fundamental concepts required for the existence
of a rational general-relativistic statistical thermodynamics will also be
studied.

There exists tremendous scope for advances in understanding and practical use of
gravity theory, matching those in experimental and observational gravity and
cosmology that have been, are, and will be continuing to occur. It is such
theory that this research will continue to find, to exhibit clearly, and to put
to work in the next several years and beyond.
