This work will focus on the measurements of elastic constants of geophysically
important minerals at high temperatures (above 1500 K, or in some cases up to
the melting point), and especially those of iron bearing minerals such as
fayalite, olivine, and pyroxene. This will require setting up a controlled flow
oxygen pressure environment around the experiment, similar to that used in
defect studies, and will require the use of new specialized talent skilled in
oxygen fugacity control. The anharmonic properties and empirical relationships
between anharmonic properties at high temperature for the three minerals will be
measured. These relationships are very helpful in giving constraints on mantle
convection theories and seismic tomography.
