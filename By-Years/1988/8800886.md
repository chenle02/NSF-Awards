This grant supports research on the properties of nuclei near A=100 amu. These
nuclei are neither spherical nor strongly deformed, and have proven difficult to
describe using conventional nuclear structure models. New techniques developed
by the grantees will be used to populate and measure the properties of low-lying
non-yrast levels in a sequence of transitional odd-A nuclei, and the results
examined for evidence of rotational multiplets. The latter have been predicted
using new models based on persistent rotational degrees of freedom.
