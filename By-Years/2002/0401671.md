This award will provide partial support for the 27th International Conference on
the Physics of Semiconductors will be held during the week of July 26-30, 2004,
in Flagstaff, Arizona, USA. The International Conference on the Physics of
Semiconductors has a long and respected tradition as the prime conference
covering the entire field of semiconductors. The scientific program will include
plenary sessions, four parallel oral sessions including invited talks, and
poster sessions. The NSF funds will be use to reduce fees for students (over 200
expected), support young participants from Latin America, provide reduced fees
for participation of qualified semiconductor physicists from minority
institutions, and provide support for invited speakers, especially from
colleagues from Eastern European countries and from other institutions overseas,
who do not have the funds to participate.
