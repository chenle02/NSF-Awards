A research site will be established at Virginia Polytechnic Institute for the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Engineering Logistics and
Distribution (CELDi). The center conducts research and develops integrated
solutions for logistics and distribution problems. Virginia Tech enhances CELDi
expertise in logistic systems, supply chain design, and material flow
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the research projects are shared
among all center members and eventually in the research literature. The
direction of the research is influenced by industry members and conducted by
some of the most talented faculty and students in the country. The research
results from CELDi impact industry operations directly, provide improved
approaches for practitioners who see the research results at conferences and in
publications, and extend the general body of knowledge in logistics and
distribution.&lt;br/&gt;
