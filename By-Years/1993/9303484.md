A calculus of operations are being developed to facilitate maintenance of
programs by non-specialist programmers. Operations are to be performed on an
"enhancement structure" of a program rather than the (more complicated) program
text. Enhancement structures are based on the methodology of stepwise
enhancement developed under a previous NSF grant. This continuation award
includes a supplement to support research experience for an undergraduate
participant. %%% Previously a tool, PT, was built to support the major steps of
stepwise enhancement, applying techniques to skeletons, and composition of
programs enhanced from the skeleton. Enhancement structures have now been
defined formally. The specific task to be performed by the undergraduate student
is to enhance PT to directly manipulate enhancement structures. The maintenance
operations would be performed directly on the enhancement structures, rather
than by reapplying operations directly on programs as is the case currently.
