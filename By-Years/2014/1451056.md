There is an increasing demand for sensitive, flexible, and low-cost pressure
sensing solutions for health monitoring, wearable sensing, robotic and
prosthetic applications. This proposal describes a translational research plan
to develop highly sensitive pressure sensing devices to map pressure
distributions at an ultrafine spatial resolution. The proposed sensing
technology offers a powerful alternative to the solid-state pressure sensors, by
providing an unprecedented sensitivity and ultrafast response time in a
completely transparent, flexible and adaptive platform. Potential applications
can be integration with existing medical applications: given its low-cost and
flexible design,the sensor can be readily integrated into existing medical
devices (e.g., disposable catheters) for physiological pressure monitoring; and
artificial skin with digital sensation: our ultrasensitive and flexible sensor
film can be integrated onto the soft fingertip surface of a glove to stimulate
the sense of touch.

This proposal intends to deliver the world first microfluidics-enabled flexible
pressure-sensitive film for biomedical applications, as a powerful alternative
to the existing solid-state pressure sensors. The proposed microflotronics
sensors offer several unique advantages over existing pressure sensing
technologies: ultrahigh sensitivity, low cost, rapid mechanical response,
ultrathin profile, soft skin-like construct, stable sensing units, and optical
transparency. The microfluidics-enabled sensing devices pioneered by this team
have shown promise in an array of unconventional applications in which a minute
amount of liquid sensing elements rapidly respond to an external load by
altering the physical properties or geometries.
