Abstract ATM-9628759 Feng, Xiahong Dartmouth College Title: Dendrochronological
and Stable Isotope Studies of Tree-Rings for Selected Areas of the United States
Tree-ring techniques have been increasingly used for climate and paleoecological
studies with time scales of hundreds to thousands of years. The record of stable
isotopes in tree-rings may provide detailed information about present and past
climate. This project is designed to study the climatic implications of stable
isotopes in annual tree-rings and to address the basic analytical and
interpretive issues related to this methodology. This award will address the
signal-to-noise ratios of the isotopic records and the fundamental question of
replication: can reasonably homogenous hydrogen and oxygen isotope chronologies
be developed from several trees at a single site? The project will also focus on
the effects of tree age and microenvironment on the derivation of climatically-
sensitive isotope chronologies.
