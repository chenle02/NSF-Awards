Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-0245260&lt;br/&gt;Bent/Stanford&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
addresses the fundamental chemistry needed to allow the integration of
semiconductor and organic thin film materials. Synthetic strategies for the
controlled attachment of organic molecules to semiconductor materials are being
developed by Professor Bent and her coworkers in the Chemical Engineering
Department at Stanford University. Approaches to first layer attachment are
being examined, along with general strategies for the attachment of second layer
molecules to the organic interface. The third focus of the research is on the
controlled patterning of these semiconductor-organic interfaces. The results of
this work provide the fundamental understanding necessary for the development of
the processing chemistry for the next generation of molecular electronic
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program, Professor Bent and her collaborators at Stanford University
are exploring synthetic strategies for the attachment of organic layers to
silicon and germanium surfaces. Using approaches developed in standard organic
synthesis, they are investigating vacuum based methods for the controlled
modification of semiconductor surfaces with a range of organic molecules. The
results of this research provide the basis for the processing of molecular
electronic devices. &lt;br/&gt;
