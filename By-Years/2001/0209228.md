This project focuses on system-level mapping of applications written in
imperative programming languages such as C to multiple FPGA computing systems by
the synergistic collaboration of program analysis, parallelizing compiler
technology and behavioral synthesis tools. The proposed research addresses
system-level partitioning and scheduling of the execution of tasks among
computing cores based on high-level program analysis as well as managing the
storage and movement of data between both internal and external memories and
between tasks. This project is the first comprehensive, and automatic,
integration of parallelizing compiler technology with EDA synthesis. It is also
the first attempt to integrate in a compiler high-level loop transformations
guided by estimates provided by commercially available synthesis tools. The end
result is a realistic and accurate design space exploration strategy we believe
is widely applicable to current and future multiple FPGA systems as well as
future System-On-a-Chip (SoC) systems. An automated application mapping approach
that addresses system-level issues as proposed in this research will ultimately
allow designers to explore a wider range &lt;br/&gt;of application mapping
strategies for SoC systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
