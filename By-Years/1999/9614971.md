9614971 Sacks The PIs propose to study the effect of water on seismic properties
of mantle subduction zones by providing experimental data needed to model this
regime. The proposed research will involve experimental measurements of sound
velocities using their newly developed controlled-pulse- transmission technique
on artificially hydrated, natural mantle peridotite at high pressures and
temperatures. ***
