A diversified program of research in nuclear physics and related fields will be
carried out using the University of Pennsylvania tandem Van de Graaff
accelerator and other facilities. Some specific areas which will receive
attention include: gamma ray spectroscopy of nuclei far from stability using a
newly constructed 4pi charged particle detector; charged- particle spectroscopy;
studies of light nuclei at extreme values of spin and deformation using
resonance techniques; experiments aimed at understanding the mechanism of heavy-
ion-induced reactions at both low and intermediate energies; electron scattering
as a probe of nuclear structure; inelastic scattering and charge-exchange
reactions involving pi mesons; continued development of accelerator mass
spectrometry as a tool to measure extremely low concentrations of radioisotopes.
Development of scientific instrumentation will also be pursued, with emphasis on
detector development, applications of parallel processing to the acquisition and
analysis of nuclear physics data, and exploration of new methods of generating
intense beams of negative ions.
