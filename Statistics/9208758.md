This project will provide support for postdoctoral fellows at the National
Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS), to engage in cross-disciplinary
research with significant statistical research components. Jerome Sacks is
Director of NISS, located in Research Triangle Park. NISS is a recently formed
institute whose inspiration came initially from an NSF sponsored workshop on
cross-disciplinary research. Subsequent meetings in the statistical community
produced a site selection procedure and, ultimately, the Research Triangle site.
The creation of the Institute responded to the fact that in order to address
major national problems or "Grand Challenges", substantial progress has to be
made in the methods and applications of statistical science. A critical
component of a continuing effort in this direction is the involvement and
encouragement of junior researchers. The present project will support junior
fellows to work on dedicated projects of high importance. It will provide
postdoctoral fellowship support for projects of a cross disciplinary nature. The
scope of the project is closest to the role of the institutes in mathematics
(IMA, MSRI, IAS). However, the outlook is quite different. While the mathematics
institutes support postdoctoral fellows, their focus is on active collaboration
with researcher from different disciplines, to solve important "national
problems" which involve new statistical research, in a manner fully consistent
with recommendations of the Commission the Future of the NSF. ( See: A
Foundation for the 21st Century, 1992.)//
