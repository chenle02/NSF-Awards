Proteins are central to carrying out life?s processes and provide the link
between genetic information and biological function. Understanding protein
action is critical in understanding biology at a molecular level: improving our
knowledge has applications ranging from developing drugs to synthesizing
biofuels. This project will develop a new approach for studying protein action
based on comparing the detailed chemical and physical properties that the
molecules create. This new approach will provide better techniques for finding
related molecules, or understanding the differences between similar ones. Better
matching techniques will enable new tools for inferring the function of
uncharacterized proteins, designing proteins to achieve specific goals, and
studying evolutionary relationships.

This project will lead to new coursework in visual computing and biochemistry,
contribute to training undergraduates and graduate students, and provide
outreach to K-12 science education.
