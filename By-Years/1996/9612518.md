9612518 Keeling In this project, measurements of the concentration of molecular
oxygen and carbon dioxide in air samples will be continued. The samples are
collected at a series of baseline sites around the world. The data will lead to
improved estimates of the net exchange of carbon dioxide with land biota and the
oceans, of marine photosynthesis rates, and of atmospheric mixing rates. These
results are needed to improve our understanding of the processes regulating the
buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and of the processes regulating
marine and terrestrial ecological functions in relation to various agents of
change, especially climatic changes. In support of the measurement program,
absolute standards for oxygen in air will be developed in order to ensure stable
long-term calibration. A survey of the oxidative oxygen/carbon ratios of
terrestrial and marine organic carbon will be conducted, in order to improve the
quantitative basis for linking the oxygen and carbon dioxide geochemical cycles.
