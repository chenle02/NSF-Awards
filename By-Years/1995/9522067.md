This is a Planning Grant to develop a five year continuing grant proposal under
the Minority Institutions Infrastructure (MI-I) program. The institution plans
to develop activities which are part of their long range plan, Project RAISE,
Research Advancement in Science Education. As a part of these activities, a
proposal for a five-year continuing grant will be developed. Winston Salem State
University is one of sixteen institutions comprising the University of North
Carolina System. It is a predominately African-American undergraduate
institution serving the educational needs of Winston-Salem and the northwest
Piedmont area. There are currently 226 students majoring in computer science and
the project, if successful as a five-year proposal, has the potential ultimately
to significantly increase the number and quality of students graduating in
computer science.
