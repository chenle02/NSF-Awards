This project investigates the Leadership Content Knowledge (knowledge of
mathematics, how it is learned, how it is taught) of secondary school
administrators. We will explore the nature of secondary administrators. LCK, how
a "Lenses on Learning" course affects this LCK and how materials design
principles developed for K-8 Lenses function at the secondary
level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate these questions while
developing, piloting, and field-testing a six-session "Lenses on Learning"
module in which administrators will do and discuss mathematics; explore how
students learn mathematics and how it is best taught and link these ideas to
their administrative practice. &lt;br/&gt;Collaborators will be three pilot-test
sites in the Boston area, six nationally-distributed field-test sites, internal
and external evaluators, advisory board and publisher (Pearson
Learning).&lt;br/&gt;
