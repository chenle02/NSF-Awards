The North Carolina Partnership for Improving Mathematics and Science (NC-PIMS)
is a joint effort between 4-partner institutions of the University of North
Carolina General Administration (East Carolina University, Fayetteville State
University, University of North Carolina-Pembroke and the University of North
Carolina Wilmington) and the University of North Carolina Mathematics and
Science Education Network (UNC-MSEN) which has centers at three university hubs.
School district partners number 17 in proximity to those hubs. An additional
partner is the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. The partner
districts have a student population in excess of 200,000 (with over 40%
classified as minority) and share the common characteristics of being rural and
poor relative to state averages. To help the school districts increase student
learning of science and mathematics while simultaneously decreasing current
achievement gaps, NC-PIMS has three foci:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. To develop
Policies and District Leadership that support mathematics and science
instruction. Efforts include: (a) establishment of a State Advisory Board to
align policies and improve communication between districts and state agencies;
(b) establishment of District Leadership Teams to help integrate the project
within district reform efforts; and (c) STEM professionals who will assist
teachers in enhancing the depth of content in instruction.&lt;br/&gt;2. To
provide Teacher Professional Development and Support. Activities include: (a)
hiring full-time Facilitators who will deliver professional development and
provide direct support to teachers; (b) education of building-level Lead
Teachers (designated elementary teachers and department chairs of middle and
high schools) who will become model teachers and provide inservice for peers;
and (c) creation and delivery of eleven professional development courses in
science and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;3. Implementation of Student Engagement
activities that encourage students to remain engaged in science and mathematics
learning. Examples include: (a) out-of-school student activities to generate
motivation in preK-8; and (b) information sessions for parents to assist them in
supporting children's learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
