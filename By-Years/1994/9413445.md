This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Yale University acquire a 750 MHz NMR Spectrometer
which will be used in research. The research activity to be supported includes:
Yale Core Research (i) NMR in Highly Polarized Samples, Polyhydrides and
Catalysts (ii) Structure Determination in Media with Magnetic Field Induced
Order (iii) NMR Studies of the Structured of RNA and Protein-RNA Complexes (iv)
Determination of the Structures of RNA's and Ribonucleoproteins by NMR (v) NMR
Studies of Quinone Orientation in Biological Membranes (vi) A Comparison of
Amorphous Alumina and Mesoporous Molecular Sieves Research by Outside Users
(Academic and Industrial) (i) Solids NMR Studies of Biological Systems Using a
750 MHz Spectrometer (ii) NMR Studies of DNA and Proteins (iii) Probing
Structure in Low-Dimensional Conductors (iv) The Study of Acid and Basic
Catalysts (v) Intermolecular Coherence Transfer (vi) Nucleophilic Substitution
Mechanisms of Transition Metal Complexes in Zeolites (vii) High Field Optically
Pumped NMR of Thin Film Materials Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize
specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers and
catalysis, and in biology.
