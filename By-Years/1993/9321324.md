9321324 Lesser Control, the intelligent selection of actions to execute, is
critical to the performance of knowledge-based systems such a planners job shop
schedulers, and speech understanding systems. This is particularly true for
parallel systems in which the controlling agent has the additional goals of
maximizing the utilization of parallel resources. The proposed research studies
the issues of control in parallel knowledge-based systems through the
development of a theory of control based o an analysis of task interactions and
the influence of the environment. The theoretical approach to control issues is
based on the observation that control is a knowledge-based on an understanding
of the interactions between the problem-solving process, the problem domain, and
the specific environment in which a problem-solving episode takes place. This
effort will be an extension of previous efforts to develop a formal model of how
the structure of a domain influences ad constrains the choice of methods used to
develop solutions within that domain and in developing stochastic models of
environments. These efforts will be extended towards modeling effects that are
particularly significant in parallel computations. Specifically, the nature of
task interactions will be explored.
