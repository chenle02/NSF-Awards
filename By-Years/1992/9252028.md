A distributed computing environment for course work and independent study
projects is being developed. The computing environment is having a major impact
on the upper level mathematics and computer courses that form the department's
Computer Information Systems major; the environment supports coursework in
distributed data bases, concurrent programming, multitasking and network
operating systems, operations research and mathematical modeling and simulation.
Students have access to high performance workstations to study numerical methods
for solving large linear algebraic systems and large stiff systems of
differential equations.
