This project addresses research in design methodology and interactive graphics.
Specifically, it is aimed at the development of computer-aided design software
utilizing nonlinear programming algorithms with imbedded artificial intelligence
concepts and progress monitoring capability. The final concept evolved will be
such that a user would specify the design goals and delimit the feasible design
space and then direct the computer to develop the best design for a mechanical
system or part thereof.
