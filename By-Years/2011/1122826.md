Given that the United States Supreme Court is not specifically required to
follow past decisions, it has been difficult to explain why the Court ever
adheres to precedent that it does not agree with. Consequently, research to-date
has sought to determine if the Supreme Court is an unconstrained political actor
or if it is constrained by a norm of following precedent. The current research
responds to this existing puzzle by empirically testing the theory that the US
Supreme Court adheres to precedent because of its effect in guiding lower court
decision-making in those thousands of cases that the US Supreme Court will never
hear. The research plan involves coding 53 US Supreme Court cases and 1700 Court
of Appeals cases from the period 1965 through 2008 related to gender equity
claims. Using this data, the researcher will test the relationship between
precedent and other political and institutional
concerns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings from this research will advance
understanding of the impact of existing legal decisions on the present decision
making processes of the US Supreme Court.
