Mathematically well-understood random graphs serve as reference models which can
guide the analysis and design of (models for) real world networks such as
communication networks, social networks, or food chains. This project aims at
developing and advancing mathematical tools and techniques for analyzing various
random graphs, including "dynamic" models (i.e., graphs that grow step-by-step
in a random way). The dynamic aspect is conceptually important since (a) many
real-world networks also grow over time, whereas (b) the majority of the
existing mathematical random graphs literature focuses on "static" models. This
project thus contributes to the interdisciplinary effort of understanding
networks, which are nowadays omnipresent in real life as well as in data
science, complex networks, and many other disciplines.

This project explores a topic which is central to the theory of random graphs:
the phase transition phenomenon in the component structure (from only "small"
components to a "giant" component dominating most of the graph). The PI will
investigate this fundamental and striking phenomenon in several difficult-to-
analyze random graph models, with particular emphasis on (the finite-size
scaling behavior of) the size of the largest component in models with non-
trivial dependencies between the edges. Two principle aims are (i) to advance
our general understanding of the phase transition, and (ii) to improve the
mathematical proof techniques in the area, in particular to make them more
robust (so that they apply to a wider range of models).
