9315767 Pyrak-Nolte The PI will investigate on the laboratory time scale active
seismic monitoring of fractures or interfaces undergoing frictional sliding and
stick-slip behavior. Active seismic monitoring involves propagating
compressional/shear waves across interfaces under shear loading. Results from
this work on the laboratory scale should illuminate one of the key questions of
earthquake prediction and joint stability. In order to achieve this objective,
two critical issues will be addressed: (1) the observation of changes in seismic
amplitudes or velocities as a fracture undergoes frictional sliding and stick-
slip behavior, and (2) relating seismic precursors to the surface conditions of
the fracture. ****
