The project will support an initial, limited field-test of a new navigation
capability for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating under icebergs
and ice shelves. This system will enable an AUV to navigate and position itself
with-respect-to a moving ice surface, rather than with-respect-to the seafloor
and/or an inertial reference frame. Expected ice motion includes both
translation and rotation. To achieve this goal, maps will be generated of
submerged ice surfaces, and real-time algorithms which compute the AUV's ice-
relative position using sonar soundings of those surfaces will be developed and
demonstrated. This capability will augment all existing AUV under-ice navigation
techniques. The system will generate maps that allow a science team to select
and visit under-ice sites (either with an AUV or an ROV) by providing a much
broader perspective of the submerged ice surface than has ever been possible
before. It will also be possible to return to specific sites for experimentation
and serial observations, and includes the ability to hold station in support of
imaging and sampling missions. It will also increase the safety of AUV
operations in these hazardous environments. Field tests will be performed during
an already funded cruise to study icebergs in the Antarctic.
