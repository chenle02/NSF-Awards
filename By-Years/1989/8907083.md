This research grade instrument will serve the need of two major user groups from
the Chemistry Department that employ vibration spectroscopy on the following
areas of research: a) The structural and functional characterization of
halobacterial light-energy transducers and photosensors. b) The study of
mechanisms of enzyme catalysis and inhibition; of protein conformational states
and folding; and of mechanism-based drug design. For both projects FTIR has
become an essential tool to study protein molecular changes and reactions of
amino acid side chains. In addition two minor users groups will use the
instrument for studies on: a) The physical and chemical basis of eye lens
transparency, and b) The study of the structure and function of Bleomycins; a
group of anticarcinogenic metalbinding glycopeptide antibiotics.//
