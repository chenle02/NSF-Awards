With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
R. Daniel Little, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the
University of California, Santa Barbara, is studying the reaction chemistry of
trimethylenemethane diradicals and 1,3-diyl radical cations. Using diazenes as
diradical precursors, Professor Little is exploring the factors responsible for
selective formation of 8-membered ring carbocyclic compounds or their 6-membered
ring isomers, as well as oxygen- and nitrogen-containing heterocyclic analogs.
Symmetrical and unsymmetrical 1,3-diyl radical cations are the subjects of
studies relating to the assembly of 7- and 8-membered ring compounds as well as
mechanistic analyses of cation radical equilibration and recoil accompanying
loss of nitrogen from diazenes.

Many organic compounds which display interesting chemical or biological activity
contain 7- or 8-membered rings of atoms. The development of efficient techniques
for the synthesis of such cyclic compounds remains of great interest,
particularly in light of the generally greater stability of smaller-ring (5- and
6-membered) compounds. Professor R. Daniel Little, of the Department of
Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is
developing new reactions allowing the selective synthesis of 7- and 8-membered
ring compounds and studying the factors responsible for the selectivity of these
reactions.
