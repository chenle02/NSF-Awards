The problem of large scale post-earthquake urban search and rescue has been
recognized in recent foreign earthquakes (Mexico City 1985, Armenia 1988).
Initial actions have been taken to develop an urban search and rescue response
capability in the United States. This effort has been based on fragmentary
experience. The planning assumptions of local, state and Federal response plans
have been of a hypothetical nature. The Loma Prieta earthquake, while not a
major event in terms of building collapse, does provide a very useful occasion
for the testing of urban search and rescue (USAR) response planning assumptions.
It also provides the opportunity to assess the relevance of USAR training
programs which have been developed to date. This work along with other research
under way on emergent group formation and rescue equipment performance should
provide timely guidance for major investment in the USAR response system which
is now being contemplated by local, state and Federal agencies.
