Undergraduate students will be involved in the research activities of the radio
astronomy group at Cornell University. The undergraduate students will work
directly with members of the Cornell faculty and research staff on projects
covering a range of disciplines in radio, infrared, and radar astronomy, and
related theoretical topics. Many students will participate in observations at
one of the facilities used by Cornell scientists in their research. Some will
use the supercomputing resources available at Cornell. The students will conduct
individual research projects and also participate in group activities such as
seminars. Attempts will be made to encourage participation by students at
undergraduate institutions, by women and by minority students. This program will
be a continuation of the undergraduate program established in the summers of
1989 and 1990.
