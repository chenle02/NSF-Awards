University of Arkansas Little Rock TITLE: Exploring Engineering Through Project-
based Experiential Learning NSF RECEIVED DATE: 06/04/2002

Abstract

The proposal will establish a bridge connecting engineering education in the
Donaghey College of Information Science and Systems Engineering (DCISSE) to the
College of Education (COE) at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. A
series of three thematic engineering courses has been proposed to bring
engineering education to the pre-college educators, education majors, and high
school students. The courses will be implemented using Project-Based
Experiential Learning (PBEL) philosophy that is currently popular in Freshmen
Design Experience Programs. The novelty of the proposed approach is that the
courses will be designed to be intellectually substantive, taught on a just-in-
time basis in context to a real-world problem, and the courses will also satisfy
curricular requirements of engineering / engineering technology degree programs
to insure that these do not function as service courses. The math prerequisites
will be mid-level high school algebra, and the courses will be open to any
student who wants to explore engineering. The enthusiasm for such an approach
has been prompted by the success of a PBEL course that was initiated last fall
in DCISSE, and cognitive scientists assertion that theoretical ideas are much
easier to learn when the theoretical understanding is closely coupled to real-
world experience. .
