This research involves two cultural anthropologists from CUNY and Fordham
Universities in New York in a study of the local reaction to anti-Mafia
activities in Palermo, Sicily, Italy. The researchers will live in a lower-class
neighborhood of the city and study the reactions of people to the tension in
contemporary Italian society between reformers who wish to change the nature of
Sicilian civil society to give less support and encouragement to Mafia
activities, and the `Sicilianist` reaction to anti-Mafia activities which
defends local identities, language and customs against a `modernist` critique
which is seen as disloyal to Sicily. Using techniques of participant observation
the anthropologists, both fluent in local languages and very familiar with local
cultural and historical issues , will study the successes and failures of the
contemporary anti-Mafia movement. This research is important because as the
European common market (and other such agreements such as NAFTA) expands to
control more cultural and social issues, the tension between democracy movements
of restructuring local civil society are being undermined by regional
nationalism. Understanding in depth of one case study will illuminate general
processes in common with other situations, and aid policy makers in the search
for improved democracy which is sensitive to local history and culture.
