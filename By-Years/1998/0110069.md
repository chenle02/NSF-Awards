Water use efficiency (WUE)is among the most fundamental constraints molding the
evolution of terrestrial plant cellular anatomy, tissue structure, physiology,
and whole-plant morphology. Due to extensive physiological control, modern
plants of both natural and agricultural systems have a tremendous capacity to
maintain high rates of growth and productivity over a wide range of often
challenging environmental conditions.Nonetheless, water utilization and the WUE
of growth remain the single most important determinants of terrestrial
productivity in both natural and managed ecosystems. Genes that act, singly and
in concert, to regulate the development and plasticity of essential plant traits
controlling WUE will be characterized. WUE is defined as the ratio of carbon
gain in photosynthesis (A) to the associated water loss (E). A genomic analysis
of WUE will be undertaken in two crop plants, rice and tomato. Stable mapping
populations already available will be the basis of the first screen in whole-
genome QTL analyses of rice and tomato. Phenotypic measurements, both
physiological and morphological, will be made on contrasting phenotypes at
several stages.Fine-mapping efforts will focus on QTLs that condition the most
interesting phenotypes. These activities will enhance understanding of the
integration of plant water relations and carbon metabolism, develop the most
detailed maps of WUE genes and comparative maps across multiple species, and
provide new molecular markers to greatly enhance breeding programs for improved
WUE.
