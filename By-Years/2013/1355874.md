This proposal further develops a software package that autonomously generates
head and eye movements, in a virtual assistant or social robot synchronized with
real-time speech for "human-like" conversation. Existing solutions use
preprogrammed head and eye movements for conversation, as current technology
cannot synchronize head and eye gaze for real-time speech. The proposed
technology can be used in interactive open-ended conversations and can adapt to
gender and culture of the conversation partner. This project presents three
contributions to human-computer and human-robot interaction. First, autonomous
generation of head and eye gaze in a virtual assistant or social robot
synchronized with real-time speech for open-ended interactive conversations.
Second, the front end of the social agent responsible for gesture generation is
completely independent of the back end knowledge base; hence deployments of
virtual assistant or social robot solutions are easier, cheaper, and faster.
Third, the technology enables generation of social gaze sensitive to gender and
culture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project include the
validated benefits of the technology for end users, such as increased social
acceptance, increased positive feelings, increased engagement, improved
understandability, and superior likeability. Stemming from encouraging initial
discussions with end users the proposed technology may be transformative in a
large number of markets like video games, online marketing, web customer
service, telepresence, telemedicine, entertainment, eldercare, and
healthcare.&lt;br/&gt;A successful deployment of the technology may result in
substantial cost savings to organizations that deploy virtual assistant or
social robot solutions, and increased revenues for the vendors of these
solutions due to accelerated consumer adoption.
