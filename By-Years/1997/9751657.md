San Diego Miramar College proposed to improve the quality of learning and
breadth of instruction in Biotechnology by providing "hands on" laboratory
experiences for both community college and high school students in their shared
teaching facility at Scripps Ranch High School. Responding to the national need
to implement biotechnology skill standards and improve biotechnology
instruction, this project features training and practice in the use of industry-
based research techniques with an emphasis on team work, critical thinking and
problem solving skills. Project objectives focus on helping students gain the
laboratory competencies required for entering the field of biotechnology and/or
for advanced study in the field. During the term of the grant, instructional
laboratory activities will be produced to develop student skills in: 1) basic
laboratory techniques, 2) immunology, 3) tissue culture and 4) working with
nucleic acids. Project Co-PIs will join in a collaborative effort with industry
representatives, Miramar faculty, Scripps Ranch High School faculty and other
local educational institutions in order to recruit underserved and
underrepresented students, accomplish project goals, and disseminate project
results. The instrumentation equipment requested will also be used to enhance
biology and microbiology laboratories for both majors and non-majors.
Significance of the Miramar College ILI-IP project centers on the industry-
education commitment to improving the quality of biotechnology education by
utilizing local industry resources and expertise. The enhanced offerings will
increase the number of students majoring in science, transferring to four year
colleges and/or receiving A.S. degrees and professional certificates. In
addition, the instructional materials developed under this project will provide
a useful laboratory improvement model for other high school and community
colleges.
