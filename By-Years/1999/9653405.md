The purpose of the proposed series of four workshops at four different
geographical areas is to provide a financially-accessible opportunity for
faculty, instructional support staff, and instructional computing administrators
at two-year colleges and the lower-division of small four-year colleges to
become familiar with current issues and obtain a working knowledge of some of
the emerging technologies in instructional computing. This purpose will be
achieved through a series of four two-day workshops and follow-up activities
involving four groups of thirty participants each. Each workshop will focus on
three specific topic areas: Emerging Technologies, Resource Management, and
Instructional Methodologies. Within each topic area, emphasis will be placed ol
providing detailed, specific, meaningful, applicable, realistic, achievable
solutions to the issues being addressed. Laboratory facilities will be available
to practice and reinforce the solutions being developed. Through contact with
guest presenters, who are experts in the field, participants will become
informed about the details of working implementations of the technology. Upon
completion of the workshop activities, each participant will be required to
conduct a local follow-up seminar to disseminate materials and knowledge gained
from the workshop. These follow-up activities will provide means for
participants to interact with local colleagues to discuss implementing solutions
at their institutions. The results of the project will be presented by
participants as professional journal articles and conference presentations as
well as posted on the World Wide Web. A prototype of the proposed workshop
series was successfully conducted by the ACM two-year College Education
Committee on February 16-17, 1996 as a three-part workshop at the SIGCSE
Technical Symposium in Philadelphia.
