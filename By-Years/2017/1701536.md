Joshua Dillon is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at the University of
California, Berkeley. Dillon will develop analysis techniques to enhance the
sensitivity of large radio telescope arrays. This will allow astronomers to
detect gas from a time when the first stars formed in the Universe and
influenced the formation of objects such as galaxies and black holes. Alongside
this research, Dillon will develop a course in data science for undergraduate
astronomy research students.

Dillon will create new foreground subtraction and baseline calibration
techniques for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array experiment (HERA), which
aims to detect hydrogen from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). He will also
develop and assess designs for future radio telescope arrays to capitalize on
these techniques. For the educational component of his work, Dillon will develop
a course in data science for undergraduate students participating in HERA's
summer research program.
