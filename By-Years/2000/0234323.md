Modern science is an increasingly distributed enterprise, particularly when
addressing challenging scientific problems with multidisciplinary researchteams,
where team members are routinely assembled from multiple universities,the
national labs, and industry participants. A problem pervasive to suchdistributed
endeavors is the need to efficiently share scientific data across multiple
teams, sites, applications, and machines.

This project's focus is on the ability to represent such data so that it is
easily shared across research teams that each use their own, well-defined and
domain-specific data representations. S(cientific)-XML is a suite of tools that
translate user-friendly XML-based meta-information about shared data to/from the
application-specific, efficient, binary-based data structure descriptions used
by high performance scientific codes. With S-XML, end users can conveniently
express and view their structured data, but all data manipulation and exchanges
are performed using efficient binary data representations. Complementing these
tools is the XML-ECho adaptive XML-conscious peer-to-peer communication
infrastructure, which implements the wide-area exchange of the large-scale
binary data used in scientific collaborations.

This middleware uses runtime adaptation to dynamically adjust its data transport
and manipulation actions to meet application-level quality of service needs.
Specifically, via XML-based descriptions of data structure, end users can
dynamically express and alter interest expression that state what data is most
important to them and should therefore, be transported preferentially.

The resulting Adaptive-XML tools and data exchange middleware will enable
effective collaboration in scientific endeavors that remain infeasible with
today's technologies, a concrete example being the Terascale Supernova
Initiative now being undertaken by a large research team distributed across U.S.
universities and national labs. Project outcomes will also benefit U.S.
corporations, as evident from our discussions with companies like Schlumberger
and also from the deployment of some of our technologies in industry testbed
(e.g., at Delta Air Lines).
