A doctoral student will conduct an eighteen-month study on the feeding ecology
and behavior of the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), a nocturnal primate
endemic to the island of Madagascar. No long term field studies have previously
been conducted on this animal. The aye-aye has a considerable number of unique
morphological characteristics, including a filiform middle finger on the hand,
continuously growing incisor teeth, inguinal mammary glands, the largest brain
size relative to body size of any prosimian primate, and it is the only Malagasy
primate that is sexually dimorphic in body size. Its nocturnal and insectivorous
habits set it apart from other primates of similar body weight. Like humans, the
aye-aye has a significantly larger brain for its body size than closely related
species. Since a large brain size may allow for more complex sensorimotor
processes, permitting the exploitation of stationery or hidden foods not
available to other species, Daubentonia and humans may each differ from closely
related primates in their greater capacity to exploit difficult-to-access
resources. Studies on the aye-aye's relationship to its environment may
contribute to our search for general principles pertinent to the development of
human social behavior. Since the aye-aye is one of the most endangered species
of primates in the world, study of its behavior and ecology are of extreme
importance in developing conservation management plans for this unique species.
