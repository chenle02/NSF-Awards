A primary intracellular target for calcium ions acting as second messengers are
calcium binding proteins. In plants, calmodulin is the only recognized and
biochemically characterized calcium binding protein. Animals, on the other hand,
contain a number of additional calcium-binding proteins (calmodulin-like
proteins), which mediate cell- or tissue- specific calcium-regulated processes.
The working hypothesis for this research, based on cDNA cloning and direct
biochemical assays, is that plants also contain calmodulin-like proteins which
may mediate calcium- regulated processes distinct from those mediated by
calmodulin. To test and further extend this hypothesis the following specific
goals are proposed: (1) to complete the characterization of a cDNA clone,
isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana, which encodes a polypeptide that shares
approximately 60% amino acid sequence identity with other higher plant
calmodulins, by comparing the biochemical properties of the protein encoed by
this clone with authentic calmodulin purified from Arabidopsis seedlings; (2) to
develop an antobody6 probe for the protein encoded by the Arabidopsis cDNA, and
to use this probe to ascertain the tissue- specificity of expression of the
calmodulin-like polypeptide during Arabidopsis development, and to examine the
subcellular distribution of target proteins that potentially interact with the
calmodulin-like polypeptide; and (3) to examine the functional relationship
between calmodulin and the Arabidopsis calmodulin-like protein using NAD kinase
activation as a model target enzyme system. The long range goals of this
research are to identify in plants the members of the family of calcium binding
proteins, and to determine what physiological roles these proteins play in plant
growth and development. Since similar proteins are known to be important in the
regulation of many intracellular functions in animals, the characterization of
these putative regulatory molecules in plants should greatly enhance our
understanding of the regulation of plant cell function by calcium.
