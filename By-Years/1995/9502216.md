9502216 Ammons This proposed work seeks to continue efforts to develop a
qualitative and quantitative fundamental understanding of hadronic matter by
using quantum chromodynamics to solve for the structure and dynamics of hadrons,
Our specific efforts will be an attempt to generate effective Hamiltonians for
the front-form formulation of the scalar field, quantum electrodynamics, and
quantum chromodynamics using the evolving methods of Hamiltonian
renormalization. We will also solve these Hamiltonians using basis function
techniques and other numerical methods. ***
