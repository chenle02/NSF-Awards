Proposal Number: III-9361901 PI: Steven Davis Institution: Physical Sciences,
Inc. Title: Novel Kits for Teaching Science This project will develop and test
in the classroom four kits using inexpensive ($25) diode lasers in the 630 - 670
nm spectral range. The four kits including the lasers which are to developed and
tested are: 1) Laser Threshold and Beam Divergence 2) Measurement of Diode Laser
Wavelength 3) Applications of Laser Induced Fluorescence 4) Biological
Applications of Lasers. A fifth experiment would also be done which would be
Atmospheric Monitoring but only after the above four were completed.
