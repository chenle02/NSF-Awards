IIP 1140438 North Carolina State University; Denis Gray IUCRC Evaluation Project

The IUCRC program is comprised of over 50 centers with over 150 participating
universities. These centers include over 750 industry members, 600 faculty
scientists, 1000 graduate students and almost 250 undergraduate students. The
current proposal requests support for a five-year award to support evaluation
activities of the IUCRC Program.

The proposed IUCRC Evaluation Project addresses both accountability and
improvement evaluation issues and involves both program-level and center-level
elements. The evaluation addresses three major objectives: 1) To help NSF and
local centers objectively evaluate their impact by documenting IUCRC outcomes
and accomplishments; 2) To promote continuous improvement by giving actionable,
timely, data-based (formally collected and observational) feedback, analysis and
advice to NSF and local centers; 3) To identify and communicate information
about IUCRC best practices to NSF and local centers. Research and evaluation
conducted through the IUCRC Evaluation Project in the past has made a
significant contribution to a broadened understanding of cooperative research in
general and industry/university centers in particular. The proposed work sets
comparably ambitious goals and promises to make a contribution to the
understanding of a variety of critical issues including the economic impact of
IUCRCs, impact of IUCRCs on small firms, and human capital impacts of IUCRCs.

The most unique characteristic of the IUCRC Evaluation Project is the emphasis
placed on improvement evaluation for local center directors with timely
evaluation data collected from key stakeholder groups. The project will be a
training vehicle for the next generation of S&T evaluators by promoting high
quality research opportunities for the graduate students supported by the
project. Finally, the proposed work will continue to be very proactive in
disseminating the findings to the broader scientific community by publishing the
work in widely read and high quality journals. Further, all evaluation
instruments, program reports, and student and faculty papers related to the
program evaluation effort will be publicly available on the Program Evaluation
Website housed on North Carolina State University servers (www.ncsu.edu/iucrc).
