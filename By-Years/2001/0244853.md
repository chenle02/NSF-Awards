The primary objective of the research proposal is to understand the structure of
the electroweak interactions using data obtained at particle accelerators. In
particular the PI intends to reduce theoretical uncertainties pertaining to
extracting the CKM matrix elements from data and also understand better how to
extract new physics from data on inclusive B decays. The PI also intends to
study parton-hadron duality in a simple 1+1 model of QCD. Other efforts will be
to understand non-perturbative QCD effects in exclusive nonleptonic decays of B
mesons and to identify direct signals of new physics in low energy electroweak
transitions.
