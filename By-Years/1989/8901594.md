It is proposed to hold the 5th International Symposium on Polarization and
Correlation in Electronic and Atomic Collisions at the Stevens Institute of
Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey August 2-3, 1989. The Symposium is an official
satellite of the 16th ICPEAC, being held in New York City July 26 - August 1.
The topics of the symposium will fall into two categories: (1) electron spin
polarization effects and (2) coherence and correlation effects in electron-
atom/molecule collisions. There will also be talks on the interaction of
polarized electrons with surfaces and on coherence and correlations in heavy
particle collisions.
