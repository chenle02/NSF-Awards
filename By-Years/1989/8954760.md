This project will continue the publishing and distributing a quarterly
newsletter aimed and elementary school teachers of mathematics: >The Elementary
Mathematician>. The newsletter, already received by over 18,000 educators,
contains application, hands.on materials for the usage of calculators and
appropriate technologies, classroom.ready pull.out section of useful and fun
materials, and articles assisting the elementary school teacher to relate
important skills in estimation and number sense. The newsletter will feature
ideas and articles by will.known educators as well as serve as a forum for
materials developed through National Science Foundation elementary materials
projects. The second year of the project will be devoted to developing
self.sustaining resources for the publication, enabling COMAP to continue
publication after NSF funding has ceased. Estimates place circulation at 40,000
