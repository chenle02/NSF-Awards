9313993 Knoblock An important and difficult problem in Knowledge Management is
how to efficiently retrieve information from distributed, heterogeneous
multidatabase systems. This project addresses this problem by bringing to bear a
richer set of knowledge about databases to optimize multidatabases queries. The
idea is to use semantic knowledge of the contents of databases to reformulate
queries into equivalent yet less expensive ones. Using this knowledge, the
potential cost reduction is significantly more than can be derived from
convention query optimization alone. Since the semantic knowledge required can
be learned from any database, this approach is applicable to other Knowledge-
intensive systems. ***
