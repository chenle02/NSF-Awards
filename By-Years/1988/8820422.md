This is an equipment grant to provide support for acquisition of structural
testing equipment to upgrade the dynamic experimental research capability at the
University of Maine. The major testing equipment to be acquired is a 165-k
actuator with a 6-inch stroke. This will enable a variety of steel-plate sheer
wall specimens to be tested under cyclic loads simulating seismic conditions.
The support will enhance a research project under way at the University and also
greatly improve the experimental capability to conduct future laboratory
research.
