9708003 Cargill This study of electromigration using X-ray microdiffraction and
electron microscopy builds on the experience and confidence gained during work
supported by a one-year SGER NSF award. This work has shown that thermal and
electromigration induced strains can be successfully measured with 10 micron
spatial resolution and with strain sensitivities on the order of 0.0002 by X-ray
microdiffraction. The past work has confirmed that linear strain gradients
develop during electromigration in conductor lines with no reservoirs and that
abrupt strain relaxation occurs during the later stages of electromigration
under the conditions used in the studies. The new project extends the work on a
limited number of 10 micron-wide, 200 micron-long pure Al conductor lines to
narrower line widths with bamboo and near-bamboo microstructures, to shorter
lines which should be able to sustain larger strain gradients, to A1(Cu) lines
where electromigration of Cu and of A1 can be separately followed by X-ray
microfluorescence, and finally to Cu and Cu(Sn) lines, which should be more
resistant to electromigration than A1(Cu). The work utilizes higher spatial
resolution X- ray instrumentation to extend composition, microstructure and
strain mapping to the submicron scale and to permit measurements on single
grains within polycrystalline conductor lines. The study includes transmission
electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and SEM- based grain
orientation mapping observations as complements to the X-ray microbeam
microstructure, composition, and strain mapping. Finite element modeling is
employed with realistic microstructures and misorientation dependent grain-
boundary diffusivities. The study will be extended to short range,
microstructure related strain gradients, and to effects of pulsed and reversal
current on electromigration strains. %%% The expected significance of the
research is that it provides a better experimental base for underst anding
electromigration. Successful direct measurements of strain distributions during
electromigration will provide tests and focus for further theoretical work in
this area. ***
