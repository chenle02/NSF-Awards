This EAGER award will explore the Distributed Acoustic Sensing emerging
technology that transforms a single optical fiber into a massively multichannel
seismic array. This technology may provide a scalable and affordable way to
deploy dense seismic networks. Experimental Distributed Acoustic Sensing
equipment will be tested in the Antarctic exploiting unused (dark) strands in
the existing fiber-optic cable that connects the U.S. Amundsen-Scott South Pole
Station to the Remote Earth Science and Seismological Observatory (SPRESSO)
located about 7.5-km from the main station. Upon processing the seismic signals,
the Distributed Acoustic Sensing may provide a new tool to structurally image
firn, glacial ice, and glacial bedrock. Learning how Distributed Acoustic
Sensing would work on the ice sheet, scientists can then check seismological
signals propagating through the Earth's crust and mantle variously using natural
icequakes and earthquakes events in the surrounding
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose to convert at least 8 km of
pre-existing fiber optic cable at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station into
more than 8000 sensors to explore the potential of Distributed acoustic sensing
(DAS) as a breakthrough data engine for polar seismology. The DAS array will
operate for about one year, allowing them to (1) evaluate and calibrate the
performance of the DAS technology in the extreme cold, very low noise (including
during the exceptionally quiet austral winter) polar plateau environment; (2)
record and analyze local ambient and transient signals from ice, anthropogenic
signals, ocean microseism, atmospheric and other processes, as well as to study
local, regional, and teleseismic tectonic events; (3) structurally image the
firn, glacial ice, glacial bed, crust, and mantle, variously using active
sources, ambient seismic noise, and natural icequake and earthquake
events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
