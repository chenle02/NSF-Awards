This award provides partial funding for the 2003 "Mechanisms of Eucaryotic
Transcription" conference to be held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory August
27-31, 2003. This meeting will be the eighth biennial conference in this series.
About 450 international participants will attend. Transcription regulation is
probably the most important aspect of gene regulation and has been consistently
an area of very active research. Recent advances include the elucidation of the
role of chromatin and histone modifying complexes in transcriptional regulation.
This conference covers a wide array of research areas and is one of the few high
profile meetings devoted entirely to transcription. The organizers have taken
care to ensure the participation of students, young investigators, and
underrepresented minorities.
