The goal of this pilot study is to develop a new methodology that can be used to
dissect the mechanism by which mechanical signals are transduced into
alterations of cell form and function. An electromagnet will be constructed
using a direct- current supply to provide an adjustable source of magnetic
tension. In order to begin to analyze the molecular specificity of force
transduction at the cell surface, potential transduction molecules (fibronectin)
will be conjugated to magnetic microparticles, allowed to interact with cell
surfaces, and then tested for their ability to modulate cell metabolism (DNA
synthesis) in the presence of applied magnetic fields. Future studies will use
this magnet system to characterize dynamic effects of external forces on
cytoskeletal organization and polymerization and to identify proteins that
mediate mechanochemical transduction across the cell surface. This approach is
unique and provides a new method for examining the influence of surface tension
on cell form and function.
