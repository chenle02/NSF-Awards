The aim of the Mt. San Antonio College Math Lab Project is to revitalize
Intermediate Algebra instruction by restructuring the Intermediate Algebra
curriculum, modernizing course content, introducing weekly computer-based
laboratory sessions into the course, and providing students with regular
classroom computer mathematics demonstrations. The approach will eventually be
expanded to include most mathematics courses. Students involved are being
tracked, and an in depth study is being conducted to evaluate the effectiveness
of the approach. A project implementation manual is being developed and
distributed to all California Community Colleges.This project is significant
because it addresses one of the most pressing issues facing community colleges
today: the high attrition rates and poor achievement levels in lower division
college mathematics.
