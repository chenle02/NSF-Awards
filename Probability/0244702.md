This proposal is for the travel funds for American attendees of the conference
``Kolmogorov and Contemporary Mathematics'', an International scholarly meeting
to commemorate the Centennial birthday of A. N. Kolmogorov -- arguably one of
the best mathematicians of the 20th century. The conference will take place on
June 16-21, 2003 in Moscow, Russia and is expected to draw 600-800 participants
from around the world. Organized by the Russian Academy of Science and Moscow
State University, the Kolmogorov's Centennial Conference will be one of the
largest and most important gatherings of mathematicians in 2003.

The conference will cover many areas of mathematics and Plenary Talks will be
given by prominent mathematicians in these areas. It is therefore, expected that
the conference will have a great impact on many areas of current active research
in mathematics and its applications in various areas of science.
