Recent public policy discussions have raised concerns over the insurability of
quake damages and the extremely low level of earthquake insurance purchase by
small business. At the same time, very theoretical issues have been raised about
the use of deterministic loss estimates, especially worst-case ones, in
insurance evaluation procedures, especially for earthquake. These theoretical
issues suggest that deterministic decisions, decision made in ignorance of
probabilities, may encourage adverse selection and discourage risk
diversification, such as coverage of numerous small properties with geographical
spread. To examine these issues, and also to clarify superior risk tools now
available for earthquake, quantitative models for both insurers and small
businesses will be developed and examined using these models to determine
whether or not and under what types of program constructs earthquake insurance
would be feasible for post-disaster recovery of small businesses. This
quantitative approach should further assist in clarifying the concept of
insurability.
