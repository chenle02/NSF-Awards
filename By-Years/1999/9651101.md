This project supports the use of a versatile, laser-based spectroscopy system
in the undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory. The use of lasers in
graduate, postdoctoral, and professional research makes it imperative that
students be proficient in this area. The department has recently obtained a
small Helium-Neon (HeNe) laser in order to carry out introductory laser
experiments in the undergraduate laboratory. However, to ensure that this is not
the only level of instruction that any of the students receive with lasers, this
project outfits the undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory with the
necessary equipment to teach more advanced laser-based experimentation. The
acquisition of the Nitrogen-laser-pumped dye laser (N2-dye) system allows for
the introduction of an integrated laser-based curriculum into this undergraduate
laboratory course and of related techniques for the Instrumental Analysis and
Biochemistry laboratories. The laser-based experiments complement and enhance
experiments already performed in these courses. The laser system is being used
for Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy and has the potential to be used for
time-resolved experiments in the future. An original experiment utilizing
surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is currently being developed and
introduced into the laboratory curriculum. The impact of the new experiments can
be evaluated by comparing student course questionnaires with those of past
semesters when no laser-based experiments were used and when many students
explicitly requested more up-to-date equipment. Original experiments for the
undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory can be submitted to the Journal of
Chemical Education and discussed at meetings of the American Chemical
Society(ACS). The SERS experiment currently under development may be presented
at the ACS Biennial Conference of Chemical Education in Clemson, South Carolina,
in August 1996. A lab manual is being compiled with the new experiments and may
be made available over the Internet as well as in printed form.
