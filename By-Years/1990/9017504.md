This is a three-year experimental, theoretical and field study of convective
instability and its role in solute mixing during mass transport. Instabilities
can develop at different scales under a variety of geologic and hydrogeologic
situations when more dense groundwater overlies less dense groundwater. The
process mixes the two waters to reduce the density stratification. The specific
objectives of the study are to describe the dynamics of instability development
both conceptually and mathematically and to evaluate the potential for
instability development to influence the chemical evolution of groundwater in
large flow systems. The study includes both experiments and the evaluation of an
actual groundwater system, the Milk River artesian aquifer, in which unstable
mixing has a significant potential for influencing the chemical evolution of the
water. The laboratory work will involve a series of precisely controlled and
monitored flow tank studies designed to describe the dynamics of the mixing
process. The field study will involve a detailed characterization of the geology
and hydrogeology of the Milk River aquifer, followed by an evaluation with a
variable density model. This study will contribute basic knowledge about a
relatively unknown and poorly understood process. Previous studies show that
mixing due to instability development can be more important than commonly
realized. The work is of practical and academic importance to problems of
solvent-enhanced oil recovery, chemical mixing in sedimentary basins and
contaminant migration.
