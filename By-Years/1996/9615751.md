9615751 Romanowicz This grant provides $65,000 as one-half support of the costs
of acquiring new and upgraded computer equipment for the Geophysics computer
laboratory at UC Berkeley, a facility shared by the Berkeley Seismographic
Station (BSS). Specifically, the equipment and upgrades will include a dual CPU
SUN Enterprise 3000 server, eight Sun Ultra 1 140 upgrades to eight existing SUN
SLC's, one new SUN Ultra 1 140 workstation and one SUN Ultra 1 200E workstation.
The addition of a new faculty member, Dr. Doug Drever, and the computationally
intensive needs of other seismologists and geophysicists at Berkeley will
benefit from the new capabilities afforded by this equipment which will include
using software to create a parallel virtual machine (PVM) from multiple upgraded
workstations. Specific projects that will utilize this equipment include
modeling of regional crustal and upper mantle structure in the western U. S.
through inversion of broadband waveform data collected from multiple digital
seismographic networks including both permanent BSS and IRIS GSN stations and
data from portable IRIS-PASSCAL instruments, studies of the nucleation and
growth of earthquake ruptures and statistical analyses of the relationships
between large aftershocks and mainshock fault slip, global mantle tomography
based on models of the anelastic attenuation of seismic waves, numerical
modeling of geodynamic processes and ab intio calculations of the properties of
mantle minerals. ***
