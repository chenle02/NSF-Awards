An electronic database will be developed for a variety of weather conditions for
use as laboratory exercises in atmospheric science courses at all levels.
Exercises will emphasize problem-solving skills, and students will engage modern
analytical techniques that are appropriately applied to each case history. A
namual will accompany the datasets to provide instructions for accessing the
data, with suggested exercises that can be used to demonstrate applications of
the datasets. Materials will be developed for different levels of instruction
from introductory classes for non- majors to upper division courses in synoptic
meteorology, weather forecasting and dynamics. These exercises will allow
students to explore atmospheric structures and processes with ease and detail
not previously possible and will enhance their understanding of the three
dimensional evolution of complex weather systems. These materials will be made
available through production of CD-ROMs and/or 8 mm exabyte tapes.
