This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
a homologous recombination or gene targeting system for plants. Gene targeting
offers great promise for harnessing the biosynthetic capacity of plants to
produce compounds of commercial value. A major limitation in implementing this
technology is the low frequency of homologous recombination. This project plans
to overcome this limitation through the use of a proprietary method to introduce
chromosome breaks at specific target loci. Chromosome breaks greatly enhance
localized homologous recombination, and experiments are designed to modify a
plant gene to confer herbicide resistance. Success of these experiments will
provide the foundation for developing an efficient system of gene targeting for
use in a variety of important crop species. This technology will be a powerful
tool for studying gene function, modifying genomes, and engineering biosynthetic
pathways.

The commercial application of this project will be in the development of new
crop varieties, that better withstand pests, have enhanced food value, and
produce compounds of industrial importance.
