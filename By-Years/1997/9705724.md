This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research on electron transfer reactions by Dr. Thomas J. Meyer of the
Chemistry Department, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Metal-to-
ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states of polypyridyl complexes in
molecular assemblies will be studied in order to better understand the general
phenomenon of photoinduced electron and energy transfer. Chromophore-quencher
and ligand-bridged assemblies will be synthesized. These new assemblies will be
designed for the investigation of the following: (a) novel photophysical
phenomena particularly in the Marcus inverted region, including intramolecular
competition, time delays, and multi-photon effects; (b) the role of new
structural motifs, based on cis/trans isomerism at unsymmetrically substituted
bipyridine ligands; (c) long-lived storage of photochemical redox equivalents
through the use of bridging electron transfer ligands; and (d) photchemical
energy conversion. Spectroscopic parameters will be used to calculate electron
transfer rate constants. Investigation of the electronic properties of large
molecules and associations of molecules, or assemblies, is ultimately aimed at
development of molecular-level electronic devices. This research is relevant to
photochemical energy conversion and information storage based on color changes.
To develop this technology, movement of electrons over long distances and over
long time scales must be better understood.
