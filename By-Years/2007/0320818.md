ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No. CTS-0320818&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: T. Ho, Lamar University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lamar University is a
non-Ph.D. granting institution with a strong commitment
to&lt;br/&gt;environmental research and education. Currently, research
activities in several focused areas are being pursued, including
characterization of outdoor/indoor particulate matter, development of microwave-
enhanced technology for trace air pollutants destruction, chemical
characterization of industrial sludge, super-porous titania-based photoreactor
for environmental applications, and waste reduction in nanofiltration
facilities. All of the activities require a high-sensitivity GC/MS (gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry) to separate and identify the trace amount of
volatile organic compounds (VOC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested GC/MS (gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry) system is an Agilent (formerly Hewlett-
Packard) Model 6890N GC interfaced with Agilent Model 5973 MS and coupled with a
SIS (Scientific Instrument Services) Model 786000 Auto-Desorb System. The
addition of this Auto-Desorb GC/MS system will significantly enhance our
capabilities in conducting trace VOC-related research at Lamar University.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will enable installing a high-sensitivity GC/MS
system at Lamar University to enhance capabilities in research and education in
four different departments. It will also enhance services to the area K-12
students and efforts in recruiting potential students to science and engineering
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
