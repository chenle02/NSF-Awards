"Project Splash" is a 24-month project targeting middle school students (grades
7-9) from predominately immigrant and refugee backgrounds. Although numerous
partnerships are highlighted throughout the proposal, the main partnerships
include the University of Massachusetts Lowell, the Lowell Heritage State Park,
the Lowell Housing Authority, the New England Board of Higher Education AQUA
Educators' Network, GEARUP, Salem State College, Lowell High School, the New
England Aquarium, and Lowell's Youth Leaders, the River Ambassadors. Two cohorts
of 25 youth (a total of 50 students) will participate in after school and summer
academic activities. Activities will link culture and science through hands-on
environmental experiences with science leaders and cultural representatives.
Students will participate in "Project Splash" two hours a day twice a week
during the academic year and summer. Transportation will be provided to all
program activities.
