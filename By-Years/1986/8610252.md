For superconducting magnet systems, He II is a desirable coolant because of its
extremely large heat conductivity and large specific heat. A number of large
magnet systems are using or considering the use of He II cooling. In all these
systems, He II brings the advantage of higher magnetic fields and higher overall
heat capacity. The other large-scale application of He II is in space cryogenic
systems. Space cryogenic systems utilize He II for its isothermal low
temperature environment, allowing efficient component cooling with a minimum of
thermal gradients. This work will provide He II heat transfer coefficients.
