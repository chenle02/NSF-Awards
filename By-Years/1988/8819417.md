The main purpose of this projected study is to investigate the structure and
regulation of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, the enzyme involved in the
catabolism of the neurotransmitter GABA. The structural studies entail the
elucidation of the primary sequence of the enzyme by either direct amino acid
sequence or by analysis of the C-DNA encoding this aminotransferase. Valuable
information on certain regions of the polypeptide chain modified by specific
chemical reagents have been obtained by direct amino groups of the enzyme has
been determined together with the identification of the SH pair undergoing
oxidation/reduction. Tryptic peptides isolated and purified by HPLC
chromatography will be used in further sequential studies. It is expected that
the complete amino acid sequence of the enzyme will be elucidated in less than
two years. Screening of a library of C-DNA clones inserted into the phage lambda
G 11 has begun. Two methods, i.e., hybridization with oligodeoxyribonucleotide
probes and recognition by antibody probes are being used in the screening steps.
The results derived from the sequential studies are important for further
analysis of specific regions of the aminotransferase by site- directed
mutagenesis.
