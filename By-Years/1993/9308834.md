This small grant for exploratory research project is using tail fiber parts from
the bacterial virus T4 to examine the mechanical and other properties of these
proteinaceous building materials, many of which seem to exhibit unusual strength
and stiffness. Dimer fragments are being produced in quantities appropriate for
structural analysis. The structural information from these materials will be
used to facilitate molecular modelling and theoretical estimations of properties
such as stiffness, elasticity and tensile strength, as well as in designing
novel structural parts. Longer polymers will be made by using genetic techniques
to alter the ends of the basic building blocks. Average length of the polymers
can be determined by adding "stop" subunits in different limiting
concentrations. %%% This research has the potential to produce novel materials
from biological products.
