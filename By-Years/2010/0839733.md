This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to test the
feasibility of the chemical synthesis for the production of copper
nanoparticles, which are stable on the air, for the electronic industry. UT Dots
will develop a synthetic procedure for the production of copper nanoparticles
that will be formulated as ink for printable electronic industry.

Air stable copper nanoparticles may be used in a wide variety of applications.
