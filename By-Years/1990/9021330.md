This research, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, will study electron capture by molecules. Electron capture finds
application in identification and quantification of certain classes of
molecules, most prominently halogen containing molecules which are of biological
and environmental importance. Prof. Grimsrud's research uses mass spectrometry
to observe the process of electron capture and to quantify trace contaminants in
samples. The unique aspect of Grimsrud's work is his use of photodetachment
modulation. This improves specificity and sensitivity in analytical
measurements. One can also differentiate electron capture capabilities of ground
states and excited states, which is important in understanding how
photochemistry modifies the chemistry of halogenated compounds in the
environment. The study of secondary processes (processes preceeding or
succeeding the electron capture event) also is indicative of details of
atmospheric pressure gas-phase chemistry of the studied compounds, and is useful
in understanding unexpected sensitivity in analytical measurements.
