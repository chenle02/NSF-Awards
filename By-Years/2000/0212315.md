This project will examine the importance of leaf detritus with differing decay
characteristics on ecosystem properties in headwater streams that receive most
of their energy from the surrounding forest as autumn-shed leaves. By
manipulating the quality and complexity (i.e., number of leaf types) of detrital
resources, the investigators will test the hypothesis that quality and
complexity of detritus in a detritus-based ecosystem regulates ecosystem
structure and function. This will be accomplished by controlling detritus
persistence and availability to stream-dwelling consumer organisms. Increasing
the complexity of leaf detritus should reduce temporal variation in key
ecosystem characteristics and processes such as standing crop of organic matter,
organic matter export, fungal reproduction, nutrient retention, ecosystem
metabolism, and invertebrate abundance, biomass and production. Anthropogenic
reductions in global biodiversity require an improved understanding of the
impacts of biodiversity on ecosystem processes, such as the consequences of
different riparian replanting schemes for stream ecosystems.
