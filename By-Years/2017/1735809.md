This project from North Carolina State University establishes an I-Corps Site at
NC State's innovation and commercialization headquarters - the Springboard
Innovation Hub. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are
NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and
support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the
marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking
opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their
work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps
Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the
National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and
investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NC State's I-Corps Site is a University-wide
initiative that supports technology commercialization and startup activities
across campus by collaborating with all of the University's entrepreneurial
groups and initiatives. This Site will allow NC State to support the
commercialization of the technologies emerging from its research expenditures by
immersing faculty, postdocs and students in the I-Corp curriculum and
methodology and to catalog best practices for engaging faculty and students in
technology commercialization and entrepreneurship. The support provided through
the I-Corps Site allows increased numbers of NC State faculty, postdocs and
students to engage in customer discovery and lean startup methodology, seeding
multiple future potential technology commercialization and startup opportunities
in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Research Triangle entrepreneurial
ecosystem is active and tech-centric. The startup companies emerging from NC
State's I-Corps Site will serve to both bolster this ecosystem and benefit from
the increased entrepreneurial talent pool and funding available within the
region. The Site's activity will also be leveraged to accelerate a culture shift
at this University.
