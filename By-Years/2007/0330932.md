This award will provide partial support for one of six co-conferences to be held
under the auspices of the Internation Society of Optical Engineering (SPIE) at
the La Fonda Hotel, Santa Fe, NM, June 1-4, 2003, and gathered together as a
"Symposium on Fluctuations and Noise". The specific conference is entitled
"Noise as a Tool to Study Materials (NTSM)". The Chair of the NTSM is Michael
Weissman, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champagn. The objective of the NSTM
conference, essentially the first of its kind, is to bring together workers from
across the field of materials science, as well as condensed matter and materials
physics, who share interest in understanding noise as a fundamental phenomenon,
as a materials parameter, and as a limiting factor in micro and nanoscale device
performance. Materials of interest include glassy systems and disordered
materials, such as the colossal magneto resistance materials. For these, noise
measurements can distinguish among different domain sizes, in contrast to common
electrical measurements that must average over many dissimilar regions. Another
emerging theme is the use of noise techniques to characterize conductance
mechanisms in unconventional regimes, such as extremes of low temperature and
high magnetic fields. This award will partially support the attendance of
approximately 12 attendees, with emphasis on graduate students, post-docs, and
younger scientists. The conference planners hope that this will be the first in
an ongoing series, which will bring together researchers focused on fundamental
origins of noise as well as scientists and engineers interested in applications
and materials characterization.
