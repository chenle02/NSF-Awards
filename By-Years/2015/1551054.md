Recycling of Earth's crust back down into the deep Earth has been invoked to
explain a wide variety of Earth processes, including changes in the forces that
move tectonic plates, and how the thickness and composition of Earth's crust
evolved. All of these processes take place at depths inaccessible to humans. A
volcanic eruption in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan has brought to light
pieces of rock from 90 km deep in Earth that can be used to test recycling-
related hypotheses. This project will provide training and research
opportunities for graduate student Madeline Shaffer and several undergraduate
students. Visits to local elementary schools will expose potential future
scientists to Earth science. Continued development of the laser-ablation split-
stream technique will benefit the broad range of visitors to their
laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative US-Tajik-Romanian project
has a two-pronged approach: 1) Laboratory geochronology and petrology that will
constrain the timescale of recycling, and the compositions, densities and
wavespeeds of the recycling materials. With some assumptions about protolith
composition, the evolution in these physical properties can be calculated. 2)
Geodynamic modeling of recycling crustal sections with different compositions
and layers in different thermal gradients. The models will yield the calculated
evolution of the physical properties of recycling crust and determine the types
of crustal sections that may recycle. Because the Pamir-Tibetan Plateau is an
archetypal continent-continent collision, ideas developed there can be applied
globally.
