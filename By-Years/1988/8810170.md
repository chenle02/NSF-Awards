The objective of this Research Initiation project is to determine the most
effective method of performing simulation studies on a multiprocessing system.
Molecular Dynamics will be the specific class of problem chosen where simulation
codes will be developed for both a INMOS Transputer, a message-passing parallel
processing system, and a BBN+, a shared-memory parallel machine. The relative
merits of the shared-memory and message-passing paradigms for this class of
problems will be determined. An existing sequential Molecular Dynamics code will
first be adapted to a parallel environment on each of the two machines;
performance evaluation methods will identify the bottlenecks in system
performance. The codes will be iterated, resulting in successively more
efficient implementations.
