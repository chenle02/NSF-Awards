Models and Algorithms for Genome Evolution (MAGE) is an international meeting
addressing the interdisciplinary area of genome evolution. MAGE is also
celebrating the 50-year career of David Sankoff, a pioneer in computational
genomics and biology. The community of computational evolutionary biologists is
composed of mathematicians, computer scientists, statisticians, physicists and
biologists, all willing to contribute to a better knowledge of the history of
life on earth. The plurality of backgrounds yields a plurality of approaches,
theoretical and empirical. The organizers represent a diverse international set
of researchers at different stages of their careers. While the core of senior
and early-career researchers have been invited and accepted, these funds will
enable up to 20 students and postdocs to participate in the conference. In
addition to the presentations and daily poster sessions, the meeting will also
provide input to a book to be published by Springer in its series Computational
Biology.
