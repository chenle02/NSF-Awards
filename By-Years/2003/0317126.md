Aerobic organisms have evolved to use the oxidizing potential of oxygen to their
benefit. Although a powerful oxidizing agent, the direct reaction of dioxygen
with other molecules is slow and nature has developed ways to lower this kinetic
barrier. This process of oxygen activation has tremendous importance and the
understanding of the principles by which this activation is accomplished is
crucial. A new tool for the study of oxygen activation was recently introduced
and involves the analysis of the effects of pH, viscosity, temperature, and
isotopic composition on the second order rate constant for the reaction of
dioxygen with an enzyme. Such studies have already provided valuable information
on the nature of the rate-determining steps in oxygen activation in a number of
enzyme systems. This project describes efforts towards the elucidation of the
role of the metal center in the mechanism of oxygen and substrate activation in
a group of dioxygenases belonging to the cupin superfamily. Two types of enzyme
systems have been chosen for initial studies: copper-and iron-containing
flavonol 2,3-dioxygenases from Aspergillus flavus and Bacillus subtilis, and
nickel- and iron-containing acireductone dioxygenases from Klebsiella
pneumoniae. These enzymes were chosen for their unique mechanisms and the
potential to provide important insights into the mechanism of oxygen and
substrate activation. Understanding of the structural basis for the catalytic
diversity observed in the cupin superfamily of proteins may provide the
foundation for deciphering the function of new protein
members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project incorporates tools
and techniques of biochemistry, bioinformatics,molecular biology,physical and
synthetic organic chemistry, in the study of the mechanism of metalloenzymes.
This multidisciplinary research provides an excellent opportunity for the
education of graduate and advanced undergraduate students in a multicultural
research environment that will foster mentoring of minority students.
