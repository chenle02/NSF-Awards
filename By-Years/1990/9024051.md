Dr. Henderson is a pioneering investigator in the area of developmental cell
cohesion in Dictyostelium. The problem being addressed is that of the function
and chemical structure of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins
which she has shown to be involved in cohesion. This award is a National Science
Foundation Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers. The proposal
fulfills the FAW objectives, which are: 1, to recognize outstanding and
promising women scientists and engineers in academic careers of research and
teaching and 2, to facilitate the further development of their careers.
