Soils harbor an incredible diversity of microbes-- for example, one square meter
of Alaskan forest can be inhabited by hundreds of species of fungi, most of
which have not yet been named. What controls the diversity of fungi in the soil?
Do different species perform different functions? Scientists are interested in
unearthing these questions because fungi decompose dead tissues from plants and
animals. In doing so, they release CO2 (a greenhouse gas) to the atmosphere. If
different species target different components of dead material, a more diverse
community of fungi may release more CO2 to the atmosphere. Treseder, Borneman,
and Mack will examine the hypotheses that variation in functions of fungal
groups and variation in the chemistry of the litter they decompose are both
important controls over the diversity of fungi, and that changes in fungal
diversity may influence CO2 production. They will use a recently developed DNA
technique (nucleotide analogs) to identify the functions of individual groups of
fungi found on different types of decomposing leaves in Alaskan forests. They
will also establish miniature laboratory ecosystems with varying numbers of
fungal groups, and then measure decomposition rates within those
ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;The scientific importance of this work will be a better
understanding of the processes that occur belowground in ecosystems, and an
increased capacity to predict how ecosystems will respond to changes in the
environment. The information gained should be useful in determining policy
recommendations in the face of global change.
