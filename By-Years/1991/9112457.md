The project goal is to procure a real time data acquisition and active control
system to support several research projects, including (1) vibration control of
flexible structures using imbedded fiber optic sensors, (2) deployment dynamics
of a flexible spacecraft, (3) multi axis rotational control of flexible
spacecraft, and (4) the effects of damping on the performance of controlled
structures. The equipment will also enhance the education of undergraduate and
graduate students in aerospace engineering.
