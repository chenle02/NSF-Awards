9703615 Wexler This project supports the construction of a field-deployable
Rapid Single-Particle Mass Spectrometer (RSMS). This instrument will be capable
of providing chemical as well as size information on individual particles in the
size range of 40 to 200 nm. This will be achieved by size selecting particles
with a specially designed nozzle inlet, evaporating the particles using excimer
laser radiation and analyzing the fragments using mass spectrometry. Chemical
constituents such as organic carbon, elemental carbon, sulfates, methane
sulfonates, and sodium chloride will be distinguishable. The information will be
semi-quantitative due to shot-to-shot variations in signal intensity obtained
with particles of identical composition, and due to a bias of the technique to
surface species. However, chemometric data analysis techniques are capable of
classifying the obtained spectra and extracting information on the aerosol
composition and mixing state (external vs. internal). Once the assembly of the
field-deployable instrument is completed, it will be tested at a local site to
demonstrate the technique at ambient air conditions. The sizing technique will
be calibrated and validated.
