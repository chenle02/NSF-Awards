9526784 Krogstad The goal of this project is to understand how basaltic
infusions into silicic magma chambers affect physical and chemical processes in
those chambers and influence the subsequent evolution of the mafic and silicic
magmas. The research will focus on two Silurian composite plutons (the Cadillac
Mountain and Gouldsboro intrusions) in the coastal Maine magmatic province. This
research will combine detailed field studies, petrography, and major-trace-
element geochemistry of whole-rock samples with studies of the isotopic
systematics of Sr and Nd both in whole rock and in feldspar crystals from a wide
range of rocks. This research should contribute to our understanding of
compositional stratification in composite magma chambers and the origin of
magmatic enclaves, and will provide new insights into the possible origins of
A-type granites and trondhjemites.
