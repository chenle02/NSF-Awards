Currently, the development of revolutionary new network approaches is ham-pered
by the lack of methods to evaluate the performance of radically different
designs of network architectures, protocols, and applications. The goal of this
project is to explore new theoretical concepts and algorithms for predicting the
delay and throughput performance of future networks. The project develops a
stochastic network calculus that leads to simple models and fast computational
methods for networks that are very different from the networks and protocols
used today. The research team will determine the capabilities and limitations of
this approach and the project will address applications to scheduling in high-
speed networks, to the verification of service level agreements, and in the
analy-sis of feedback-based buffer management and congestion control algorithms.
Efficient computational algorithms derived from the theory permit other re-
searchers to use the methods of the calculus without requiring familiarity of
the underlying theory. This project presents urgently needed methods for the
analysis of the communication infrastructure of the 21st century and it stimu-
lates research in analytical methods in science and
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
