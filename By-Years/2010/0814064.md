This Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research to Indiana
University support a workshop entitled ?Building a Network for Neutron
Scattering Education? and held on March 27-28, 2008 Chantilly, Virginia. The
workshop brings together neutron scattering experts and other academicians with
experience in developing non traditional educational programs; the objective is
to define and design a roadmap for a comprehensive neutron scattering education
program in the US. This will lead to maximizing the national intellectual
capital in neutron sciences, and increase the sophistication of research
questions addressed by neutron scattering at the Nation?s premier neutron
facilities. Participants bring together the scattered and independent elements
of an education program and form them into a comprehensive initiative based on
modern tools. The broader, long term, impact will be the development of a
research community capable of taking full advantage of the unique tools at the
Nation?s premier national facilities. The PIs are committed to involve members
of underrepresented minorities from Historically Black Colleges and Universities
and other Minority Education Institutions.
