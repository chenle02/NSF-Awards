During the Phase I of the current research program Hydronetics achieved
breakthrough results by demonstrating feasibility of sheet based Laminated
Object Manufacturing (LOM) process and systems. This laser based system
manufactures three-dimensional objects of unlimited complexity by successive
deposition, bonding and forming of layers of material. The objectives of the
Phase II research are to define the configuration and the design of a fully
automated LOM system, and to build it. Other aspects of the research are to
create the software interfaces to handle the cross-sections generated on the
computer and run the mechanical components of the system. Finding and evaluating
new sheet/glue combinations usuable in the sheet LOM process will also be part
of the Phase II project.
