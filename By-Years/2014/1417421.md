This award funds the research activities of Professor Xingang Chen at the
University of Texas at Dallas. In recent years, experiments and theoretical
studies have established a six-parameter Standard Model for the Big Bang
cosmology, and provided strong support for the existence of an inflationary
epoch as the origin of Big Bang. The details of this epoch are now being
explored. In addition, various tantalizing anomalies have been observed that can
potentially provide us the knowledge beyond the Standard Model. This project
will systematically study different beyond-Standard-Model signals in terms of
both the theoretical model-building and the interpretation of data. The primary
data comes from detailed studies of the cosmic microwave background(CMB) and of
the large scale structure (LSS) of the universe. This research motivates new
connections between theory and data, and facilitates discoveries of new physics.
In addition, this will provide training for undergraduates and graduate
students, and there will be an outreach program to high school
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate and classify a variety of
possible new phenomena in the inflationary density perturbations, such as
primordial anisotropies, features and non-Gaussianities. He will systematically
classify different types of anisotropic pre-inflationary relic and study their
effects on density perturbations, will study different inflation models with
oscillating spectator massive fields and predict their effects on the CMB and
LSS, and will extend work on primordial non-Gaussiantiies and study the effects
on the CMB and LSS. He will emphasize important connections between the beyond-
Standard-Model signals and fundamental physics. Methods of model building,
first-principle derivation and data analyses are combined to effectively carry
out this program.
