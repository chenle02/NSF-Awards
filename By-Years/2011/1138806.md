This award supports a special symposium at the 2011 American Association for
Aerosol Research (AAAR) annual conference. The symposium will address the
linkages between precipitation and other atmospheric processes, such as
nucleation, and formation of cloud droplets and ice crystals, as well as the
effect of changes in aerosol particles due to human activities on precipitation,
the radiative and dynamic properties of clouds, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award will provide travel support for four early career scientists to attend and
present as invited speakers at the symposium, including several women.
