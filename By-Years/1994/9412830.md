9412830 Caulton Indiana Univ. - Bloomington Dr. Kenneth G. Caulton, Chemistry
Department, University of Indiana at Bloomington, is supported by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for
an investigation of the structure and function of hydrogen ligands which are
attached to catalytically active late transition metals. Methods of forming
complexes of osmium, platinum, and rhodium which contain hydride and dihydrogen
ligands will be developed. The kinetics and thermodynamics of ligand binding and
exchange, and the mechanism of magnetic exchange within these molecules will be
evaluated. Attempts will be made to extend dihydrogen coordination to new metals
and to new oxidation states. The results of these studies will be utilized to
design new catalysts for, in particular, olefin hydration. Hydrogen molecules
may become activated by interacting metal atoms. This property has been
exploited for a long time in both laboratory and industrial chemistry to
increase the ability of hydrogen to undergo many reactions. In another respect,
the interactions between hydrogen and metals has become an important topic with
the increased interest in hydrogen as a clean fuel. This project will evaluate
the fundamental ways in which hydrogen becomes attached to a metal. Using this
data, new compounds containing hydrogen will be designed and a new method of
performing the industrially very important addition of water to an unsaturated
organic compound, i.e. "olefin hydration", will be developed.
