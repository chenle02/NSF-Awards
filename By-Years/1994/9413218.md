9413218 Monson This award will support a training program for undergraduate,
graduate and postdoctoral students with a focus on biosphere/atmosphere
interactions across several spatial scales. This area of research plays a
central role in understanding the impact of the environment on ecosystems at
several different levels of organization. Greater understanding of the
mechanisms of trace gas emission and of their influence on the environment will
be emphasized. The group of faculty is drawn primarily from the University of
Colorado, but includes several staff from the National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
facilities in Boulder. The training program includes courses and fieldwork,
workshops and internships at the NOAA and NCAR labs. The training will expose
students to both theory and measurement, the latter using some unique equipment.
Besides student support, the award will enable purchase or construction of
unique research equipment and will cover some costs of student research, travel
and publication. This award is also being supported by the Atmospheric Chemistry
Program in the Division of Atmospheric Sciences. ***
