The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to advance the capability of current robots to autonomously engage
with the household environment, recognize objects, and manipulate them in a
purposeful way. The proposed methodology adds this capability to a wide range of
household and entertainment robots. A user can teach a robot a wide range of
autonomous behaviors out of reach of the previously installed baseline software
packages. The proposed technology radically lowers the threshold for teaching a
robot sophisticated behaviors without complex programming nor high-quality
demonstrations. This enables a class of new applications beyond the simple
repetition of industrial activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project leverages a deep neural network-based
computer vision system that creates a lower-dimensional representation of the
world-view of the robot. On this latent encoding, the robot behavior is trained
using a combination of optimization criteria (e.g. training loss) that ensures
the generalization of the target task, smooth operation, recovery from
accidental mistakes, and ability to choose between alternative solutions to the
problem (e.g. avoid an obstacle to the left or to the right). The technology is
novel: current learning by demonstration systems usually reproduce an identical
trajectory to what has been demonstrated. This might be useful on a factory
floor but would not work in a home environment. In contrast, the proposed model
learns a generalizable behavior that uses demonstrations to obtain clues as to
how to solve a particular manipulation problem and can both identify and learn
from its own mistakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
