This award is for support of a one-year funded extension of a previous grant (of
the same title) to Dr. MacAyeal (DPP-8914398) to complete a research agenda that
has grown in scope as a result of new modeling techniques, and in anticipation
of new deep ice coring projects in West Antarctica. The current project has
already achieved a number of successes in ways which are important toward
reaching the overall goal of predicting the West Antarctic ice sheet's response
to global warming. This work will help to predict ice core attributes such as
chronology, levels of clathrate stability, isotopic and thermal stratigraphy,
among other parameters, which will be useful in the interpretation of ice cores
to be obtained in West Antarctica.
