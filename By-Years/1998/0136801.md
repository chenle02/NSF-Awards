Description: This award is to provide funds to the United States Department of
Agriculture, Washington, DC to support three joint research projects in the area
of agricultural biotechnology. The program director is Clemen Gehlhar, of the
USDA/Foreign Agriculture Service. These projects include: 1) holding a workshop
on developing an insecticidal nematode industry in Egypt, managed by Dr. Randy
Gaugler of Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey and Dr. Sally Allam of
Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt; 2) development of improved low-fat soft cheese,
managed by Dr. Joseph Frank, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia and Dr.
Morsi El-Soda, University of Alexandria, Alexandria, Egypt; and 3) examination
of poliovirus isolates from Egypt by nucleic acid probe hybridization signals to
determine the pattern of virus spread, managed by Dr. Olen Kew, Center for
Diseas Control & Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia and Dr. Naglaa A. Hamed, Egyptian
Organization for Biological Products & Vaccines, Agouza, Cairo, Egypt.

Scope: The award allows USDA to support three collaborative projects involving
US and Egyptian scientists, in areas of interest to the two countries. This
award is made under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to
scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative
activities.
