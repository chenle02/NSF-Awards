9408452 Lodge The study of plant-herbivore interactions in freshwater
communities has lagged far behind similar investigations in terrestrial and
marine systems. Yet research in the latter two habitats has revolutionized our
understanding of plant-animal interactions, ecosystem function, and coevolution.
This project extends methods and approaches developed for marine herbivore
systems to little-studied freshwater herbivore systems. The investigators are
documenting: what plant traits deter herbivore consumption, the selectivity of
freshwater herbivores, and the impact of generalist vs. specialist herbivores.
This research will allow the testing of important theories of plant defenses and
herbivory developed in terrestrial and marine systems, and provide a unique
opportunity for valuable comparisons between the three systems. This research
will improve our understanding of the ecology of plant-herbivore interactions
and the role of macrophyte feeders in the function of aquatic ecosystems. The
results have application in the management of aquatic ecosystems.
