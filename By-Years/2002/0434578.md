This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY 2005. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Determining
Free-energetic and Hydration Bases for Ion Channel Action via Computation." The
fine-tuned molecular structure of ion channels in living cells allows them to
selectively conduct a narrow class of ions across the biological membrane. This
project uses molecular simulation techniques to study the basis of this fine-
tuning. This research is a step toward the global goal of developing a set of
computational tools and theoretical constructs for determining the molecular
basis of transport action in ion channels of known structure. The training
aspect involves assimilating several skills: numerical methods, free energy
simulation techniques, and using classical molecular force fields to include
many-body effects.
