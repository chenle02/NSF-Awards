Project iLASER (investigations with Light And Sustainable Energy Resources) will
engage children, youth and adults in the Southwest United States in public
science education and hands-on activities. The Project iLASER team will visit
communities in Chula Vista, CA; El Centro/Brawley, CA; Yuma, AZ; Nogales, AZ;
Las Cruces, NM; El Paso, TX; McAllen, TX; and Harlingen, TX. Each two-day or
three-day visit will include activities in light and solar energy. Numerous
local partners, including Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCAs, science museums, two year
colleges, chemistry clubs and individuals will assist. Two particularly critical
partners are the Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE Net) and CCI
Solar, a basic research center centered at Caltech. Public lectures on the
science and impacts of CCI Solar research will be offered in each community.

Project iLASER is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Division of
Research on Learning, Lifelong Learning Cluster, as part of the celebration of
the International Year of Chemistry.
