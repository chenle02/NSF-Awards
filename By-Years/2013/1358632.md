The research team is developing a photonic crystal platform technology based on
negative refraction superlattices designed to implement high-performance phase
modulators and tunable birefringent filters for use in optical communication
modules. This technology is with chip-scale photonic crystal elements, highly
wavelength-dispersive and potentially low-loss structures allows for high-
density integration into modules. Since the devices are based on negative
refraction photonic crystal superlattices which have strong wavelengths and
phase sensitivity, they have low-voltage/power requirements for
modulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current optoelectric modules are large and
require high power and high voltages. This technology provides a small, low
power, low voltage module. The smaller size, would enable devices to be
integrated into large numbers on silicon chips and enhance communications
technologies.
