Animals interact with their local environment in ways that determine their
reproductive success and survival. By looking at how climate, topography, and
vegetation interact with the physical properties of the animal, including its
metabolic rate and heat gain and loss, a basic model can be developed. The
current model uses global climate data, digital elevation maps, vegetation maps
and animal properties to calculate available microclimates, animal energetics,
behavior, activity patterns, food web structure, community structure and
potential for and food-borne pathogen and pesticide exposure. New work will
extend the model's availability by providing a graphical user interface and web
accessibility, as well as by extending the database of information on animal
reflectivity and morphology.

The model can be applied to a wide range of questions from the appropriateness
of environments for relocating endangered species to the impact of climate
change on animal population dynamics and environmental impacts of pesticide
spraying or forest burns or other management activities. Informed decision
making is improved and a wide range of collaborators and students help to spread
the use of the
