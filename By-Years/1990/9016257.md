This award supports cooperative research in three areas of surface physics among
several groups in the U.S. and in Brazil. The principal investigators are See-
Chen Ying of Brown University and Amos Troper of the Brazilian Center for
Physics Research (CBPF) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This work will be concerned
with the growth and dynamics of mesoscopic and low dimensional systems. It
consists of three interrelated projects: (1) the growth and stability of
interfaces, (2) the diffusive and vibrational motion of adatoms on surfaces, and
(3) the optical properties of superlattices and quantum wells with well-defined
interfaces. This project involves the effort of two institutions in the United
States, Brown University and the Naval Research Laboratory, and two institutions
in Brazil, CBPF and the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), with a
total of three investigators on the Brazilian side and four on the American
side. Over the last few years a collaborative effort has already existed among
the investigators. The present project would enhance further collaboration and
allow a stronger focus and interaction among interrelated directions of research
within the broad important area of surface and interface physics.
