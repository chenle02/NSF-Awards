This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
conference "Harmonic Analysis Applied to Geometry of Fractal Sets" that will be
held February 3-5, 2017, on the campus of Ohio State University. For additional
information see the website https://u.osu.edu/hafs2017/

This conference is devoted to the study of problems that lie at the interface of
harmonic analysis and the geometry of fractal sets (e.g., the Falconer distance
conjecture; the existence of geometric configurations, such as triangles, within
fractal sets; the relationship between the Fourier transform and Hausdorff
dimension). There will be nine featured speakers: Seymon Dyatlov, Alex iosevich,
Erin Pearse, Lilian Pierce, Malabika Pramanik, Sze-Man Ngai, Karoly Simon, Pablo
Shmerkin, and Mariusz Urbanski. The program allows ample oppportunity for junior
mathematicians to present their work.
