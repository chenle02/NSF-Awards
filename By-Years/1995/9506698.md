Current tectonic models for the Scandinavian Caledonides indicate the Lofoten
archipelago contains crust from the western edge of the Baltic craton that was
deeply subducted during Silurian collisions with Laurentia, however few studies
have addressed either the evidence for deep burial or the timing of such burial
and exhumation. This project will follow new data that suggests that these rocks
were buried to depths of 30km, but returned to the surface much more slowly and
in distinct episodic events. In addition to the significance for Caledonia
tectonics, this study will be relevant to the diverse fields of tectonic work to
evaluate the relationship between the original thickness and structure of an
orogen, the duration and processes of unroofing orogenic and thick continental
crust and attenuation of lithosphere along an evolving continental margin.
