The work which will be conducted by Profs. Barat and Gorun at New Jersey
Institute of Technology is to design active catalyst species which are in
essence miniature reaction vessels. This feature makes them similar to enzyme
catalyst sites. The PIs intend to use perfluorinated phthalocyanines as
hydrophobic vessels surrounding hydrophilic metal centers for the aerobic
oxidation of mercaptans to disulfides. These perfluorinated phthalocyanines
should be more resistant to damage by catalytically-produced oxygen radicals
than other oxidation catalysts, which is another feature in common with enzymes.
The work proposed is a straightforward study of the influence of ligand
structure on catalyst activity, and stability. The authors propose to study the
kinetics of the homogeneous radical-based oxidation, as well as evaluating
heterogenized versions of the catalyst (Cobalt-based phthalocyanines coordinated
to SiO2 through imidazolyl groups). The project aims to provide catalysts for
oxidation of molecules which are more "green" than previous catalysts by
allowing the use of air for the reaction without the catalyst being destroyed by
the oxygen. This is done by replacing reactive C-H bonds with unreactive C-F
bonds in the catalyst species. Further fine tuning of the catalyst is possible
by using organic chemistry modifications of the catalyst. The investigators have
chosen mercaptan oxidation, now used to remove sulfur from gasoline, as the
first reaction for study. This is a useful benchmark, and success will allow
projection of the concept to other catalysts and reactions. These studies will
be of interest to the community enrolling at NJIT, and the PIs will involve
undergraduates in the research program.
