Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at
Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research
programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing programs. It is expected that
the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and
effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the home institution, and
involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The project seeks to
understand the effect of viruses on the global systems and their impact on the
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to
understand the diversity and potential of viruses within intertidal zones in the
Chesapeake Bay area using direct counts, isolates of viruses and hosts
(mycobacteria) and sequencing approaches. The expected outcomes will contribute
to the gap of knowledge on the biodiversity of the viral community in the
physical intersection of soil and marine environments with an emphasis on the
intertidal zone of different river systems in the Chesapeake Bay Estuary. The
experimental methods will incorporate an interdisciplinary approach combining
field work, environmental sample collection, biology based wet-lab
experimentation, data analysis, metagenomics, genomics and bioinformatics. The
approach will be to isolate, annotate and analyze mycobacteriophage genomes and
to understand the viral diversity of the intertidal zone in different seasons.
The global impact of this work will contribute to the understanding of how
anthropogenic factors may contribute to the changes in environmental
ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
