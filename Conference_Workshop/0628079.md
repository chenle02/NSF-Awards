The lectures will involve boundary-value problems for nonlinear elliptic
equations on bounded domains. They will encompass several important topics of
current interest such as bifurcation theory, domain shape, Morse index
solutions, and peak solutions; which occur in a great variety of applications of
mathematics such as mathematical biology, catalysis theory, material science,
and combustion. There will also be a discussion of interrelationships between
these topics.

The lectures will show a close connection between the theory of peak solutions
and the theory of finite Morse index solutions. It is becoming increasingly
apparent that finite Morse index solutions are very useful tools for studying
nonlinear elliptic equations with rapid growth in the nonlinearity (faster than
the critical growth).

The talks will also include a number of interesting open problems that may be of
interest to researchers in the area.
