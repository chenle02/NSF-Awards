In order to understand and predict local and regional scale weather, it is
important to understand the influence of land surface variations. In previous
studies the Principal Investigator has shown that spatial differences in
vegetation and soil can influence mesoscale heat and moisture fluxes which in
turn can influence the local weather. The Principal Investigator will continue
his work in this area emphasizing the development of parameterizations for
numerical models and testing these models using actual data.//
