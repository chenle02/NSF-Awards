The principal investigator will measure the effect of pressure on the
equilibrium sound speeds of multicomponent silicate liquids. He also will
experimentally determine the effect of dissolved waer on the iron redox state of
silicate liquids. Results of this work will be important in understanding the
nature of igneous processes in the Earth.
