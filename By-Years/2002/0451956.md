This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at the University of Oregon for the summers of 2005-2007. The program
director is Geraldine Richmond. The objective of the University of Oregon REU
Program is to provide interested undergraduate students an opportunity to
combine their knowledge in chemistry and physics in research endeavors that
encompass both of these disciplines. Selection of the participants is based on a
strong interest in both chemistry and physics and a desire to conduct research
that involves both disciplines. Seventeen research-active faculty from the
Chemistry and Physics departments at the University of Oregon have research
projects for the participants, giving students many choices for summer research.
The proposed research projects have been carefully designed to provide a
research experience that is challenging, educational, rewarding and enjoyable.
Faculty help students move from a relatively dependent to independent status as
the competency of the student increases over the summer. In addition to the
publishable research, the students and mentors participate in research seminars,
weekly meetings, social activities and follow-up activities after students
return to their home institutions. The project will attempt to increase both the
numbers of students entering graduate school in chemical physics and the
diversity of the students selecting this field for future study and careers.
