Dr. Eric Chronister is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study fast dynamical processes which occur in molecular
solids at extreme pressures. These experiments will provide important
information on how chemical reactions are influenced by conditions of extreme
pressure at very low temperatures. In this project Chronister will utilize high
pressure and time-resolved coherent spectroscopies to study details of solid
state intermolecular interactions which cannot be obtained by other means.
Although temperature provides the energy for a system to move on a potential
energy surface, the effect of increased density is very different since it
influences the shape of the potential energy surface. Chronister's research will
be useful in developing dynamic theories of optical dephasing, vibronic
relaxation and inhomogeneous coherence loss, all of which are controlled by the
shape of the intermolecular potential energy function. Since no high pressure
studies of relaxation dynamics of molecular solids at low temperature have yet
been done, Chronister will begin with detailed studies of pure and mixed crystal
systems as well as some novel molecular solids.
