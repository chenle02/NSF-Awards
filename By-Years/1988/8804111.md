This grant will be used as partial support for the operation of Case Western
Reserve University's Burrell Schmidt telescope which is located on Kitt Peak in
Arizona. The operating costs are shared equally between Case Western and Kitt
Peak National Observatory, with the Case Western contribution coming in part
from university money and in part from the National Science Foundation (NSF).
The Burrell Schmidt is the largest Schmidt-type telescope in the United States
with objective prisms and is thus uniquely suited for large scale spectroscopic
surveys. A number of surveys using this technique are being carried out by Case
Western astronomers.
