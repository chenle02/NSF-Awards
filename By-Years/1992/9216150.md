We propose to replace the Beckman Model E Analysis Ultracentrifuge with the new
Beckman Optima XL-A Analytical Ultracentrifuge. This will maintain state-of-the-
art instrumentation and facilitate physical biochemical analysis of numerous
protein and nucleic acid systems currently under study in the laboratories of
the proposed user group. Analytical ultracentrifugation is the best technique
for studying associating macromolecular systems and is extremely useful for
elucidating the interaction, size, and shape of small molecules, proteins and
nucleic acids. Three primary and at least five secondary users will utilize the
requested instrumentation in a variety of projects. Major projects include: 1)
tubulin polymer formation and microtubule- associated protein self-association,
2) specificity of drug- nucleic acid interactions, 3) assembly of amino-tRNA
syntheses complexes, 4) protein-RNA interactions and 5) secretory protein
association. Minor projects include: 6) redox-electron carrier protein
association, 7) molecular studies of secreted glycoproteins and 8) specificity
of histone-DNA interactions. Acquisition of the requested equipment will have an
immediated and significant impact on each of the projects listed in this
proposal. The impact will include: 1) increased access to analytical
ultracentrifugation for routine sedimentation velocity and equilibrium analysis,
2) access to rapid data acquisition and analysis through an interfaced PS/2
computer system, and 3) support for maintenance and repair of the
ultracentrifuge. The analytical ultracentrifuge work is complemented by a
variety of other biophysical approaches including circular dichroism,
fluorescence spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, stopped-flow
kinetics, electron microscopy, and molecular biology, protein engineering. The
applicants have an established record of shared instrumentation and of active
collaboration in their research programs. The Optima XL-A will be only
functioning analytical ultracentrifuge in the State of Mississippi.
