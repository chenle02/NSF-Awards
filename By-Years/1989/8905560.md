The response of the Earth to the (nearly) diurnal torques applied by the Sun
and the Moon provides a means for studying the characteristics of the Earth and
the interactions of the Earth's mantle with its fluid parts (fluid-outer core,
atmosphere and oceans). The PIs will study these problems through the use of
very-long-baseline (VLBI) measurements of the motions of the Earth's rotation
axis in space - the nutations of the Earth, addressing issues concerning the
accuracy with which the nutation series coefficients can be determined from VLBI
data, and at the interpretation of the differences between the observed
coefficients and those computed from theoretical models of the response of the
Earth to the nearly diurnal torques.
