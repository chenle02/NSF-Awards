This project explores possible mechanisms in the sulfite replacement of light in
activating latent ATPase of pre- reduced or trypsin treated spinach thylakoids.
Sulfite might prevent inhibition by tightly bound ADP and magnesium ions.
Kinetics of Mg2+ and ADP inhibition are being investigated at different levels
of energization, and with different states of thylakoid activation using
sulfite. Reduced CF1, depleted of adenylates by MgATP hydrolysis in 35% methanol
should be permanently active. Initial reactions will be studied by stop-flow
technique, to see if lags are eliminated by sulfite or by adenylate depletion.
Dr. Jagendorf has made the interesting observation that sulfite can substitute
for light leading to energy generation during photosynthesis. He is now using
this effect to study the basic mechanism of energy generation in chloroplasts.
This process is of utmost importance to life on earth as it converts light to
chemical energy for the production of carbohydrates.***//
