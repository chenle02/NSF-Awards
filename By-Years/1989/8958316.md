The core research focuses on the representation, management, and communication
of data, design decisions, and knowledge throughout the life cycle of facility
planning, design, construction, and management. The integrated data systems
accommodate spatial data (3D object models), graphical data (pictorial
representations), nonspatial data (object attributes, specification), temporal
data (design versions and construction plans), and design-dependent knowledge
(the rationale behind design decisions). Previous work established a new model
for integrating existing engineering databases and applications across networked
computers through an intelligent, centralized network interface, including
automatic translation of data queries and replies between widely varying views
of data. The model has been implemented in a prototype system called KADBASE
(Knowledge-Aided Database Management). The KADBASE research will help
architects, engineers, contractors, and facility managers cooperate and
communicate using their current, familiar applications and their successors. The
organizational problems arising from industry fragmentation will be at least
partially alleviated through the virtual integration of engineering computer
systems using this approach. //
