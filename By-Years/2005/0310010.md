Geodetic deformation around the Marmara Sea, Turkey: Implications for the
earthquake deformation cycle, and earthquake hazards in the greater Istanbul
area

Brief Summary

This research project involves monitoring and interpreting ongoing postseismic
deformation for the 1999 Turkey earthquake sequence on the North Anatolian fault
(NAF) and determining better the character of elastic strain accumulation in the
Marmara Sea region. We will use six continuously recording GPS systems (CGPS)
being retired from the UNAVCO Inc. equipment pool to augment the network of CGPS
stations currently in operation around the greater Istanbul region. They will be
deployed to establish a N-S profile across the 1999 Turkey earthquake surface
break and along the north shore of the Marmara Sea west of Istanbul. These
stations, together with continuing GPS survey observations being done by our
Turkish partners (TUBITAK, Marmara Research Center) will allow us to constrain
the earthquake deformation cycle for major, continental strike slip faults and
will provide new constraints on the rheology of the continental lithosphere. The
new information from this study will be directly relevant to estimating
earthquake hazards along the NAF and similar continental strike slip faults
including the San Andreas fault in California.
