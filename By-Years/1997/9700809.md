EEC 9700809 Cummings Abstract This award funds a three year Combined Research-
Curriculum Development (CRCD) program, entitled "Development of a World Wide Web
Based Textbook on Molecular Simulation," at the University of Tennessee-
Knoxville under the direction of Dr. Peter T. Cummings. The goal of this project
is to initiate a WWW-based "textbook" on molecular simulation. An electronic
form of this book exists exclusively and is read via an electronic browser such
as Netscape or Microsoft Explorer. This electronic format invites the use of
many novel tools that significantly enhance the learning experience and permits
the book to adjust rapidly to advances in the field of molecular simulation,
thereby precluding its obsolescence. The work funded by this award is part of a
broader project to weave molecular simulation into the undergraduate and
graduate chemical engineering curricula at the University of Tennessee-
Knoxville. This is important because molecular simulation is emerging as a
practical tool of chemical manufacturers and consumers.
