Colorado College proposes to strengthen offerings in a new interdisciplinary
environmental science program by adding an inductively coupled plasma
spectrometer (ICP) to the current equipment used to teach environmental courses
in the chemistry, geology, economics, and biology departments. Faculty in a
variety of departments have created new courses and improved existing courses to
meet student demand for environmental science education. The next step in
providing a substantive curriculum for these students is to strengthen the
quantitative analysis components of environmental course offerings. The proposed
ICP, because of its multicomponent analysis capabilities, is particularly
effective for involving students in developing and evaluating various
alternative models,as well as providing quantitative data. The ICP will be used
by students in environmental courses in chemistry, biology, geology, and
economics to analyze air and water for elemental pollutants, and plants and
soils for nutrients and toxic metals, as well as investigate the bioaccumulation
of heavy metals in food webs.Colorado College faculty believe strongly that the
sciences should be taught as a laboratory or field experience in which models
and theories are created to explain observations, and that the best laboratory
teaching experiences contain a significant component of original research that
allows students to become involved in the practice of science. Not only are
students prepared for possible teaching, graduate, or industrial work, but non-
science majors are exposed to the processes by which scientists arrive at the
conclusions that impact all of our lives. Based on past experiences with other
instruments at Colorado College we expect the ICP to further enhance the
interaction between departments, both within the natural sciences and across to
the social sciences.
