To address the decline in degrees awarded to domestic students in Computer
Science and Software Engineering (CSSE), this project is increasing
participation and retention of academically talented, financially disadvantaged
undergraduate and graduate students by providing about 57 scholarships over the
course of the project. The undergraduate scholars are pursuing degrees in any of
the three accredited degree programs: Computer Science, Software Engineering and
Wireless Engineering. Auburn University is providing full tuition waivers to
graduate scholars. The project is providing a pool of skilled graduates for the
workforce that will help the nation maintain a leadership position in embedded
computer systems and distributed computing. Recruitment efforts are being
conducted via college and departmental recruiting events, site visits, web site,
office of minority engineering program, and synergy with the STARS alliance. The
project is improving retention and transforming the educational experience by
one-to-one tutoring, mentoring of undergraduate scholars by graduate scholars,
study-groups, and field trips. Career networking and internships opportunities
are being provided via industrial partnerships. The outcomes are being
disseminated via conferences, journals, web site and media outlets by Auburn
University's office of communication and marketing. Research is being integrated
into education by participation of undergraduate scholars in the summer REU
program (optional) and graduate scholar research. Formative and summative
evaluations are informing the process of recruitment, retention, and placement.
