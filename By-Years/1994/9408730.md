9408730 Smith The design of high-hazard structures, such as spillways on major
dams, is based on estimates of the Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP). The
Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) offers a wealth of radar data which
utilization in the analysis of severe storm events will advance the
understanding and measurement of extreme rainfalls and will improve the
procedures for assessing PMP. The principal objectives of the projects are: to
characterize the spatial, seasonal and diurnal heterogeneities in the occurrence
of extreme rainstorms giving special attention to storm transposition and the
specification of spatial and temporal patterns of PMP; and to assess the
accuracy of radar rainfall estimates of extreme rainstorms. The results from
this work will enhance the quality of the design of emergency dam spillways and
other high risk structures, and the risk assessment of these structures. ***
