Calmodulin (CaM) proteins function to transduce a chemical signal (increase in
cytosolic calcium) into a biochemical signal. The ability of the CaM protein to
recognize and functionally interact with a target protein is essential in this
signal transduction process. In many organisms, with the exception of plants,
there exist one or two CaM-type proteins. In the model organism Arabidopsis
thaliana there are seven known CaM proteins and five additional CaM-related
proteins. Further analysis of the Arabidopsis genome suggests that there are at
least an additional 13 potential CaM-related proteins. In this project, the
biochemical and functional difference between three CaM-related proteins will be
addressed. These proteins all possess conserved cysteine residues, which are
proposed to form a disulfide bond. This PI will investigate the role of the
cysteine residues and potential disulfide bond formation in calcium binding and
in binding to a hydrophobic resin. If disulfide bond formation appears to
influence the ability of the proteins to bind calcium and to interact with
hydrophobic surfaces, the cysteine residues will be individually mutated. The
mutated protein will then be expressed and purified to test the effect of
elimination of specific cysteine residues on the biochemical activity of these
proteins
