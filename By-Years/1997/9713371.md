The PI will establish a new research program investigating the metallisation
schemes which offer potential for implementation if wide band-gap (GaN, SiC)
semiconductor devices. Her research will combine knowledge of interfacial
reactions and materials properties with an understanding of the physics of
Schottky barriers and the associated interfacial current transport mechanisms.
