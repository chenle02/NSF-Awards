#: 0328741&lt;br/&gt;Title: RUI: Multiple Information Sources for 3D Articulated
Pose Tracking&lt;br/&gt;PI: Howe, Nicholas&lt;br/&gt;Smith
College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will pursue the research and
development of a system to track human motions in three dimensions from single
camera video input. A limited ability to sense the activities of humans in their
native environment has long inhibited the application of computer technology
outside strictly controlled environments. Expanding the range of what computers
can learn through simple video input concerning events in their surroundings has
the potential to vastly increase the number of applications to real-world
situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will yield both research insights
and new curricular initiatives. Current systems for tracking human motion either
limit the domain in some manner (tracking only certain types of motion, or in
fewer than three dimensions) or else lack reliability, losing track of their
subjects over time. The research focus of this project therefore aims to build a
general system with improved long-term reliability by incorporating novel
sources of feedback, including retrieval of known poses from silhouettes, and
graph-based techniques for segmentation and body-part identification. The
mechanism will embody a flexible Bayesian framework, admitting the inclusion of
additional tracking guidance components as they are developed. Once built, the
tracking system will offer opportunities for curricular deployment, particularly
in exercise and sport studies, where it may augment the tools available for the
study of human motion and biomechanics. The work will enhance opportunities in
areas utilizing motion analysis in their fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
