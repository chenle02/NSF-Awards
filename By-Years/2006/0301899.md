The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Alison M.
Bell to work with Dr. Felicity A. Huntingford at the University of Glasgow in
Glasgow, United Kingdom.

This project is a study of a behavioral syndrome in threespined stickleback, a
widely-distributed freshwater fish well-suited for testing evolutionary
hypotheses. The PI will study differences between individuals and populations
for boldness and aggressiveness in three ways. First she will ascertain whether
boldness and aggressiveness are similarly correlated in a number of populations
which differ in predation risk. Second, she will investigate a physiological
mechanism underlying both behaviors in order to infer how the two traits might
be related proximally. Third she will examine the evolution of the 'boldness-
aggressiveness' syndrome across the populations with a phylogenetic perspective
to ask why the traits are correlated in some populations but not others.
