This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in genetics involves
Christopher Francklyn of the University of Vermont and Dino Moras of the
Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire at the French
National Center for Scientific Research in Strasbourg, France. The objective of
the research is to investigate the structures of histidyl-tRNA synthetases from
prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The U.S. investigator brings to this
collaboration expertise in the molecular biology, biochemistry and
crystallization of proteins. This is complemented by French expertise in
crystallography. The project advances understanding of the catalytic and
substrate recognition properties of these enzymes and their evolution during the
transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic organisms.
