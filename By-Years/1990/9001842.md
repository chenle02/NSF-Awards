Professor Wogen will investigate several questions in the theory of Hilbert
space operators. These questions involve various notions of reflexivity for such
operators. In addition the structure of the algebra of all operators which
commute with a given operator will be investigated and finally Professor Wogen
will examine the structure of certain types of composition operators. Hilbert
space operators are essentially infinite matrices of complex numbers. These
operators have applications in every area of applied science as well as in pure
mathematics. This type of research is an attempt to classify certain important
classes of such objects.
