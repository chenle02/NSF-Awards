Individuals who are recruited to participate in research studies are often asked
to disclose information about their race. Some research participants, including
those who do not identify with a standard reporting category, may think that
their identity is not accurately captured by demographic questions. This project
will develop strategies for collecting and reporting information about the race
of research participants. Project findings will provide guidance to researchers
so that they can ask questions in ways that are more respectful of research
participants and more likely to produce accurate and reliable information about
racial identity. The overarching aim of the project is to promote ethical and
responsible research practices for collecting and reporting information about
the racial identity of research participants.

The research team plans to collect and analyze participants’ racial identity in
their own words and understand their experiences of answering typical
demographics questions about race. The team will draw on this information to
develop and test alternative ways of asking participants about their race and
for reporting that information. The team will use an on-line data collection
platform with a nationally representative participant pool, as well as conduct
interviews and focus groups. Guidelines for collecting and reporting
participants’ racial identity, as well as strategies for disseminating the
guidelines, will emerge from the project. The team also plans to collect
feedback from researchers, survey professionals and other stakeholders, and
refine the guidelines, which will be tailored for adoption by each group.

This project is funded through the ER2 program by the Directorate for Social,
Behavioral and Economic Sciences.
