This proposal supports 15-20 students for their travel to attend the 2017 Annual
International Cryptology Conference (CRYPTO), sponsored by IACR (International
Association of Cryptologic Research), in cooperation with the Computer Science
Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara. CRYPTO is a highly
selective conference in cryptography, attracting students, researchers and
industry specialists from all over the world. The scope of research papers
accepted to CRYPTO range from the theoretical foundations of cryptology to
application and implementation of cryptographic schemes. As such, it fits
closely with the goals of NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC)
program, which include applied cryptography and implementation of cryptographic
schemes.
