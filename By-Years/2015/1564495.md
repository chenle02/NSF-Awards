This project is focused on improving the representation of biosphere-atmosphere
exchange processes in atmospheric chemical transport models. The overall
objectives of the project are to investigate the impact of future land-use
change on surface-atmosphere exchange processes, and to improve the
characterization of the pre-industrial atmospheric composition. The project will
aid in the development of sound policies for promoting air quality and a
sustainable environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is directed toward
evaluating and improving GEOS-Chem global model simulations of dry deposition,
organic aerosol aging, and bioaerosols. The focus of this work is on short-lived
climate forcers: ozone and aerosols. The GEOS-Chem model is being used to
isolate the impact of land surface modifications on chemical fluxes and
atmospheric composition. Modeling results will be evaluated using ambient field
observations from surface sites and airborne campaigns over the last decade.
