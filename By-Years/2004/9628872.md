96-28872 Holt The PI proposes to investigate both the kinematics and dynamics
of deforming continental lithosphere in regions such as Asia, New Zealand, and
Japan. He will utilize kinematic modeling techniques that he has developed and
demonstrated are equivalent to the solutions for the deformation of a thin
viscous sheet, and in this proposal, will advance his research toward a joint
determination of both the kinematics and dynamics. The advantage of joint
kinematic and dynamic analysis is that all of the dynamic solutions will be
constrained by observations. This work will help advance an understanding of the
kinematics and dynamics of strain partitioning within zones of continental
deformation, which is fundamental for the quantification of earthquake hazards,
and for the understanding of continental tectonics in general. The educational
component of this proposal includes the preparation of a graduate level textbook
on continental kinematics and dynamics. ***
