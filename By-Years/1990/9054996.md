Western Kentucky University will initiate a 5-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Molecular Biology for 20 students entering grades 11,12. Each of the
participants will undertake a research project with one of four research
faculty. Research activities in DNA cloning and sequencing, enzyme analysis, and
gene expression will continue through the year at high schools in a follow-up
program involving the research staff and high school teachers.
