The NSF Collaborative grant "Graduate Student Training through Research on
Plasma-Based Accelerators", has supported the work of 14 graduate students since
September 1, 2009 at seven different institutions. Eight of these students have
already graduated and another six are expected to graduate by the close of
calendar year 2014. This project supports one of these six students, whose
scientific goal is to complete theoretical studies aimed at improving the
efficiency of particle acceleration through the use of lasers. Laser
acceleration of proton and ion beams from solid targets is a topic of great
interest for a variety of applications, including beam therapy of cancer and
fast ignition. While this concept offers the promise of compact treatment
facilities, the need for mono-energetic beams at controlled energies with modest
laser power has been a challenge. The student has demonstrated an approach to
controlling the energy of beams with density gradient and laser rise time
shaping. The scheme can surpass the scaling of beam energy with the laser power
of current schemes. This final work will address the scaling of the potential
height with laser intensity.
