Title: Rocky Mountain Discrete Mathematics Conferences

This project supports a 3-year sequence of Rocky Mountain regional mini-
conferences in Discrete Mathematics and its applications. Each two day meeting
features plenary talks by outside experts on focused, contemporary themes in
Discrete Mathematics. The topics and plenary speakers are:

2003: Generalizations of interval graphs and their applications Speakers: Jeremy
Spinrad (Vanderbilt University) Ann Trenk (Wellesley College)

2004: Tournaments Brooks Reid (California State San Marcos) Steve Kirkland
(University of Regina)

2005: Algebraic Graph Theory Chris Godsil (University of Waterloo) Willem
Haemers (Tilburg University).

This project supports a 3-year sequence of annual two-day conferences for
mathematicians and computer scientists in the Rocky Mountain region. The
conferences (a) provide an encouraging environment for young researchers and
graduate students, (b) inform researchers of some of the latest developments in
discrete mathematics, and (c) strengthen collaborative, and interdisciplinary
research ties among discrete mathematicians in the Rocky Mountain region.
