Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details
and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic
and organometallic molecules. When combined with gas chromatography (GC), the
resulting GC/MS affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools available for
the separation and characterization of compounds. The acquisition of GC/MS is
essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many fields of chemistry.
The Department of Chemistry at the Wake Forest University will use this award
from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to help acquire a GC/MS system. The
areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the
following: 1) Synthesis and Reaction Chemistry of Transition-Metal S2O
Complexes. 2) Carbenoid Chemistry/Natural Synthesis. 3) Evaluation of the
Feasibility, Applications, and Scope of Cloud Point Extractions. 4) Chemistry of
N-Alkyl-N-Nitro-Nitrosoguanidines and Alkane and Benzyl Diazotates.
