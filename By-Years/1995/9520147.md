Abstract 9520147 S.L. Girshick, U. of Minnesota A new method for creating
nanostructured coatings or bulk materials by using a hypersonic plasma particle
deposition will be investigated. The objectives of the research are to develop a
plasma expansion process for high-rate synthesis of nanoparticles of hard non-
oxide ceramics with minimum in-flight agglomeration, investigate the hypersonic
impaction process for powder collection and in-situ compaction, and characterize
the particles and corresponding deposits. Models will be developed for particle
nucleation and growth, in-flight agglomeration and hypersonic deposition, and
then applied to the experimental conditions in the laboratory. The project is
technologically relevant to manufacturing nanoparticles and advanced ceramics
coatings. ***
