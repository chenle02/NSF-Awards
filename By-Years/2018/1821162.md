Symmetries, which can be mathematically described by groups, play an important
role in science. In quantum physics, the fundamental theory of physics at small
scales, operator algebras provide a mathematical framework to study quantum
systems and their symmetries. To describe quantum particles and matter in low
dimensions (for example, on a thin layer) one needs a generalization of symmetry
that goes beyond groups, often referred to as quantum symmetries. A main focus
of this project is to find models realizing such symmetries in quantum field
theory, which combines the principles of quantum physics and the theory of
special relativity. The goal is to use the rich interplay between operator
algebras and quantum field theory via conformal nets and to better understand
possible quantum symmetries in mathematics and low-dimensional physics. One
potential application is topological quantum computing, where the goal is to use
quantum operations coming from non-trivial quantum symmetries to perform
computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conformal nets give rise to interesting
quantum symmetries in terms of subfactors and unitary modular tensor categories.
The project will focus on three main directions. First, the principal
investigator will extend the understanding of boundaries or defects between
conformal nets, generalize the abstract description of defects in terms of
braided subfactors, and explore the relation to Jones' planar algebras. The
second project focus is to provide new structural results and examples of
rational conformal nets realizing the quantum doubles subfactors. Lastly, the
principal investigator will develop methods for using operator-algebraic
techniques to construct conformal nets from their quantum symmetries and give
relations between the operator algebraic approach of conformal nets and the
purely algebraic approach of vertex operator algebras.
