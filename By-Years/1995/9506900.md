9506900 Sharp This research is directed at understanding the physical and
chemical basis of specific antibody-antigen binding. The system for study
consists of three antibody/protein complexes and four antibody/hapten complexes
for which high resolution X-ray structures and binding data are available, plus
data on binding differences for point amino acid mutations and hapten analogue
binding. The study will focus on: 1) The role of solvation, including both
electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. 2)'Association entropy' changes
arising from translational/rotational entropy loss upon binding, and
conformational entropy changes. A combination of theoretical approaches will be
used, in order to develop computationally feasible yet quantitative methods for
calculating binding energies. Electrostatics will be treated using a continuum
treatment of solvent with an atomic detail representation of the molecule, using
the Finite Difference Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB)method. Dynamic aspects will be
handled by a method which combines the FDPB method with molecular mechanics
(FDPB/MD). Hydrophobic interactions will be treated using surface free energy
relationships. Conformational entropy changes will be assessed by quasi-harmonic
analysis using dynamics. %%% This research will have general significance both
for understanding how antibodies recognize (bind tightly) to specific antigens,
and for biological recognition in general. The specific recognition of antigens
by antibodies is a fundamental part of the immune response. Also the antibody-
antigen interaction is a paradigm for molecular recognition in biology. specific
binding is also a key requirement of effective inhibitors and drugs. The ability
to calculate binding energies from antibody-antigen structures has significance
for indentifying the driving force for binding, the origins of specificity, the
role of antigen-antibody complementarity and the intrinsic antigenicity of
surface groups, and for the design of inhibitors and drugs. ***
