Deepwater rice is grown in large areas of Southeast Asia, e.g. Bangladesh,
where chronic flooding during the monsoon season makes the cultivation of other
crop plants impossible. This rice type responds to partial submergence by a
rapid increase in growth. This permits the rice to keep part of its foliage
above the rising flood waters and to avoid "drowning." The signal for enhanced
growth is reduced oxygen tension in the submerged plant. This promotes ethylene
synthesis which in turn activates a hormone called gibberellin. The hormone
promotes rapid stem elongation. The molecular processes underlying this complex
series of events will be studied using state of the art genetic probes.//
