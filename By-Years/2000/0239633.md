Professor Alan Esker of Virginia Polytechnic Institute is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study magnetic nanoparticles and
their aggregation, adsorption, transport and viscoelastic properties in
biomimetic lipid systems. Applied magnetic fields can alter fundamental lipid-
nanoparticle interactions, which are particularly relevant for drug delivery and
therapeutic applications. This CAREER award also supports the PI's goal of
attracting students to macromolecular physical chemistry with innovative
research experiences for undergraduates and research on enzyme kinetics as part
of the physical chemistry course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic nanoparticles
have attracted considerable attention for separations, biosensing, targeted
delivery of therapeutic agents and magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents.
Basic research into their interactions with membranes will ultimately lead to
improvements in these applications.
