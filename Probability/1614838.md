Successful prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer requires an
understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which cancer evolves spatially and
temporally. The occurrence of different cell types in different parts of a
tumor, the spatial heterogeneity of the tumor, can lead to failure of therapy
that is directed only against one type of cancer cell. Furthermore, spatial
heterogeneity is associated with a worse prognosis in many cancer types, and the
spatial distribution of nutrients and oxygen can favor the development of more
aggressive tumor cell populations. By analyzing spatial cancer models, this
research will provide new insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of intra-
tumor heterogeneity in solid tumors, and into the role of cellular mobility in
shaping tumor phenotypes with poor prognosis. To guarantee that the results are
relevant to treatment, the project will be carried out in collaboration with
physicians and a cancer biologist. The involvement of graduate students in this
research will enhance their ability to work at the interface between mathematics
and biology.

This project addresses critical challenges in the quest for more effective
diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches in the fight against cancer. Complex
agent-based models have often been employed to investigate the impact of space
on cancer evolution. However, even if a simulation successfully reproduces
observed phenomena, it does not mean that the true underlying mechanism has been
found. For this project the investigators plan to extend prior work on spatial
Moran models by adding new features to the basic model. To further reduce the
gap between analytically tractable and complex computational models, the
behavior of the new systems will be analyzed mathematically. The biological
questions to be addressed by the project are motivated by recent experimental
findings, including studies of the impact of cancer cell migration on solid
tumor growth and elucidation of the role of cancer stem cells in driving cancer
evolution. Mathematical models that can include genomic data will be used to
study genealogies and intra-tumor heterogeneity in colon cancer. Rigorous
results for hybrid models that describe tumor-microenvironment interactions will
also be derived. More generally, the rigorous analyses of the models will
require the development of novel mathematical techniques that will contribute to
a deeper understanding of spatial stochastic systems and the behavior of
genealogies in an expanding population.
