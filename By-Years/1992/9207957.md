The Third Topical Meeting on Laser Applications to Chemical Analysis will be
held at Salt Lake City, Utah on January 27- 30, 1992. This meeting will be a
three-and-one-half day program (single sessions) that will consist of a
combination of invited and contributed papers (oral and poster presentations).
Technical sessions will be held each morning until lunchtime; afternoons will be
unscheduled to permit informal discussions similar to a Gordon Research
Conference; further technical discussions will continue in the evenings.
Summaries of papers as submitted by the authors will be collected and published.
Research topics to be considered include atmospheric and remote sensing,
biological applications, materials chemistry and analysis, surface chemistry,
molecular identification and separation, combustion diagnostics, plasma studies,
trace element analysis, single atom/molecule detection, laser sources and
spectroscopic instrumentation, and sensors.
