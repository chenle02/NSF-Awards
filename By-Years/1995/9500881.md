DMS-9500881 Huang Huang will study the mapping problems for real hypersurfaces
in complex spaces and try to prove various regularity results for Cauchy-Riemann
mappings. He will investigate the smooth and analytic structure of a real
submanifold in the complex space and the structure of its local hull of
holomorphy. Also he will explore the Kobayashi extremal mappings of bounded
domains in complex n-space and their applications to the study of holomorphic
self-mappings. Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the century
as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of one complex variable. It
became clear early on that the theory differed widely from it predecessor. The
underlying geometry was far more difficult to grasp and the function theory had
far more affinity with partial differential operators of first order. It thus
grew as a hybrid subject combining deep characteristics of differential geometry
and differential equations. Many of the fundamental structures were defined in
the last three decades. Current studies still concentrate on understanding these
basic mathematical forms.
