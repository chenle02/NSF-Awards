About twenty investigative lessons are being developed for display on a
Videoshow unit from General Parametrics Corporation, which will help build a
model curriculum for lower division, introductory biology courses. Emphasis for
the lecture packages will be placed on visually clear examples of experimental
sequences, flow charts, and data that add dimension to a student's understanding
of scientific processes. Analytical skills will be enhanced by numerous examples
of experimental data presented first in raw form then displayed in a graphic or
statistical manner that changes numbers into information. The strong visual
support for these difficult concepts will help an under represented general
student population understand scientific methodology. Unique features of
Videoshow that contribute to the overall quality of the lecture products are its
programmability, adaptability, ease of use, random access features, and quality
of images. The addition of slide, print, and transparency makers to the system
will increase versatility. Changes in student achievement will be evaluated and
compared before and after implementation of the new program with results being
reported both locally and nationally.
