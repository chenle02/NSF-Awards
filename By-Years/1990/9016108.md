Preliminary examination of a long model run of the NCAR CCM with idealized
geography indicates that the surface temperature field can be interpreted as an
system forced by noise in space- time. The linear system can be interpreted as
an energy-balance climate model (EBM) with diffusive horizontal heat transport
and linear radiation damping. The surface temperature field in both models has
several interesting properties. For example, the spatial correlation statistics
are essentially isotropic over distances of a few thousand km. The spatial
correlations fall off with a characteristic length of about 1500 km which agrees
with the EBM and with surface temperature data. Linear theory suggests that
climatological (=time averaged) responses to point heat sources should exhibit a
spatial pattern identical to the equal times spatial auto correlation function.
This appears to be the case in the CCM surface data. These pieces of evidence
help to explain why the EBM has been so successful in earlier studies of the
seasonal cycle and even in various paleoclimate scenarios compared to data and
GCMs. This research will study the underlying mechanisms of climate variability
and change using simple models. The PI will systematically examine the fluxes
and related meteorological fields in order to clarify the reasons for the
apparant linearity of climate fluctuation and response phenomena. This research
is important because it may give insight into how the climate system works - a
pre-requisite for more credible predictions of future climates.
