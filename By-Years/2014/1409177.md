Modern technology enables the collection and manipulation of detailed digital
traces about online and offline social processes, at scale. Apps that run on
social media platforms, for instance, provide the opportunity to engage with
hundreds of millions of users, within an environment whose parameters for any
individual can be specified/changed in response to the behavior of others.
Technically, in such applications we often have access to so-called social
network information, which is typically not leveraged by existing strategies to
design and analyze experiments. Tools for knowledge acquisition and manipulation
in such networked systems are key. In particular, algorithmic and statistical
strategies to design and analyze experiments that leverage information about
connectivity among the components of a system of interest individuals, and can
operate at scale, will provide necessary stepping stones for tackling many
important open problems and policy questions.

This research develops an integrated research and educational program that
addresses three key problems: (1) how to remove bias from popular link-tracing
algorithms used to acquire data on networked populations; (2) how to design and
evaluate new network sampling algorithms that optimize a given objective; and
(3) how to design randomized experiments on networked populations that enable
the estimation of causal effects, rather than associative effects. It will
develop two case studies to demonstrate these tools in practice: (1) A large-
scale study of the effects of education and network capital on upward mobility,
in the United States and Europe; and (2) An empirical analysis of causal
strategies to improve of root-cause analysis of latency in distributed software
systems.
