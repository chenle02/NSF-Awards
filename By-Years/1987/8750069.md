In order to increase and modernize the Biology majors' expertise with
biochemical instrumentation, a three-step project is being undertaken: .
techniques of analytical chemistry are being introduced earlier into the Biology
curriculum; . students are being exposed to more current and sophisticated
techniques through the acquisition of a high-performance liquid chromatography
system and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometers; and . the Biochemistry
laboratory course is being converted from a survey of biochemical reactions to a
course that includes a significant exposure to modern biochemical techniques.
Biology graduates who are familiar with these additional instrumental techniques
are expected to have a deeper understanding of major issues in modern Biology
and thus to be able to compete successfully for positions in graduate and
professional programs of study and for employment opportunities.
