Title: Postdoctoral Fellow with an Interdisciplinary Approach to Law and Society

Abstract

To facilitate greater intellectual collaboration among the existing set of
socio-legal scholars at Tulane University, this project will support a
postdoctoral fellow in law and society whose research takes an interdisciplinary
approach to legal studies. The postdoctoral fellow would be embedded within the
research and scholarly community at Tulane University. The postdoctoral fellow
will receive mentoring from senior faculty, participate in an interdisciplinary
scholarly community, and mentor undergraduate student research assistants.

This project will nurture a scholar in law and society studies by fostering
close research, mentoring, and networking interactions. Interdisciplinary
scholarship in law and society takes place within several disciplines, including
law, sociology, political science, psychology, and anthropology. Thus, this
project will facilitate the intellectual development of the law and society
communities at Tulane University by expanding the university's capacity, with a
goal of drawing a diverse assembly of scholars, policy makers, and the legal
community to its base in New Orleans.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
