This project is developing an understanding of how minority communities can more
fully participate in the design and use of process, practices, and tools for
preparing and analyzing data, to open up pathways to data literacy and civic
engagement. The research team members are experts in computing, design, and
education. The project employs members of minority communities to conduct data
work for a broad portfolio of clients that have need for contextualized data
work. The project provides an educational but real-world setting to learn,
investigate and evaluate data process, practices, and tools. These efforts can
help local and national government organization develop robust and democratic
approaches to data that serve the diversity of their citizens. They also provide
an ideal means to leverage such work to develop new pathways for minority
community members to become literate with data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
approaches and methods in this project include participatory design to study and
develop data systems that extend the reach of computing to new communities and
to move from a goal of computational thinking to a more powerful notion of
computational empowerment. The project also uses ethnographic methods in
minority communities to identify needs for computational data tools that further
these communitiesâ€™ digital and civic literacy. Outcomes will include a
searchable catalog of data work tools and a framework for the design of new
tools. Through the design and deployment of different data learning pathways,
theories of communities of practice will be improved, to identify how situated
learning can be purposefully structured to move young people who are
underrepresented in computing from entry level peripheral participation with
computing to a fuller participation in both data science and civic
domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
