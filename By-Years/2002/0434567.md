With this Chemical Bonding Center (CBC) Phase I, Step II award, the Division of
Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Directorate jointly support the research of Nicola A. Spaldin,
of the University of California at Santa Barbara, who will lead a collaborative
of researchers from UCSB, the University of Houston, Ohio State University, and
Carnegie Mellon University. This CBC brings together chemists and material
scientists with the goal of using the principles of chemical bonding to achieve
the rational design of multifunctional materials. In phase I of the project, the
CBC team, with expertise in chemical synthesis, structural characterization,
thin film growth, and high level computation, will focus on polar bonding in
solids to design and synthesize polar solids exhibiting interesting electrical
and magnetic properties. The long-term goal of this CBC will be to combine the
exceptional properties of newly designed polar solids with additional
functionalities in order to rationally design and prepare "smart" materials. In
addition to the fundamental understanding and technological breakthroughs that
will result from this CBC at the interface of chemistry and materials science,
an extensive outreach program will enhance the public's appreciation of
chemistry as a major driving force in modern
innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical Bonding Centers are designed to focus
innovative collaborative efforts that address a "big problem" which will lead to
a major advance in chemistry or at the interface of chemistry and other sciences
and will have the potential to attract broad scientific and public
interest.&lt;br/&gt;
