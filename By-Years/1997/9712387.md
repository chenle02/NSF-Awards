P.I.: Delaney Proposal Number: 97-12387 Institution: University of Washington
Title: REVEL: Research and education - volcanoes, exploration, and life The
REVEL program was initiated by the University of Washington in 1996 with the
intention of involving science educators in oceanographic research. The current
proposal requests funds to support the continuation of this project during the
summer of 1997. Ten 7th to 14th grade science teachers will participate in a
cruise to study the hydrothermal vent fields on the Endeavour Segment of the
Juan de Fuca Ridge in August, 1997. The costs of the cruise are being paid by
the University of Washington and the American Museum of Natural History, with
funds for teacher participation requested in this proposal.
