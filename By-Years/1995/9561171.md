This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design an
adaptive critic based controller for use in optimizing control of complex large-
scale, multi-goal systems which exhibit nonlinear dynamics. Currently
implemented Adaptive Critic controllers often work well on small-scale problems,
but convergence is slow on complex large-scale problems. In addition, the need
to optimize performance with competing goals makes learning and convergence of
adaptive critic controllers difficult. Phase I will demonstrate this adaptive
critic controller on a typical but challenging problem: optimization of auto
driving characteristics over a standard driving cycle. The controller will
optimize throttle control, acceleration, deceleration, and braking so as to
minimize energy expenditure over the course while also traversing the cycle in a
minimum time span. This is similar to a long-haul truck driver searching for an
optimal sequence of gas pedal and brake controls to go from New York to Los
Angeles in minimum time and burning minimum fuel (and traveling through hills
and mountains in between). Commercial applications of adaptive critic
controllers of this kind are expected semiconductor manufacturing and flight
control as well as in the automotive control problem.
