The rapid development of a myriad of networked devices for computing and
telecommunications presents challenging and exciting new issues for coding.
Communication system designers always have to deal with trade-offs among
reliability, efficient use of available bandwidth, data throughput and cost.
Error-correction coding is one of the most powerful tools available to address
these trade-offs. A small improvement in error-correction can yield large
savings in the overall cost of systems. Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes
promise to be the ultimate answer to the questions of coding specialists.
Although a great amount of research has gone into LDPC codes, the investigators
believe that the potency of LDPC codes in resolving many practically relevant
coding issues such as rate-compatible coding, improved decoding and coding for
error detection has yet to be discovered. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today,
theoretical limits on rates at which reliable transmission or storage of data is
possible are known for many&lt;br/&gt;telecommunications challenges. Today's and
tomorrow's challenges are to employ LDPC codes in networked, distributed
computing and communications applications. This work first investigates finite
and infinite length punctured LDPC codes over MBIOS channels. Bounds on the
performance degradation of punctured LDPC ensembles as a function of puncturing
fraction are derived. Using which, the investigators plan to arrive at criteria
for good puncturing patterns and degree distributions. Then, the research
expands on improved decoding algorithms that&lt;br/&gt;outperform standard
iterative decoding by orders of magnitude over MBIOS channels. The intention is
to derive conditions on the choice of guessed bits and bounds (on the number of
them) for the improved decoding to successfully complete decoding. Finally, the
research investigates the error detection capability of LDPC codes and analyzes
the tradeoff between computational complexity and average performance of
ensembles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
