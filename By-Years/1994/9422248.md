9422248 Telionis During many flood events flood waters, overtop levees and flood
control water works fail, sometimes leading to catastrophic results. Inflatable
dams could be a more effective option for the protection of specific structures
and facilities. This project will study the behavior of these dams subjected to
a parallel or an oblique flow of water on one side of the dam, to the effect of
impacts from debris, and of various levels of flood waters. Experimental,
analytical and numerical methods will be used to better understand the
hydroelasticity and fluid mechanics of inflatable dams under flood conditions.
The mitigation measures resulting from this study will benefit many flood- prone
regions in the country. ***
