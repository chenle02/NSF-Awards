&lt;br/&gt;This application seeks support for a basic research symposium
designed to stimulate a thorough discussion of areas of controversy in the field
of vestibular physiology and related movement control. Over the course of 2 and
1/2 days, there will be six workshops concerning active research areas. We will
bring together scientists interested in psychophysics, systems level
neuroscience, and cellular and molecular mechanisms to facilitate discussions
that incorporate a broad perspective. This format will provide basic information
to the field at large, help resolve issues by direct confrontation of scientists
with disparate views and inform younger investigators about the important issues
in the field that they are entering. Indeed, the principal objective of this
grant is to generate funds so that junior investigators and women and minority
participants who are making exciting contributions to the field but who have
limited travel funds may attend the meeting. An airing of the issues raised in
this symposium will ultimately guide the clinical application of our knowledge
in persons with balance and orientation problems, as well as a variety of
motion-induced visual disorders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
