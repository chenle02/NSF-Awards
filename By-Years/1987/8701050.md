This research program is concerned with the development of mathematical and
numerical techniques for the kinetic equations and nonlinear boltzmann type
equations governing transport phenomena. Application areas of the research
results include heat transport in cooperative media, thermonuclear plasma,
rarefied gas dynamics, neutron transport, transport of electron swarms and of
muonic atoms, etc.
