This REU Site activity directly addressed the challenge of increasing the
enrollment of women and minorities in engineering graduate study. The key
aspects of this program are: 1) the active recruitment of minorities and women
by visiting carefully selected "target" schools, and 2) a student oriented
research program that contains social as well as instructional aspects designed
for successful integration of the participants into an exciting research
environment. Ten faculty members have volunteered to support recruitment,
instruction, and research supervision. The projects offered span a wide range of
research, from plant tissue culture, to thermodynamics held together by common
chemical engineering principles. REU participants will be matched with projects
prior to selection to maximize mutual interests and capabilities. The
participants will enroll in a three credit undergraduate research course during
the 1990 summer semester. An instructional program at the beginning of the
program has been designed to give the students a quick start on research. To
stress the importance of communication, an introductory final and oral
presentation, as well as a final written report will be required of each
student.
