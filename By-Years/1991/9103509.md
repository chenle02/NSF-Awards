This award will provide half of the funds needed for the acquisition of an
electron microprobe. This new electron microscope will primarily serve the needs
of the Geology faculty and graduate students in the Department of Geological
Sciences at The University of Indiana. The University of Indiana is committed to
provide the additional funds to make this acquisition possible. Seven Geology
Department faculty and their students have been identified as primary users. Six
other faculty expect to be less frequent or occasional users. This large group
of faculty and their students pursue research in diverse areas (e.g.
thermodynamic links between mechanical and chemical processes in metamorphism,
origin of various types of volcanic and igneous rocks,provenance of terrestrial
and lunar sediments, crystal chemistry and banding of agate). This new
microprobe will replace a 19-year old instrument,and will now make it possible
to do elemental micro- analyses with greater accuracy and precision. In addition
to the use of this instrument to analyze minerals and rocks, wide use by
materials science researchers on the campus and in the community is expected.
