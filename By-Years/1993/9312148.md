9312148 Van Altena This award will fund the construction of a Speckle
Interferometer and station it at the Cesco Observatory of the Yale Southern
Observatory and the University of San Juan at El Leoncito, Argentina. The
purpose of this instrument is to rectify the large imbalance in the hemispheric
distribution of modern observations of close visual binaries. The new
observations, in combination with those from the pioneering work of Finsen, will
lead to a significant improvement in the knowledge of the lower part of the mass
luminosity relation. Improved masses can provide needed constraints to stellar
structure and evolution calculations and their comparison with observations. ***
