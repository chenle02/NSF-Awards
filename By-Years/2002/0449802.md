The addition of the University of Florida to the Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Engineering Logistics and Distribution presents a plan to
broaden the research and industry-member base of the Center. The Center
currently contains four academic partners focusing their collective research
efforts on value-adding, sustaining, and recovering processing in logistics and
distribution management. The University of Florida's participation will be by
researchers currently associated with the Supply Chain and Logistics Engineering
Center, a multi-disciplinary research center that focuses on large-scale supply
chain and logistics optimization problems.
