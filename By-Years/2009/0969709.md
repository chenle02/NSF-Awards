This award supports a program of research aimed at the development of new
computer software that will allow researchers simulating the evolution and
merger of astronomical systems containing two black holes to identify and
characterize the gravitational waves produced in the simulations. Gravitational
waves produced in the last moments of binary black hole evolutions are expected
to be an important signal for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave
Observatory (LIGO). Searches of LIGO data for signals of this type can be made
more sensitive if more is known about the waveforms to be expected. The proposed
software will use the technique of Cauchy-characteristic wave extraction, a
method that can analyze the waveforms infinitely far from the source (in effect
where LIGO would be). Standard methods could introduce inaccuracies into the
extracted waveforms because they require measurement much closer to the source.
The developed software will be made available to the broader research community
as a module of the Cactus framework. Undergraduates will be supported by this
award. The science and methods of this project will form the basis of public
lectures by the PI.
