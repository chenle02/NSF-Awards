A New Prefabricated Cage System in Concrete Members: Small Grant for Exploratory
Research, CMS project 0355321&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Halil Sezen, Ohio
State&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new reinforcement system, Prefabricated Cage System
(PCS) is proposed to perform the functions of &lt;br/&gt;both longitudinal and
transverse reinforcement in reinforced concrete (RC) beams and columns. This
proposal includes experimental and analytical research to investigate the
confinement and axial-load carrying capacity of the PCS. 20 specimens will be
tested to better understand the confinement and axial behavior of PCS system.
The specimens including concrete-filled steel tube, RC and PCS columns will be
tested, and the results will be compared. As a result, a concrete confinement
model will be developed for the proposed PCS. Based on test results,
effectiveness of the proposed new system will be investigated. The proposed
reinforcement system will directly impact seismic design practice by eliminating
some potential failure modes in RC, and by providing larger strength and
displacement ductility. &lt;br/&gt;
