This starter grant award to the University of Delaware supports the research of
Professor Eugene G. Mueller. The research is an investigation of the mechanism
and structure of the enzyme myo-inositol oxygenase, whose catalytic function
arises from a non-heme iron in a protein environment. Techniques employed
include nuclear magnetic resonance and Moessbauer spectroscopies; rapid freeze
quench methods; site-directed mutagenesis; and steady-state and rapid kinetic
studies including substrate analogs, inhibitors, and the determination of
isotope effects. In addition to the novel chemistry to emerge from these
studies, the enzyme myo-inositol oxygenase is of physiological interest.
Diabetic animals show a marked decrease in its acitivity, and inhibition of the
enzyme leads to rapid kidney failure. Inositol phosphates play a key role in
cellular signaling, errors in which mediate oncogenesis. Thus, non-heme, iron-
containing enzymes are vital in life-sustaining biological processes.
