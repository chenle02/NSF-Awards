The research proposed here is to develop a molecular theory for aqueous
solvation of macromolecules. Specifically, Dr. Ichiye is interested in the
solvation of entire folded proteins, not just subunits or homopolymers. The most
straightforward approach to the solvation of macromolecules would appear to be
via computer simulations, such as molecular dynamics simulations, in which all
the solute and solvent molecules are modeled. However, when the size or number
of macromolecules increases, this becomes impractical because of the large
number of solvent molecules needed for sufficient layers of solvation,
especially when there are long-ranged Coulombic forces. Rather than explicitly
simulating all of the solvent molecules, Dr. Ichiye proposes to develop analytic
theories of solvation which include the molecular nature of the solvent. This
approach involves integral equation theories which predict the molecular
structure of liquids given the same intermolecular potentials as used in
computer simulations.
