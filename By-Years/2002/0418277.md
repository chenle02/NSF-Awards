This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will
develop a Dynamic Torsional Knee Ankle Foot Orthosis (DTKAFO) for the treatment
of Metatarsus Adductus/Varus (MTA), Internal Tibial Torsion (ITT) and Talipes
Equinovarus (TEV). The DTKAFO offers an easy-to-use brace that combines the
manipulation aspects of physical therapy, the positioning of serial casting and
the compliance benefits of thermoplastic bracing. The design of the DTKAFO will
be finalized via prototype development and with close input from orthopedic
surgeons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will
be in the area of orthopedics for treatment of congenital foot deformities in
children.
