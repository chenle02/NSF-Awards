Inactivation of Bacillus Spores Using Antimicrobial
Peptides&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Bacterial spores are
the most resistant life forms known, whose dormancy and resistance are
attributed to their nanoscale multi-compartmental structure and morphology. The
inner cell membrane encapsulating the DNA and other cellular contents is
protected from the external environment by nearly 100 nm barrier of a polymer
layer and protein coat. Spores such as Bacillus anthracis are especially
problematic, because they have been used as bioterrorism agents and their
potential for future abuse remains. In addition to being very difficult to
inactivate, Bacillus spores are easily spread through the environment and can
readily contaminate a large area from a single source.&lt;br/&gt;Although spores
are not infective, with proper stimuli, the spores transform from their dormant
state to a virulent pathogenic state via a multi&amp;#8722;step process of which
germination is the first. According to current understanding of spore
inactivation, it is believed that germination must occur before spores can be
killed by anti-sporal agents, with a few exceptions such as dodecylamine (DDA),
although the mechanism of the deactivation is not understood. Currently, there
are no adequate methods for spore inactivation that will work in all
environments. For example, while bleach and water are commonly used for spore
inactivation, their effectiveness is greatly reduced by the presence of organic
materials, meaning that this technique is much more effective in the laboratory
than it would be in a field environment. For the first time, we have
demonstrated in preliminary experiments that a naturally occurring antimicrobial
peptide&lt;br/&gt;can inactivate Bacillus spores, and this occurs even in the
absence of a chemical germinant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work are due to the societal need
for new methods of spore deactivation, as well as, the potential to train
students and affect outreach to K-12 teachers. This work has a clear societal
benefit since there are currently no effective methods for spore detection and
inactivation that will work for different types of surfaces and under
environmentally-relevant conditions, such as in the presence of organic matter.
