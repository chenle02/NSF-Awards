A common mechanism by which internal gravity waves are generated in nature is
flow over topography. The goal of the proposed work is to improve our
theoretical understanding of this generation mechanism with particular emphasis
on three-dimensional nonlinear disturbances. To this end, an asymptotic theory
will be developed to describe the generation of finite-amplitude disturbances by
nearly uniformly stratified flow over three-dimensional topography that is more
elongated in the spanwise than in the streamwise direction. The proposed theory
makes it possible to explore certain features of fully nonlinear waves --- for
instance, how wave breaking is influenced by three-dimensional effects --- that,
although of primary geophysical interest, so far have defied theoretical
treatment. Moreover, the mathematical approach taken here is distinct from prior
studies and promises to advance our understanding of nonlinear internal wave
propagation from a mathematical standpoint as well.

Internal gravity waves are common features in oceans, lakes and in the
atmosphere. They owe their existence to the density stratification present in
these natural fluid bodies due to variations in temperature and changes in the
salinity (in the case of oceans) and pressure (in the case of the atmosphere).
Geophysical internal waves are known to possess enormous scales, on the order of
kilometers to hundreds of kilometers, so it is not surprising that they are
important factors in determining local weather patterns and climate dynamics.
The proposed work will provide a mathematical description of the generation of
internal waves by flow over topography, modeling the action of wind over
mountain ranges in the atmosphere or the flow of currents over a sill in the
ocean bottom. Emphasis is placed on particular flow conditions under which
internal- wave generation is most violent and is expected to play an important
part in geophysical applications (e.g., the development of thunderstorms).
