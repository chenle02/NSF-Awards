The Mesozoic history of the Alpine Middle East can be divided on the basis of
the recognition of two distinct oceanic tracts that have evolved somewhat
interdependently. The older Paleotethyan tract originally separated Laurasia
from the Gondwana supercontinent but was closed when a microcontinent separated
from Gondwana and moved towards Laurasia, causing the opening of the Neotethyan
tract. Recent work in Turkey has shown the presence of remnants of well-
preserved segments of both the Paleo- and Neo- Tethyan ocean basins. This
project will study a suite of ophiolites in Turkey believed to represent ocean
floor of these two ocean basins, and will address aspects of their origin and
emplacement histories. Results bear directly ont he quite complex but overall
convergent tectonics of the Mediterranean - Middle East region.
