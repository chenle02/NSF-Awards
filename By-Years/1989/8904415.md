This project is a theoretical study to improve the estimation of earthquake
hypocenter errors. The focus is on finding a practical way to do multi-
hypocenter error estimation. The research will extend previous 2-event methods
to many events, and evaluate non-parametric methods. The new techniques
developed will be applied to three earthquake data sets: aftershocks of the June
10, 1987, southeast Illinois earthquake, seismicity in the area of the rupture
zone of the 1984 Morgan Hill, California, earthquake, and seismicity in the Garm
region of the USSR. Earthquake hypocenter locations, and their uncertainties,
are directly applicable to our ability to delineate active fault surfaces and
therefore the research is important to the goals of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program.
