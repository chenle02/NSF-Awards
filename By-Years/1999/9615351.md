Key contributors to research and education networking are being invited to
participate in this strategic workshop. This will be the third in a series and
will build on the FARNET/NTTF joint meeting on April 15 and16 in Washington, DC
as well as the Monterey workshop on the NII and Higher Education in Sept. 1995.
The earlier meetings convened members of leading higher education, research and
supporting organizations to better understand the needs and requirements of
higher education for advanced networking. The participants at the Monterey
conference in September of 1995, were in general agreement that 1) the
requirements for communications for tomorrow1s university are not clearly
articulated and 2) leadership, and perhaps services exclusively from the private
sector are not likely to provide the solution. These conclusions spawned a
number activities addressing both issues. A number of draft strategy documents
addressing the fulfillment of those needs and requirements were presented at the
April 15-16 Washington, DC meeting. Our objectives at the Colorado Springs-
Cheyenne Mountain Resort workshop will be to further develop and evaluate those
models, discuss and evaluate critical technical issues, and discuss alliances
and organizational structure to implement the strategy.
