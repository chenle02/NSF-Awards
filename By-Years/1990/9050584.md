The Department of Chemistry will acquire a CO2 laser, a UV-VIS
spectrophotometer, a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer and a graphics
workstation for use in the undergraduate laboratories. The focus of the project
is an advanced elective, project-oriented laboratory to follow the required
three-semester laboratory sequence for undergraduate chemistry majors at MIT.
Students enrolled in this course will concentrate on one or two specific topics
from a menu of available choices; they will be expected to devise their own
experimental protocols, prepare detailed proposals before starting laboratory
work, and present their results in the form of written reports and oral
seminars, all under the guidance of faculty mentors and experienced teaching
assistants. Projects are planned to appeal to a wide variety of student
interests, including laser photochemistry and spectroscopy, protein chemistry,
trace analysis of environmental contaminants, microelectrochemical devices, and
advanced computational chemistry. Provisions will be made for disseminating the
results of these projects to other interested chemistry departments.
