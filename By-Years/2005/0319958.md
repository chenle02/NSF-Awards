Plastid transformation is inefficient in the model plant species Arabidopsis
thaliana. Proposed research will test the hypothesis that inefficient plastid
transformation in Arabidopsis is due to the inefficiency of the plastid's
homologous recombination machinery to incorporate foreign DNA. Increased
transformation efficiency by a system independent of homologous recombination,
utilizing the phiC31 phage integrase (INT), will test this hypothesis. Plastid
transformation by INT will depend on the availability of a recipient line in
which an attB site has been incorporated in the plastid genome. Plastid
transformation will involve insertion of an attP vector into the attB site by a
nuclear-encoded, plastid-targeted INT. Cells with transformed plastid genomes
will be selected by kanamycin or spectinomycin resistance carried in the attP
plastid vector. Transformation of the Arabidopsis plastid genome on a routine
basis will allow plastid transgene-based genetic screens for factors mediating
communication and molecular interactions between the nuclear and organellar
compartments. Methods developed for Arabidopsis are likely to be applicable to
oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and vegetable brassicas (broccoli, cauliflower and
cabbage; Brassica oleracea), species related to Arabidopsis with significant
gene-flow problems in North America. Since plastids are not transmitted by
pollen in Brassicaceae, the methods developed in Arabidopsis may also find
agricultural applications to control transgene flow in the field.
