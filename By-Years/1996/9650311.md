Mayville State University is a small university serving a rural area. Thirty-
four percent of the college students impacted are preservice teachers. The
request is for computer workstations and probes for use primarily in
laboratories associated with an interdisciplinary general education science
course. In addition the equipment will be used in discipline-based science
laboratories. We want our students to be computer literate; to achieve
competency in critical thinking and problem solving skills; and to gain a
comprehensive view of the sciences. Approximately one-third of the student
population will be affected initially, and ultimately all of the student body
will benefit from the improved technology. Program results will be disseminated
on the internet and in articles for two publications. Workshops will be held for
area high school teachers and students to demonstrate the potential of
multimedia in the classroom. A survey instrument will be completed by the
students to evaluate the effectiveness of this project.
