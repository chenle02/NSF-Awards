This proposal is funded to survey and core high accumulation Holocene sediments
along the margin of Columbia and Peru in the northeastern tropical Pacific. This
should allow for a high-resolution reconstruction of sea surface temperatures
and salinity by using the oxygen isotopic composition and Mg/Ca ratios of
planktonic foraminifera, and continental climate proxies such as clay
mineralogy. By doing the proposed work a number of unresolved questions about
ENSO-type variability may be answered.
