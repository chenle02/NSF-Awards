The contractor will conduct surveys of those industrial employers which hire
scientists, engineers, and technicians to obtain information on current labor
market conditions. All necessary steps connected with collecting, processing,
and analyzing data will be handled by the contractor with approval from the
National Science Foundation (NSF). This contract will use a panel designed to
provide nationally representative data by major industry groups. NSF is required
by law to provide a central clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation,
and analysis of data on scientific and engineering resources and to provide a
source of information for policy formulation by other agencies of the Federal
Government. NSF sponsors the conduct of this survey to meet the needs of
policymakers for understanding current labor market conditions (such as
scientific and technical subfields in short supply).
