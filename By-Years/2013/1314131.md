This award supports ongoing research by the Center for High Energy Physics
Research and Education Outreach (CHEPREO) at Florida International University on
the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland.
Scientific contributions include the study of final states with Z bosons and
searches for evidence of Supersymmetry. Technical contributions include
maintenance and operations of the Hadron Calorimetry for the CMS detector, and
grid computing for CMS physics utilizing the CHEPREO Tier-3 computing facility.
The broader impacts of the program are substantial, from the development of
innovative approaches to undergraduate physics instruction at FIU, to the
continuing development of a research and education community that includes high
school teachers and students in the southern Florida region.
