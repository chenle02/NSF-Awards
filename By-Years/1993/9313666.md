Medical ultrasound works by illuminating the body's interior with short, high
frequency sound pulses, receiving the echoes, processing them numerically, and
displaying the moving image in real-time on a CTR screen. The heart of
ultrasound is a rather sophisticated composite transducer. With this
sophistication, conventional design methods are approaching practical limits of
effectiveness. Comprehensive computer modeling is seen as the answer. The
industry is currently using frequency-domain finite element codes exclusively,
with limited success due in part to the transient character of the signals
modeled. A much better alternative is explicit time-domain simulation. In our
Phase I project we developed and validated such a time-domain finite element
code, FLEX, for transient analysis of piezoelectric transducers and general wave
propagation. It includes complete and operational piezoelectric, acoustic, and
elastic elements. the Proposed Phase II project will extend and tailor the code
to the very special needs of practicing design engineers. This research and
development is essential if we are to achieve the technical and marketing
potential of this computer modeling system during the present window of
opportunity. We are working with ultrasound companies in order to guide these
usage enhancements.
