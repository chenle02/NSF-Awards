9301554 Silver This award will support a study of fluid flow through accreted
sediments of the Costa Rica margin, the southern extension of the Middle America
Trench. Fluid flow along other accretionary margins has been shown to be
extremely important in controlling mechanical and chemical characteristics of
such margins. The Costa Rica margin differs from other trench environments in
having a low input of pelagic sediment on the underthrusting ocean plate and a
low input of continental derived sediments. Underthrusting of the oceanic plate
is high relative to other trenches and it therefore represents an endmember of
trench environments. The objectives of the project are to locate sites of fluid
venting, to sample the fluids and relate them to structural features of the
margin, and to determine the heat-flow along the margin and its relation to
fluid flow. In addition to examining the basic fluid low system on this margin,
data from this project will be used for siting future drill holes in the region.
The project is a cooperative study between scientists at the University of
California at Santa Cruz, the University of California at San Diego, and
Columbia University. The field program will be undertaken from the research
submersible Alvin. ***
