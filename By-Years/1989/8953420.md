The Franklin Institute Science Museum will develop, install and evaluate a
museum-wide Interactive Computer Information System (ICIS) designed to enhance
visitors' exhibit learning through museum-wide visitor information access and
connectivity. ICIS will provide educational experiences for 1.2 million people
per year, tailoring its information presentations to individual visitor needs
and levels of knowledge. Exhibit based units will add advanced presentation
functions beyond the usual graphics and text labels. ICIS will include 67
touchscreen-operated computer stations and six min- computers linking 27 exhibit
areas in The Franklin Institute. This project is a collaboration between The
Franklin Institute and the Unisys Corporation, which will provide over a five
year period systems engineering, hardware, installation, maintenance and
training of museum personnel valued at $2.4 million. An extensive evaluation
plan will include studies of visitor-computer interaction, the economics and
management of system maintenance, collaboration between museum and corporation
and effectiveness of computer-based exhibit interpretation techniques. Project
results will be disseminated through conference presentations, seminars and
published articles.
