9417258 Bonner Russell Sage College requests support from NSF for connection of
its Sagenet Consortium Network to NYSERnet. NYSERnet is the midlevel network
located in the state of New York. Sagenet is composed of Russell Sage College of
Troy, Sage Junior College of Albany, Sage Evening College, and Sage Graduate
School. NYSERnet will provide operations management and information services and
it will give Russell Sage College a 56 thousand bits per second connection to
the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to
access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able
to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
