It is proposed to measure the electric dipole moment (edm) of the cesium atom
and thereby measure the edm of the electron. The existence of an edm for the
electron would imply a violation of time-reversal invariance. The basic
principle of the experiment is to spin polarize the ground state of cesium and
to search for a precession of that polarization in an applied electric field.
High polarizations and relatively long lifetimes can be obtained using optical
pumping techniques and well designed cells. With precision polarization
analyzing techniques, it is possible to observe very small precessions. In the
present experiment an electron edm of about 10 (E-25) e-cm should be detectable.
These results will place interesting constraints on super-symmetric gauge
theories and other new unified models.
