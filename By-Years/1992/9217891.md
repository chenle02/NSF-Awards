It is now possible to detect and study radio emission from the coronae of stars
by using the improved sensitivity of the VLA. The PI is exploiting this
capability to survey a variety of stars which are known or expected to have
coronae. These include weak-lined T Tau stars, dMe flare stars, RS CVn binaries,
stars in the . Persei cluster, the rapidly rotating K dwarf AB Dor, etc. The
goal is to understand the structure and underlying physical processes of the
coronae.
