MICHENER Extensive flooding resulting from tropical storm Alberto moved into
southwestern Georgia and maintained a relatively stationary position producing
extreme precipitation and extensive flooding. Over 53 cm of rain were recorded
in portions of the Flint River drainage basin, and flooding has been
characterized as a 500-year event for this catchment. The large-scale and high-
intensity floods have provided an opportunity to initiate a number of studies on
the effects of flooding on longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and wiregrass
(Aristida stricta) ecosystems. Research is to be carried out on tree mortality
and regeneration, stream geomorphology within riparian zones, mortality and
recruitment of wiregrass, landscape-scale geomorphic responses, and patch
structure relative to landscape position. Remote sensing techniques and ground-
based surveys will be used to assess the impacts of disturbance on these
ecosystems and to initiate studies addressing recovery in these disturbed
environments. This research is important because of the severity and rarity of
the event, and the information base to which this occurrence can be compared.
These ecosystems have generally been viewed as susceptible to disturbance by
fire, but the roles of flooding and extreme precipitation have not been
researched. This project begins a timely study of flood and precipitation
disturbance in these economically important ecosystems. ??
