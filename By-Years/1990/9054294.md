Two one week workshops, for twenty social scientists each, are being conducted.
The workshops are covering techniques of exploratory data analysis using a
statistical package particularly suited for graphical forms of data analysis,
"Stata." Participants are developing skills in using and teaching robust
statistics, analytical graphics and data transformations. Exploratory data
analytic techniques, such as data smoothing, median polishing, re- scaling and
transforming data using the ladder of powers, five number summaries, box and
whisker plots, and stem and leaf charts, are emphasized. The workshops also
illustrate pedagogical methods for teaching EDA techniques at the undergraduate
level and establish a professional network of EDA-oriented faculty. The
significance of the project to undergraduate faculty and students lies in the
use of exploratory data analysis techniques as interesting and useful
alternatives to traditional confirmatory statistics.
