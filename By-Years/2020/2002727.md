This project supports a March 2020 conference, Women of Color in STEM
Entrepreneurship Conference. The conference focuses on both underrepresented
adults and girls of color from Hawaii, Alaska, Saipan and Guam. Arizona State
will participate in a 5-day, residential camp at Kohala Institute.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contribution to the field will include: capturing the
views of women and girls of color regarding the design of inclusive culturally
responsive practices in computing, and enabling inter-generational perspectives
to inform theory and practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
