The purpose of this ROW grant is to carry out Rb/Sr and stable isotopic analyses
of migmatites from the Colorado front range to understand isotopic mobility
during partial melting of crustal rocks. Preliminary Rb/Sr isotope analysis of
leucosomes and adjacent selvages and paleosomes of these rocks have indicated
that the leucosome size is a factor in the extent of isotope migration and
resetting of the Rb/Sr age, however considerable ambiguity exists about other
factors including fluid interactions that may affect the mobility and effective
volume of homogenization of the Rb/Sr systems. This study will focus on an
outcrop having widely variable sizes of leucosomes. Results may help understand
the geologic meaning of Rb/Sr data, now considerably out of favor as an age
dating tool.
