A Radio Telescope for Advanced Astronomy Laboratory A radio telescope antenna is
being equipped with a receiver capable of detecting the 21-cm emission from
galactic neutral hydrogen. A existing 10 foot paraboloid antenna formerly used
for satellite communication at l.3-cm is used for the antenna. Using a modern
receiver and low noise preamplifier, this antenna is able to detect and map the
21-cm line emission from the Milky Way disc to trace the rotation curve of the
galaxy, and to measure the overall mass and distribution of the interstellar
gas. This telescope is incorporated into undergraduate laboratories to give
students experience with radio spectroscopy and microwave equipment and
techniques. In addition, a new course, Advanced Astronomy Laboratory, uses the
telescope to give students the opportunity to do observational projects related
to senior level astrophysics. The radio telescope provides the tools needed for
such projects.
