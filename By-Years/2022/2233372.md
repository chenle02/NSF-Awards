The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will address the need for an accessible method
to identify early-stage epithelial cancers, with high accuracy, earlier and at
lower cost than is currently available. In 2020, the total cost of cancer care
was nearly $210 billion. Due to the nature of current cancer diagnostics, most
cancers are diagnosed and treated during late-stages. This results in a large
economic burden to patients, families, healthcare providers, and facilities. To
advance the health and welfare of the public and reduce the nationâ€™s healthcare
burden, there is a need for cancer screening, diagnostic, and monitoring devices
that are non-invasive, cost-effective, easy-to-use, and accurate. The proposed
platform for the early detection of multiple types of epithelial cancers 1)
addresses the lack of effective non-invasive portable screening devices; 2)
provides faster, more discriminatory assessments in near real-time; 3) yields
the most precise and accurate results to identify cancers earlier, when
interventions are more impactful, less expensive, less invasive, and more likely
to improve patient outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to establish the feasibility of developing
the first portable, programmable, single cell cytology platform for early
detection of multiple types of epithelial cancers, suitable for use at the
point-of-care. The proposed technology will uniquely combine microfluidics and
artificial intelligence (AI) to act as a sensor and provide predictive analysis,
allowing for the accurate classification of potentially cancerous tissue. The
platform will support near real-time, multiparameter, single-cell cytology
measurements and will provide a method for automated analysis of a plurality of
key metrics. Proof of concept has been established for the application area of
oral cavity cancers, with the approach demonstrating superior performance
metrics compared to other diagnostics (tissue reflectance, tissue auto
fluorescence, salivary testing, and cytology testing). It is the only adjunct
that can distinguish between mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia. The key
objectives for this project are to develop methodologies to link different
clinical specimen types to the microfluidics environment, and a biomarker
discovery process to identify biomarkers for different applications that are
amenable to the platform. The successful completion of this project will enable
the platform to recognize and assess various levels of dysplasia across multiple
epithelial cancer types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
