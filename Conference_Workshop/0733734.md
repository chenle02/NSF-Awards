Statisticians play an indispensable role in the analysis of biomedical,
environmental and public health data, from the study design stage all the way
through to final analysis and report-writing. Scholarly conferences where new
ideas can be exchanged are important for statistical science to move forward.
International meetings, while of course rarer due to their size and expense, are
particularly beneficial since they permit exposure to ideas and colleagues the
attendee might not ordinary see or even read about in the familiar journals of
one's own country. The benefit of and need for attendance at such meetings by
junior statistical researchers is particularly great, since they contribute
mightily to their professional development and help level the playing field with
more established senior investigators. This grant will provide support for the
Third International Joint Meeting of the IMS (Institute of Mathematical
Statistics) and ISBA (the International Society for Bayesian Analysis), to be
held in Bormio, Italy on Wednesday, January 9 to Friday, January 11, 2008. A
central theme of the conference will be Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and
related methods and applications ranging from finance to technology, with
specific focus on challenging problems in biostatistics. All grant funds will be
used to support the travel expenses of junior biostatistical investigators,
i.e., persons pursuing a PhD or DrPH in statistics, biostatistics, or a closely
related field, or who have received such a degree within the five years
preceding the conference.
