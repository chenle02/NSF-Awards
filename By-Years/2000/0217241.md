Rice is one of the most important crops in the world, and the main source of
food for nearly half of the world's population. Rice research can be applied the
other major cereals, such as wheat and&lt;br/&gt;maize, and many aspects of rice
genomics can be transferred to the many minor economic grass species that have
themselves not warranted extensive research and breeding. Drafts of the rice
genome have been recently published, and current estimates indicate that 60,000
genes&lt;br/&gt;are present in rice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plan is to
construct a structural and functional model for every protein encoded by the
rice genome using methods developed at the University of Washington. The project
will further the understanding and elucidation of the function of characterized
as well as novel proteins, identify those proteins that improve yield and confer
disease and pest resistance, and enable genetic engineering of rice crops with
beneficial traits not naturally found in rice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research, involving the collaborative efforts of scientists from all over the
world, will provide opportunities for the training of undergraduate and graduate
students, and post-doctoral fellows. All the information generated by the
research will be generated through a web server and database:
http://bioverse.compbio.washington.edu, which will provide a synergistic portal
to obtain a comprehensive picture of rice and cereal organismal biology. Besides
helping understand how other plant genomes work, this research will also set up
a framework&lt;br/&gt;for integrating single molecule and genomic data, and thus
the science developed will help with projects on analyzing other
genomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
