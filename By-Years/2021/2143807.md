Unsteady flows in natural and engineering systems, such as in the ocean and in
industrial processes, play a fundamental role in the transport and mixing of
submerged particles and chemical substances. Transport barriers organize flows
into distinct regions with large scale coherent structures, and, thus, control
the mixing of passive particles and substances. For example, transport barriers
can be exploited to predict oil spill patterns. However, less is known about how
these transport barriers affect the transport and mixing of active matter and
vice-versa. Despite evidence that aquatic organisms, such as fish schools and
phytoplankton, could affect transport in the ocean, a systematic understanding
of the interplay between activity and transport barriers is lacking. Such
understanding is crucial for controlling active matter in unsteady flows, with
the potential to impact application areas ranging from aquatic ecology to bio-
inspired designs. This award will support research to advance our knowledge of
the interplay between active matter and transport
barriers.Â &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to reveal the two-way coupling between
transport barriers and active matter, the PI will conduct experiments in
electromagnetically driven laboratory flows with light-guided brine shrimp
(Artemia salina). The research plan is structured around two aims: (1) to
determine the non-dimensional groups that are most relevant in the coupling of
active matter and large scale transport barriers, and divide the corresponding
high dimensional space spanned by the non-dimensional groups; (2) to understand
how small length scale in active matter percolate through scales to modify the
large length scale transport barriers. The results of this research will pave
the way for implementable control strategies of active matter in real-world
scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
