A combined use of a rotating screen at the bottom and an exhaust fan at the top
of a cylindrical chamber can produce tornado-like vortices through the
conservation of angular momentum. However, the existence of vertical wind shear
in a thunderstorm environment can induce horizontal vorticity which in turn
induces vertical vorticity when tilted by convective updrafts. By replacing the
rotating screen with three tiers of plexiglass guide vanes, thereby simulating
the storm-relative, vertically veering winds, the vortex chamber at the
University of Oklahoma is now capable of simulating vortices by vorticity
tilting instead of vorticity stretching. This project will allow extensive
measurements to be made in the vortex chamber and thereby examine the role of
environmental wind shear and helicity (the dot product of the vorticity vector
and velocity vector) in the simulated tornadoes.
