The research objective of this award is to introduce and explore game theoretic
models that capture how pediatric vaccine prices are negotiated in the United
States. Non-cooperative game theory and discrete optimization methodologies will
be studied to gain insights into pediatric vaccine pricing that meets the needs
of all stakeholders, and hence, facilitate a reliable stream of pediatric
vaccines. The advantage offered by such models is that pediatric vaccine prices
can be set collectively based on the entire set of vaccines required to satisfy
the childhood immunization schedule, rather than one vaccine at a time, as is
the case today. The results of this research will provide novel insights gleaned
from Bertrand oligopoly pricing models, including the existence and computation
of Nash equilibrium for weighted set cover games, and the introduction and
analysis of repeated weight set cover games. This research will also provide
conditions under which tacit collusion and the grim trigger strategy may lead to
unexpected equilibrium vaccine prices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this
research will introduce models and methodologies for setting and evaluating
pediatric vaccine prices, with the potential to lead to a more secure and
reliable pediatric vaccine supply. Such results will provide value in assessing
the current state of pediatric vaccine pricing and in evaluating future pricing
for new vaccines as they enter the market. This in turn may lead to improved
national immunization coverage rates based on a more reliable set of vaccine
sources and their impact on both economic and public health performance
measures. Moreover, through a variety of student involvement activities and
public health outreach, this research effort will enhance the educational
environment supported by NSF and fostered at the University of Illinois.
