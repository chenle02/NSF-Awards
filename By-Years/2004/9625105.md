New technologies such as multimedia, digital libraries, and electronic
publishing require large databases and powerful query languages. This project
investigates a database management system that supports a meta-query language
with which users can design their own visual query languages to specify both the
data to retrieve and the display format. Theoretical aspects of the research
address the characterization of classes of visual queries that can be evaluated
with guaranteed time-complexity by providing a careful design of the query
evaluation engine. Practical goals include the implementation of a database
management system supporting visual queries, the dissemination of results using
the WWW, and the transfer of technology. The project has a strong educational
component, seeking the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students and
the inclusion of prototypes in the classroom so as to reflect the more
interactive and visual aspects of today's computer science. Visual query
languages will be key components of the next generation of declarative database
interfaces because they take advantage of the user's visual perception to convey
information efficiently. Their successful implementation will provide database
systems with fundamental capabilities not currently available.
