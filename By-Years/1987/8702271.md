Research is in progress that follows two paradigms for parallel computation: A
reduction paradigm and a divide and conquer paradigm. The reduction paradigm
proceeds as follows: given a problem instance of size n it employs a reducing
procedure to produce a problem instance of size less than or equal to n/2, such
that the solution to the original problem can be easily deduced from the
solution to the reduced problem. Work on the reduction paradigm continues a
previously successful avenue of research carried out by the PI. Work on the
divide and conquer paradigm holds similar promise. Work done under each of these
paradigms proceeds by obtaining exact solutions from approximate solutions. The
PI is very knowledgeable and is an accomplished researcher in the area proposed.
The work proposed is very significant for the future of parallel computation and
has potential for substantial impact.
