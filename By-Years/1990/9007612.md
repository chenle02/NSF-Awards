This project considers the problem of displaying a series of views of a
polyhedral scene from the vantage point of a moving viewer, called "animating
viewer motion." The investigator has previously shown how to take advantage of
frame-to-frame coherence to animate viewer motion for the restricted case of
parallel projection, viewer rotations only, and rendering via line drawings with
hidden lines removed, resulting in the only efficient algorithm for this case.
The algorithm has been implemented and shown to be practical. Several extensions
to this work, including more sophisticated rendering, perspective projection,
and arbitrary viewer motions, will be studied.
