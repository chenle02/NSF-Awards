#9505762 COMBERIATE With the installation of a special ground station at McMurdo
Station, Antarctica, it is now possible to collect real-time ozone data from
NASA spacecraft. NASA and NSF will jointly upgrade the station software to
automatically produce ozone images every orbit as the Total Ozone Mapping
Spectrometer - Earth Probe (TOMS-EP) satellite passes overhead, and make them
available to users worldwide, via the INTERNET. Approximately $96,000 is
required for the project. NASA has provided $66,000 for the prerequisite
activities that need to be accomplished at the NASA Goddard Space Center. This
award of $30,000 will upgrade the NASA Antarctic Interactive Support Launch
Support (NAILS) system at McMurdo Station; develop, install, and test real-time
ozone image processing software on the NAILS; and provide documentation and
training for winter-over operators at McMurdo. The tasks funded by this award
will be provided by a NASA Goddard contractor and reimbursed by NSF/OPP. It is
recommended that this award be funded in FY-1995 at $30,000.
