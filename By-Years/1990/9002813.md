This proposal requests funds to help provide support for student participants at
the 1990 Northeast Regional Conference on Developmental Biology. This Conference
will be held at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts,
April 20-22, 1990. The Conference will include four platform sessions, two
poster sessions, a keynote address and ample opportunity for informal discussion
of research. There are two general goals of this Regional Meeting in bringing
together younger investigators in the field of developmental biology. The first
is to expose them to important current research in laboratories throughout the
Northeast. The second is to give them a chance to present their own work in both
formal presentation as well as informal discussions. The specific goal of this
1990 meeting is to bring together those investigators working on plant
development and those working on animal development in order to develop a common
language and appreciation of each other's work.
