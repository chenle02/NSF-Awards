One goal of information science research is the improvement of database query
languages, making them simpler to use, easierto learn, and less prone to user
error. Most non-technical endusers cannot use existing large online
bibliographic database systems without help from specially trained
intermediaries or experts in the use of the online systems, and even trained
intermediaries are not equally proficient in all of the many bibliographic
systems available. The use of artificial intelligence techniques to produce
computer assistants or intermediaries will make it possible for end users and
experts to retrieve information directly and efficiently by assisting with query
construction. The specific emphasis is on directing the user's uncontrolled
vocabulary queries toward controlled indexing vocabulary for a particular
database. A computer intermediary to assist users with query construction will
be implemented to validate this principle on the Chemical Abstracts database.
The results obtained in this study will be applicable to query construction for
information retrieval, particularly by non- technical personnel and casual
users, on a wide range of database systems.
