ABSTRACT Friesen 9322727 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
project will develop novel copolymers with an improved combination of high
permeability and high selectivity for use in making membranes for gas and vapor
separations. Typically, membranes with high permeabilities have low
selectivities, and vice versa. During Phase I, the feasibility of preparing
copolymers with an improved combination of permeability and selectivity was
successfully demonstrated. The novel substituted polyacetylene copolymers
developed in Phase I displayed the physical characteristics necessary for making
membranes and were prepared in high (>70%) yield. During Phase II, research will
focus on continuing to develop and evaluate copolymers based on monomers use in
Phase I; synthesizing and evaluating copolymers made from additional monomers;
evaluating the copolymers for industrially important separations; developing
procedures for making asymmetric hollow-fiber membranes from the copolymers; and
making and testing small hollow-fiber modules. The widespread use of membrane
systems for many separations has been limited by the performance of current
membranes. Potential commercial applications for high-permeability, high-
selectivity membranes include the production of nitrogen from air; the
production of oxygen for medical applications; the removal of carbon dioxide
from natural gas; the recovery of hydrogen from petroleum-refining process
streams; and the separation of volatile organic vapors (e.g.,
propane/propylene). Keywords: membrane, gas separation, polymer, high
