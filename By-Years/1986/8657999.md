The objective of this research is to combine constitutive equations, bifurcation
theory and finite element methods to improve our understanding of the collapse
mechanisms and unstable phenomena within soils and rocks. A better understanding
of the catastrophes and instabilities resulting from nonlinear material behavior
is of fundamental importance not only to Geotechnical Engineering, but also to
Earthquake Engineering and Structural Geology. The transition between continuous
and discrete modeling of soil and rock masses will be analyzed with the theory
of bifurcation. The emergence and growth of discontinuities within initially
continuous soil and/or rock masses will be studied by combining nonlinear
description of material behavior (including stress-dilatancy and strain-
softening) and some finite element techniques similar to the one developed in
Structural Mechanics to analyze the problems encountered in the buckling of
shells. The description of strain localization is a fundamental and necessary
step to understand not only the emergence and growth of failure surfaces within
earth slopes or beneath structures but also the formation of faults in
sedimentary deposits caused by tectonic forces.
