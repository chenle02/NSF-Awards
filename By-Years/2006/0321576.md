This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will optimize
and finalize the design and the simulation of the ultrasound-on-a-chip (UOC)
probe, and itegrate it into a portable ultrasound medical imager with high
spatial resolution and enhanced picture definition for noninvasive clinical
diagnosis of the internal lumens. The UOC probe architecture is based on
patented ultraprecision micromachining technology.

The objective is to fabricate and test the UOC probe and integrate it into a
portable cost-effective medical imaging prototype system for noninvasive real-
time high-definition volumetric medical imaging. The realization of the merits
of the ultrasound-on-a-chip based portable medical imager will open a wide
window of commercialization opportunities for medical and nonmedical
applications.
