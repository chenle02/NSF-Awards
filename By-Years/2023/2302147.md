Symmetries play a key role in various parts of science and their systematic
study in various dimensions is the subject of representation theory in
mathematics. In recent years it has become apparent that, more generally, it is
important to investigate the phenomenon that groups of symmetries themselves
possess symmetries, which leads to the notion of higher representation theory.
This project will develop this viewpoint of higher representation theory
further, with an emphasis on applications to solving open problems in the theory
of modular representations of finite groups of Lie type. The project will
provide research training opportunities for graduate students.

In more detail, this project will bring higher representations of toroidal Lie
algebras into the study of modular representations of finite groups of Lie type,
providing two-variable conjectural decomposition matrices for those groups. An
important part of the project is the development of an affinization of the
theory of two-representations of Kac-Moody algebras. A second part of the
project is based on a new degeneration of modular representations of finite
groups of Lie type. This degeneration leads to connections with Hilbert schemes
of points on surfaces and to two-variable combinatorics, which arise from
perversity properties of derived equivalences.
