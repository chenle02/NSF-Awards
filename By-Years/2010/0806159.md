Dr. Ted von Hippel (University of Texas - Austin), along with collaborators
Peter Frinchaboy (University of Wisconsin - Madison) and Kurtis Williams
(University of Texas - Austin) are awarded funds to organize and conduct the
sixth annual symposium of the National Science Foundation Astronomy and
Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship (AAPF) program. The symposium, to be held
January 6-7, 2008 in Austin, Texas, will bring together the AAPF fellows,
faculty mentors, prospective AAPF applicants, and interested members of the
astronomical community. This will allow the fellows to present their research
and educational activities, and better establish ways to enrich the fellowship
experience itself. Additionally, fellows will obtain opportunities to establish
interdisciplinary projects with colleagues during the symposium.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integration of educational activities into the
research efforts of the fellows provides for a broad impact of the fellowship
program. Many fellows participate in K-12/public outreach activities, leading to
enhancement of the public's interest in science. The symposium will allow the
fellows to share their ideas and experiences, not only among themselves, but
also with faculty mentors and with others in attendance.
