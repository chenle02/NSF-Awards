9406870 Khuller Over recent years, the Capital Area Theory Seminar has been
particularly active, hosting a talk every other week. Some of the speakers for
the seminar are local, and others are visitors to the DC area. The mailing list
has 107 entries, some of which are other mailing lists. The goal of the seminar
is to stimulate activity in theoretical computer science. In this regard, the
seminar has been relatively successful. The seminar is often attended by
researchers from Univ. of Maryland at Baltimore County, Johns Hopkins Univ. and
Georgetown University. The Workshop on Algorithmic Research in Midsouthwest
(WARM) has been sponsored by the National Science Foundation, under Grant
CCR-9104017, so that, in the last three years, researchers from Texas, Louisiana
and Oklahoma could hold biannual workshops to exchange the latest developments
in algorithmic research and related areas and provide a forum for exchange of
ideas. This grant will allow a continuation of WARM meetings twice a year in
Spring and Autumn. There will be between 4 and 6 talks each time including 1 or
2 talks from visiting leading researchers from other areas of the country. A
portion of each meeting is allocated on informal discussion. ***
