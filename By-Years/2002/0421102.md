This award is for acquisition of instrumentation to outfit a new Metabolic
Profiling Facility (MPF) at Purdue. In metabolomics, gas or liquid phase
chromatographic separation technologies (GC and LC) are coupled to mass
spectrometry (GC/MS and LC/MS) for the identification and quantification of
metabolites, and for the evaluation of metabolic fluxes in vivo using stable
isotope labeling. The MPF will provide important new capabilities to many
research programs on the Purdue campus that currently focus on these questions,
and will help to support these research programs in the future. This
instrumentation will enable Purdue students and post docs to develop methods for
sample preparation and analysis specific to their research goals. A fundamental
philosophy behind the MPF will be that students will best learn how to apply and
integrate MS into their own research by obtaining hands on experience. Thus,
graduate and undergraduate students will be given supervised access to the MPF
instruments. This experience will solidify the understanding of MS that students
have gained in the many MS-oriented courses available on the Purdue campus.
