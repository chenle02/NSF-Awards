The purpose of this conference is to have research workers in aspects of
classical analysis (e.g. function theory, operators arising in the theory of
functions, harmonic analysis, etc.) to attend to discuss and present their work.
It will have a focus on the work of X. Tolsa.

Several experts will discuss their new results which use the tools and results
of some of his material. There will be a presentation of some of his results and
the techniques he uses to establish his results. In addition to this material we
are encouraging other research workers in the areas (noted above) to come and
present their work. In particular we hope to attract newer workers (i.e. recent
Ph.Ds) to attend and give talks on their works. We will have principal (one
hour) speakers from Europe and the United States ( Nicolau, Richter, Seip and
Sundberg).
