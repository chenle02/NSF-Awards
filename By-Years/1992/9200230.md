The project is to address the area of human-computer interaction. The program
will involve bringing ten students (five men and five women) to the university
for a ten week period, with follow up in the academic year. The students will be
from Nebraska and immediately surrounding areas, with the majority from
institutions other than the host. Included in the program will be a seminar, the
actual research project, and discussion of opportunities for graduate study.
