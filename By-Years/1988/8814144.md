Professor Guido Weiss of Washington University, St. Louis, will be principal
lecturer at an NSF-CBMS Regional Conference to be held at Auburn University,
Auburn, Alabama in June of 1989. The lectures will present certain general
principles of harmonic analysis that make it easier to understand a multitude of
function spaces encountered in analysis and related areas, such as Lebesque
spaces, Lipschitz spaces, Hardy spaces, Soboler spaces, etc., as well as some
recent developments in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations.
