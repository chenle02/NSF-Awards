This mathematics research project is concerned with several problems in harmonic
analysis. A primary focus is on the problem of estimating operators that commute
with translation and rotations. It is desirable to prove effective
characterizations for the boundedness of such operators in Lebesgue spaces. Such
results and the techniques to prove them can be used to investigate regularity
properties of the solutions of classical equations in mathematical physics, such
as the wave equation, the Schroedinger equation and other dispersive equations.
Seeger and his collaborators will also study various questions about the
behavior of the Fourier transform on submanifolds of Euclidean space. Such
problems are tied to quantitative questions about eigenfunctions of differential
operators on compact manifolds. Other projects concern the regularity properties
of averaging operators, the boundedness of singular integral operators,
generalized Radon transforms, and various pointwise convergence questions
related to differentiation problems and Fourier series.

Methods and techniques from Fourier analysis have always found wide applications
in understanding physical phenomena in the natural sciences and in engineering.
The proposed investigations of the solutions of wave and Schroedinger equations,
as well as some of the projects on singular integral operators, are motivated by
questions from physics. The proposed research on generalized Radon transforms is
relevant to problems that arise in medical imaging. This research project also
has an educational component, as Seeger will direct Ph.D. students and mentor
postdoctoral researchers both in their research and in teaching. Seeger will
also continue to be involved in the organization of conferences to facilitate
interactions of researchers and students in the mathematics field of analysis.
