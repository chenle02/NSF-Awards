Abstract

Award: DMS-9970284 Principal Investigator: Lei Ni

The principal investigator propose to study the interplay between geometry and
analysis on complete Kahler manifolds. The focus will be the linear and
nonlinear analysis on complete Kahler manifolds under various curvature
conditions. The main goal is to understand the spaces of holomorphic functions
(and sections of certain holomorphic bundles) on complete Kahler manifolds under
various curvature assumptions and apply the properties of these various spaces
to the study of the geometry and topology of complete Kahler manifolds with
various curvature conditions, in particular, the uniformization of complete
Kahler manifolds with positive bisectional curvature.

The subject of the PI's investigation belongs to fields called differential
geometry and global analysis on manifolds. Differential geometry is the study of
the relationship between the geometry of a space (a manifold in the language of
differential geometry) and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global
analysis is the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of a
space by piecing together local information. Since the space is usually a curved
space, the term ``curvature'' is introduced to measure the deviation from the
Euclidean space, which is flat. Applications of these areas of mathematics in
other sciences include the structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas
boundaries, and the large scale structure of the universe. A Kahler manifold is
a complex space which has an extra structure called Kahler structure. The
geometric and analytic properties of Kahler manifolds are important to various
fields of mathematics and physics such as low dimensional topology, algebraic
geometry and superstring theory.
