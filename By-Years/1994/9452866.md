9452866 Kozma This unsolicited proposal has been prepared for submission to the
National Science Foundation's Program on Networking Infrastructure for Education
(NIE). The proposal is for a 6-month grant for SRI to engage in research and
support activities of an extremely time- sensitive nature. The proposed project
capitalizes on a unique situation and a time-limited opportunity to both
document and support nascent efforts to install an educational version of the
information superhighway that is unparalleled in the country. During this
6-month period we will (1) observe and document the rapidly changing events that
are affecting the Castro Valley Unified School District as they attempt to take
advantage of unusually rich technology opportunities while maintaining their
focus on their own educational and school restructuring goals, (2) provide
support and technical assistance to school district personnel, and (3) engage a
third party evaluator (external to SRI) to review our methods and findings on an
ongoing basis. ***
