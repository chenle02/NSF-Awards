This award supports travel, registration, and accommodation expenses for US
researchers, including students and post-doctoral scholars, to attend the 14th
Meeting of the Canadian Number Theory Association (CNTA XIV), which will be held
at the University of Calgary, Alberta Canada, on June 20-24, 2016. The
conference website is here: http://www.ucalgary.ca/cnta2016/. The CNTA meetings
are held bi-annually, and are among the largest number theory conferences world-
wide.

In addition to contributed talks, invited talks, and plenary lectures on current
research in number theory, there will be a special session honoring the many
contributions of Richard Guy, as we celebrate his 100th birthday. Topics covered
by the conference traditionally have included algebraic number theory, analytic
number theory, computational and algorithmic number theory, arithmetic geometry,
diophantine approximation, combinatorial number theory, and any other areas
related to or belonging to number theory.
