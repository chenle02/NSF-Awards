The principal investigator will conduct research at the interface of
probability theory and statistical mechanics. The emphasis will be on infinite
particle systems that model non- equilibrium processes. The questions
investigated will be concerned primarily with the rate at which the processes
converge to their equilibrium. The investigator will study some fundamental
questions about the relationships between several notions of convergence to
equilibrium for stochastic Ising models. He will also consider relationships
between rates of convergence and properties of the equilibrium measures. The
principal investigator will undertake new work on the rate of evaporation for a
stochastic model of an evaporating droplet.
