The project brings together material scientists and electrical engineers who
build synthetic 3D scaffolds with embedded electronic and optoelectronic
devices, neuroscientists who culture neural cells on the 3D scaffold to form
biological neural networks with precisely defined 3D topology and integrated
multimodal information interfaces, chemists and chemical engineers who
synthesize functional molecules for controlling the neural cell placement,
development, and activity, and computer scientists who operate the neurocomputer
prototype and extract its information-coding and processing algorithms with
machine-learning methods. The goals of the project are to contribute to the
grand challenge of reverse engineering the brain and open up new computing
paradigms based on cultured biological neural networks to propel machine
learning and artificial intelligence to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The neurocomputer prototype pursued in the project employs biological
neuronal circuits engineered into well-defined 3D topologies reminiscent of
deep-neural-network models as the information-processing units. Electronic and
optoelectronic devices will be integrated with each neural cell to administer
and monitor the neuronal and synaptic activities based on electrophysiology,
optogenetics, and neurochemistry. The fabricated neurocomputer prototype will
then be utilized to perform various learning and computing tasks such as image
recognition and space navigation. Neural code and learning algorithms will be
extracted using a combination of experiment and simulations based on spike
generation models and recurrent neural network models. The results will help
reveal how complex living neural networks function and provide a technologically
transformative approach to information-processing
machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
