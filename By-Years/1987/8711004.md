The research program will investigate the general electromagnetic problems
posed by beams scattered by stratified or periodic boundaries, with special
attention to several peculiar effects that have only recently been recognized,
namely: unexpectedly large lateral, focal and angular beam shifts, as well as
modifications of the beam waist and distortions of its intensity profile. These
non- specular phenomena are most pronounced when the incident fields couple
energy to waves guided by the scattering structure. The interactions between
beams and guided waves will therefore be explored in detail, an original
approach being used to examine the dispersive properties of the scattering
configuration in terms of its characteristic (surface, leaky, etc.) modes.
Specific pertinent questions will then be addressed, such as: the effect of the
non-specular effects, and procedures to enhance those effects. The results are
particularly relevant to engineering areas involving the control and
manipulation of well confined beam fields, with potential applications in
integrated optics, ultrasonics and microwave acoutics.
