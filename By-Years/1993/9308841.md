CTS-9308841 Drexel University Xiaowei S. He ABSTRACT Mechanical properties of
structural materials often depends on the processes occuring during
solidification. Modeling solidification is difficult because phenomena in the
mushy zone occur over many different length and time scales. The relationships
between dendritic microstructure and macroscopic transport will be investigated
with cellular automaton simulation of flow, temperature and concentration fields
at the microscopic level. Results for the microstructure model can be coupled to
macroscopic phenomena by statistical analysis. Better understanding of the
underlying processes involved during solidification should lead to less waste
and increased efficiency during production of many solid materials, making
American industry more competitive.
