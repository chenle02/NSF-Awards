Marine elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays) synthesize and retain high
concentrations of urea in their tissues for the purpose of osmoregulation.
Mammals also synthesize urea, but for the purpose of detoxifying nitrogen wastes
for disposal in the urine as urea. The enzyme catalyzing the first step of urea
biosynthesis in liver of sharks is uniquely different from the corresponding
enzyme in mammalian species, and it is also present in a few non- elasmobranch
species of fish, which is interesting, since fish generally do not make urea -
they excrete ammonia directly into the water via their gills. The product of
this reaction step is also utilized for biosynthesis of precursors needed for
genetic expression, and the formation of this compound is catalyzed by a
different but related enzyme, which in sharks is also different from the
corresponding mammalian enzyme. These differences are related to the absence of
a compound needed by most tumor tissues for nitrogen and energy, and the results
may have a bearing on the observation that sharks are resistant to cancer.
Elasmobranchs also differ significantly form other species in how they store fat
for energy and how this is made available during fasting. These enzymes and
processes will be investigated in this study and the results will provide
valuable comparative information about 1) these enzymes (the enzymes for shark
appear to be evolutionary intermediates), 2) the evolution and function of the
urea biosynthetic pathway, and 3) the enzymatic regulation of energy and of
nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism in sharks and fish, which may serve as
useful model systems for studying these processes in humans or mammalian species
in general.//
