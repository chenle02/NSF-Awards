This project is a follow up to a previous project "Climate Change Adaption in
High Latitude Rural Development Planning." The funding will enable the
researcher to use the successful methodology developed during the 2011 research
season to. The original project funded the survey of over 80 municipalities in
Sweden, Finland, and Norway using a mixed method of face to face interviews and
web-based survey. However, the web-based survey response was much lower than
anticipated and the face to face survey interviews were more productive than
anticipated. This award will allow the PI to increase the response rate and the
data gathered by completing an additional 40 interviews face-to-face from the
originally planned web-based survey.
