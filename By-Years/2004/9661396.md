*** 9661396 Zappi This project addresses selective fluorination in mild
conditions.. The objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate high
current densities and yields in selective fluorination reactions using custom
designed soluble mediators and anodically regenerated solid phase fluorinating
reagents. This will constitute a generic synthetic method for the selective
substitution of fluorine into aliphatic carbon atoms, and special attention will
be given to the applicability of the chemistry to larger scale operation. While
the applications of fluorinated drugs and specialty chemicals continue to
expand, the synthetic methods for their preparation remain limited and case-
specific. In most cases multi-step syntheses are required, and the overall
yields are poor. A unique opportunity for the development of a new synthetic
approach for the synthesis of a broad range of selectively fluorinated compounds
has been identified. This method will give access to a wide range of existing
compounds at more competitive prices and new compound for use in drugs,
agrochemicals and other areas.
