The PI proposes to extend recent work with Belabas and Bhargava on counting the
number of algebraic number fields within the complex numbers of a given degree
over the field of rationals, and with the absolute value of the discriminant
below a given bound. This work also has an algorithmic side where one counts the
exact number and not just a main term with an error estimate. In addition, the
PI proposes to study the chaotic behavior of the multiplicative order function.
Here one studies the arithmetic function which assigns to an odd natural number
the multiplicative order of 2 to this modulus (with obvious generalizations).
This function appears intrinsically in many problems, and it has important
applications in cryptography. In these projects and others in the proposal, the
PI will involve graduate students, undergraduates, and junior faculty, as he has
done with success in the past.

The rational numbers (fractions) are so basic that they are taught in elementary
school. For the past few centuries, number theorists have found natural ways of
expanding them to larger domains that involve throwing in roots of particular
polynomials. The program to classify these new fields was begun by Gauss over
two centuries ago, where he was able to solve the problem for the case where the
polynomial has degree two. In the past century we learned how to do this for
degree three, and in the past decade for degrees four and five. Building on this
work, the PI proposes a deeper study of these fields from a statistical point of
view, and also an algorithmic point of view. We have very few hard data in
connection with higher degree fields, and the new perspectives for counting them
seem ripe for development as computational tools. In addition, the PI proposes
to study the lengths of the periods of certain cyclic processes that are
important in cryptography. These lengths have chaotic behavior (for nearby
parameters, the lengths can be wildly different). There have been certain
conjectures proposed for both the normal lengths of these cycles, and the
lengths on average. The PI hopes to settle some of these conjectures, perhaps in
the negative. In these projects and others in the proposal, the PI will involve
undergraduates, graduate students, and junior faculty. The problems proposed are
fundamental and some have been studied for centuries. Some of the more recent
problems are entwined with cryptography, a topic of great importance in the
world's economy.
