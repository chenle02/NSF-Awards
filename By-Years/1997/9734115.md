9734115 Model checking is emerging as a practical tool for automated debugging
of complex reactive systems. In model checking, a high- level description of a
system is compared against a logical correctness requirement to discover
inconsistencies. This CAREER research aims to enhance applicability and
efficiency of this paradigm by pursuing three objectives in research and
education. First, to make results in computer-aided verification more accessible
to nonspecialists, a modeling method called "reactive modules" is developed as a
unified framework. In addition, an analysis tool that supports a combination of
techniques, a standard textbook on computer-aided verification, and an advanced
course on computer-aided verification will all be created. Second, to develop
techniques that can analyze systems beyond the reach of existing tools, two new
topics, open systems and heterogeneous systems, are investigated. An open system
is a reactive system interacting with an unspecified environment, and for
analysis of such systems, novel specification paradigms such as alternating-time
temporal logics are studied. For analysis of systems consisting of components
with different synchrony assumptions and described in different source
languages, the utility of reactive modules as a common semantic framework is
investigated. Finally, to integrate concepts in formal methods into
undergraduate education at Penn, changes to existing courses in theory and
systems are proposed.***
