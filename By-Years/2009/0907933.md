University of Minnesota proposes to support technical services on R/V Blue
Heron, an 86? general purpose UNOLS research vessel operated by the UM Duluth
Large Lakes Observatory as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System research fleet. They request support for basic services only.
They will provide one technician on each lake-going research project of R/V Blue
Heron to support lacustrine research projects and to maintain, calibrate and
provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research
instrumentation. The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year
continuing grant.
