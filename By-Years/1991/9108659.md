This research is an empirical investigation of female labor supply. The first
part focuses upon how experience on the job affects future wages and labor
supply decisions; the second part looks at joint labor supply decisions taken by
married couples. The estimation is complicated by the fact that labor market
conditions change with the business cycle, fluctuations that affect the
decisions of individuals and households, which in turn feed forward into future
wage and employment rates. Since previous research has largely ignored this
dynamic phenomenon, an important component of the research is to develop
econometric techniques from the underlying economic framework which can
implement with the proposed empirical strategy. This research is important
because it will provide a deeper understanding of factors that affect the
participation and success of women in the labor market.
