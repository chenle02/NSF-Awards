9731472 Navon The overall objective of this project is to test and apply new
approaches and mathematical methods for four-dimensional variational data
assimilation, taking advantage of the availability of the adjoints of the full
physics versions of global forecast models to improve the computational
efficiency and representation of physical processes in the dynamical
assimilation process. Dr. Navon will employ the Florida State University Global
Spectral Model (FSU GSM), developed by Dr. Krishnamurti, as the primary model
for the studies. The three major thrusts of this research are: (1) to develop
more efficient methods for parameter estimations for key parameters identified
by the modeling community as having a sizeable impact on model forecasting
performance and physical initialization; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of
two computationally efficient methods for approximating the full 4-D variational
process - the incremental approach and the multiple truncation incremental
approach; and (3) to test the Discrete Truncated Newton method with memory, a
new large-scale unconstrained minimization algorithm. The last will be done in
collaboration with Dr. Fisher of ECMWF and Dr. Berger of OPTEAM, Ltd. Efficient
and effective four-dimensional data assimilation is a critical component in the
effort to improve numerical weather forecasting. This research has considerable
potential for advancing that effort.
