This project is being supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program. A variety of novel structure-types and novel chemical reactions are
being investigated which include pentacoordinate organosilicon compounds,
strained-bridged aromatic compounds, and unusual carbenoid and radical
containing organic compounds. Study is being made of (1) synthesis and the
chemistry of novel single-atom peri-bridged arenes and their derivatives, (2)
the products, stereochemistry and mechanisms of pentacoordinate addition-
rearrangement-ejection reactions of alpha-haloalkylsilanes with nucleophiles,
(3) generation and the behavior of metallized carbenes, carbynes and alpha-diazo
radicals and (4) carbenic capture and aromatic substitution and expansion
processes involving conjugative alpha-elimination and addition.
