This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has created
extreme challenges for community corrections agencies across the United States,
a population at a high risk for infectious diseases due to a prevalence of
social, economic, and behavioral risk factors. This RAPID project will measure
and track agency-level responses to prevent, contain, and respond to the
COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, this project will examine how community
corrections (the largest arm of the corrections system) respond to the COVID-19
pandemic and balance public health and public safety. Consequently, this study
will investigate the circumstances under which community supervision agencies
alter their policies and procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, while
examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health
of community supervision officers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through surveys and
interviews with community supervision administrators and officers, and based on
a theory of organization change, this project will take a longitudinal approach
to examine how community corrections agencies adapt during the COVID-19
pandemic. These methods will enable a study of the circumstances under which
community supervision agencies alter their policies and procedures during the
COVID-19 pandemic. This project will produce data and research results that will
provide key information on the strategies agencies use during the COVID-19
pandemic. Findings will aid scholarship and agency decision making in response
to the COVID-19 pandemic, while informing the development of plans to protect
the health and well-being of correctional staff and clients in future infectious
disease events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
