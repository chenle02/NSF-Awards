This grant provides funding to develop a finite algorithm and forecasting
procedure for the determination of optimal decisions in the context of a non-
stationary model that accurately reflects a future characterized by
technological change. In particular, research will be directed toward
establishing both existence of, and a algorithm to discover, a finite planning
horizon guaranteed to yield an optimal policy choice for today's decisions. For
the forecasting function, a hierarchical model will be developed that simplifies
the task of data forecasting by decomposing the system being modeled into
elementary components, each assumed to exhibit costs that grow by a constant
proportion over time. Selection of a planning horizon for non-stationary models
has been in the past based upon tradition or engineering judgement. When the
horizon is myopic, the resulting decisions taken can be short-sighted and fail
to properly position the firm for a future characterized by rapidly changing
technology. The overall goal of this research is to provide a rational framework
that leads to a planning horizon choice that is far-sighted, leading to
decisions undistorted by potential end-of-study effects.
