9224005 Meseguer This research will extend the scope of declarative programming
to support reactive system applications (e.g., communications software,
operating systems, robotics) and concurrent object-oriented systems. The
research will also develop a unified logical framework as the semantics basis
for a multiparadigm declarative programming language unifying functional,
relational, and concurrent object- oriented programming, and having powerful
mechanisms for programming-in-the-large. The multiparadigm language will be
implemented by extending the current implementation of the OBJ3 language which
will be included as a functional sub language. The methods used to design the
multiparadigm language are based on an axiomatic theory of general logics that
permits combining logics supporting different styles of declarative programming
by means of mappings preserving the structure of these logics. Examples of such
mappings include sub logic inclusions and translations between logics. The
results of this research will provide new methods for specifying, programming
and reasoning about reactive and concurrent object-oriented systems at a high
level of abstraction, and for reusing such systems to increase software
productivity, as well as a language implementation supporting these methods. The
results will also contribute to the mathematical foundations of concurrent
object- oriented programming. ***
