PRISM (Partnership for Reform in Science and Mathematics) is a partnership
between the University System of Georgia, four core public universities (two
research institutions, one regional, and one state university) and additional
supporting higher education partners, thirteen school districts involving cities
(Atlanta and Savannah), small urban regions and rural areas, the Georgia
Department of Education, and the Education Coordinating Council of Georgia (the
state's P-16 council). PRISM activities are built on a foundation of past work
in the state that emphasizes a preK-16 approach to education. PRISM seeks to
increase science and mathematics achievement by providing challenging science
and mathematics curricula for all students; raising public awareness of the need
for all students to complete the challenging curricula; increasing and
sustaining the number, quality and diversity of preK-12 teachers of science and
mathematics; and increasing the responsiveness of higher education to the needs
of schools. The PRISM partner school districts enroll over 170,000 students and
employ over 10,000 elementary through high school teachers of science and
mathematics. Within the school districts, 39% of the students are African
American, 54% are White, 1% are Asian American, 5% are Hispanic, and 1% are
Multiracial.

To increase student achievement, PRISM emphasizes changes in educational
practice at all levels of four regional preK-16 partnerships and works to
transform state policies to help the regional and local reform efforts gain
traction and expand. In particular, PRISM institutionalizes professional
networks and learning communities within which educators examine student work
and best practices in science and mathematics education. Knowledge from this
work, then, is shared, refined and used to develop the capacity of current and
future preK-12 teachers. Through an Institute on the Teaching and Learning of
Science and Mathematics, higher education faculty who prepare teachers work to
change their pedagogical practices, which will help teachers deepen their
understanding of science and/or mathematics. By including key state entities,
PRISM also influences the statewide policy environment in order to reinforce
local changes aimed at ensuring implementation of higher standards. While
focused on the regional partnerships, it is hoped that innovations deriving from
PRISM will impact the entire Georgia P-16 Network (15 regional school/university
partnerships) and, through the MSP Learning Network, the Nation.
