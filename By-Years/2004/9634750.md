9634750 Daskin This research involves the development of integrated models of
production and distribution for perishable products. Determining inventory
levels and delivery schedules for products that deteriorate physically (such as
fresh foods and certain blood products) or whose economic value decays rapidly
(such as newspapers) present a number of problems for decision makers. The
investigators will develop and analyze models that address the timing and
reliability of product distribution, location of product distribution centers,
trade-offs between large production facilities where economies of scales may be
gained and multiple plants that may be closer to customers, and routing product
from distribution centers under time-window constraints. These models will
include uncertainty in both supply and demand of product. The investigators will
work closely with a large blood products supplier to ensure relevancy to
industry needs. In many industries, the economic value of goods is substantially
reduced if their production and distribution is not timely and reliable.
Moreover, the production and distribution systems must be integrated in order to
be most effective. This research should lead to better tactical and operational
models in highly competitive industries, and ultimately to better decisions
regarding trade-offs between investments, operations, and customer service.
