The rapidly expanding Biology Department of Washington College is modernizing
and upgrading the portions of its curriculum concerned with cellular/molecular
phenomena, i.e. its courses in Genetics, Cell Biology, Microbiology, Aquatic
Biology, Cell Physiology and Biochemistry, and a new course in Immunology. Much
of this advance results from new capabilities conferred through the procurement
of a light microscope with phase contrast and fluoresence features obtained
through this award. This new instrument permits students to actually view such
features and activities as membrane receptor sites and their motility, antigen-
antibody specificity, and membrane transport. Since the Washington College
Biology Department capitalizes upon its location on the Eastern Shore of
Maryland to involve itself in studying the ecology of Chesapeake Bay, one
important application of the new microscope is to facilitate investigations that
distinguish heterotrophic from autotrophic protozoa in mixed, naturally
occurring populations. This award is an especially timely one for Washington
College, coming as it does on the heels of a $1.2 million special appropriation
from the State of Maryland for upgrading the school's science facilities and for
enhancing its ability to contribute to analytical studies of the Bay.
