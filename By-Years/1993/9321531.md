9321531 Eisenberger Princeton University and the University of California at
Santa Barbara, jointly will hold a series of six workshops in which participants
from universities, government and industry look strategically at selected areas
of technological and societal importance. The goals of these meetings will be,
first, to identify important areas in which progress can be made, then to
identify fundamental scientific problems that need to be solved in order to make
progress in those areas, and finally to identify resources that will be needed
to carry out relevant research. In short, the workshops will identify explicitly
those places where fundamental research at universities can make significant
impacts on critical technologies. They will also provide guidance both for
academic scientists and engineers and for the National Science Foundation. ***
