OVERVIEW California State University, Fullerton, is offering a three- year
Language and Mathematics Project for 64 elementary (K-5) teachers. The project
will create a partnership with Santa Ana Unified School District, which has a
high enrollment of minority and Limited English Proficiency students. One half
of the participants will be drawn from Lowell Elementary, a school with one of
the highest minority enrollments and lowest mathematics achievement scores in
the district. The other participants will come from other schools in the
district. Participants will attend 25 four-hour sessions throughout the school
year for each of two years. They will receive in- school support between
sessions by specialists funded by the grant and by the school district, as well
as by peers who have been involved in previous programs in the district. The
project intends to help teachers improve their skills in mathematics and
mathematics teaching and support success of ethnic minority children in
mathematics through a focus on use the language of mathematics in problem
solving, new content, and emphasis on higher order reasoning. California State
University, Fullerton, and the Santa Ana Unified School District are
contributing a 71% cost share for the project.
