This award provides travel support for student participation in the 2017 meeting
of the APS Division of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics. The conference
program includes many of the research topics central to Atomic, Molecular, and
Optical Physics and Quantum Information Science. The support of students through
this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of
future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in atomic, molecular,
and optical physics acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable
them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is scheduled to be held in Ft. Lauderdale, FL
May 28 through June 1 of 2018. It offers an opportunity for students to present
their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the
United States, but also the broader international community. Support is provided
only for US students (students enrolled in US
universities).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
