Under the supervision of Susan Harding, Ph.D. student Christopher Cochran will
adopt an ethnographic approach to study of the normative aspects of physics
practice that shape subjectivity and the authority of the discipline. He will
also document the ways that other scientists are collaborating with or using the
work of quantum physicists, e.g. psychiatrists who collaborate with theoretical
physicists to apply mathematical techniques of quantum field theory to neuronal
networks, and analytic philosophers who hope that paradoxes of the mind-body
problem can be fixed with concepts from quantum physics. The co-PI will
investigate how concerns about the future are implicated in attempts to invent
new ways of articulating scientific questions and new methods to obtain answers
and may result in the creation of a new social/scientific formation. The
research promises to promote scientific literacy about quantum physics by
encouraging understanding of the difference between empiricism and speculation.
After completing the dissertation the co-PI plans on publishing his results as a
book aimed at a wide public audience.
