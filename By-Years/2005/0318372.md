The Computer Research Association proposes to address the problem of too few
full professor women faculty by creating the Associate Professor Cohort Program.
This program aims to increase the percentage of women faculty holding degrees in
Computer Science and Engineering with the rank of full professor by forming and
mentoring a cohort of women from the associate professor ranks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cornerstone of the Cohort Project will be the
involvement of 15 senior women, appointed as CRA-W Distinguished Professors, who
will actively participate as &lt;br/&gt;role models, mentors, and advisers. The
project will build a community of associate professors, and provide them with
mentoring, leadership training, encouragement and ongoing peer-support
activities. The program will include an initial Professional Development
Workshop, a series of smaller meetings in conjunction with technical
conferences/seminars, and ongoing electronically-based support activities.
