9634735 Kovadevic Automatic gas tungsten arc welding is widely used for
precision joining. Although automatic welding machines can realize the pre-
programmed welding parameters more accurately than a human operator, they lack
the visual feedback capability associated with the human operator to compensate
for the deviations in the process. This project is aimed to provide an
innovative weld penetration control technology by developing a neurofuzzy model-
based nonlinear adaptive control system with vision feedback of the weld pool.
In the proposed control system, the welding current, torch speed, and arc length
are used as the control variables to achieve the desired size and shape of the
weld pool. Also investigated in the project are the dynamic behavior of the weld
pool and the correlation between the pool geometrical appearance and
penetration. Weld penetration control is central to automatic welding. The
development of an advanced weld penetration control technology is essential to
resolving the present bottle-neck problem in precise joining. The investigation
of the dynamic behavior of the weld pool provides fundamental knowledge valuable
to welding physics. Industrial relevancy of the research is enhanced by the
existing strong collaboration with industrial firms. ***
