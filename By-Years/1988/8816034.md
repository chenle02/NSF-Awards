Complex flows of viscoelastic fluids are to be modeled theoretically and
experimentally. The approach is a synthesis between large scale numerical
simulations and high spatial and temporal resolution experiments. The validity
of constitutive models is to be explored, with application to realistic and
cost-effective three-dimensional predictions of industrially relevant polymer
flows.
