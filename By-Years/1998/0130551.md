This project provides for continued development and public access to the
national Information Service for Earthquake Engineering (NISEE) at the
University of California, Berkeley. The Earthquake Engineering Abstracts
database, which will soon reach 100,000 citations of the technical literature,
is the premier source of earthquake engineering research literature in the
world. The NISEE Software Library of 114 programs in source code has
successfully turned a long-term investment in NSF engineering research at
universities into an affordable public good for engineering analysis and design.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant also supports a workshop designed to review the
needs and directions within NSF's evolving George E. Brown, Jr. Network for
Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) program. In conjunction with management
of NISEE, the PIs will conduct the workshop to identify needs and opportunities
in the information environment created by the formation of the NEES
collaboratory. The workshop will include representatives from the Science and
Engineering Digital Library project at Cornell University, and also managers of
curated databases in the physics community (e.g., Lawrence Livermore Laboratory)
and industry representatives. The proceedings will include recommendations on
needs and future directions in information services in the future. &lt;br/&gt;
