9724735 Nielsen This Americas Program award will fund a short-term planning
visit to Chile for Ms. Karina Nielsen, currently completing work on her doctoral
dissertation at Oregon State University. The purpose of the visit is to prepare
a proposal on the relationship between oceanographic conditions and intertidal
community structure and dynamics along the central Chilean coast, to be
submitted to the International Post-doctoral Fellowships Program. The specific
goals include visiting and identifying appropriate field sites, selecting
species for experimental manipulations, determinations of specific methods and
collection of preliminary data on community structure at field locations. This
preliminary work will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Sergio Navarrete,
Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile. ***
