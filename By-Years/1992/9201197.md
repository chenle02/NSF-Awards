The integration of services that share resources on a single network has
generated an in creasing interest in analyzing models of multiple service,
multiple resource (or multi-rate) communication networks. The proposed research
develops efficient computation algorithms for analyzing large multi-rate-loss
networks. The principal investigator will develop decomposition algorithms that
allow the exact analysis of a large class of models. By reducing the analysis to
that of a set of subnetworks, the overall dimensionality of the problem and the
computational costs are reduced significantly. This enables the exact efficient
computation of performance measures (e.g. blocking probabilities) in larger
models than hitherto possible. The PI also will develop an approximation method
to analyze such models for any size and load. The success of this effort would
result in the development of efficient methods for exact and approximate
analysis of multi-rate networks of practical size and complexity.
