Dr. Robert J. Doedens and other members of the Chemistry Department of
University of California at Irvine are being supported to continue a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5,
eight undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged
in a variety of research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of
chemistry-analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique
feature of this program is the recruitment of students from all parts of the
country including under- represented groups.
