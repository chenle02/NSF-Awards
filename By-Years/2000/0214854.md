This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to apply
Multi Photon Detection technique (MPD) to quantify proteins bound to a
microarray of antibodies. The first arrays will target cytokines, the important
secreted proteins that regulate the immune system. The goals of this project are
to create an immunoassay based protein-chip for the concurrent measurment of all
the cytokines down to the level of a few zeptomole/ sample, to implement
improved P-chip designs using peptide nucleic acid linkers, and to study the
levels of cytokines in cell cultures and human samples. By analyzing patterns of
protein expression and their post-translational modifications, correlations of
functions and/or of disease states with specific protein expression patterns are
expected to be established.

The commercial applications of this project are in the area of medical
diagnostics.
