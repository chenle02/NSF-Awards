This ICorps project seeks to evaluate the business opportunity for a new optical
cellular imaging modality for use at the clinical point of care. The microscope
system will employ a unique sample holder, called the interferometric-chamber
(InCh) which enables holographic imaging of cell morphology with a simple,
inexpensive yet robust optical system. Significantly, this approach does not
require any sample preparation, such as addition of fluorescent labels, and
obtains wide field images of cell samples in a single acquisition, i.e., no
sample or optical scan is needed. Holographic cell images can be easily
processed to calculate numerical morphological parameters of individual cells
and thus provide important information for medical diagnosis and health status.
The proposed team will critically evaluate the commercial need, target markets
and develop a licensing strategy as well as create a commercial prototype of the
InCh microscope for demonstration to potential partners and investors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-range goal of this research is to create a new
biomedical diagnostic product for the purpose of generating holographic cell
images, particularly red blood cells, at the point of care using a simple,
robust imaging device. Initial testing will be conducted on red blood cells to
calculate parameters usually obtained by manual cell counting of blood smear
samples. Further applications include identifying abnormalities of the red and
white blood cells due to malaria, chagas and sickle cell anemia as well as real
time imaging of living cells for laboratory applications such as cancer biology
and stem cell research. This research has significant transformative potential
in that it can dramatically increase the availability of diagnostic information
at the point of care. If successful, this technology can impact healthcare
domestically as well as in the developing world. Further, this technology can be
used as a tool to enable future discoveries by providing a means to obtain and
rapidly analyze information from blood samples for biomedical studies.
