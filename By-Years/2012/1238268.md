This grant is to fund student travel to the International Symposium on Computer
Architecture (ISCA), which is a premier forum for presenting, discussing and
debating new and innovative architectural ideas and techniques for advanced
computing and communication systems. This symposium brings together researchers
in fields related to processor architecture, compilers, chips and systems, for
technical exchange on current areas of architectural challenge. This proposal
aims to support this highly regarded conference by obtaining travel support for
students in order to defray the costs of attending and participating, with
attention to broadening participation and building the technical workforce of
the future.
