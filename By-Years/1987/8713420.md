The project concerns undergraduate participation in ongoing research in the
areas of automation and information processing systems. The individual student
projects emphasize that modeling of engineering systems is a key to solving
difficult problems. Integration of computer technology with analytical methods
is stressed. The areas of research are: Intelligent Servomechanisms, Chemical
Process Systems, Manufacturing Systems Communications and Signal Processing
Systems, and Expert Systems and Parallel Architectures. The purpose of the REU
Program is to provide undergraduate students with the opportunity to actively
participate in ongoing research projects in order to enhance their training for
careers in mathematics, science, and engineering. This project provides such
support in a rich research environment.
