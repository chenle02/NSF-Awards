This research project investigates questions in the area of magnetic materials,
emphasizing modeling, analysis, and numerical explorations of nanoscale systems.
Magnetic materials have been an indispensable ingredient for information storage
since the advent of the computer age and presently hold great promise for the
development of revolutionary new computer and information technologies. Recent
advances in nanofabrication allow an unprecedented precision in building
magnetic multilayer structures, using ultrathin films with thickness down to a
single atomic layer and a lateral extent down to ten nanometers. At these very
small scales, new physical effects become prominent, driving interesting new
phenomena such as spin transfer torque, chiral domain walls, magnetic skyrmions,
spin, inverse spin, and topological Hall effects. This new physics needs to be
incorporated into the micromagnetic modeling framework that proved very
successful in the previous studies of magnetic systems at larger scales. This
research project explores the multiscale, nonlinear, nonlocal, and often
stochastic nature of the new models, which represents a significant challenge to
understanding and predicting the behavior of such systems. A key component of
the project is the involvement of a new generation of applied mathematicians in
this highly interdisciplinary area of research.

This project aims to formulate and analyze models of ultrathin ferromagnetic
films in the presence of antisymmetric exchange interaction, which produces a
non-trivial interplay with the topological characteristics of the magnetization.
Particular care will be taken to incorporate into the models the non-local
effects of the stray field via rigorous analysis of the appropriate asymptotic
thin film limits arising from the full three-dimensional treatment. Within the
obtained reduced thin film models, the properties of charged domain walls,
chiral domain walls, and magnetic skyrmions will be investigated, using a
combination of analytical, formal asymptotic, and numerical tools. The questions
of existence and asymptotic properties of these coherent structures give rise to
challenging problems of energy-driven pattern formation and calculus of
variations. The research is strongly motivated by the rapidly expanding field of
spintronics. All the special magnetization configurations that will be
considered in the project are currently targets for potential applications in
spintronics devices and, in particular, for the development of non-volatile
sequential and random access computer memories.
