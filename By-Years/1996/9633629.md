This three-year program will construct helmet streamer solutions containing a
cavity flux rope and a prominence in its closed field region. The solutions will
study the initiation and propagation of coronal mass ejections by investigating
their dynamical evolution due to photospheric shear motion. Using a 2 1/2
dimensional MHD code (incorporating the characteristics in the boundary
conditions), the PI will construct a quasi-static helmet-streamer solution. This
solution will be used to quantitatively study the equilibrium structure, force
balance and energy content in detail and compare with observations. Using the
helmet streamer as an initial state, the PI will also study its dynamical
evolution due to photospheric shear motions. The shear is anticipated to cause
the streamer to erupt impulsively, and the helmet dome, cavity and prominence
will form typical three-part looplike coronal mass ejections. In all, this work
will generate a more physically realistic pre-event coronal atmosphere, reveal
the physical mechanisms that cause the initiation of coronal mass ejections, and
address the fundamental question of the energy source of coronal mass ejections.
