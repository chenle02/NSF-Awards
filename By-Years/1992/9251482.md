The Department of Computer Science will establish a Computer Graphics and
Visualization Laboratory to address the increasing interest and demand for
instruction in data visualization techniques, for both majors and non-majors.
The project will allow the creation of the laboratory featuring a cluster of
powerful UNIX workstations configured with hardware, peripherals, and software
specifically to support high- performance computer graphics. The laboratory will
enable the department to enhance and extend two existing major courses, Computer
Graphics and Advanced Graphics and Visualization, and to offer for the first
time service courses focusing specifically on advanced visualization techniques.
The development plan calls for the immediate introduction of a course targeted
at science majors, Data Visualization and Display Techniques, with the
possibility of other service courses being added later to address the needs of
other potential user groups. The laboratory's graphical environment will support
both these regular courses and special projects, and will extend the level of
training beyond what is possible with the currently available PC-instructional
clusters. With the new laboratory, the students can gain hands-on experience
with state-of-the-art graphics and visualization technologies and better prepare
themselves for careers in research, public service, or industry.
