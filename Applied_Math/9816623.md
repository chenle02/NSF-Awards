Silver 9816623 The investigator and his colleagues conduct an experimental
interdisciplinary training course at Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole,
on modeling of biological systems. The course lasts for six weeks and aims to
rapidly introduce students, postdocs, and more senior investigators to a range
of biology, mathematics, and computation. The goal is to bring them quickly to
the point where they can begin effective collaborations with investigators of
complementary expertise on biology problems of mutual interest. Innovative
aspects of the project include its immersion in the subjects, thematic
organization, modularity of content, interdisciplinary teaming during the
course, and planned multi-year involvement of participants, including students.
The richness of biology and the deeper understanding offered by mathematical
analyses and modeling require concerted nurturing to foster the continuation and
growth of collaborations at this interface. The investigator and his colleagues
organize an intense interdisciplinary course on modeling of biological systems,
aimed to provide the necessary common background for students and researchers in
biology, mathematical sciences, and engineering. The goals of the course
include: (a) training biologists in the use of fundamental and sophisticated
modeling oaradigms and tools, (b) training mathematical scientists in a
biological arena, including laboratory experience, (c) bringing computational
and experimental biologists together in considering certain specific research
areas, (d) establishing a common framework for addressing quantitative analysis
and understanding of biological systems, (e) serving as an interdisciplinary
training and resource venue for addressing questions of modeling of biological
systems. In addressing these goals, the course fosters the development of the
shared language and skills necessary for scientists, mathematicians, and
engineers to collaborate in solving key problems.
