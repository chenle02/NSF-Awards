This project is devoted to research on dynamical systems that represent
mathematical models of complex physical systems evolving over time. Dynamical
systems of interest include mechanical systems (e.g., motion of satellites under
the influence of gravity, solar pressure, electromagnetic forces, etc.),
astrophysics system (e.g., expansion of the early universe, motion near a Black
Hole, and evolution of exoplanetary systems), and high energy physics (e.g.,
particle accelerators, and plasma confinement devices). The goal of this
research is to analyze and predict patterns of complex behavior emerging from
the dynamics, and to obtain statistical information on the long-term evolution
of the underlying systems. The obtained results are expected to contribute
towards advancing scientific discovery and promoting innovative technologies,
for example to design more efficient satellite orbits, to optimize performance
of particle accelerators, and to understand more about the formation and
evolution of the universe and of our solar system. Additionally, this project
integrates research with education, and contributes towards preparing a diverse,
highly qualified mathematics workforce.

At the fundamental level, the mathematical models to be investigated by this
project can be framed in the formalism of Hamiltonian dynamics. A quintessential
question is to understand the long-term behavior of orbits in Hamiltonian
systems. This question is investigated in the context of nearly-integrable
Hamiltonian systems (the Arnold diffusion problem), in the context of the N-body
problem, and in the context of randomly perturbed Hamiltonian systems. The main
objective of the research is to obtain qualitative and quantitative information
on typical orbits in such systems. The information of interest concerns the
distance traveled, speed and stability of orbits, the measure/Hausdorff
dimension of the set of initial conditions for orbits that visit a prescribed
sequence of targets, and the statistical distribution of orbits evolving from an
initial data set. For this purpose, the investigator and his colleagues develop
innovative methodologies that combine geometric, topological, and statistical
methods, which can be applied to concrete examples, and can be implemented in
high-precision numerical computations and computer assisted proofs.
