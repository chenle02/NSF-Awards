This Presidential Young Investigator Award is for support of Christopher
Atkeson at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His research interests are
the study of motor control and learning in humans and machines. He uses tools
and techniques from biological, computer, and engineering sciences to study how
humans control and improve their movement and how machines might attain human
levels of perfomrance. Atkeson's current research has three main thrusts:
computational studies of motor learning in general; experimental studies of
robot learning; and psychophysical studies of human motor learning. The
significance of this work lies in the implications it has for both humans and
robots: in the former, better understanding of how we learn new arm movements,
compensate for motor disorders, and adapt to prosthetic and assistive devices;
in the latter, more useful and usable robots.
