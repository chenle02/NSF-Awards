The Workshop Physics system, in which traditional lectures and laboratories are
replaced by interactive learning methods and micro-computer-based laboratory
activities, will be used to provide a combined calculus-based/non-calculus
introductory physics course. Additional interactive methods such as conceptual
exercises, collaborative problem-solving, and multimedia technology will be
incorporated into the existing Workshop Physics curriculum. This will result in
improved student learning and more efficient use of instructor time.
