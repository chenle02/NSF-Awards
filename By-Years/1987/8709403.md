Support is requested to purchase an Inductively Coupled Plasma/Quadropole Mass
Spectrometer. The advantage of the very high temperature (7,000 K) plasma source
in general analytical chemistry are outlined, especially as they apply to
refractory elements with high ionization potentials. The utility of the ICP/MS
system is discussed in the context of our present analytical capability at MIT.
The operating principles of the machine are discussed and some sample spectra
presented. Brief examples of possible applications are given. Statments of
support from Profs. E.A. Boyle, F.F. Frey and S.R. Hart (all in the MIT
Department) are contained in an Appendix.
