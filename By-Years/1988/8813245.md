A conference will be held in Washington, D.C. in the summer of 1988 to help
guide the future of a highly influential, widely used data series known as the
National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience (NLS). The conference
will bring together leading academic researchers from the fields of economics,
demography, and sociology, high-level administrators from federal agencies which
support the NLS, and key staff from the three organizations which share
operational responsibility for the NLS to discuss issues of substance and
methodology which have arisen due to existing and predicted resource
constraints. Among the contemplated outcomes of the conference are the
dissemination of scientific papers assessing the tradeoffs involved in
maintaining vs. discontinuing particular components of the series, vitally
needed additions to the series for providing information on changing economic
and social problems, and the establishment of priorities for satisfying
different research objectives. The conference is timely in its emphasis on
reassessment as well as reaffirmation of the value of the NLS both to social
science and to public decision making.
