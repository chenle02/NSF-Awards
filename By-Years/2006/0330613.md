This proposal is designed to facilitate grid portal development using the
portlet/container approach to building portals. This approach separates portal
control and basic services from content. A central control server provides basic
portal services such as authentication, access control, and user
customizability. Into this framework, portal content and custom services are
plugged in using software components called portlets. The container manages the
organization and interaction of the portlets, and the portlets deliver specific
web content (either local or remote), including Grid service
interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The portlet-based design concept supports
distributed, loosely coupled development and deployment: user interfaces and
science interface components can be developed independently, using the standard
portlet API, and then reused between portals. Services and interfaces may be
installed and added to various portals in a well-defined way. The portlet model
is also an ideal fit to the emerging Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) and
its implementation specification, the Open Grid Service Infrastructure (OGSI).
Because OGSI is based on the new web-service standards, each Grid service can be
directly accessed by a custom portlet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of
making the Grid readily approachable by the international community of
researchers is potentially extremely large, as the immense resources that have
been collected and organized in recent years by the underlying Grid technologies
become visible as usable components of the global research community's desktop.
This project will greatly simplify the use of Grid technologies and allow new
services to be made readily available to individual researchers and groups by
enabling the proliferation of Grid portal technology through reusability and
simplification of installation. Scientists will be able to easily form flexible
groups with collaborators across the world and use the Grid to share data and
resources. This project provides tools for collaboration between established and
ad hoc groups of users, enabling those scientists to communicate effectively
with each other about the science they are doing, and providing customized views
of the Grid that are tailored to meet the needs of collaborating
groups.&lt;br/&gt;
