DIMACS, the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science,
will run a workshop entitled "Software Security." The workshop is aimed at
providing leadership to the field of information security by bringing together
in a single forum experts from a variety of relevant fields to assess the
current state of the art, identify research needs, and establish directions for
collaborative future work. The workshop will investigate building secure
software, including topics such as software risk managment, programming
languages and platforms, auditing software, design for security, security flaws,
and testing for security. The workshop will also investigate application
security, including topics such as sandboxing code, protection against malicious
code, locking down executables, monitoring programs as they run, enforcing
software use policy with technology, and dealing with extensible systems.
