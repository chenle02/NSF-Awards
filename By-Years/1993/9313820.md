9313820 Neuman A Surface force microscope equipped with silica surfaces and
laser spectroscopic attachments will be used to simultaneously study the
tribological properties of molecularly thin liquid films and the behavior of the
molecules in the liquid. The techniques of sum-frequency generation and
flourescence recovery after photobleaching will be used to independently measure
molecular orientation, mobility, interacions with the surface, and relaxation.
These properties will be correlated with stick- slip transitions, shear stress
and rheology of the thin film. The liquids to be tested include
perflouropolyether and n- hexadecane with and without phisisorbed and
chemisorbed additives. Part of the work will be performed in cooperation with
the Swedish Institute for Surface Chemistry in Stockholm. ***
