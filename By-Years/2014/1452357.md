Gravity waves (GWs) originating from lower atmospheric sources can lead to large
accelerations of the background flow through wave dissipation or breaking. The
accelerations produce secondary GWs with longer wavelengths, allowing them to
propagate farther upward into the ionosphere. Here, through interaction with the
ionospheric plasma, they are visible in the form of optical signatures in red
line (630 nm) images, and are often referred to as traveling ionospheric
disturbances (TIDs). A broad array of optical imagers will be used to
triangulate the lower atmospheric sources for F region GWs, quantifying the GWs
by numerically modeling the same optical signatures, and then using this
quantification to ray-trace the secondary GWs to reveal their altitude profile
of momentum deposition. This effort will connect two critical points on the
coupled path: from the lower atmospheric source to momentum deposition in the
mid to upper thermosphere. This project will include outreach to students at
rural high schools where the instruments will be deployed. It will also provide
undergraduate students opportunities to participate in data analysis and
interpretation.
