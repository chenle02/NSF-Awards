In a communication network, protocols provide the services for reliable, timely,
and efficient transfer of information among users that are distributed
throughout the network. A model is developed for specifying and verifying large
time-dependent and multi-function protocol systems and this model is applied to
real-life network protocols. Included in this research are extensions to earlier
work on projections and time-dependent modeling. The research objectives include
the development of a model that can be easily and rigorously implemented by
inexperienced programmers and have very simple semantics so that verification
for logical correctness can be determined with a minimum of effort and notation.
