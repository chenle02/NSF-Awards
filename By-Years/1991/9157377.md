Bresler This research falls into four broad areas: image reconstruction,
reconstruction of time-varying distributions, sensor array processing, and
visualization of multiparameter data. In the area of image processing, the
principal objective is to develop the theory and associated computational
algorithms for superresolution image reconstruction from partial and noisy data,
using statistical models. For the second area, the goal is to develop optimum
signal acquisition schemes subject to physical or economic constraints, and the
associated efficient reconstruction algorithms, for imaging spatial data that is
time varying during the acquisition process. In the area of sensor area
processing, several issues are being addressed including the design of
computationally efficient algorithms for the (sub)optimal solutions of model
fitting problems, wideband source location, and imaging with sensor arrays.
Finally, in the last area, the goal is to address the effective fusion, display,
and visualization of multi-parameter spatially-related data, such as is acquired
in multispectral, or multi-modality remote sensing and diagnostic imaging.
