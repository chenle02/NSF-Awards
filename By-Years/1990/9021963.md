The Cascade Topology Seminar is a series of two-day meetings held each year
since 1987. Thirty to fifty participants meet at an institution in the region.
There are usually two or three lectures on Saturday and one or two lectures on
Sunday, plus much informal discussion, on a weekend in the spring and another in
the fall. The organizers have attracted excellent speakers, and the seminars
have played a significant role in fostering topological research in this region
of the country. This modest award will assist the organizers, mainly to bring in
high quality speakers from outside the Pacific Northwest, during the next three
years.
