With a grant under the Presidential Young Investigator Program, research on flow
- structure interaction will be carried out. Analytical modeling and
computational techniques will be applied to unsteady aerodynamics and flutter in
turbomachinery, transonic buffeting, and other relevant unsteady interactions
between flow and flexible structures. This research will advance the ability to
predict and control flutter and other instabilities in various engineering
systems, primarily turbomachinery.
