The objective of this proposal is to use inclusion chemistry to synthesize and
characterize electro-optic materials which can be fine tuned and switched as
nanocomposites. The preliminary research has demonstrated our ability to define
the compositional phase space of an extensive class of materials which have the
same topology as one of the premier nonlinear optic crystals known, KTP. The
phase space of a second inclusion structural family, ABCO4, is being explored
and has been shown to contain members with optical windows to 0.2 um and large
SHG coefficients. Reversible gas phase adsorption, guest/host interace
chemistry, and solid state substitution chemistry are being used to modify
electro-optic behavior with respect to SHG and phase matching. Exploratory
research using a variety of synthetic techniques is proposed in our search for
new nonlinear optic inclusion hosts. A second objective of this research is to
examine the nonlinear optic response as a function of externally induced atomic
displacements by applied electric field, temperature, and pressure. Exploratory
synthesis into new structural types will make use of the structure/property
relationships determined in the above studies.
