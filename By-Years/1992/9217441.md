This Americas Program award will support Dr. Alberto A. Sagues, of the
University of South Florida-Tampa, in a collaborative research program with Dr.
Luis A. Maldonado and Pedro Castro Borges, of the Merida Unit of the Center of
Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN-
CINVESTAV), Mexico. Their work will investigate the contamination of concrete by
chloride ions from seawater in warm environments, and the effect of that
contamination on organically-coated reinforcing steel. The information obtained
from this cooperative effort will be critical to the successful control of
corrosion in tropical marine environments. The proposed interaction will benefit
both nations by establishing a common approach toward corrosion detection and
control in a shared geographic region. By increasing our understanding of steel
corrosion in concrete, this project has the potential to make a significant
contribution towards improving the durability of structures.
