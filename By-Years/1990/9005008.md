This award provides one-half the funding required for the purchase of computing
hardware and software that will be installed and operated in the Department of
Geology and Geophysics at Rice University. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary. The computing system upgrade is
required for the processing of seismic data for a number of Rice University
research projects in vertical-incidence and wide-angle reflection seismic
processing, seismic interpretation and modeling of crustal structure.
