A fundamental question for pre-Cambrian tectonics is the timing and amounts of
extraction of crustal material from the mantle and its addition to the crust.
However, it has been difficult to distinguish new additions from recycled older
crustal material. This project will employ isotopic technique to establish Nd-
model ages and fix the time since the parental material of the rocks separated
from the earth's mantle. Coupled with U-Pb ages, these data will allow the
estimation of new materials to the Northeastern Appalachians during late
proterozoic time (1300-1000 Ma).
