With the explosion of atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the entire world
became aware of what had heretofore been known only to a few: the enormous
energy which lay dormant in the atom. The use of this power, both militarily and
for civilian purposes, became a major goal in the postwar era. Yet the radiation
which atomic power entailed posed serious problems which scientists had to
study. How they undertook this research in the United States is the subject of
this research. Dr. Whittemore is analyzing the interaction of science, law and
ethics in research on radiation exposure limits for human beings. It is the
establishment of such standards that one finds the most sophisticated and
complex mixture of scientific, ethical and legal issues. This study focuses on a
history of radiation standards in the United States from the founding of the
Advisory Committee on X-Ray and Radium Protection in 1928 to the disbanding of
the Federal Radiation Council in 1970, when its functions were transferred to
the Environmental Protection Agency and then on to the present. Dr. Whittemore
was Senior Policy and Research Analyst for the Advisory Committee on Human
Radiation Experiments. This Committee, appointed by President Clinton in 1994,
uncovered and collected many of the documents which make possible a postwar
history into classified government research in this area. The Committee also
conducted a number of oral history interviews with scientists who have been
active in the field. It is this collection of documents and interviews that Dr.
Whittemore will use in his research.
