9628043 Dueker This research involves use of newly acquired PASSCAL seismic
broad-band digital data to improve knowledge of the Colorado Plateau's
lithospheric structure and address the origin of the Colorado Plateau's uplift.
This unresolved Cenozoic uplift occurred after the plateau remained essentially
at sea-level for most of its 1.7 billion year history. Proposed analysis will
involve construction of common midpoint stacks of receiver functions,
measurement of teleseismic P and S wave travel times, measurement of Pn travel
times from two Deep Probe shots, and shear-wave splitting measurements for the 4
suitable SKS events recorded. The results should provide information on Moho
depth, crustal and upper mantle velocities, and seismic velocity anisotropy due
to fossil strain and/or recrystallization processes. ***
