Reproductive self-regulation among large free-roaming mammals is a well-
documented but poorly understood phenomenon. Our limited knowledge of the
physiological mechanisms which determine reproductive self-regulation in
mammalian species is currently derived from studies of rodents and primates. The
goal of this study is the identification of primary factors involved with female
reproductive self-regulation among large wild ungulates. It is important to
recognize that the focus of this work is primarily directed toward the
understanding of the differences in reproductive performances among two
contrasting herds ofthe North American bison of Yellowstone National Park.
