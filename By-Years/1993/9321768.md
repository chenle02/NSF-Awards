9321768 Koel Studies of the structure and reactivity of thin Pd overlayers on
refractory metal substrates forms the focus of the research supported in this
project. By combining ion scattering, scanning tunneling microscopy, and kinetic
studies using thermal desorption spectroscopy, the differences between surface
and bulk reactivity of Pd will be probed. The results of this investigation,
supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will impact on our
understanding of bimetallic catalytic systems. Chemisorption and reaction
properties will be correlated with geometric and electronic effects measured
spectroscopically. %%% The interaction between a catalytically active transition
metal and an unreactive substrate underlies widely used bimetallic catalyst
systems. This research project probes the geometric and electronic effects in
bimetallic systems which control the catalytic chemistry. Information from
studies of this sort provide the knowledge base for the design and manipulation
of heterogeneous catalytic materials. ***
