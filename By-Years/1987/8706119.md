This research will determine appropriate new and innovative computer-intensive
statistical procedures and apply them to samples of discrete extragalactic
sources defined by objective criteria, and to their relations with the
predictions of mathematical cosmologies. The probabilities of such deviations as
may be observed, assuming the sample is unbiased and accepted cosmology is
correct, will be estimated by Monte Carlo methods. Statisical acceptability of
the chronometric and Friedman cosmological hypotheses will be tested by
comparison of their predicted observable relations with those observed in
complete, or other statistically objectively delineated, published samples.
Computer applicable multivariate estimation for luminosity functions at several
frequencies will be investigated. This research is cross-disciplinary, involving
a symbiosis of Statistics with Computational Cosmology. The fields of
Statistics, Lie Groups, Modern Analysis, Geometry, Relativity, and Cosmology are
all scientifically relevant in an essential way to the testing, validation, and
formulation of cosmological theories of the nature of the redshift and its
objective statistical implications. Senior scientists from these fields, which
are normally non-interacting, will combine their expertise in re-analyzing
extragalactic data and retesting the redshift theory.
