This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will apply agile
manufacturing, and lean production concepts in studying the real time workflow
patterns at plant level in a manufacturing-related company. The results will be
used to develop a new generation ERP (enterprise resource planning) software
system. This project will develop a web-based modularized software for
upper/middle levels and as well as shop-floor-level production planning,
execution, monitoring, and evaluation using agile manufacturing and lean
production principles.

The commercial application will be directed toward the U.S. Manufacturing
industry. This new ERP system will provide rapid and quality responses to plant-
level production needs of manufacturers.
