An exploratory study will be conducted into the dynamics of air flow in the
microelectronics clean room as it interacts with the process automation
equipment to determine if this approach can eventually lead to improved clean
room design with a high level of contamination control. This study will examine
fluid dynamics of clean room operations, including the consideration of robots
as a source of contamination and the effect of robot movement and work station
design on the aerosol dispersion in the clean room. Development of a simulation
computer program of robots and end effectors as particle generators is planned,
as well as a simulation program of a clean room with graphic output showing
three-dimensional particle concentration in the room.
