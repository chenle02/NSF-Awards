DMS-9970879 ABSTRACT

Asymptotic properties of determinants for different classes of operators

that depend on a parameter have been important in several branches of

physics and mathematics. In random matrix theory such determinants yield

formulas that compute many fundamental statistical properties. For

example, the distribution function for a linear statistic, (or a certain

kind of random variable) in the classical Gaussian Unitary Ensemble is

described by a Fredholm determinant of a convolution operator. Other

ensembles of random matrices and other statistical objects give rise to

more complicated operators. In the orthogonal and symplectic ensembles,

matrix-valued symbols of operators naturally occur, while non-smooth

random variables lead to operators with singular symbols. In all the above

cases the asymptotic expansions are generalizations of the Strong Szego

Limit Theorem to various classes of operators.



Many physical systems possess such complicated behavior that exact

predictions become impossible. Two billiard balls that are set into motion

close together on an irregularly shaped billiard table may have very

different paths. The energy level of a particle of a compound nucleus in a

slow nuclear reaction also has complicated unpredictable behavior.

Random matrix theory provides mathematical models that allow a simulation

of the energy levels of the particle or the energies of the billiard balls.

One of the goals of the subject is to understand the statistical behavior

of the energy levels. Here is an example. Suppose we add all the

energies together. Does the distribution of the sum of the energies change

depending on our initial assumptions about our models?

For a large class of models, the answer is no. The

distribution of the sum of energies, after appropriate normalization is

bell-shaped. These results agree with experimentally

acquired data and illustrate the universality of the theories.
