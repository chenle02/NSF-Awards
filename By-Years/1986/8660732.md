Numerically controlled (NC) machining has and will continue to enhance
manufacturing productivity by yielding final products with high reliability and
high precision. NC machines are driven by computer programs that are usually
written by available shop personnel. Generation, correction, and verification of
NC code are time-consuming tasks. Computer-assisted NC coding software is
available, but with limited capability. Currently, there exist only weak links
between computer-aided design (CAD) systems and NC machining. The ideal is a
fully integrated system wherein the NC code is generated automatically from a
CAD-generated part specification. There is a strong need to provide an
economical and efficient means to verify the correctness of an NC program and to
provide automatic generation of NC programs from a CAD database.
Microcompatibles proposes to apply a novel solid modeling method to the problem
of automatic NC code generation and verification. They will create an efficient
and economical mechanism to generate 3D graphical emulation of NC machining
providing dimensional information, checks for undesired tool, spindle, fixture,
or workpiece collisions, and automated verification capability. This is a small
business Innovation Phase I award.
