9414846 Savoie This program focuses on the chemical, physical and radiative
properties of aerosols over th North Atlantic Ocean. At present the estimates of
direct (as well as indirect) aerosol forcing are highly uncertain because of
many unknown factors about aerosols: their composition, size distribution and
radiative properties, and the temporal and spatial variability of these
properties. The work includes (1) continuous sampling to extend the chemical
climatologies that were developed during the first two phases of AEROCE, (2) an
initiation of continuous measurement of aerosol absorption and total integrated
aerosol scattering, and (3) intensive measurements of size-segregated aerosol
chemistry on four islands in the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic Ocean
(NAO): Bermuda; barbados; Tenerife, Canary Islands; and Lanzorote, Canary
Islands. Daily bulk aerosol samples from all of the sites will be analyzed for
(1) nss-SO4 =, derived from anthropogenic sources and biological sources in the
ocean; (2) MSA, an atmospheric oxidation product of DMS which is produced by
biological sources in the ocean; (3) NO3-, derived from continental and oceanic
sources; (5) Na+, for sea salt; and (6) nss-K+m as a tracer fir biomass burning.
Continuous measurements will also be made of (1) total integrated aerosol
scatter using integrating nephelometer, (2) aerosol composition in two size
ranges (1-10um diameter and the fraction below 1 um), (3) total aerosol number
concentration using condensation particle counters, and (4) total aerosol
absorption coefficient using aerosol absorption photometers. th latter data will
be supplemented with spectral reflectance measurement made in the laboratory
using a diode array spectrophotometer. The data will be interpreted in terms of
the physical, chemical, and radiative properties of aerosols associated with
specific source regions and types.
