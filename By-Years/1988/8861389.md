Innovative Dynamics plans to investigate solid-state lasers to be incorporated
in a Laser-Acoustic System for remote sensing applications in the Arctic
environment. This system consists of a pulsed laser transmitter and an acoustic
receiver, both operated in the air. The laser beam in focused to a small spot on
the surface of the ground. Strong absorption of the laser energy at the surface
limits penetration of the beam to a few wavelengths. Instant evaporation of
surface molecules take place if the peak power density of the laser spot on the
surface is sufficiently intense. The superheated steam subsequently explodes,
creating an acoustic field which propagates through the medium and is reflected
at the media interface. An acoustic receiver detects the reflected sound from
the interface. Precise timing of these signals makes it possible to accurately
measure the thickness of the given medium. The reflections would also reveal
characteristics of the medium. Initial ice field measurements proved the
feasibility of the concept for measuring 1 meter thick ice using a CO2 laser
operating in the infrared portion of the spectrum (10.6 um). The emphasis of the
proposed program is to determine the feasibility of using a Nd-Yag laser
operating in the near infrared region (1.06 um) to generate acoustic pulses in
various media including water, ice, snow, and soil. The results of these
experiments will yield important information as to the potential utility of
airborne laser remote sensing for rapid and wide scale measurement of spatial
and temporal variations in snow, ice, and frozen conditions.
