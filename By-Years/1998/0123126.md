This program is a multi-faceted approach to retain and graduate talented, but
financially needy, juniors and seniors in mechanical engineering, civil
engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, engineering
administration, computer-aided drafting and design technology, mathematics and
computer science and to assist them with career placement. The project builds on
well-established academic support services, a mentoring program, career services
and placement, established and thriving cooperative education and internship
programs, and industrial partnerships through industrial advisory boards and
research projects. The student support structure includes mentoring by both
faculty and industry representatives through learning communities, as well as
synchronous and asynchronous on-line conversations among scholars, faculty, and
industry representatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
