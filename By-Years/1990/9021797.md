This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of Missouri -
Columbia for the repair and renovation of Schlundt Annex so that it can house
the research and research training programs in protein structure of the
Biochemistry Department. This building was constructed in 1940 and has not
previously been renovated. The ARFMP grant of $1,449,728 and $1,534,760 provided
by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and
research training facilities and permit a strong and coherent research group to
be unified along with a transgenic plant facility in a contiguous research
space. This project will address the need to improve the current research
infrastructure by reconfiguring the space so that it is more functional,
installing centralized air conditioning and heating and the appropriate duct
work, increasing electrical services, improving the access to all floors,
upgrading the transgenic plant facilities, and constructing laboratories to
house the protein sequencing and peptide synthesis facility. This award
contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing an improved
environment for the conduct of research and for the training of quality
undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Students trained
in these laboratories, where there is a coherent grouping of strong faculty
leadership surrounded by a configuration of pertinent facilities, will be able
to keep abreast of the latest developments in an important area of biochemistry.
