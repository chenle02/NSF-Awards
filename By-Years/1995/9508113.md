9508113 GILBERT This research involves the complete re-evaluation of the Earth's
complete normal-mode spectrum in light of recent large earthquakes. It is fair
to say that, before the June 9, 1994, great deep Bolivian earthquake,
observational free-oscillation seismology had gone into a state of suspended
animation. A lack of very large events and, in particular, the lack of very
large deep events made progress difficult and incremental. The Fiji event in
March rekindled some interest since it was the largest deep event to be
digitally recorded since the 1970 Columbian event, but it was rapidly eclipsed
by the Bolivian event. Not only was the Bolivian event bigger than the 1970
Columbian event but it was recorded by an unprecedented number of observatory-
quality digital stations. For those who know what is possible with hand-
digitized recordings of the Columbian event, the new data promise a quantum
improvement in our knowledge of the seismic response of the Earth at long-
periods. It is anticipated that this research will lead to, at the minimum:
stringent constraints on anisotropy in the core, constraints on the relative P
and S velocity variations in the mantle, constraints on 3-D attenuation
structure (at least of even harmonic degree), high resolution 1-D models with
resolution lengths below 100 km for precisians of 0.1%, and an accurate
description of the seismic spectrum at long periods making better determination
of long-period source behavior for large events possible. *** ??
