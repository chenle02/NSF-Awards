9652658 Jones Effects of Defoliation on Isoprene Emissions from Oaks Isoprene
emitted by plants is the single most important naturally occurring volatile
organic compound in the lower atmosphere, because it is a major control on
atmospheric concentrations of carbon monoxide, ozone and methane. Understanding
what controls isoprene emissions from plants is critical for improving models of
atmospheric chemistry that are used in studying global climate change. This
project explores a new, potentially major control over isoprene emissions from
plants. Preliminary studies showed that partial defoliation of oaks resulted in
an unexpected increase in isoprene emissions from remaining leaves. Oaks are the
major isoprene-emitters in the eastern U.S., and are periodically subjected to
massive, wide-scale defoliation by an introduced forest insect pest, the Gypsy
Moth. This project will study the effects of defoliation on isoprene emissions
from oaks, using the information to improve existing models that predict
isoprene emissions from plants.
