A request is made to fund shipboard scientific support equipment on the R/V
Atlantic Explorer, a 168? general purpose research vessel owned and operated by
Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System. BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for-
profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New
York, and geographically located on the Island of Bermuda. The mission of the
ship is to support funded science research throughout the Central Atlantic but
specifically work in support of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series (BATS) program.
RV Atlantic Explorer had 120 days funded in 2017, all but 7 of which were for
NSF. In 2018, the vessel is scheduled to sail 183 days with 178 (98%) of them
funded by NSF. With this proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and
rationale for the acquisition of the following Shipboard Scientific Support
Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 ea Furuno Radar Systems $84,471 &lt;br/&gt;34
ea Survival Suits $13,656 &lt;br/&gt;Tachometer $20,284 &lt;br/&gt; $118,411
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the
present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines
(NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the
vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
