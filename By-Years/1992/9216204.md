Detailed vertical velocity shear measurements will be conducted in the fall of
1992 and spring of 1993 in support of the North Atlantic Tracer Release
Experiment (NATRE) using an autonomous profiler called Cartesian Diver. The
observations are to be conducted at four different locations in concert with
microstructure profiling. The scientific objectives of this study are to relate
turbulent mixing processes in the thermocline to the background internal wave
field and to relate direct diffusivity measurements obtained from tracer
diffusion to eddy diffusivity models based on turbulent dissipation rates.
