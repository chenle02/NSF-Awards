This award supports cooperative research in polymer engineering to be conducted
by Luis Garcia-Rubio of the University of South Florida and Gregorio Meira of
the Institute for the Technological Development of the Chemical Industry
(INTEC). Additional collaborators are from the National University of the South
and the National University of Mar del Plata. The work will involve the further
development of analytical procedures for polymers, copolymers and other complex
systems. The method to be employed is size-exclusion chromatography used on line
for the control of copolymerization reactors. Kinetic models for predicting
property distribution in copolymers will be validated. This work will take
advantage of the progress already being made by these scientists in the
characterization of copolymers and complex polymer systems. The prospects for
mutual benefit are strong since Prof. Rubio's forte is the specifically designed
model copolymer systems which must be coupled with complex data analysis of the
size-exclusion chromatograms which are the focus of Prof. Meira's work. The
expertise of the participants is complementary. Real progress should result from
the collaboration.
