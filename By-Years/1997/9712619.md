9712619 Dordick The Enzyme Engineering Conference is the longest, continuous
conference series that is sponsored by the Engineering Foundation. The first
meeting was held in New Hampshire in 1971 and every other year thereafter. The
meetings alternate between domestic and foreign locales. The conferences are
generally attended by 150-200 world leaders in enzyme engineering research. Over
half of the speakers are from foreign nations. The theme of the 1997 conference
is "technologies that have the potential for dramatically shaping biotechnology
and chemical technology in the 21st century". Leading enzyme scientists,
including many of our BES awardees (e.g., Arnold, Dordick, Clark) are
participants. Among the key sessions are: Protein engineering enzymes Fine
chemical synthesis using enzymes Extremozymes Artificial enzymes Environmental
biocatalysis Analytical applications of enzymes The conference will provide an
excellent opportunity for U.S. researchers to network with foreign scientists in
the field, many of whom come from countries with extensive enzyme-use history,
e.g., Japan. The proposal requests $12,000 from NSF to support the travel and
registration costs of six of the U.S. speakers. ***
