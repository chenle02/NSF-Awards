With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and
support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor
Viktor Nemykin from University of Minnesota Duluth and colleagues Steven Berry,
Venkatram Mereddy and Viktor Zhdankin will acquire a microTOFMS with
electrospray inionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
(APCI), and atmospheric-pressure photoionization (APPI) capabilities. In
general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to
identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in
complex matrices. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass
spectrometer where they are ionized into the parent ion and its fragment ions
and their masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection
and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. As a
primarily undergraduate institution, the faculty at the University of Minnesota
Duluth embraces undergraduate research experiences as one of the most important
outcomes of their research activities. The proposed instrument will directly
impact the research experiences of a large number of undergraduate and master
students within the three-year project period, and many more in years to come.
The instrument will be used in classroom and research activities.

The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially
in areas such as (a) determining structure, stability, and reactivity of small
organic, inorganic, and organometallic synthetic molecules; and (b)
investigating potentially bioactive compounds prepared using organic synthesis
approaches.
