The focus of this research is the development of efficient methods for the
preparation of functionalized thio- and phosphoglycosides and to use these
glycosides for diastereoselective synthesis of oligosaccharides. The focus of
the educational plan involves the development of programs, laboratories and
group activities that foster learning as an active rather than passive activity.
Collaborative learning will be stressed. With this CAREER award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research and educational plan of Dr. Kang Zhao
of the Department of Chemistry at New York University. Professor Zhao will focus
his research efforts on the development of an automated protocol that allows the
coupling of a variety of reactivity- modulated glycosyl donors with acceptors on
solid supports. The focus of Professor Zhao's educational plan involves the
development of programs laboratories and group activities that foster learning
as an active rather than passive activity. Collaborative learning will be
stressed.
