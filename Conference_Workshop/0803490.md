Abstract Higson

The proposal is for partial support of the East Coast Operator Algebra
Symposium (ECOAS). The ECOAS conference series has several objectives. One is to
help young researchers in operator algebras broaden their acquaintance with the
field. Another is to help acquaint them with senior researchers in operator
algebra theory (among them possible future colleagues, mentors and
collaborators). With these goals in mind, the ECOAS series places a heavy
emphasis on attracting young researchers to the meetings and giving them
opportunities to present their work and otherwise interact with established
figures. In the conferences in the series so far, over half of the participants
and a substantial number of the speakers have been students or postdoctoral
fellows.
