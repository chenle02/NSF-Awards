9622985 Ram This award supports the research of Professor A. Ram to work on the
connections between Lie algebras, quantum groups, Coxeter groups, their
representations and combinatorics. In particular he will study representations
of Iwahori-Hecke algebras and the centralizers algebras of tensor
representations with special emphasis on the combinatorial aspects of these
topics. For example, he hopes to obtain an explicit combinatorial formula that
gives the irreducible representations as well as their irreducible characters.
This is research in algebra. Algebra can be thought of as the study of symmetry
in the abstract. As such, it has direct applications to areas of physics and
chemistry. Much of algebra also connects directly to problems in coding theory
and so has a direct bearing on the very practical problem of error correcting in
data transfer.
