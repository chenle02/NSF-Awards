This project establishes an integrated laboratory to support instruction in
three areas. They are: (1) Development of software that must function in a real-
time, embedded system environment; (2) The interfacing of embedded computers to
their external environment; and (3) The relationship between embedded systems
and the external environment. The laboratory will consist of six Motorola VME-10
microcomputers that can be interconnected and/or networked through individual
serial or parallel devices or through an IEEE-488 bus. The VME-10 computers will
be used both singly and in combination to control plants simulated by COMDYNA
analog computers.
