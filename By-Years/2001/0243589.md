The University of Minnesota continues operating a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site is affiliated with the U. of Minnesota
Materials Research Science and Engineering Center. Ten undergraduate students
are recruited nationwide every year for a ten-week summer research experience.
Emphasis is placed on recruitment from four-year colleges, tribal colleges in
the upper Midwest, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Hispanic
Serving Institutions. Undergraduate students are involved in materials research
projects that include microstructured polymers, crystalline organic
semiconductors, and magnetic materials. In addition, REU participants attend
professional development workshops, research seminars and on-campus social
events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site also includes a Research Experiences
for Teachers (RET) component. Seven high school teachers are recruited every
year for a five-week summer research experience, with an option for accompanying
high school students for returning teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
