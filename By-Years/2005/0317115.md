In plants, cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) genes are able to spread by blocking
pollen production (male reproduction) because they are maternally inherited and
cause increased seed production. An individual that carries CMS has reduced
ability to transmit nuclear genes; thus, nuclear male fertility restoration (Rf)
genes have arisen to counteract the effects of the CMS genes by reinstating
pollen production. The Rf genes have a detrimental effect on overall
reproduction, however, called the cost of restoration, which is a key to
understanding the spread of CMS and Rf genes. The goal of this proposal is to
perform a powerful experiment to measure the cost of restoration in a plant
model system, Silene vulgaris. The cost of restoration will be measured as the
strength of the correlation between total reproductive output and the ability to
restore male fertility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies will provide
vital information regarding the spread of maternally inherited genetic diseases
and interactions between cytoplasmic and nuclear genes. Moreover, this research
may generate novel genes for crop breeding. An undergraduate assistant and a
postdoctoral associate will be trained, opportunities for graduate student
participation will be available, and new instrumentation will be purchased for
research at the University of Alaska. &lt;br/&gt;
