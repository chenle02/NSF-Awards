This project is a symposium in the honor of John von Neumann and is organized
by the American Mathematical Society and sponsored by the American Mathematical
Society and the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics. The symposium
will be held at Hofstra University in May and June of 1988 and will fall on the
85th anniversary of Neumann's birth. John von Neumann died in 1957. In addition
to support by the National Science Foundation, both IBM and the Sloan Foundation
will contribute support to this research symposium. Neumann is known as "the
father of the modern computer" and contributed significant research to many
fields including computer science, logic, ergodic theory, fluid mechanics,
quantum mechanics, atomic energy, algebra, measure theory, econometrics and
ordnance. The symposium will review the many accomplishments to science of John
von Neumann and will discuss the current state of research in the mathematical
fields that he helped to develop.
