Stark, Philip 95-04410 Acoustic vibrations of the Sun contain information about
the distributions of soundspeed, material density, and angular velocity within
the Sun. Current methods for imaging these properties of the solar interior from
helioseismic eigenfrequencies produce images that might resemble the Sun, but
the formal uncertainties of the techniques do not accurately quantify possible
differences between the models and the truth. Nor can the methods incorporate
physical constraints that might reduce the uncertainty. The effects of data
errors, choice of modeling algorithm, and theoretical approximations on the
reliability of the images are largely unexplored; published uncertainties
approximate the variability of the estimation method conditional on a particular
parametric representation of the solar property and a host of other assumptions,
without regard for possible biases. Dr. Stark will develop and apply methods to
study both the variability and the bias of estimates of the distribution of
soundspeed in the solar interior and the distribution of angular velocity in the
solar interior, under less restrictive assumptions. The bias can be controlled
using prior physical information about the Sun, such as bounds on either energy
or observed rotationally-induced oblateness. The work will also lead to new
methods to test hypotheses in the presence of infinite-dimensional nuisance
parameters.
