9508996 Hayes This proposal addresses corticosterone and thyroid hormone-
regulated gene expression during metamorphosis in two species of anuran, Xenopus
laevis and Bufo boreas. The specific aims are 1) to characterize CORT-regulated
genes isolated in previous studies 2) to isolate other hormone-regulated genes;
3) to further test for thyroid hormone-regulated genes in B. boreas; and 4) to
determine if thyroid hormone-regulated genes are also regulated by CORT. ***
