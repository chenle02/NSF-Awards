&lt;br/&gt;M.E. Mear, K. Ravi-Chandar and G.J. Rodin&lt;br/&gt;Center for
Mechanics of Solids, Structures and Materials&lt;br/&gt;The University of Texas
at Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Texas at Austin is
engaged in a four-year focused research effort aimed at providing the physical
underpinnings of three-dimensional (3-D) crack evolution through an integrated
theoretical, computational and experimental investigation. Specifically, we are:
(i) performing critical experiments that will provide insight into general
(mixed mode) 3-D fracture evolution, (ii) performing numerical analyses of the
experimental specimens/observations to determine the crack-tip fields
corresponding to crack growth, and (iii) developing criteria for crack growth
initiation and shape evolution which are consistent with the experimental
observations and numerical simulations. &lt;br/&gt;The technological importance
of this work stems from the staggering human and economic costs of structural
failure resulting from material fracture. This cost is compounded by the fact
that much of the infrastructure built in post World War II boom is aging yet
excessively expensive to replace. While significant progress in failure analysis
over the past four decades has aided in the design and analysis of fracture
critical and flaw/damage tolerant structures, limitations in the
characterization and modeling of flaws in their early stages of development have
restricted much of the success of fracture mechanics to situations where the
flaws are fully developed and admit treatment within a two-dimensional
framework. The objective of this investigation is to provide a basis for
overcoming these limitations. &lt;br/&gt;
