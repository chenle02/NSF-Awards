This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is in the area of bioinorganic chemistry. The focus of the project is
nonbiological metal-containing compounds which mimick the action of
monooxygenase enzymes. These enzymes, which catalyze the incorporation of oxygen
atoms from dioxygen into organic substrates, contain metal ions at their active
sites, principally heme iron, non-heme iron and copper. The mechanisms of the
reactions of these enzymes are not understood, and it has not been possible thus
far to duplicate their reactivities with nonbiological reagents. In an effort to
develop "reaction analogies" to the monooxygenase enzymes, reactions of
metalloporphyrin peroxo complexes are being studied to learn more about the role
of the O-O bond cleavage step in the heme enzymes. To mimick the action of non-
heme enzymes, where much less is known about the environment of the metal at the
active site, metal-mediated oxygen atom transfer from the single oxygen atom
donor iodosylbenzene to organic substrates is under investigation. Also under
study are iron-mediated oxygenation reactions using reagents containing intact
O-O bonds, i.e. dioxygen, superoxide and peroxide. The results of this research
will provide information useful in assessing mechanisms of dioxygen activation
in biological systems and in designing catalysts for oxygenation reactions for
use in the laboratory and in industrial applications.
