This International Institute on Complex Adaptive Matter (I2CAM) focuses on
networking interaction in the area of fundamental, complex phenomena in soft,
hard, and living matter. The International Materials Institute (IMI) is based at
the University of California and includes senior investigators from six
universities (U. of California, Princeton U., Rutgers U., U. of Chicago, U. of
Illinois at Urbana-Campaign, Florida State U.) and Los Alamos National
Laboratory. The broader US network incorporates participants from fourteen
universities and three national laboratories. International partners are located
in Western Europe (UK, France, Germany, Switzerland). The IMI builds on the ICAM
(Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter) multidisciplinary program of the U. of
California. The IMI supports fellowships for graduate students and postdoctoral
associates to conduct collaborative research projects at leading European
centers for several months, and to attend international workshops and summer
schools on emergent behavior in materials. The IMI also supports travel awards
for materials researchers to make short international visits to develop and
nurture collaborative projects. I2CAM also organizes an annual series of
international multidisciplinary workshops on emerging complex phenomena in
materials, and a US/Europe summer school on a frontier topic in complex adaptive
matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
