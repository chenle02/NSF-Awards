A synapse is a functional contact between two nerve cells (neurons). Chemical
synapses utilize compounds called neurotransmitters, which are molecules that
are released from the pre-synaptic cell to cross the tiny cleft between the
cells, and so transmit signals from one neuron to another. This project utilizes
synapses within the compound eye of a fruitfly, Drosophila, as a model system to
identify proteins responsible for synaptic signaling in the visual pathway. The
Drosophila eye offers the clear advantage of its well-known genetics to exploit
mutations in visual deficiencies that are easy to screen. A novel combination of
biochemistry and genetic techniques is used here to identify proteins that are
important in the basic functions of neurotransmitter synthesis, packaging and
release. Identifying molecules involved in transmitter release and localization
is a first step in understanding the complex series of events in signal
transmission across a synapse. Results will have impact not only on
understanding synaptic mechanisms at the molecular level, but also on the
genetic control of such mechanisms, on understanding visual function in the eye,
and on processes in general cell biology involving cellular carrier vesicles.
