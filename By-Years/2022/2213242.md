This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). Jessica Peña is awarded an NSF Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to conduct a
program of research and activities related to broadening participation by groups
underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship to Jessica Peña supports a research
project entitled "MPS-Ascend: High Altitude Filament Formation and Propagation",
under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the
fellowship is the University of Central Florida and the sponsoring scientist is
Dr. Martin Richardson.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Ultra-short pulse lasers with
sufficient peak power can form self-guiding optical structures called filaments
that can project high intensities over kilometer-scale distances in the Earth’s
atmosphere by forming plasma channels. Peña will define the nonlinear, or
filamentation, regime for various atmospheric pressures and conditions as well
as characterize how the filament properties are influenced by environmental
factors. Peña will be a mentor to students, as well as work with the Research
and Mentoring Program (RAMP) at the University of Central Florida, the American
Physical Society Bridge program, and the GEM Fellowship program nationally to
recruit and mentor students from underrepresented groups. This award is co-
funded by the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences in the NSF
Directorate for Geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
