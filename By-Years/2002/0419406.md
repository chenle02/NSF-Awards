This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop wear resistant and protective coatings for mechanical shaft seals based
on a novel material called Ultrananocrystalline (tm) diamond. Diamond, because
of its hardness, chemical inertness and low friction coefficient is an obvious
candidate for coating mechanical shaft seals. Conventional CVD diamond
technology (based on H2/CH4 gas chemistry), which produces microcrystalline (or
nanocrystalline) diamond is not suitable because of large grain sizes and high
internal stresses. The new process based on Ar/CH4 gas chemistry produces
diamond with small grain sizes (2-5 nm) and a surface roughness of about 20-30
nm which is ideally suited for such applications.

Mechanical shaft seals are used in almost every industry. The main functions of
these seals are to ensure that the pumping fluid does not escape the system and
to protect the fluids from contaminants. Presently, silicon carbide (SiC) is the
material of choice for most of the seals used in these industries. However,
several studies have shown that due to poor friction properties of this
material, almost 20% of the energy is lost due to friction. By improving the
efficiency of shaft seals in these devices by just factor of two, it is
estimated that a worldwide energy savings of 6x109 Kw-hr/year could be achieved.
