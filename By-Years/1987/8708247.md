This project is to continue studies of the temporal and petrochemical evolution
of the Society Islands chain. Volcanic and plutonic rocks and upper mantle
xenoliths have been collected to evaluate the parental magmas and
differentiation mechanisms for alkaline oceanic islands and geochemical
variations within these volcanoes. These studies will contrast with the better
known, but perhaps atypical, tholeiitic Hawaiian volcanoes. Both lineaments are
thought to arise from Pacific plate motion over stationary hotspots, and the
contrasting geochemical evolutions should reveal complexities in hotspot
structure and possible melt contributions from the oceanic lithosphere. Over 150
samples collected from two volcanoes on the island of Tahiti have been described
petrographically and their ages determined. These investigations will now be
extended to other volcanoes in the Society Islands and will involve a
collaborative program of radiometric, geochemical and esperimental studies at
Oregon State, and isotopic analyses by William White at Cornell. A large number
of new samples and geological maps are being supplied by French volcanologists
R. Brousse and H. Barsczus.
