9512708 Cummins The proposed U.S.-Brazil collaborative research will use
experiments with a class of materials closely related to metallic alloys to test
a recently advanced non-steady-state theory of interface evolution. Based on
materials discovered in 1965 but using techniques of videomicroscopy and
computerized image analysis, the relevant characteristics of the interface
profile and solute concentration field will be observed, extracted, and
analyzed. The project, led by Herman Cummins at CUNY in New York and Oscar
Mesquita at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Brazil,
will use equipment available at both sites. A second objective will be to
investigate the nature of the planar-to-cellular bifurcation, with potential
implications for materials preparation and design. The research addresses a
question of both theoretical and practical importance using the latest methods.
The ability to attack complex, non-linear problems of the nature proposed has
only developed in the past few years, opening the way for the proposed research.
The project pairs U.S. and Brazilian investigators with experience in related
problems, promising valuable results. ***
