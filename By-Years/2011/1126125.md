This Major Research Instrumentation grant supports acquisition of a
cyberinstrument at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute which combines a next
generation massively parallel computer with integrated large-scale high-
performance storage and visualization components. The cyberinstrument will
provide a well-balanced massively parallel computing platform capable of
supporting cutting edge research across a wide range of disciplines that require
both data and compute intensive simulations and visualizations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cyberinstrument will accelerate ongoing data-intensive
computational research, the development of new highly scalable algorithms, and
the education of the next generation of high-performance computing researchers
and practitioners at Rensselaer. The core of the cyberinstrument will be located
at Rensselaer's Computational Center for Nanotechnology Innovations (CCNI) which
supports over 600 users (researchers and students) from more than 50
universities, national laboratories, industrial research centers and small
businesses. The cyberinstrument will allow that user community to more strongly
focus on the development of the simulation tools needed for the future high core
count massively parallel computers and will accelerate new areas of data
intensive computing research. This outstanding balanced system will attract
researchers from universities across the United States. Specific emphasis will
be placed on attracting researchers from under-served groups.
