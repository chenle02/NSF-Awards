0449703 The slow dynamical adjustment of the deep ocean creates a computational
bottleneck for models of the ocean circulation. In particular, integrating ocean
GCMs to equilibrium remains prohibitively expensive, limiting our ability, for
example, to simulate climate under different (paleo) boundary conditions,
systematically explore sensitivity to parameters and representations of sub-grid
scale physics, or to study the ventilation of the ocean using tracers such as
natural radiocarbon. The goal of the proposed study accelerating the dynamical
spin up of ocean models with a recently developed method for efficient tracer
simulation in ocean models. This scheme, known as the "matrix method", makes it
feasible to directly obtain equilibrium solutions to the tracer equations
without explicit time integration. The matrix method, which is linear and exact
for passive tracers, will be adapted to the nonlinear spin up problem by
embedding it into an iterative algorithm to "shoot" toward an equilibrium
circulation. The proposed study will make extensive use of recent developments
in scientific computing and numerical analysis, in particular, the "Jacobian-
Free Newton-Krylov" class of methods.

The proposed study is exploratory and high-risk because the linear tracer model
will be extended to the non-linear spin-up problem. The accuracy and numerical
efficiency of the method is hard to predict until after it is developed.

Broader impacts: An important outcome of this research will be the development
of accurate and efficient methods for tracer simulation and GCM spin up. These
tools will be especially useful for paleoclimate studies. The proposed
algorithms will be implemented in the widely used MOM ocean GCM to ensure its
accesibility to a broad group of researchers. However, the techniques can be
applied to any existing GCM, and numerical code developed as part of this
research will be made freely available to the research community.
