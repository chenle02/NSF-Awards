This workshop has two goals. First, the workshop will bring together experts in
the field of computer science for the purpose of creating and rationalizing the
computer science curricula from the freshman year through the PhD. Second, the
workshop will serve as a tested for a design approach called the Generic Design
Methodology that has recently been developed. The workshop will test whether
this methodology can enable a group to work together efficiently to produce
good, well-documented results in a short time.
