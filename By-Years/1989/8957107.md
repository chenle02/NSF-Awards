The Principal Investigator (PI) is the recipient of a Presidential Young
Investigator Award. He proposes to investigate several distinct astrophysical
problems: The life histories of pulsars and their progenitors; gravitational
lensing by massive, extended galactic sources; and the adaptation of ideas from
optical speckle interferometry to radio astronomical imaging and from
interstellar scintillation to atmospheric seeing.
