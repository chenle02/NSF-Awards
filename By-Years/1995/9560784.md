9560784 Valenzuela This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project addresses reduced use and emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
during semiconductor manufacture. VOCs are solvents of active photoresist
material, and their emission is regulated by the Clean Air Act and by local
permitting agencies. This project is also part of NSF's 1995 initiative for
Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing. Presently, photoresist is dispensed at
the center of a spinning wafer. A very large excess is needed to achieve uniform
thickness because of the application only at the wafer center. This research
will apply a uniform layer over the entire wafer using ink jet printing
technology. With a distributed deposition, less photoresist is required for
final uniformity during spinning. Thickness uniformity will be tested by
SEMATECH, which will develop plans for subsequent prototype hardware tests in an
integrated circuit manufacturing environment.
