This investigation will seek to determine if an electronic connection can be
made between intracellular redox components of intact cells and an outside
circuit. Phase I will conduct experiments on a photosynthetic microorganism
(i.e., the blue- green algae, or cyanobacterium, Anacystis nidulans) for the
following reasons: 1) the photosynthetic redox apparatus is activated by light
and therefore convenient systems exist for initiating electron flow; and 2)
intact cyanobacteria cells are quite rugged and their photosynthetic electron
transport activity can be maintained over lengthy periods of time. It is
anticipated that this research will result in a broad-based technique that can
be applied to a range of microbes and cell types for the development of new
bioelectronic devices.
