This research investigates an interesting evolutionary trade-off in coreid
insects. Autotomy, the dropping of a limb, can be an effective trait to avoid
predation and entrapment. However, sometimes it comes at a high cost - not being
able to reproduce. The research adopts a multidimensional approach to
investigate the causes and consequences of the autotomy response in the Coreidae
clade (Insecta: Hemiptera), examining species that need the hind legs for
reproductive success and those where the legs play no role in successful mating.
The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Daiqin Li of the
National University of Singapore. Dr. Li is a leading behavioral ecologist with
expertise in anti-predator defenses in insects. The results of the research will
be valuable to other areas of biology, especially those involving evolutionary
trade-off. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Autotomy, induced limb removal, is an effective
trait used to avoid predation and entrapment. To investigate why coreids drop
their weapons, we need to investigate the interaction between autotomy and
reproductive selected weaponry. To do this, the PI will use a phylogenetic
context to identify the ancestral state leading to this interaction (i.e., is
autotomy ancestral to weaponry or vice versa?). Regardless of how this
interaction evolved, the negative consequences of losing a weapon persist. Thus,
the work will investigate if sexual selection has constrained autotomy to
increase weapon retention. If sexual selection constrains autotomy it would
suggest that sexual selection can constrain a naturally selected trait, lending
insights into the conflict between natural and sexual selection. In addition to
the research, this award will initiate a novel international collaborative
effort between the National University of Singapore and the University of
Florida.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer
Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is
jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Singapore.
