This project analyzes French and American working class cultures by drawing on
200 in-depth interviews conducted with randomly sampled white and African-
American working class men living the New York suburbs and with white and French
Algerian working class men living in the Paris suburbs. It examines the criteria
that these men use to define, and to discriminate between, worthy and less
worthy persons. Drawing on available data on French and American upper-middle
class cultures, the study will explore issues such as the extent of working
class resistance to upper-middle class culture, the decline of working class
cultural distinctiveness, and cultural difference between majority and minority
working class men. This study will make a significant contribution to the
understanding of national cultures and of racial differences within these
cultures.
