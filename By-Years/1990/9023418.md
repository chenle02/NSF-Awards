The primary objective of this US-Poland research project under the Marie
Sklodowska-Curie Joint Fund between Dr. William D. Myers, Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory, and Dr. Jan Blocki, Polish Institute for Nuclear Studies, is
development of a quantitative theory of nuclear dynamics. The work will examine
both classical and quantized particles in 1) potential wells of finite or
infinite depth and possessing sharp or diffuse surfaces, 2) the wells undergoing
periodic or aperidic shape changes of various multipolarities, and 3) fission-
like deformations that span regimes of regular and chaotic nucleonic motions.
These studies, in addition to advancing the theory of collective nuclear
dynamics, are expected to contribute to our knowledge of the quantal behavior of
a classically chaotic system. This project in nuclear dynamics fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and
pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
