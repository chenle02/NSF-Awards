This award will support a joint U.S.-Mexico workshop in numerical analysis to be
held in Oaxaca, Mexico in January 1992. Organized by Professor Richard Tapia of
Rice University and Professor Jean Pierre Hennart of the Institute for Applied
Mathematics (IIMAS) at the Universidad Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), the workshop
will emphasize numerical optimization, numerical linear algebra, and the
numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. This workshop
is sixth in a series of U.S.-Mexico workshops in numerical analysis that have
taken place since 1978. As such, these workshops have been very valuable in
helping to sustain the exchange of ideas and knowledge between outstanding
researchers on both sides of the border. Moreover, the workshop topics are
likely to be of increasing importance in future U.S.-Mexico scientific and
technological exchanges.
