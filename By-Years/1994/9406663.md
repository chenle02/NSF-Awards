9406663 Chassignet Data suggest that large number of vortices are present in the
ocean at any time and modern eddy-resolving general circulation models generate
vortices which are potentially od dynamically significance. This project is to
conduct theoretical and numerical studies of oceanic rings and vortices. In
particular, to study the interaction of vortices and external influences as
topography and shear. Particular attention will be given to stability of
convective rings. The results of the research will be used to the interpretation
of data and models, and will be very useful for the construction of future
models and the planning of field work.
