The effect of the acoustic waves on the atomization of a slurry jet by high
velocity air will be investigated. The atomized drop sizes will be measured with
a high speed camera at different resonant acoustic wavelengths, where the theory
indicates a finer and more uniform atomization. Semi- empirical models will be
used to correlate and interpret the measurements with Newtonian and
pseudoplastic suspensions. The goal is the controlled generation of micron and
sub-micron droplets, with narrow size distribution. The research is relevant to
powder production, spray coating, coal slurry combustion, and the use of
piezoelectric materials. The research project will involve several undergraduate
and graduate students in this predominantly undergraduate institution (RUI
proposal), where more than half of students are minorities.
