9311950 Shortliffe This research addresses the problem of modeling time in
dynamic domains given incomplete and uncertain information about the domain. The
dynamic network model (DNM) is a time-series model built on the belief-network
paradigm that employs classical time- series methodologies to provide a
mechanism for making unbiased forecasts. Domains exhibiting complex cyclical
behavior abound in all fields of science and engineering. The success of dynamic
models in these application domains is contingent on their ability to predict
the future cyclical behavior. Typically, these domains contain uncertainty in
the form of noise from perturbations by unmodeled exogenous forces. An
integrated framework will be provided for modeling cyclical behavior an
uncertainty. The methodology combines Fourier analysis, a powerful technique for
modeling periodic functions, and belief networks, an expressive knowledge
representation for modeling uncertainty.
