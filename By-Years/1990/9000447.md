The CEDAR ( Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) program
has as part of its main goal the understanding of the coupling between
atmospheric regions on a global scale. This project is directed towards
improving our understanding of the processes coupling the mid-latitude upper
atmospheric regions during magnetic storms. This will be done by analysis of
radar, optical and magnetic data collected at Millstone Hill Observatory and by
theoretical modeling. Specific issues to be addressed are equatorward surges in
the neutral winds during storms, the relative importance of the different energy
sources and coupling processes , such as temperature and compositional changes,
and electric field changes related to the dynamo set up by the enhanced
equatorward winds.***
