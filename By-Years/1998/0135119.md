CAREER&lt;br/&gt;Garnero&lt;br/&gt;0135119&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
describes a long-term research directive for studying &lt;br/&gt;Earth's deep
interior and related activities in science education in &lt;br/&gt;seismology
and geophysics. An undergraduate and graduate course in &lt;br/&gt;seismology
will be developed in Arizona State University's Department &lt;br/&gt;of
Geological Sciences, a department that has experienced recent
&lt;br/&gt;expansion in geophysics/seismology. Many topics in seismology are
&lt;br/&gt;beyond the scope of an undergraduate course that uses traditional
&lt;br/&gt;lecturing approaches. The new courses will utilize more three
&lt;br/&gt;dimensional visualizations using computer imaging and animation,
&lt;br/&gt;along with more interactive learning methods and analogies. Both the
&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate course will utilize already in-house
&lt;br/&gt;research tools to study aspects of seismic data from recent and past
&lt;br/&gt;relevant earthquakes. Emphasis on individual student and group
&lt;br/&gt;discovery will be emphasized in both classes. Research activities for
&lt;br/&gt;the proposed period focus on seismic studies of Earth's interior,
&lt;br/&gt;with emphasis on the deep mantle. Three main areas of focus are: (1)
&lt;br/&gt;determination of seismic heterogeneity, which is used to infer
&lt;br/&gt;thermal and/or chemical heterogeneity; (2) detection and
&lt;br/&gt;characterization of seismic wave speed anisotropy, which is related
&lt;br/&gt;to rheology, dynamics, and flow in the mantle; and (3) detection and
&lt;br/&gt;mapping of boundary layers and/or discontinuities in seismic
&lt;br/&gt;properties, which may relate to chemical or phase boundaries in the
&lt;br/&gt;Earth. The proposed work utilizes travel time and waveform analyses
&lt;br/&gt;of relevant seismic waves and tomographic analyses, and will utilize
&lt;br/&gt;two state of the art computer labs in the department, which are both
&lt;br/&gt;outfitted with modern PC and UNIX computers. Research efforts
&lt;br/&gt;characterizing heterogeneity, anisotropy, and boundary layering will
&lt;br/&gt;include 2- and 3-D travel time and waveform analysis and propagation
&lt;br/&gt;tools, an important next step in deep Earth seismology.&lt;br/&gt;--
