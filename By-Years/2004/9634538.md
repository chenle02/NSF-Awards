ABSTRACT Harritt, McCartney, Bodenhorn OPP-9528073. This small grant for
exploratory research is intended to bring the PIs together with the Alaska
Native Whaling Commission and the North Slope Borough History, Language and
Culture Commission for purposes of research planning and coordination. The focus
will be on prehistoric and contemporary whaling practices and cultures. Among
the primary questions to be addressed are the environmental contexts within
which whaling originated and developed, the varied importance of whaling through
time, oral traditions, gender roles, and ceremonialism. This combination of
scientific expertise with Native interests has great potentials and is in
keeping with the goal of creating research partnerships with native peoples. ??
