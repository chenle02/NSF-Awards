This award will provide support for the "First Annual Computation and Neural
Systems Meeting", to be held in San Francisco, July 26-31, 1992. The meeting
will bring together experimental and theoretical neurobiologists along with
engineers, computer scientists, cognitive scientists, physicists, and
mathematicians interested in understanding how biological neural systems
compute. The meeting will equally emphasize experimental, model-based, and more
abstract theoretical approaches to understanding neurobiological computations.
