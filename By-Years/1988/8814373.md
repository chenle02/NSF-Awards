This project under the direction of Dr. Gray will continue empirical diagnostic
analyses of climate data to elucidate climatic influences on the variability of
tropical cyclones. The research will focus on establishing the links between 1)
El Nino/Southern Oscillation and tropical cyclone occurrences and 2)
tropospheric and stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation and tropical cyclone
frequency. The ultimate goal is to improve our physical understanding of such
climatic relations and to determine their potential for seasonal prediction.
Specifically, this project will enhance our capability to forecast the Atlantic
seasonal hurricane activity well in advance of the hurricane season.
