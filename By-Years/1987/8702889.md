The objective of this research is to interpret, adapt and extend the concepts
and techniques associated with certain local and nonlocal bifurcations so that
they become valuable tools for system design, stability and feedback control
mechanisms. In particular, it will focus on theoretical issues, applicability to
several engineering systems, and computer-assisted graphics and computations.
Recent results on local bifurcations, chaos and Arnold diffusion will be
employed and further developed. Local bifurcations, chaos and Arnold diffusion
constitute an undesirable form of instability which has to be systematically
addressed in current engineering design and control methodologies. In
particular, they are not desirable in power systems, Josephson junctions or
adaptive and feedback control systems. The results of this work could be used as
proper design criteria for wide class of engineering systems.
