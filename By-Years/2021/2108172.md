This research project is a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the
abundances and properties of elements within the Solar System. The investigators
will update and refine so-called “solar abundances,” which are a fundamental
reference for determining the properties of gas and dust in space. Results from
the study will allow astronomers to accurately interpret observations of a
variety of stellar environments and understand how chemistry influences the
formation of stars and planets. This project will train a graduate student and
provide research opportunities for undergraduate students. Results from the
project are expected to be integrated into textbooks, and they will be broadly
applicable to physical sciences besides astrophysics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
work seeks to provide a fundamental framework for interpreting abundances and
chemical compositions of gas and dust in stellar environments. The researchers
will undertake a detailed assessment of elemental and isotopic compositions of
all chondritic meteorites and their components to evaluate and model apparent
differences in abundance between the solar photosphere and rare “CI chondrites.”
They will then use thermochemical models of gas and condensation chemistry to
address the apparent abundance variations of refractory elements between the Sun
and other G-type stars. The project is expected to result in a significant
update to the Solar System elemental and isotopic abundance reference set
derived from meteoritic and solar data. It will also complement spectroscopic
studies of the atmospheres and circumstellar shells of evolved stars, as well as
the analysis of presolar grains isolated from
meteorites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
