This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfields of
electrosynthesis and electrocatalysis. The thrust of this experimental effort is
to determine the suitability of fluorinated and unfluorinated high surface area
graphites as anode materials for the electrosynthesis of chlorate and
hypochlorite chemicals. The number of stable, inexpensive anode materials
available for the electrosythesis of chemicals, especially under highly
oxidative conditions, is quite limited. The effectiveness of these high surface
area graphite electrodes relative to that of conventional dimensionally stable
anodes (DSAs) Ä±RuO2 on Ti! and Pt/Ir coated titanium will be evaluated for these
two industrially important electrochemical processes. Cell operating
requirements and conversion efficiencies will be compared. The electrode
materials whose feasibility will be evaluated in this Phase I research could
provide equivalent or better performance than DSA electrodes, resulting in lower
capital costs for on-site production of these desirable chemicals. Following
demonstration of feasibility in Phase I, research in a subsequent Phase II
undertaking will continue these studies in larger scale electrochemical flow
cells.
