This research will investigate the potential for development of new
cutting/lubricating fluid slurries that would have significantly higher thermal
capacities than those currently available and would have potential application
to high-speed machining. Fluid slurries will be designed, fabricated, and tested
in both the laboratory and the machine shop to demonstrate the conceptual
feasibility for provision of superior cooling and lubricating performance for
machining operations at atmospheric pressure. The derivation of new cooling and
lubricating fluids with significantly improved thermal properties could increase
cutting tool life, improve product quality and uniformity, reduce time for tool
changing, increase production, reduce thermal distortion of products, facilitate
precision engineering, and reduce both fluid loss and operator exposure to
potentially hazardous fumes associated with vaporizing current fluids during
high-speed machining operations.
