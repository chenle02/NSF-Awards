The extends ENCOMPASS ı79,82,85-87! a prototype environment to support the
incremental construction of Ada programs using executable specifications and
formal techniques similar to the Vienna Development Method. In ENCOMPASS,
software is specified using PLEASE ı80,81,83,84! an executable specification
language which builds on logic-programming and database technology. In
ENCOMPASS, PLEASE specifications are incrementally refined into Ada
implementations; refinements can be verified using testing, peer review or
proof-based techniques. PLEASE supports the rigorous development of software:
parts of a system can be developed using completely formal methods, while other,
less critical parts are constructed using less expensive techniques. Systems can
be constructed using all the features of Ada, although at present not all Ada
constructs can be formally analyzed. The next phase of this research will extend
the formal description of both PLEASE and the development process based on it;
study the efficiency and scalability of the technologies used to implement
PLEASE and ENCOMPASS; investigate the use of PLEASE in the development of large
and parallel programs; and extend ENCOMPASS with more sophisticated, knowledge-
based tools.
