This project focuses substantial resources on a small set of highly capable
first-year students to inspire a greater fraction of them to pursue research
careers in science and engineering. Chemistry is the ideal course for this
because most science and engineering majors take it in their first year; physics
and engineering courses begin later. In 1990-91, we developed an intensive
first-year chemistry course for 40 of the very best new students in a class of
5000. The course introduces state-of-the-art chemical thought as early and as
often as possible. The cornerstone of the course is the Spring research project,
in which pairs of students engage in hands-on research in the laboratories of
chemistry professors. Student response to the course was overwhelmingly
positive. Eleven of the 25 students who participated planned to continue
research projects this Fall. This project will enhance the research experience
and the laboratories. This model course may convince other universities to focus
more resources on the very best science and engineering students in the critical
first year.
