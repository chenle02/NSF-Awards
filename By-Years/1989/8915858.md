Many workers have suggested that several deep-water (&gt;200 m) scleractinian
corals originated at relatively shallow water depths and deeper water
environments. A similar onshore-offshore pattern has been demonstrated for other
benthic macroinvertebrates as well. The goal of this research is to rigorously
document the paleoenvironmental history of deep-water azooxanthellate
scleractinian corals through field work and through examination of museum
collections in order to test hypotheses about the nature of observed patterns.
With planning grant monies PI will visit the Smithsonian Institution, the
British Museum (Natural History) and the Museum National D'Histoire Naturelle
(Paris) and the Institut de Paleontologie in order to examine the coral
collections and work with coral specialists at these institutions.
