A program of research with the three-antenna millimeter-wavelength array and the
85-foot telescope at the Hat Creek Observatory of the University of California
will be carried out. The 85-foot telescope will continue its participation in
the Very Long Baseline (VLBI) Network at centimeter wavelengths and will
continue in its large-scale spectroscopic surveys of the galaxy. The millimeter-
wavelength array will pursue continuum and spectral line mapping at 2.5 to
4.0-millimeter wavelengths. A wide class of problems will be attacked by both
staff and visitors, with a strong emphasis on star formation and the late stages
of stellar evolution. There will also be studies of the solar system, the
interstellar medium, supernova remnants, the distribution of molecular gas and
dust in both normal and active galaxies, radio galaxies and quasi-stellar
objects (QSO's) and the 2.7-k cosmic microwave background radiation. Receivers
for 1.3-millimeter- wavelength observations will be developed and then used to
make observations complementary to the current 3-millimeter wavelength studies.
