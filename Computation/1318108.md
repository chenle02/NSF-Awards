Three distinct projects that study the behavior of finite element methods (FEM)
will be considered. The first project is studying the pollution effects of
immersed boundaries in the immersed boundary finite element method. A sharp
error analysis will be given that measures how far one has to be from the
immersed boundary to obtain optimal convergence. The second project will involve
adaptive Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. Contraction properties of weakly
penalized DG methods will be proved. The final project is max-norm stability
analysis of inf-sup stable finite element methods for the Stokes problem. A
Fortin projection that is exponentially decaying will be constructed for the
lowest-order Taylor-Hood element in three dimensions. Exponentially decaying
projections will be an important tool to prove max-norm stability estimates.

FEM are widely used to simulate a variety of problems in engineering and
science. Users of these methods rely on theoretical results that give them some
guarantee of their reliability. The P.I. will use mathematical analysis to
describe the behavior of FEM for three important FE methods. In particular, the
P.I. will mathematically study the behavior of the immeresed boundary FEM which
is a method especially suited for fluid-solid interactions. For example, these
methods have been used to simulate blood flow and animal locomotion, to name a
few. The results of this investigation will give users theoretical guidance on
where to put more computational effort which in turn will make their simulations
more accurate for imporant applications.
