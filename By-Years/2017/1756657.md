One of the most pressing challenges we face today is online hacking of
communications by adversaries, including foreign adversaries. Non-human actors
on social media platforms, that is accounts controlled by computer algorithms
and colloquially known as Internet bots, are also playing an important part in
this process. This project will conduct a major investigation of the role of
Internet bots in public communications and political discussion. The project
will have wide benefit for understanding how bots play a role in opinion and
public policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal therefore is to
support the development of a theoretical framework for understanding the role of
domestic and foreign non-human actors in online communications and conversation,
methodological tools for both identifying bots and tracking their activity, and
empirical analyses that test hypotheses from the researchers' theoretical
framework using a unique collection of historical data. Theoretically, the
project will develop a two-part framework that can be applied to both domestic
and foreign adversaries. Methodologically, the researchers will build off of
previous methods they have developed for identifying bots in one particular time
and place to produce general methods for identifying bots in different times and
places; we will also develop and verify new (and test existing) methods for
tracking bot activity of the type their theories predict, and attempting to
influence search engines and social media
communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
