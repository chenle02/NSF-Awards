Proposal Title: I/UCRC: CELDi at MU&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Missouri-Columbia&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 03/30/2008&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
award establishes University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) as a research site of the
Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (I/UCRC) for the Center for
Engineering Logistics and Distribution (CELDi). Other sites of this
collaborative research center include the University of Arkansas (lead),
Oklahoma State University, Lehigh University, Clemson University, University of
Oklahoma, University of Louisville, Texas Tech University and Virginia Tech. The
mission of this center is to provide integrated solutions to logistics problems
through modeling, analysis, and intelligent systems technologies. MU will be a
strong partner of CELDi and should be able to immediately contribute to the
logistics systems analysis and design, supply chain modeling, and material flow
design and improvement. MU has a team of researchers who are capable of
providing immediate assistance in research related to the integration of
logistics components in large, complex inter/multi-modal systems. CELDi will
benefit from the expanded research expertise and involvement of top Fortune 500
companies that MU will bring to the table. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of
Missouri-Columbia will make significant contributions to the mission of CELDi.
The quality and quantity of research conducted will expand the impact of CELDi
in technical, educational and outreach activities. The research team at MU is
multidisciplinary with faculty participating from industrial engineering,
systems engineering and transportation engineering perspectives as well as
management logistics and agricultural economics. MU has a clear plan to involve
students in its research, and the nature of the proposal ensures that the
proposed research will have significant impact on industrial practice through
close collaboration with industrial partners. Both the undergraduate and
graduate education at MU will be positively impacted by MU?s participation in
CELDi.
