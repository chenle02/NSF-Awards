The project provides insights into such issues as the internal organization of
firms and the efficiency of large markets. The research emphasizes the role of
incentives and uncertainty in decentralized economic organizations. The results
show how the government can establish rules for bargaining with contractors that
are in its best interest and what bargaining procedures for the transfer of
items between divisions of the same firm promote the best interests of the
organization as a whole. The study of bargaining is focused on the goal of
comparing the efficiency of different bargaining procedures. These procedures
are modelled as Bayesian games. The project emphasizes the equilibrium bidding
strategies and welfare performance of k-double auctions, procedures used in the
London gold market. Results obtained from the analysis of k-double auctions are
used to derive general insights into the microstructure of an economy. A major
goal of this project is to prove for a given bargaining model that a competitive
market becomes efficient in the limit as the number of traders becomes large.
Partnership is modelled as a game where each partner privately chooses his own
contribution to the joint effort. This research examines the existence of rules
for fully sharing the joint output that will induce each partner to choose to
contribute the efficient amount of his input. It is shown that such rules may
exist when the joint output is not completely determined by the partners'
inputs. Sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of such rules.
