This award supports a specialty "Workshop on the Atmospheric Importance of
Biogenic Hydrocarbons" to be held at University of Virginia in Early Spring
2005. This workshop builds upon the recent Gordon Research Conference on
biogenic hydrocarbons and the atmosphere by specifically targeting: (1) a review
of multi-decadal changes in North America vegetation patterns and how changes
have modified hydrocarbon production rates; (2) a state of the science
evaluation regarding photooxidation of biogenic hydrocarbons and secondary
aerosol formation; and (3) developing new research strategies to improve current
understanding of the sources, fates, transport and transformations of biogenic
hydrocarbons. The broader impacts of this project include advancing our
understanding of the influences of biogenic hydrocarbons on atmospheric
composition, radiative transfer and climate. In addition, the workshop will
bring together established researchers and early career scientists, providing
invaluable opportunities for professional interactions in a focused and
productive forum. Travel support under this award will facilitate attendance by
a number of early career scientists from U.S. institutions, with particular
emphasis placed on attracting minority scientists.
