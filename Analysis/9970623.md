Lindblad's research concerns basic mathematical questions for systems of
nonlinear wave equations which include several important equations in physics,
for instance, in classical field theory and continuum mechanics as well as in
classical physics, e.g. Einstein's equations, the Yang-Mills equation and the
equation of nonlinear elasticity. These basic questions are: (i) Do we have
local existence and uniqueness of solutions in a certain class? (ii) Do we have
blow-up of solutions? (e.g. black holes in general relativity) (iii) What is the
long time behavior of solutions? More specifically, Lindblad is working on two
projects. One with Demetri Christodoulou on proving the well-posedness for a
class of problems that occurr in fluid dynamics and general relativity, in
particular proving the well-posedness for the free boundary problem of the
surface of a fluid in vacuum. Another project is to study how regular initial
data needed to ensure the existence of a local solution to nonlinear wave
equations, in particular constructing counterexamples to local existence. These
two problems are related to the question of whether the fundamental equations in
physics have global solutions. Solution to these questions could have important
consequences. For instance, it is conceivable that one could use the knowledge
obtained from the solutions of Einstein's equations to permit the use of
gravitational waves to observe the Universe. To solve these problems Linblad and
his collaborators are developing completely new techniques that could be useful
for studying many other problems as well, e.g. the properties of the interface
between two fluids. Such a result would have industrial applications.
