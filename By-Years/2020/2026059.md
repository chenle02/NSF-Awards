The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project will develop a new process to reshape batteries through
rapid, custom manufacturing. The battery industryâ€™s manufacturing process has
remained relatively unchanged over the past 40 years, impacting applications
such as Digital Health and the Internet of Things (IoT). This project will
develop a novel platform for battery manufacturing using a cure-on-command
technology, which will expedite the components curing process from hours to
seconds. The cure-on-command technology will provide added multiple benefits to
battery manufacturing through elimination of certain processing steps, such as
cost savings, capital equipment savings of 3x, and environmental
friendliness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aims of this project are to benchmark the
benefits of cure-on-command technology for rapid manufacturing of battery
components, demonstrate its application for ultra-thin, flexible batteries, and
highlight its technical and economic benefits to battery manufacturing. The
biggest hurdle to new methods in battery manufacturing has been the thermal
evaporation process, which is a slow (&lt;67 m2/min) and toxic process. This
project will advance a faster (&gt;500 m2/min) curing process. The key
objectives of this proposal will be: (1) formulate zinc-silver oxide battery
materials with cure-on-command technology, (2) test performance and durability
of batteries in comparison with the state-of-the-art battery manufacturing
process and materials, and (3) integrate and test a small prototype battery
(20-220 mAh) to replace bulky, rigid coin cells in devices for Digital Health
and IoT applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
