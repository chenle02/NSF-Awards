Macaulay 2 is one of the leading computer algebra systems for research and
teaching in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. The ability to perform
increasingly complicated computations in more and more areas of these two fields
continues to revolutionize both research in algebraic geometry and commutative
algebra and the breadth of the applications of these fields to other areas of
research. Most of the other related computer algebra systems are based in
foreign countries and continued competitiveness of Macaulay 2, a leading United
States--based program, depends on both a broad community contributing to its
development and the funding to support this community through intensive
workgroup meetings.

Two intensive workshops for generating and improving key ``packages'' for
Macaulay 2 will be held January 7-13, 2010 and in August, 2010. Approximately 30
researchers will attend each workshop. The main objective is to implement
algorithms in the following three rapidly growing areas: algebraic statistics,
numerical algebraic geometry and toric geometry. These areas have significant
applications in fields as diverse as computational biology, data analysis and
statistics. It is the expectation, therefore, that the packages developed
through this workshop will advance our knowledge and understanding across
multiple disciplines. The participation of both experienced and novice
researchers from a variety of institutions is crucial to the work of these
workshops. These intensive workshops are also a great opportunity for graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows to enhance their package-writing skills early
in their careers, taking advantage of the experience and research expertise of
the more senior researchers as well as sharing their own expertise with the
group. A strong presence rom young researchers also helps the base of
mathematicians programming for Macaulay 2 to grow over time. Travel and lodging
support for these workshops are critical to both the intensive nature of the
workshop and to the future development of Macaulay 2.
