Submillimeter Continuum Observations of Comets. Dr. Jewitt will make a detailed
investigation of the submillimeter continua of comets, using primarily the 15
meter diameter James Clerk Maxwell Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. The
submillimeter wavelength region of the cometary continuum is essentially
unexplored. Only a small number of comets have yet been observed in the
millimeter and submillimeter regions of the spectrum. The submillimeter
continuum from comets is produced by thermal emission from the nucleus and from
large grains in the coma. The large grains present a small fraction of the total
cross section in cometary dust, but they may carry a large fraction of the total
grain mass. Therefore, measurements of the large grains are of unique value in
the study of the mass production rates of comets.
