ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DIRECT NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF TURBULENT DROP
DISPERSION &lt;br/&gt;David P. Schmidt and J. Blair Perot&lt;br/&gt;University
of Massachusetts-Amherst&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Droplets deform and dissipate
energy in response to turbulent gas velocity fluctuations, creating complex
interphase coupling. Nearly all past efforts have treated the particles as
points and determined drag from simple solid-particle correlations. The current
work will provide the information missing from past Direct Numerical Simulation
efforts by calculating the gas and liquid behavior in unprecedented detail. The
proposed work will simulate the droplets as well-resolved, deforming fluid
domains. The exact location of the fluid interface will be tracked using novel
moving-mesh methods. Every detail of the liquid and gas phases will simulated
directly, based only on first principles. The simulations will be run in
parallel on the P.I.s' 180 CPU Beowulf cluster. The results will show how the
complex drag behavior of realistic droplets creates resonance with eddies, wake
vorticity, and additional dissipation. Most importantly, the motion of the
droplets will provide valuable data for understanding turbulent droplet
dispersion.&lt;br/&gt;
