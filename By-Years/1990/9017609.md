The Diatom Collection of the California Academy of Sciences is the largest
systematic reference collection of its type in western North America. It
includes more than 37,000 prepared slides and hundreds of type specimens.
Marine, freshwater, and fossil diatom samples from the western U.S. and the
Pacific margin make this collection an internationally important resource. Dr.
John P. Kociolek, Curator of Diatoms, has initiated a multifaceted program aimed
at improving the accessibility of the collection, and increasing its impact on
systematic, evolutionary, and ecological research. The donated collections
within the larger holdings will be integrated and entered into a computer
database, and unprepared samples will be processed into usable specimen slides.
Natural history collections such as this are the foundations on which diverse
biological research is based. Ecology, evolutionary biology, and biogeography
are but three of the many scientific disciplines that rely on systematic
collections. Supporting the growth and improvement of these collections will
provide future generations of investigators with the essential tools of
biological research.
