This project provides resources to procure the elements of a testbed for
investigating the fundamental concepts and feasibility of damage mitigating
control and its design. The problem is as follows. More often than not,
controller design for many processes focuses on optimization of dynamic
performance under constraints that do not include or represent the structural or
material limits of the system components. The equipment secured through this
award supports research which addresses generic design methodology which would
provide a trade-off between system dynamic performance and its life span. The
hope and intent are that such an enhanced controller will reduce the detrimental
effects of fatigue, creep, and wear of system components. The equipment itself
comprises an electro-mechanical shaker system, and computer and data acquisition
systems.
