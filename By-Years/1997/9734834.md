***&lt;br/&gt;9734834&lt;br/&gt;Hiscock&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Hiscock's research group
will continue their work on semiclassical effects on black hole geometries, with
particular emphasis on whether zero-temperature black hole "remnants"
(representing possible endpoints of black hole evaporation) are possible within
semiclassical gravity, and on semiclassical effects on the causal structure of
black hole interiors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While it is widely accepted that
semiclassical gravity is at best an approximation to some as yet ill-defined
full theory of quantum gravity, it is nevertheless the best present tool
available for the study of quantum effects in strong gravitational fields, such
as around black holes and near the Big Bang. The present work will extend our
knowledge of semiclassical effects in these regimes, and act as checks for
calculations in proposed fundamental theories of quantum
gravity.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
