Proposal Title: PECASE: Quantifying Erosional Processes on Upland Landscapes
Institution: Dartmouth College

PI proposes a five-year research project to quantify specific constitutive
relationships for sediment production and transport processes, integrating
methodologies and building the synergy between learning and discovery into an
education plan. Research will test hypotheses to (1) quantify erodability, or
mechanical strength, of parent material across landscapes with known soil
production functions, (2) quantify soil production rates and processes across
portions of the landscape not examined previously, and (3) quantify the
mechanisms of sediment transport across the same landscapes to better define
widely applicable erosion laws. Specifically, PI will use lab and field testing
to determine the mechanical state of the parent material, in situ produced
cosmogenic nuclides (10Be and 26Al) to determine soil production and catchment-
averaged erosion rates, and short-lived fallout nuclides (7Be, 210Pb, 137Cs, and
241Am) coupled with a numerical model to quantify sediment transport processes
on the same sites. These independent methodologies will be used to test three
fundamental hypotheses underlying our understanding of actively eroding soil-
mantled landscapes. These hypotheses are all field-testable, link the processes
shaping a landscape and may help explain the variability among soil-mantled
landscapes, yet they have not been quantitatively tested to date. Additionally,
work at each field site will address specific questions regarding the transport
laws best describing the dominant geomorphic processes operating on the sites as
well as the weathering history of the sites."

This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a
Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in
September 2004.
