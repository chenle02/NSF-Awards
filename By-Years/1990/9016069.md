This project will measure the rates of NH+4 and NO-3 assimilation,
nitrification and nitrogen fixation in the Sargasso Sea over a seasonal cycle in
conjunction with the ongoing Bermuda Atlantic time series (BATS) study. These
measurements are designed to assess the rate of new production, including both
nitrate uptake by the plankton and nitrogen fixation, and to assess the
regeneration rates of the inorganic substrates. Size fractionation by filtration
and cell sorting by flow cytometry will be used to identify the assimilation of
inorganic nitrogen by different components of the plankton community. Studies of
the nitrogen cycle in an oligotrophic gyre over a seasonal cycle, together with
other U.S. JGOFS research, will increase our understanding of the physical and
biological controls on new and regenerated production. The nitrogen cycling
measurements will employ trace metal clean precautions during ondeck incubations
with 15N. Recently improved analytical techniques for measuring low ambient
concentrations of NH+4 and NO-3 will be used to monitor nutrient concentrations
during the multiple time point incubations and to ensure tracer level additions
are made. Care will be taken to account for substrate regeneration and to
construct an inventory of the added label.
