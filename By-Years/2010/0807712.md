This research project is an analytical and numerical study of statistical
transport under complex, non-conservative particle interactions. The models
under study include kinetic integro-differential equations of Boltzmann type and
semiclassical quantum probability transport models. Modeling, analysis, and
development of numerical methods will be conducted in three primary problem
areas:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Statistical models related to energy-dissipative phenomena,
including hard sphere equations for kinetic models of rapid granular flow and
dynamics of gas mixtures. &lt;br/&gt;(2) Mesoscale kinetic systems modeled by
Boltzmann-Poisson and Vlasov-Poisson systems under strong shear forces induced
by electric fields or by boundary driving forces. &lt;br/&gt;(3) Semiclassical
quantum trajectory models for flow of quantum probability distributions, with
application to problems in nanoscale modeling.&lt;br/&gt;New tools from non-
linear analysis as well as new computational strategies will be developed to
establish links from quantum to kinetic to fluid levels of
modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research concerns the development and
analysis of mathematical models for a number of important scientific problems.
The models, which arise in biological, social, and physical sciences, describe
statistically the transport of large numbers of interacting objects.
Applications include modeling of rapid granular flows, chemically reacting gas
mixtures, distribution of wealth in economic systems, opinion dynamics, and
semiconductor behavior. This project will develop new mathematical tools that
aid in the analysis of such models and their use in predicting the behavior of
these complicated systems.&lt;br/&gt;
