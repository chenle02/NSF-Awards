A microcomputer-based laboratory employing visual image processing technology is
being developed for sociology courses that focus on mass media, mass media and
communication, and cultural analysis. Students will use image processing
computer applications to complete standardized laboratory projects, and to
engage in independent study projects on topics in mass media and cultural
studies, e.g. gender roles and gender stereotypes in the mass media.
