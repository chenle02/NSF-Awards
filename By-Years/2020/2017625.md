The 4th International Conference on Sign Language Acquisition (ICSLA) will
convene virtually; this will be the first time the conference has had a United
States host. This triennial conference gathers global experts on sign language
acquisition. Studying the acquisition of sign languages greatly enhances our
understanding of general language development, relationships between input and
proficiency, multilingualism, and the possibilities (and limitations) of the
human ability to learn language. The invited keynote presenters will discuss
unique insights from sign language acquisition with respect to three central
foci: (1) variable language input, (2) neural plasticity and neurodiversity, and
(3) modality (signing, speaking, writing). This research also has the potential
for profound impacts on the lives of deaf and hard of hearing children and their
families. To this end, the conference will include professional development
activities designed to draw practitioners in aligned fields including sign
language teaching, deaf education, early intervention, and speech-language
pathology. The goal is to make sign language acquisition research accessible to
practitioners, and to inform researchers of the practical needs of people
working most closely with deaf children. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding from the
National Science Foundation will support education and enhance accessibility,
diversity, and inclusion at ICSLA by subsidizing costs for students and
attendees from underrepresented groups, and by providing for all conference
activities to be accessible in English, American Sign Language, and
International Sign. Many researchers in this field are themselves deaf or hard-
of-hearing. Four of our six invited keynote presenters are deaf, and there are
deaf members of the planning and scientific committees. Deaf students will
receive mentoring through these role models. We aim to set an example by doing
more than simply providing access to deaf participants, but centering the
conference on the experiences and expertise of deaf children, students,
educators, and researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
