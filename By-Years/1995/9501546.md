In this project the investigators will study tail current disruption during
substorms by making use of multisatellite observations. Tail current disruption
plays an important role in releasing magnetic energy which has been stored in
the near-Earth tail before a substorm onset. Recent observations have shown that
tail current disruption initiates in the near-Earth magnetotail and then expands
both azimuthally and radially, corresponding to the expansion of substorm
activities at the ionosphere. Thus, the spatial expansion of tail current
disruption is one of the most essential features associated with substorms. The
main objectives of the project are (1) to find the dependence of the spatial
developmental of tail current disruption on tail magnetic configurations, and
(2) to find magnetic conditions that are necessary for triggering the (local)
onsets of tail current disruption. To achieve these objectives the investigators
will focus on preonset magnetic conditions . Data to be used include: magnetic
field data from geostationary satellites and elliptically orbiting satellites.
Magnetic signatures will be interpreted in terms of the tail field configuration
and the enhancement in the tail current intensity. This study is the first
attempt to statistically examine the mechanisms of the trigger and the spatial
development of current disruption in terms of preonset magnetic configurations.
The understanding of such mechanisms is one of the main goals of magnetospheric
physics. The results of this project will put important constraints on future
theoretical and observational studies of substorm physics, and will be useful as
an input for more global studies, such as coordinated ground and satellite data
analyses and global simulations of magnetospheric substorms.
