This award provides funding to help defray the travel expenses of participants
in the conference "Quantum Symmetries: Subfactors and Planar Algebras Conference
2017" that will be held from July 17-21, 2017 in Maui, HI.

This conference will use planar algebras and the theory of subfactors to study
quantum symmetry. The conference will be unique among recent subfactor
conferences. Whereas many such conferences have dealt with relationship of
subfactors with physics or conformal field theory, this conference will focus on
the planar algebra descriptions of subfactor standard invariants. The conference
will bring together leading experts for a concentrated look at this specific
area. The award funds will be primarily directed to support graduate student and
postdoc participation. This will provide an important opportunity for these
junior researchers to learn of the state-of-the-art of the field, interact with
leading researchers in the field, and develop contacts for future collaboration.
