Handheld computing devices with wireless network connections have a great
potential to be powerful mobile tools to access information and software
resources in the networked world. Unfortunately, the computing power and
connection time of current handheld devices are severely constrained by the
short battery life. Moreover, the battery issue also places constraints on
various design aspects including program memory and secondary storage, CPU, and
operating system. With connection to computing servers through wireless
networks, there exist many opportunities for handheld devices to save battery by
carefully utilizing the power of the servers. This project explores compiler and
run-time techniques to assist the partitioning of application programs into
server tasks and client tasks. The optimal partition depends on available
network bandwidth and on the nature of applications. In order for handheld
devices to optimally exploit servers for a wide range of applications, careful
tradeoff is made between energy consumed by network communication versus
computation. The proposed compiler techniques and run-time support include
compile-time and run-time analysis of work and communication requirement,
exploitation of low-power networking states on handhelds, run-time decision-
making, and a light-weight software coherence mechanism.
