The aim of the research described is to develop transformed plant varieties with
enhanced freezing tolerance through the expression of antifreeze proteins that
inhibit ice crystal growth. We have shown that tobacco and tomato plants
transformed with a winter flounder antifreeze gene express high levels of the
corresponding mRNA. Furthermore, the gene was modified so that the encoded
protein is larger and more readily detected. In plants containing this fusion
protein, antifreeze expression was observed at the RNA, protein and activity
level, with transcriptional levels predominating. We will now evaluate the
impact of antifreeze protein on the freezing tolerance properties of fruit from
transgenic plants as well as from nontransgenic fruits that have been
infiltrated with antifreeze protein. If necessary, we will optimize the protein
concentration in plant tissue by enhancing protein activity, protein stability,
transcription, and translatability. Constructions resulting in optimal freezing
tolerance will be transferred into appropriate commercial varieties.***//
