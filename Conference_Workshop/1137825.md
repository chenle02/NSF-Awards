This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at the
University of California at Santa Cruz in the summer of 2012 on the topic of
statistical model uncertainty and multiplicity. The principal speaker will be
Professor James Berger from Duke University. This award will support 29
participants at different stages of their careers.

The conference will address longstanding methodological challenges of
statistical model uncertainty and multiplicity along with the recent
developments in the area that have been driven by 21st century scientific
applications such as complex models and large data sets. The conference aims to
attract new researchers to this field by providing a well-organized overview and
also intends to strengthen links and collaborations between multiple groups of
researchers in the western United States.
