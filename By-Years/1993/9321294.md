9321294 Jewitt Dr. Jewitt will conduct a concentrated program of direct and
coronagraphic imaging of the split comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 prior to and during
its encounter with Jupiter in July 1994. Optical images of the comet will be
used to study the morphological and photometric changes induced by gravitational
stresses from Jupiter, as well as changes caused by passage through the inner
magnetosphere. Images of the sunlit face of the planet will be used to record
changes produced there by the impacts. The observations exploit the fine-seeing,
low-scattering optical environment on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, and utilize an existing
coronagraphic/CCD system.
