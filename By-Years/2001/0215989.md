AST-0215989&lt;br/&gt;Thompson, Ian B.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An infrared echelle
spectrograph will be designed, fabricated, assembled and tested for use at the
Magellan II telescope by researchers associated with the Magellan consortium. It
will be capable of observing faint targets in the wavelength region in the UV
(blueward of 3600 Angstroms), while maintaining high resolution and full
wavelength coverage of the visible spectrum. The design incorporates a medium
order reflection diffraction grating in combination with a large fused-silica
prism to provide cross dispersion. A Schmidt camera with 140-mm focal length
will focus the 100 mm collimated beam onto a low noise; back illuminated CCD
optimized for UV coverage. &lt;br/&gt;***
