This award will support Dr. Amy M. Shachter, Santa Clara University, and Dr.
Michael P. Doyle, University of Maryland, to organize and conduct a workshop on
"Implementation of Undergraduate Research Centers". The goal of the
Undergraduate Research Center (URC) program is to test new models for engaging
large numbers of first- and second-year college students in research with the
overall goal of ensuring sufficient numbers of well-prepared chemists for the
future scientific workforce. This workshop will provide an opportunity to (1)
communicate the goals of the URC program and to (2) share best practices on such
common themes as center management, student recruitment and selection, student
assessment, and program evaluation. This workshop will bring together a diverse
group of participants including invited speakers, FY04 URC planning grant
awardees, and other potential PIs of future URC proposals. The outcomes of the
workshop discussions will provide the basis for a workshop report for greater
dissemination.
