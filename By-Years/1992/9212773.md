This grant is for partial support of the seventh meeting of the APS division of
particles and fields. This conference is in a series of meetings, the last of
which was in Vancouver, Canada in August 1991. It provides a forum for the
presentation of the latest results in High Energy Physics, in both plenary and
parallel sessions. It encourages the participation of young workers in the
field, and as such provides some visibility for the work of graduate students
and post docs.
