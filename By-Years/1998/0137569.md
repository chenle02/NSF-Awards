Professor Joel Harris of the University of Utah is funded by the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program to study single molecule fluorescence imaging and
optical trapping techniques for the study of colloids and colloid-derived
materials (e.g. silica). Single molecule fluorescence imaging spectroscopy will
be used to determine distributions of dye labels, to count reactive surface
sites, and to determine particle volume and areas. Optical trapping will provide
long residence times to observe Raman scattering and determine chemical
composition of individual particles and kinetics of surface reactions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wide variety of chemical materials and industrial
processes depend on the dispersion of finely divided solid materials in liquids,
and probing the chemistry of these particles is a challenge for chemical
analysis. The combination of single molecule spectroscopy and optical trapping
is being used by others, especially in biological chemistry, but the proposal to
use these on colloidal particles is unique.
