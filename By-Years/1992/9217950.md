This proposal addresses one of the most elusive problems in marine bacterial
symbiosis research: that of the mode and mechanisms of symbiont inheritance. Our
recent rDNA/rRNA-based hybridization probe studies have demonstrated the
efficacy of these techniques in resolving low copies of symbiont target within
host tissues. A trans-ovarial mechanism of symbiont transmission has now been
identified in several species of deep-sea Vesicomyid clams, however the
developmental process of symbiont incorporation cannot be elucidated in these
deep-sea representatives. With initial studies completed we propose to employ a
similar suite of molecular tools with several novel additions to examine the
ontogenetic and biochemical process of bacterial symbiont incorporation in the
protobranch bivalve Someya reidi. Specifically we will: 1) determine the mode of
symbiont transmission and ontogenetic process of incorporation into the gill
tissue, 2) to may the metabolic state of the symbionts during the incorporation
process and determine the role of the symbionts in the hosts early development
using quantitative fluorescence microscopy, and 3) to examine the symbiont role
in environmental cue detection and the process of settlement by monitoring the
expression of key metabolic enzymes in the symbionts.
