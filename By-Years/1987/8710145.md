This project continues research into the operation of labor markets. Under the
previous award the investigator published a number of papers focusing on a
variety of related topics including: (a) the determinants of earning and the
distribution of income, (b) an analysis of the impact of manpower training
programs on earnings, the value of longitudinal data, and the more general
issues of the econometrics of selection-bias models, (c) the development and
testing duration analysis models. This project will extent the previous work in
terms of three broad topics. The first is on the development and assessment of
non-experimental estimators for selection-bias problems. The methodology is
applied to the further evaluation of the impact of manpower training programs on
earnings, employment, and unemployment. The benefits of various types of
econometric estimators will be assessed. The benefits of longitudinal and
experimental data well also be explored, and data sets analyzed in the previous
work will be re-analyzed and a variety of new estimators will be developed. The
second topic is on econometric duration analysis. An estimator for duration
models using data with unobservable components will be developed and evaluated.
The third topic focuses on the analysis of black wage-structures and earnings in
the South Carolina labor market during the 1910 to 1980 period. Data from this
period will be used to assess the relative importance of government pressure,
the growth in schooling, and secular and cyclical market factors in accounting
for the breakthrough in black employment and wages observed in that state during
the mid 1960's.
