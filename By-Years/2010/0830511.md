Scheduling policies are explicitly (or implicitly) used everywhere that
resources need to be allocated, and resultantly the theory of scheduling has a
long and varied history. Out of this large body of work, two distinct research
communities have emerged and, unfortunately, researchers in each community are
often not aware of results from the other community. One set of researchers from
the theoretical computer science and optimization communities has focused on
providing competitive guarantees for scheduling disciplines in the worst-case
environment. A different set of researchers, from the performance modeling and
applied probability communities, has focused on providing exact performance
analyses of scheduling policies in stochastic/probabilistic environments. Each
of these approaches have specific advantages and disadvantages when carried out
on their own. The aim of this project is to develop techniques that can achieve
the "best of both worlds", i.e., to combine ideas from each community to arrive
at results neither has been able to achieve alone. Specifically, the goal of
this project is to develop approaches that combine worst-case results and
techniques with qualitative and quantitative techniques for analyzing stochastic
models, thus combining the breadth of models where worst-case results can be
applied with the real-world applicability of stochastic analysis. This is an
ambitious goal, but one that will open up a new avenue of research in an
important, well established field. If successful, it can bring together ideas
from two distinct communities which attack similar problems with very different
techniques, and thus is likely to identify new scheduling disciplines that will
impact system design in practice. Additionally, the project will have a broad
impact on the education of both undergraduate and graduate students through the
development of a new unified approach to teaching scheduling theory.
