9311075 Orme The award is for a high-speed x-y positioning system that will be
incorporated in an existing facility which is used in ongoing work supported by
NSF to demonstrate the ability to enhance the microstructure of net-formed
materials by using the new materials synthesis technique. The technique involves
the generation of streams of molten metal droplets that are directed onto a
temperature controlled substrate where they undergo rapid solidification.
Control of the solidification phenomena leads to control and manipulation of the
materials's microstructure. With the incorporation of the proposed high speed
positioning system the microstructure can be refined to exhibit grain sizes on a
nanoscale (with grains &lt; 100nm in at least one dimension). Significant
scientific interest is recently directed towards nanophase materials synthesis.
Properties which are associated with nanophase materials such as increased
thermal expansion, reduced density, increased strength and specific heat as well
as a supermodulus effect, have given these materials numerous new engineering
applications. The proposed high-speed positioning system will allow the
demonstration of the fabrication of nanophase materials with the new materials
synthesis technique.
