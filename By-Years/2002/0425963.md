The purpose of this grant is to provide support for student travel to the 29th
IEEE Local Computer Networks (LCN) conference, being held in Tampa, Florida on
November 16 to 18, 2004. The LCN conference is a longstanding conference
covering all aspects of computer networking, with participants from the USA,
Europe, and Asia. This grant offers support for not only student paper authors,
but also for student attendees from a state university serving under-represented
populations. This conference travel support insures that deserving students will
be able to participate in the conference, thereby nurturing the next generation
of researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
