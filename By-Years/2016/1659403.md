Advancing discovery in many scientific fields depends crucially on our
ability&lt;br/&gt;to extract the wealth of knowledge buried in massive datasets
whose scale and complexity continue&lt;br/&gt;to grow exponentially with time.
In order to address this fundamental challenge, this project
will&lt;br/&gt;develop and deploy SANDIE, a Named Data Networking (NDN)
architecture supported by advanced&lt;br/&gt;Software Defined Network services
for Data Intensive Science, with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) high
energy&lt;br/&gt;physics program as the leading use case.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The implementation of SANDIE will leverage two state of
the art testbeds: the NDN testbed hosted and serving the
climate&lt;br/&gt;science community at Colorado State, and the SDN testbed
hosted at Caltech. Building on these facilities, and the support for SDN
services&lt;br/&gt;From multiple advanced Research &amp; Education network
partners,&lt;br/&gt;we will deploy a set of ten high performance, relatively low
cost NDN edge caches with SSDs&lt;br/&gt;and 40G or 100G network interfaces at
six participating sites: Caltech, Northeastern, UCSD,&lt;br/&gt;University of
Florida, MIT and CERN, together with an existing cache at CSU.
