The Nucleic Acid Database (NDB; http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu/) is a mature
resource that provides information about crystalline macromolecules that contain
nucleic acid. The NDB distributes information about structure through the NDB
Web site and the ftp server. There are an NDB Atlas, instructional pages and a
help desk available. The NDB began when nucleic acid structural biology was most
concerned with relatively simple structures. Today, the NDB deals with highly
complex molecular assemblies. The new demands of the science and of the user
community have led to a proposed improvement in content, query capabilities and
informatics infrastructure for the NDB. This will also provide better
integration with the Protein Database (PDB).
