The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project addresses many
of the concerns people may have with blood donation and transfusion, including
ethical and religious reasons, as well as a number of supply chain related
issues. According to the America Red Cross, approximately 36,000 units of red
blood cells are needed every day in the U.S., which corresponds to a $1.5
billion annual market. Importantly, many of the risks associated with human
blood can be mitigated or eliminated with an engineered product. Other issues
include cost and availability of human blood and its processing, such as
screening for infectious diseases or spot availability in the supply chain due
to natural or other disasters. It is possible that an engineered blood product
could become widely available throughout the world and be shipped in large
quantities as and where needed, addressing significant supply chain issues. The
widely available engineered product may also provide a more affordable
alternative to human blood, driving down the costs of expensive human blood
products. Lastly, the engineered blood product could also be made available for
veterinary procedures where collection systems of animal products is limited.

This I-Corps project investigates the commercialization of an engineered red
blood cell product, based on natural biopolymers, which mimics natural red blood
cells both morphologically and functionally. A prototype has been developed by
using a novel polymeric red-blood-cell-shaped hydrogel microcapsule to enclose
hemoglobin, which is vastly different from other existing prototypes that
exclusively focus on non-encapsulated hemoglobin. The prototype has been tested
under physiological conditions, ensuring potential clinical applications. This
engineered product is ultimately aimed at replacing human red blood cells for
blood transfusion.
