9305922 Gaines This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Division, will continue studies on the fundamental
chemistry of boron hydride cluster molecules and their anions. Specific
objectives are the elucidation of mechanisms of 1) skeletal rearrangements, 2)
cluster alkylations, 3) cluster growth reactions, and 4) reactions leading to
nitrogen group derivatives. These studies will utilize regiospecific isotopic
labeling strategies, which will require the development of new synthetic routes
to some compounds, and application of multinuclear NMR techniques. %%% This
research is concerned with the chemical reactivity patterns of certain members
of the family of compounds known as boron hydrides. The results of this research
may ultimately lead to new reagents for chemical synthesis, new routes to high
performance materials, and better agents for neutron capture cancer therapy. ***
