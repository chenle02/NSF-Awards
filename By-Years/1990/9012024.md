The investigator proposes to study the development of the Holocene Sacramento-
San Joaquin Delta to elucidate its response to past climatic and eustatic
changes and to use this record as an analog for the kinds of changes that will
occur with future global warming. With the funds from this planning grant, the
PI will locate areas with a high potential for preservation of early Holocene
stratigraphy, sample sediments from these areas and determine which laboratory
methods will best address the problem posed above. This preliminary research
will be divided into the following phases: 1) initial map and aerial
photographic investigation; 2) field investigation; 3) laboratory investigation;
4) grant writing and continued library and map research.
