Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project adapts and
implements microfabrication techniques from successful programs at Georgia
Institute of Technology and Virginia Polytechnic Institute as it develops two
undergraduate laboratory intensive courses. The first course introduces students
to microfabrication techniques where they learn clean room operations and safety
procedures and ultimately produce and test a MOS transistor. The second course
presents more complex fabrication techniques that lead to the production of a
simple microelectromechanical component (i.e., a MEMS device). An evaluation
panel made up of faculty members, who have developed similar laboratories and
courses, is assessing the program. The panel is examining student course
evaluations, course content, and student work. The PIs plan to report the
results of the development and evaluation efforts in journal and conference
publications and to develop a web-based microfabrication reference tutorial.
