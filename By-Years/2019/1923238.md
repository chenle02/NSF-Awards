The Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics (GRWC) 2019, to be held June
17-28 and hosted by the University of Kansas, is the sixth edition of an annual
two-week collaborative research workshop for advanced graduate students and
postdocs from all areas of combinatorics. Participants work in small
collaborative groups with faculty and postdocs on research problems from across
the discipline. The workshops also host a variety of professional development
activities to prepare students and postdocs for industrial and academic careers.

The problems participants will work on cover a wide range of subfields of
combinatorics, including (hyper)graph theory, combinatorial representation
theory, Ramsey theory, and symmetric function theory. Details of the workshop
can be found on the website:
