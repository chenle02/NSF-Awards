Ca2+ ion transport by the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum is a fundamental
process in muscle physiology. This enzyme removes Ca2+ from the cytoplasm to
storage sites in the sarcoplasmic reticulum resulting in muscle relaxation. This
project focusses on electron crystallographic analysis of large multilayered
crystalline arrays produced from detergent solubilized enzyme in the presence of
high Ca2+ concentrations. The studies proposed will 1. develop methodology for
obtaining and combining electron diffraction image data from multilayered
crystals of different thickness, 2. optimize the protocols for preservation of
3-D order in the crystals for electron microscopic analysis, 3. investigate
crystallization protocols that favor the production of 2-D sheets free from
stacking to facilitate the electron crystallographic analysis at higher
resolution, and 4. obtain information on protein secondary structure of the
Ca2+-ATPase molecule by searching for characteristic diffraction from alpha
helices, beta sheets and lipid in X-ray diagrams of pelleted crystals. Efforts
will be made to carry this structure analysis at least to the resolution of
protein secondary structure (approximately 7A) to test current models of
Ca2+-ATPase structure.
