9313688 Furbish This project is aimed at providing a general description of the
complex flow fields that can occur in steep mountain streams, whose morphologies
consist of irregular arrangements of stable boulders and logs, and small gravel
bars. The treatment makes use of both linear and nonlinear formulations
involving depth-integrated equations of momentum and mass continuity to describe
how streamwise and transverse flow velocities, and water-surface topography,
respond to an irregular bed whose topography is significantly more complex than
that of alluvial self-formed channels. The work is an extension of a linear
model which predicts that the wavelength of nascent bend forms can be longer
than that of the dominant bendforms. Theoretical aspects of the work will be
tested with data collected rom North Boulder Creek, Colorado. Data will come
from a single reach of nearly 80 channel widths in length, and from two short
reaches selected for detailed measurements of bed topography and flow. Results
will provide a mechanical basis for testing the idea that these bouldery
channels can undergo a self-stabilizing period that involves an interaction
among extant flow conditions, variable erodibility of bed and bank materials,
local armoring of the bed, and piecemeal transport of sediment.
