Graduates from both the Department of Manufacturing Technology and the
Department of Mechanical Engineering often go into industrial positions in which
they are directly involved with the usage of computer-assisted design/computer-
assisted manufacturing equipment. Students in both of these departments are
required to take courses that include use of CAD software. The goal of this
project is to enhance several CAD-related courses by providing the equipment
necessary to produce physical prototypes. The previous content of these CAD
courses has included instruction in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional
modeling concepts. This project is expanding the capabilities of the CAD
laboratories to include the capacity to produce actual physical prototypes of
three-dimensional models described in a CAD system. This gives students quick
feedback regarding the validity of their designs by allowing them to examine,
hold, and in some cases, assemble and test models of complex three-dimensional
objects. This equipment exposes students to new concepts and technologies that
are becoming prevalent in industry today. Since the institution has not
previously had a rapid prototyping system, this new equipment is also fostering
greater cooperation among various departments and should generate opportunities
for interdepartmental projects.
