This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Sandquist and his team will
undertake precision measurements of the masses and radii of stars in eclipsing
binary systems in nearby star clusters. These measurements will allow precise
ages to be determined with a minimum amount of theoretical interpretation. The
investigators have previously identified a group of seven binary systems in
three different star clusters that will enable them to measure ages with
precisions of roughly 10%, a significant improvement over current methods. With
improved photometry, also to be obtained under this award, it will be possible
to test details of the physics governing the interiors of these stars to a
degree not previously possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from this
project will allow better ages to be determined for groups of stars in distant
reaches of the Milky Way and in nearby galaxies. Research opportunities will be
available for undergraduate students and Master's degree candidates at San Diego
State University, the only campus of the California State University (CSU)
system that offers Bachelor's degrees in astronomy. The CSU system serves more
than 417,000 students, many of whom come from traditionally underrepresented
groups.
