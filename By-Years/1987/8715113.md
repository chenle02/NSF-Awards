This research deals with the problem of reliability analysis of interconnected
multi-area generator power system. The analysis methodology includes both
operating considerations and interconnection constraints. While current
methodology exists they are not computationally viable nor can they deal with
issues of jointly owned units and emergency operation. The research is aimed at
the solution of several specific problems which, if successful, will address
these important topics.
