This is a proposal for participant travel support to attend the Annual Graduate
Student Probability Conference for the years 2011 and 2012. In 2007, a group of
graduate students at the University of Wisconsin at Madison (UW), with
assistance from Professor Thomas Kurtz, organized the first Graduate Student
Probability Conference. This conference provided students and postdoctoral
fellows from across the country with the opportunity to interact with their
peers and learn about exciting new directions of research in Probability from
some of the leaders in the field. The fifth conference in the series will be
held April 29-May 1, 2011 while the sixth one is tentatively scheduled for April
27-29, 2012. Over the three days of the conference, participants - primarily
graduate students and postdocs - will have the opportunity to deliver and attend
talks on a variety of topics in Probability Theory. In addition to student and
postdoc speakers, there will be two keynote speakers who will survey recent
developments and future directions in their area of expertise each giving three
fifty-minute talks. Professor Nathalie Eisenbaum (Laboratoire de Probabilites,
Universite Pierre et Marie Curie) and Professor Philip Protter (Cornell/Columbia
University) have accepted the invitation to be keynote speakers.
