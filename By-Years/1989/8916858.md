This a proposal to continue and expad our isotopic and trace element studies of
a variety of mantle and mantle-derived rocks as tracers of the composition and
evolution of the lithosphere and upper mantle, and of petrogenetic processes
such as melting and magma transport. Our work is centered around isotopic
studies of Sr, Nd and Pb on the one hand and U, Th series isotopes on the other,
and the associated trace element concentrations which are measured in concert
with the isotope ratio determinations. In addition, we discuss plans to add a
number of important large ionic radius and high field strength elements to our
capabilities using ICP-MS. Our investigations are varied and have both regional
and more uniersal goals. In the most general sense, the work proposed is inteded
to further our knowledge of the composition and evolution of the lithosphere
anduppermost mantle in both continental and oceanic settings, and to help
nderstand factors such as the timing of magma transport and the mechanisms of
chemical fractionation during magmagenesis. Using isotopes as tracers we will
also attempt to follow the earliest stages of continental crust formation in an
accreting island arc terrane. Specific material we will investigate in pursuit
of these goals incluse lavas from the Sylhet and Deccan Traps of India; mantle
xenoliths from alkali basalts in Incia, China, Western North America and oceanic
islands in the South Pacifice; a sequence of plutonic rocks from Luzon in the
Philippines; island arc lavas from the Aleutians, ridge basalts from the Pacific
and the Mariana Trough back arc basin.
