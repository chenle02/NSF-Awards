Florida International University (FIU), in collaboration with partners at
Florida State University (FSU), the University of Florida (UF), and the
California Institute of Technology (Caltech), in cooperation with the National
Science Foundation, are creating and operating an interregional Grid-enabled
Center for High-Energy Physics Research and Educational Outreach (CHEPREO) at
FIU, encompassing an integrated program of research, network infrastructure
development, and education and outreach at one of the largest minority schools
in the US. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHEPREO will extend FIU's existing research
activities at Jefferson National Laboratory to the long-term high-energy physics
research program at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN, create a
robust outreach activity based on CMS research, develop an advanced networking
and Grid computing infrastructure that will draw in new collaborators from South
America, and enhance science and math education in South Florida for underserved
minority students through pedagogic enhancements and teacher training led by a
Physics Learning Center (PLC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interregional Grid-
Enabled CHEPREO in a university with a large Hispanic population and with good
connections to international universities in the Central and South America will
expose undergraduate and graduate students at the university, plus teachers and
students in the community, to high-energy physics research and careers in
physics education. In addition, the CMS experiment data analysis opens the
opportunities for new discoveries and new knowledge in high energy physics and
the integration of Hispanic students in frontier research, and will allow them
to be knowledge leaders compared to their peers.&lt;br/&gt;
