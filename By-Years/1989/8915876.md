The P.I. feels that improvement of mechanisms that have proven to be effective
and the study of new alternatives should be pursued to develop better and more
efficient mechanisms to support object-oriented languages. This study will
generate insights on the type of support that will render the most benefits and
the types of mechanisms that have potential for improving the performance of the
computer system. The P.I. hopes, through this preliminary study, to define a
research project whose main focus will be the study of mechanisms to support
object-oriented languages.
