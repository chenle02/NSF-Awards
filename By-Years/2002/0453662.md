We request funds to support a community workshop to guide US efforts in
establishing a US &lt;br/&gt;Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)
mission. InSAR is a new type of space-based radar observation that allows ground
displacements from earthquakes and other sources to be measured over many
millions of pixels (each representing a resolution of about 10-30 meters) to a
displacement accuracy of several millimeters. InSAR images also have significant
value in monitoring volcanic eruptions; in weather forecasting, inasmuch as the
radar reflections are sensitive to soil moisture variations; in ice and glacier
studies; and in a variety of surface change and environmental applications,
including estimates of wind velocity and direction, and detection of oil slicks.
The proposed workshop will take place October 20-22, 2004 in Oxnard, California.
We &lt;br/&gt;anticipate receiving funds from NASA for workshop support. Funds
will also be requested from &lt;br/&gt;the USGS. The Southern California
Earthquake Center will provide administrative support for &lt;br/&gt;the
workshop.
