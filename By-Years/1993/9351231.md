Hamilton College offers undergraduates a strong program in experimental
psychology and related areas of cognitive science. Students engage in
increasingly sophisticated scientific work in their courses, independent
studies, and senior projects. The proposed ILI project will enhance this
experience in Cognition and related areas (Linguistics, Computer Science, and
Music) by providing a Macintosh computer laboratory for the cognitive courses
that will also serve as a center for cognitive study to promote
interdisciplinary study on campus. To complement the hardware we will develop
flexible tools for student research using Psyscope, a newly-developed program
for experimental control. New equipment will permit significant revisions of the
curriculum in advanced cognitive courses and independent research. Improvements
in resources will also allow students in psychology and related fields at
Hamilton and elsewhere to engage in progressively more sophisticated and
independent scientific projects, and help to ignite enthusiasm for pursuing
careers in science.
