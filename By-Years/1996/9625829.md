9625829 Suzuki This award provides support for the acquisition of a squid
magnetometer for use by the materials scientists in the departments of chemistry
and physics on the Binghamton Campus of the State University of New York. %%%
This instrument enables the characterization of important materials including
graphite intercalated compounds and magnetic glasses, for projects sponsored by
NSF and DOE as well as state and industry. The magnetometer will be installed in
a facility under renovation by an NSF STI award, which will house all the
materials chemists and physicists, and will be available for use by students.
