This workshop is designed to introduce college mathematics teachers to the art
and science of model-building, and to help them gain the skill and confidence
needed to introduce modeling activities in their own undergraduate teaching. The
specific theme of the workshop is "Mathematical Modeling of Environmental and
Natural Resource Conflicts," a topic chosen for its intrinsic importance, rich
mathematical content, and strong appeal to students. Involvement in an applied
mathematical modeling project can help students understand the central role that
mathematics plays in modern science, and demonstrate to them the value of
further mathematical study. The formal workshop will occur over two summers.
During the intervening academic year each participant will teach an
undergraduate modeling course or undertake a project at his or her home
institution while keeping in contact with workshop colleagues via the Internet.
The first summer program will include two intensive weeks of formal study and
field trips to learn about "real-world" environmental disputes in the Northern
Rockies. The second summer workshop will be devoted to discussions of completed
project and seminars on modeling issues.
