This award supports the development and implementation of searches for
continuous gravitational waves from the youngest neutron stars. It also supports
related work on astrophysical guidance and interpretation of continuous-wave
searches as they relate to neutron-star microphysics and gravitational-wave
emission mechanisms. These searches will be among the few to reach
astrophysically interesting sensitivities even with current LIGO data, and will
help propel the transformation of LIGO from a prototype into a tool for
exploring physics and astrophysics in the era of advanced
detectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detection of any gravitational wave signal will
be a transformative breakthrough in fundamental physics and open up a new era of
astronomy and astrophysics. A continuous-wave signal in particular will give a
direct view into the otherwise inaccessible interior of a neutron star and the
behavior of matter at supernuclear densities. This award supports the training
of graduate and undergraduate students on the interfaces between gravitational
physics, data analysis, astrophysics, and astronomy; and it supports public
outreach through the www.ligo.org web site.
