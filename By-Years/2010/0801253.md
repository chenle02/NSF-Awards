Non-Technical Abstract: Correlated electron materials have technical importance
as functional materials with controllable electrical and magnetic properties.
This project will provide a unified understanding, which does not now exist, of
the inter-relation of structure and chemistry of such materials with their
functional properties, to establish an effective route for the design of
improved new functional materials. Undergraduate and graduate students will be
trained in crystal growth and characterization of correlated electron materials,
and in cross-disciplinary interactions with solid state chemists and in
international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: The low
temperature physics of correlated electron materials is the physics of entropy
release from strongly coupled electronic itinerant and local moment degrees of
freedom. This project will show how the temperature scale for this release is
determined by the structure and chemistry of the materials, establishing a new
unified understanding extending from the f- into the transition metal
intermetallic compounds, with consequent importance for the design of new
functional materials. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained during
this study in the crystal growth and characterization of new intermetallic
materials and in cross-disciplinary interactions with solid state chemists and
in international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;
