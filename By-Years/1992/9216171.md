This Infrastructure Award provides computational infrastructure for use in the
areas of video coding and image understanding and fast-turnaround system
synthesis. The former research area requires massive data stores and special
purpose video processors. The latter area requires fast simulations. The
infrastructure provided under this award includes both the special purpose
computational video equipment and storage devices and the high speed
workstations necessary for both research areas. Digital High Definition
Television requires massive amounts of memory and substantial processing power.
This infrastructure award is providing research equipment for investigations
into digital video imaging and processing. The award also provides for a
collection of very high speed workstations for the rapid simulation of computer
systems. This capability will allow these systems to be much more rapidly
developed.
