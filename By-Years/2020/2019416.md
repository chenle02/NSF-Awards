This award supports participation of US-based researchers in the "VII Encuentro
Colombiano de Combinatoria: Geometric Methods in Combinatorics" summer school
that will take place in Bogotá, Colombia hosted by Universidad de Los Andes and
Universidad Sergio Arboleda during June 16-27, 2020. The meeting features
presentations by internationally renowned experts on current topics of active
research within the areas of geometric combinatorics, topological combinatorics,
and combinatorial algebraic geometry. These include Lorentzian polynomials by
June Huh, Hessenberg varieties and other combinatorial subvarieties of the flag
variety by Julianna Tymoczko, real tropical geometry by Josephine Yu, and
combinatorial convexity and topology by Jesús De Loera. There have been numerous
exciting developments in these areas, and this school will provide an
opportunity for early-career mathematicians to learn about cutting-edge
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each week of the school consists of four mini-
courses, exercise sessions, a plenary presentation, four contributed talks, a
poster session, and an open problem session. This event is part of the biennial
school "Encuentro Colombiano de Combinatoria" (ECCO) held since 2012. In
addition to showcasing excellent mathematics, the summer school places strong
emphasis on community building, focusing on early-career mathematicians as well
as members of underrepresented groups. The interaction among combinatorialists
in various stages of their careers facilitates recruitment of excellent Latin
American students by US PhD programs. The website of the summer school is

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
