The one week workshop on lasers and the application to chemical problems is
providing exposure to laser technology for 12 chemistry faculty. The workshop is
focussing on intensive exposure to both the theory and practical application of
laser technology to areas of interest to all branches of chemistry. The course
includes lectures on the fundamentals of lasers and related topics; laboratory
experiments to illustrate the principles presented in the lectures; lectures and
laboratory experiments dealing with current applications of lasers to chemically
interesting problems; and an opportunity to engage in a special project of
interest to the participant. The technology is being transported to the
participant's home institution.
