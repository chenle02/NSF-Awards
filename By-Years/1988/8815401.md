This award supports cooperative research in the basic thermal design of heat
exchangers by Ramesh Shah of General Motors and SUNY at Buffalo and Alberto
Pignotti of Techint Corporation and the University of Buenos Aires. Realistic
effects to be studied include variable heat transfer coefficients, various heat
transfer areas, longitudinal heat conduction, number of baffles and the
maldistribution of flow. The results will lead to new efficient two-fluid
exchanger configurations. Dr. Shah is a widely-experienced expert on heat
exchanger design procedures and current technology. A graduate level textbook is
in preparation. Dr. Pignotti has a strong background in mathematics and
theoretical physics. He will contribute innovative concepts and methods for
solving complex heat exchanger configurations. The computer facilities of the
two institutions complement each other as do the specialized capabilities of
these two groups. Thus the results of this collaboration will be comprehensive
in advancing heat exchanger technology and in contributing to the conservation
of energy resources in both countries.
