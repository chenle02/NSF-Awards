This award is to support research that will determine whether tree rings in the
tropical hardwood species Hymenaea courbaril represent annual growth
rings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field work will be undertaken to collect samples of
Hymenaea courbaril from localities where short instrumental records are
available for calibration. Isotopic analyses and and visual and computer
assisted methods of cross dating will be used to determine the growth history of
this species.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposed
research are that, if the growth rings are determined to be annual, a pan-tropic
taxon will be available for dendrochronology and climatologic studies of
tropical terrestrial environments. &lt;br/&gt;
