This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops novel
spin-dependent-tunneling (SDT) magnetic-field sensor devices based on innovative
methods of flux modulation. The program identifies two modes of "flux gating" as
a means of chopping or sweeping the magnetic field which is sensed by the SDT
transducers. The flux gating methods are proposed as enhancements to the
functionality of the already promising SDT magnetic sensor. The first method
offers a low-power solution for increasing the SDT signal-to-noise ratio
especially at low frequencies where 1/f noise is present. The second method
enables the determination of absolute field magnitudes. Successful development
of these novel ideas will lead to the advancement of small, solid-state,
inexpensive, low-power, high resolution magnetic-field sensors. These sensors
can be used discretely or in compact arrays for diverse applications including
non-destructive evaluation of metallic structure flaws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
commercial applications of the research include non-destructive evaluation of
flaws in metallic structures; detection, surveillance and tracking of magnetic
or metallic objects; security systems; and magnetic media sensing-which includes
currency evaluation and discrimination, and magnetic card readers.
