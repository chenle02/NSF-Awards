Robust nonlinear control and optimization strategies, and mathematical models
for a materially and geometrically nonlinear thermoviscoelastic plate and a
thermoviscopiezoelectric layer are developed. These are applied to determine the
optimum number, shapes and locations of embedded sensors and actuators required
to suppress undesired vibrations quickly and efficiently. These developments
apply to instrument platforms, satellites and printed circuit boards where
thermal, viscous, and piezo effects interact to determine the system response.
The developments are validated by comparing the predictions with experimentals
findings.
