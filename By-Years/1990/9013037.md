In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Dr. Veronica Vaida will study the effects on the reactivity of a given
species when it is associated with "solvent" molecules as part of a small
cluster. Such studies aid in understanding the changes in properties of a
species in going from a single isolated entity to a condensed-phase form. These
studies also impact on the reactivity of atmospheric species, which are often
present in the form of small gas-phase clusters, and as such have a bearing, for
example, on the formation and dissipation of smog. In the current studies,
molecules which are solvated in small clusters will be photodissociated. Various
properties, such as absorption cross sections and quantum yields for
photodissociation, will be compared between isolated and solvated species. The
emergence of new channels for photodissociation of the solvated species will be
investigated.
