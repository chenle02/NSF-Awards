The purpose of this work is to develop an effective method for controlling the
dynamic response of large civil structures subjected to severe environmental
loadings such as earthquakes and extreme winds. Tuned liquid dampers (TLD) have
been used as passive systems to control motion in tall buildings but these are
effective only for a narrow frequency band. The project will demonstrate that
the effectiveness can be enhanced by adding an active control. Two types of
active controls will be investigated, one, to control the tuning of the liquid,
the other, to control the tank movement by using an active support for the TLD.
The results of this research can improve substantially the performance of the
damping system at a low cost, and increase considerably the safety of structures
exposed to natural hazards.
