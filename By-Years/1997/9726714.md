This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on the
nature of Amazon sediment accumulation along the Guianas-Amapa coast of South
America. The collaboration involves the research groups led by Mead Allison of
Texas A &amp; M University and Frederic Baltzer of the University of Paris, Sud.
The objectives of the project are to determine: (1) how the interplay between
mudbank migration and mudcape growth controls accretion and erosion on the
Amapa-Guianas coast and (2) how recruitment, growth rates, and survival of coast
mangrove swamps are dependent on these mechanisms. The researchers will conduct
a joint field study in French Guiana and bring together information collected by
these research groups in previous field studies. The US investigators bring to
this collaboration expertise in sedimentology, geochronology and marine
geophysics. This is complemented by French expertise in ecological, botanical
and sedimentological studies of mangrove swamps. The project will advance
understanding of the natural processes that control the evolution of a muddy
coastal system. These systems make up a significant proportion of the world's
coast zones and are critical habitats that are disappearing under human
encroachment.
