The project creates a state-of-the-art electronic architectural design studio
that utilizes advanced microcomputer simulation and visualization technology as
the primary medium of building design exploration. This is distinguished by its
conceptual design emphasis from the more conventional electronic drafting
traditionally associated with computer-aided drafting. The capability of such a
design-station studio permits the construction of realistic (opaque. shaded.
colored) three- dimensional model images of student building or urban designs
superimposed over video-capture image sequences of the existing, real building
site, permitting realistic animated simulations of the proposed design. In
addition, the project modifies the department's Junior Scholars summer program
for high school students. The equipment includes thirteen networked high-end
Macintosh microcomputer design-stations with color graphic input and output
peripheral devices and appropriate software to provide 3D visualization and
video-capture simulation capability.
