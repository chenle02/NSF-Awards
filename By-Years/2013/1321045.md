Washington State University will design and study the educational affordances of
a social programming environment (SPE), a technology-rich learning environment
centered around a social networking-style activity stream of learners' problem-
solving activities and progress. Through an iterative, participatory design
process involving students and instructors at Washington State University,
Pacific University, and Mesa Community College, this project will develop (a) an
SPE to support learners as they work outside-of-class on the kinds of individual
programming assignments that are the centerpiece of early computing courses; and
(b) sets of practical guidelines and best practices to help instructors
implement social programming assignments in their courses. This work will
contribute new, theoretically-grounded accounts of how learning and
participation proceed in social problem-solving environments, as well as
empirical findings related to their impact on student learning outcomes,
problem-solving processes, attitudes, and
retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building upon previous work adapting the studio-
based learning model for computing education, the project staff aim to address
low retention in computing degree programs by facilitating effective online
learning communities for introductory computing courses. This project will
result in two new open source technologies?a ?social plug-in? for a computer
programming environment, and a learning management system tailored for ?social
programming??that can be readily used in both K-12 and undergraduate computing
education. While this project focuses on computing education, the novel social
problem-solving technologies and the empirical findings of the research studies
will be applicable to many STEM disciplines in which learners benefit by working
individually on problems within a social environment.
