The investigation involves the creation of stronger gravitational fields to act
on laboratory models using a modulated magnetic field. The goal is to produce a
model that behaves like the actual structure, and to offer the convenience of a
non-revolving experimental setup. The system is to expand the ability to excite
models with calibrated dynamic signals such as impact, harmonic excitation and
complex earthquake motions. Verification of small model tests is accomplished by
conducting an experiment on an existing full-scale structure or by analytical
predictions. This project is one supported under the Creativity Awards for
Undergraduate Engineering Students.
