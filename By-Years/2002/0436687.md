This proposal has been formulated to provide the United States Air Force (USAF)
and specifically the Air Force Research Laboratory with long term, basic
research through the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Engineering Logistics and Distribution at the University of Arkansas. In order
to provide the agile combat material support necessary to sustain our
warfighters and weapons systems in a crisis, new technologies for logistics need
to be developed. The USAF business model for acquisition and sustainment
highlights the need to add additional processes that develop the logistics
support for the incorporation of new and existing weapons systems to sustain and
protect our personnel as they go into harm's way. The goal of this research is
to develop quantitative and scientific methods that will assist researchers and
military logisticians in the analysis of the effectiveness of logistics
technology that incorporates both a human-centered and a system based
perspective.
