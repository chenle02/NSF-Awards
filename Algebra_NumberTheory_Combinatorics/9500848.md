This award supports a conference on the interaction between the fields of Lie
algebras in positive characteristic, quantum groups, and Lie superalgebras. In
the last several years, there have been important connections between the
representation theory of Lie algebras in characteristic p and the representation
theory of quantum groups. The relation between Lie algebras in prime
characteristic and Lie superalgebras dates back to the 1970's, but is still not
fully understood. These problems will be discussed at this conference. The time
and place for the conference are chosen to honor Professor Richard E. Block upon
his retirement. His work has had a deep impact on the subject. This conference
is concerned with a mathematical object called a Lie algebra. Lie algebras arise
from another object called a Lie group. An example of a Lie group is the
rotations of a sphere where one rotation is followed by another. Lie groups and
Lie algebras are important in areas involving analysis of sperical motion.
