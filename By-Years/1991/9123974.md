This work will characterize the variation of magnetization of near-axis crustal
rocks obtained by dredge and rock drill from the East Pacific Rise at 13 degrees
north. In addition to the rock magnetic studies of the returned samples,
magnetometer and gravity data collected over the sample sites will be analyzed.
The combination of the rock magnetic data from the samples, with the sea surface
magnetic and gravity data, and the further integration with the funded
geochemical analyses, will allow the identification of sources of variation in
near-axis crustal magnetization.
