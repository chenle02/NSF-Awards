Immobilized cells are in an environment which is drastically different from that
of free cells, and this is likely to change their metabolic behavior. Studies on
this microenvironmental effect have been constrained by the limitations of
experimental techniques on a micro-scale. Microprobles and Micro-optodes will be
developed for measuring redox potential and the concentrations of important
cellular metabolities in the immediate vicinity of the immobilized cells. A
1500X stereomicroscope and a monochromator with optical fiber input/output
capabiliity will be required to facilitate the development of the probes. These
new microprobes will provide new research capabilities, which will signficantly
expand the scope of investigation into the immobilized cell systems.
