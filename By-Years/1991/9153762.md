This four year teacher enhancement program, sponsored by Occidental College,
provides two two-week summer workshops for 15 teachers in chemistry and 15
teachers in biology each summer. The workshops will provide training in
discipline concepts and the use and development of laboratories employing modern
instruments. The summer program will be followed up by an academic year program
which includes a highly trained lead teacher who visits each school once a
month. The teacher brings with him/her a van equipped with the instruments used
by the teachers the previous summer. Other follow up activities include
development of a network among the participants, a seminar series, a research
associates program (teachers will be selected to carryout research with college
faculty), a science information clearing house and a "best experiment
competition". The target schools enroll a large number of minority students. The
project evaluation will look at whether a technology focussed laboratory program
increases the number of students interested in pursuing science. Matching funds
from Occidental College are equivalent to about 32% of the NSF grant.
