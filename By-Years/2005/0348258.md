There are two main approches to motivic (co-)homology appearing
in&lt;br/&gt;recent years. First, one tries to construct it as cohomology
groups&lt;br/&gt;of certain complexes with terms being given by
explicit&lt;br/&gt;generators and relations generalizing Milnor's K-groups.
Second, one&lt;br/&gt;can construct cohomology of a scheme as cohomology of a
complex&lt;br/&gt;defined in terms of algebraic cycles thus generalizing the
classical&lt;br/&gt;defintion of Chow groups. Each has its own advantages and
disadvantages.&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jianqiang Zhao's research will continue his
work&lt;br/&gt;on understanding both approaches by
using&lt;br/&gt;polylogarithms and their generalizations.
&lt;br/&gt;Polylogarithms have been around for centuries in one form
or&lt;br/&gt;another, but only recently has their whole theory become available.
&lt;br/&gt;They have deep connections with both number theory and modern
&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics. This project should shed light on these
connections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is in the field of arithmetic
algebraic geometry, &lt;br/&gt;a subject that combines the techniques of
algebraic geometry and number&lt;br/&gt;theory. In its original formulation,
algebraic geometry treated figures &lt;br/&gt;that could be defined in the plane
by the simplest equations, &lt;br/&gt;namely polynomials. Number
theory&lt;br/&gt;is the study of numbers that can be expressed
in&lt;br/&gt;terms of whole numbers, 1, 2, 3... In the second half&lt;br/&gt;of
last century these two seemingly far apart subjects have produced
&lt;br/&gt;tremendous impact on each other. The field of arithmetic algebraic
&lt;br/&gt;geometry now uses techniques from all of modern
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
