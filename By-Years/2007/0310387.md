This Minority Post-Doctoral Research and Training Fellowship contains four
studies to elucidate a broader understanding of the psychological complexity
between black Americans and black immigrants, and to measure a construct that
may serve as a mediator underlying the group differences. Study 1 will measure
the effects of situational threat and salient ethnic identification on
performance in blacks. Black immigrant and black American participants will be
primed with either an American identity or an immigrant identity, then will take
a section of the verbal GRE (Graduate Record Examination). Study 2 will measure
ethnic differences in the potential mediating factor of race schematicity, and
will survey race schematicity and ethnic identity in whites, black Americans,
first-generation black immigrants, and second-generation black immigrants. Race
schematicity is the degree to which individuals use race to encode and process
information (Runkle, 1999). Black Americans and second-generation immigrants are
predicted to show different levels of race schematicity as a function of
differential exposure to race-related experiences. Study 3 examines the impact
of priming race schematicity in black immigrants and black Americans, and
measures the effect of salient race-related experience on recall and reaction
time to race-related words. Study 4 will explicitly test the potential for
mediation of race schematicity in the relationship between ethnicity and
performance by manipulating the construct and measuring the effects of the
saliency of past race-related events on performance on a section of the verbal
GRE. The Fellow will perform her research and training for two years under the
guidance and mentorship of Dr. Kay Deaux at the City University of New York
Graduate School and University Center.
