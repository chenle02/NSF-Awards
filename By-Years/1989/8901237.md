The research represents an important contribution to the understanding of how
some tree seedings are able to grow in deeply shaded environments while others
are not. The approach is unique in the study of shade tolerance. The study ties
the physiological processes, photosynthesis and respiration, with allocational
patterns (amount of tissue in roots versus stems). The study also examines the
effect of fertilization with an important mineral nutrient, nitrogen, on the
ability to tree seedings to grow in shade. Fosters have a keen interest in
promoting the regrowth of tree seedlings in the shaded environments beneath
mature timber. Understanding plant and environmental characteristics affecting
seedling growth in shade will assist foresters in selecting and managing forest
stands for high long-term productivity.
