The objective of this activity is to provide partial travel support for six
students from U.S. universities to attend the 2009 IEEE MTT-S International
Microwave Symposium (IMS). The IMS is the annual meeting of the Microwave Theory
and Techniques Society (MTT-S) of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers, Inc. (IEEE). The IMS is also the major international symposium in the
microwave field and a focus of research results in wireless telecommunications.
The 2009 IMS will be held in Boston, MA, USA on June 8-12, 2009.

Intellectual Merit: The main impact is primarily educational, as the travel
support allow students' participation in IMS 2009. This participation is an
important part of the education process. It provides students with the
opportunity to interact with more experienced researchers, and to be exposed to
new areas of research.

Broader Impact: Student participation at the IMS not only promotes education but
also fosters the next generation of microwave engineers.
