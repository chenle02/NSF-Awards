Applications such as airlines, telecommunications, banks, and real-time database
will in the near future require 1000 or more transactions per second, where a
transaction consists of 4-6 record accesses most of them through data
structures. At these transaction rates and implied multiprocessing levels,
classical concurrent data structure techniques may be too slow. This work seeks
methods to eliminate the bottleneck of slow transaction rates. A variety of
algorithmic ideas, including cooperative concurrent and wait-free techniques,
will be evaluated to determine what features a concurrent data structure
algorithm should possess to achieve high performance. The goal is to provide a
rational method for choosing (or inventing): 1. algorithmic strategies (e.g.
bottom-up link technique); 2. recovery strategies (e.g. operation logging as
opposed to physical logging); and 3. tradeoffs between space and time, (e.g. the
benefits of merge-at-half compared to merge-at-empty). Besides the direct
benefit to high performance database management systems, this work will shed
insight on the general area of concurrent and parallel computation.
