This research is concerned with dramatically improving the performance of
computing machines for traditional languages by increasing the concurrency or
parallelism apparent in the input code via eager evaluation. Eager evaluation is
the conditional execution of code past conditional branches, before the branches
have executed. The specific objectives of the research are to more fully
understand and characterize eager evaluation by developing a graph model for its
description; measuring the performance gain and resources used when typical
codes are executed with eager evaluation, both in an ideal sense to give bounds,
and assuming different architectures or execution engines. Also, the development
of novel machines to exploit eager evaluation in an efficient manner is to be
pursued. One novel aspect of an approach to be followed is to consider the
static instruction stream model of execution, in which the code is ordered as it
exists in memory, as opposed to just the dynamic, or classic, instruction
stream, in which the program counter follows the control flow. The measurements
and evaluations to be made will be via computer simulations of the execution of
the codes, assuming specific hardware as appropriate.
