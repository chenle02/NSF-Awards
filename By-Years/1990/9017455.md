Secretion, the formation of lysosomes, and receptor-mediated endocytosis are
all mediated by intracellular packaging and transport of vesicles.
Intraorganelle communication also involves the transport of vesicles. Some of
these transport processes utilize nucleotide-sensitive, microtubule-binding
proteins to power the vesicles movement along microtubules. The goal of this
research is to investigate one of these motors, cytoplasmic dynein, which this
laboratory has recently isolated from Paramecium. The vesicle and vacuole
transport pathways in Paramecium have been studied extensively in this
laboratory. A logical extension of the previous studies is to characterize
further the motor(s) responsible for the described movements and to investigate
the possibility that microtubules organized into different arrays may support
movement of only certain populations of vesicles and not others. Experiments
have been designed to (1) determine which direction cytoplasmic dynein moves
along the microtubules in Paramecium, and (2) to produce monospecific polyclonal
and monoclonal antibodies to cytoplasmic dynein to determine the location of
this motor in the cell and to use as antagonists to cytoplasmic dynein activity
to determine which transport functions in cells are supported by this motor.
Finally, it is proposed to isolate all vesicles which bind to microtubules by
nucleotide- sensitive bridges. The results of this research using Paramecium
should provide new information on how normal cells direct and regulate
intracellular vesicular transport.
