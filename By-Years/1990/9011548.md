This research addresses the analysis of nonlinear hyperbolic partial
differential equations, with applications to wave propagation in a variety of
physical contexts. The analysis is based on the systematic reduction of complex
systems of equations to simpler model equations by means of asymptotic
equations. The model equations are studied using a combination of explicit
solutions, perturbation methods, qualitative analysis, and numerical
calculations. The research lies in the general area of applied mathematics.
Physical systems in which disturbances propagate at finite speeds are often
modelled by hyperbolic partial differential equations. Examples include
compressible gas flows, elasticity, magnetohydrodynamics, and general
relativity. When the speed of the disturbance depends on the strength of the
disturbance, the equations are nonlinear. An outstanding property of nonlinear
hyperbolic waves is the formation of shocks. Shock waves are of significant
practical importance (e.g. in sonic booms or the nonsurgical destruction of
kidney stones) and pose many challenging mathematical problems.
