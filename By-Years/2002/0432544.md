A grant has been awarded to Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL), under
the direction of Dr. Ian Billick, to renovate researcher and student housing at
the RMBL. The RMBL is a biological field station that was established in 1928 to
promote research and education in the biological sciences. Scientists and
students from numerous institutions throughout the United States visit the RMBL
to conduct research and take classes. Many of the cabins used to house the
scientists and students were constructed 75-120 years ago. This grant will allow
the RMBL to provide safe, clean living facilities for the students and
scientists who live onsite. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will pay for the
renovation of three cabins. These structures, built in 1880 and 1914, house up
to 19 students and research assistants. As part of this project the internal
electric system wil be redone and an upgrade will be made to the external system
powering the buildings. An environmentally friendly photo-voltaic system that
will generate energy sufficient to power the buildings will also be installed.
This work will not only improve the quality of housing, but will also reduce the
safety risk to the inhabitants of the buildings. Because of the remote location,
almost all scientists and students must live onsite. Consequently this grant
will allow the RMBL to continue to offer research and educational opportunities
to numerous scientists and students.&lt;br/&gt;
