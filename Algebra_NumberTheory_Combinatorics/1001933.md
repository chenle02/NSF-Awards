This proposal is to investigate various question in the combinatorics of finite
reflection groups, at different levels of generality. A significant fraction of
effort in the subject of algebraic combinatorics is devoted toward finding the
right level of generality to define various combinatorial objects. Reflection
groups are often the key to finding the "correct" generality. Some of the groups
appearing within the projects are -- the finite general linear groups, -- the
groups of symmetry of regular polytopes (both the classical real ones, as well
as the complex regular polytopes considered by G.C. Shephard and by H.S.M.
Coxeter), and -- the Weyl groups, arising in the theory of algebraic groups and
Lie algebras.

One reason to study these symmetry group comes from their transparent beauty,
known in part already to the ancient Greeks, as the symmetries of the five
regular solids: the cube, tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, and
icosahedron. At the same time, this beauty frustrates us. One wants to
comprehend these objects not as unrelated items on a list of five things: one
wants to understand the features they have in common, and how they can be
understand all at once, in terms of unified principles. This is one of the main
goals of this project.
