0402966 Dzombak The proposed work would evaluate the efficacy and economic
viability of a potential remediation technology for soils contaminated with
heavy metals. This technology employs iron oxides recovered from abandoned coal
- mining sites. The work would be carried out collaboratively with two
industrial partners, each having expertise in iron oxide recovery and site
remediation. The proposed remediation strategy is innovative and particularly
appealing because it makes use of a substance produced during
remediation/reclamation of other polluted sites (ie acid mine drainage sites).
The study will address issues relating to iron oxide purity, metal
immobilization capacity, and the extent to which immobilized metals are
extractable using established methods. Engineering application issues will also
be explored in the later stages of the project.
