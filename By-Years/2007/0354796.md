This proposal addresses the development of new nonperturbative theoretical
formalisms and &lt;br/&gt;time-dependent methods for detailed ab initio
investigation of the electronic structure and quantum &lt;br/&gt;dynamics of
many-electron Rydberg atomic and diatomic molecular systems in the presence of
intense external fields. Problems considered include:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1)
Structure and Dynamics of One-Valence-Electron Rydberg Atoms in Microwave
Fields. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;2) Development of Self-Interaction-Free Density
Functional Theories for the Treatment of the Electronic Structure of Many-
Electron Rydberg Systems. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;3) Time-Dependent Density
Functional Theory (TDDFT) for the Treatment of Multiphoton Quantum
&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics of Complex Rydberg Atoms in Time-Dependent Fields.
