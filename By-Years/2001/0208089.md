EAR-0208089&lt;br/&gt;Jeffrey J. Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large amounts of
water are carried into the upper mantle by subduction. It is generally assumed
that water is released in near continuous fashion to depths of at least 150-200
km. However, it is unknown how water is transported from the slab to the
volcanic front. Water in the mantle wedge strongly influences rheological and
seismological properties and has a major impact on subduction zone thermal
structure. The investigators propose to study the influence of water on mantle
wedge dynamics in a collaborative and multi-disciplinary project. Recent
rheological work has made it possible, for the first time, to quantify the
influence of water on creep properties of olivine. The investigators will
systematically study the rheological influence of water, with particular
interest in how the observationally inferred water distribution influences the
balance of subduction forces and the generation of the cornerflow. The models
provide predictions on subduction zone temperature and composition that allow
for critical tests using observational and experimental constraints from
seismology and mineral physics.&lt;br/&gt;
