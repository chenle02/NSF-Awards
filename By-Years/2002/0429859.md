A key component of their performance is automatic memory management (garbage
collection) which frees programmers from explicit memory management, easing the
programming burden and eliminating a source of many errors.The growing need for
high performance collectors has sparked a resurgence in garbage collection
research.&lt;br/&gt;Garbage collection provides a number of software engineering
benefits such as preventing two&lt;br/&gt;common programmer errors which are
among the most difficult to diagnose and fix: (1) prematurely &lt;br/&gt;freeing
memory that the program later references, and (2) systematically never freeing
which can cause&lt;br/&gt;memory consumption to grow without
bound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This project will
explore (1) dynamic optimizations and policy tuning applicable to a variety of
collectors;&lt;br/&gt;(2) new basic mechanisms for attaining locality and
flexible heap organizations, and (3) adaptive algorithms&lt;br/&gt;to match
applications to policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The research
impact from this project will be high performance garbage collectors that play
to the strengths of modern architectures and that adapt to the phases of modern
applications. High performance will in turn enable higher productivity
programming, i.e., programmers will be able to solve new, more difficult, and
larger problems. The publicly available research artifacts, MMTk and
architecture simulators, will add to the national research infrastructure for
exploring memory management algorithms and performance, and the influences on
total application performance for modern languages. The educational impact will
include training graduate and undergraduate students in this key language system
component. Outreach to under-represented groups will include summer research
experiences for undergraduate women.
