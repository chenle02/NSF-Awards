This proposal seeks support for the OAII Science Steering Committee, chaired by
Don Perovich, and the OAII Science Management Office, directed by Lou Codispotti
for a two-year period from December 2002 through December 2004. This proposed
program shares the goals of the ARCSS program: to understand the myriad
processes of the Arctic system and advance the scientific basis for predicting
environmental change. The program will be working towards these goals by
facilitating interdisciplinary research on Arctic System Science. Specific
objectives include: 1) Fostering interdisciplinary work on the Arctic system. 2)
Disseminating information on ARCSS-OAII to both the scientific community and the
general public. 3) Enhancing communication between OAII projects and other ARCSS
components. 4) Providing scientific guidance and encouragement to existing and
developing initiatives and 5) Facilitating the evolution from the current
structure of ARCSS to a more interdisciplinary future structure.
