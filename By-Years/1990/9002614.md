This research concerns fault-tolerant cellular automata (FTCA). Such automata
require generally elaborate constructions. The notions introduced in previous
years enable us to make the newer costructions much more transparent. All known
FTCA rely heavily on the fact that the cells of the whole array update
simultaneously. FTCA with asynchronous updation are being constructed. All known
FTCA in dimensions lower than 3 must be prepared in an elaborate, hierarchical
initial configuration. Techniques for building a FTCA without this requirement
are being investigated. In this homogenous medium, arbitrarily complex noise-
resistant structures arise spontaneously. The complexity is understood in the
sense of carrying out complex computational tasks. The mathematical possibility
of such a medium is significant for physics and biology as well as computer
science. The computational and informational costs of all constructions are
generally found to be near the theoretical minimum.
