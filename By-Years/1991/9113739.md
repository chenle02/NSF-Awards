Since the early 1980s, unauthorized immigration has increased in the United
States, Western Europe, and Japan, a function of renewed economic growth coupled
with severe restrictions on new legal immigration. Millions of illegal aliens
have migrated to these countries. In Western Europe, international labor
migration is largely unregulated. In the United States, the 1986 U.S.
Immigration Reform and Control Act has not only failed to deter much new
unauthorized immigration and to increase the propensity of illegal aliens
already in the country to depart, but has also stimulated additional illegal
immigration. The European Economic Community have characterized immigration as
"the big issue of the 1990s." This project is a comparative assessment of recent
immigration flows, public policies to reduce unauthorized immigration, and the
outcomes of these policies in advanced industrial or post- industrial societies.
A systematic examination of the experiences of advanced industrial nations
(United States, Canada, France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, and Japan) in
attempting to gain control over illegal immigration from less developed
countries and regions (primarily Mexicao, North Africa, Turkey, Eastern Europe,
the Philippines and Bangladesh) will be conducted. Alternative theories and
explanations for the persistence of low-skilled immigration and for the limited
efficacy of immigration control measures in labor-importing countries will be
evaluated. Activities will include the formation of a multidisciplinary research
group consisting of seven immigration specialists (representing sociology,
economics, political science, anthropology, and history) from various
universities who will conduct primary data collection. These researchers and
other leading immigration specialists from other industrialized countries will
meet in 1993 for a workshop to discuss the work. The results of this study will
have significant value for scientific and policy analyses of international labor
migration. In addition, the research has both transnational and international
theoretical implications relating to other issues in the sociolegal field such
as the limits of law as a regulatory mechanism, the problems of implementation,
and the relationship of public attitudes to legal outcomes and effectiveness.
