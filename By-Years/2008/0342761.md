The intracellular transport of large macromolecules in eukaryotic cells is
facilitated by motor proteins that convert chemical energy into mechanical force
for movement of their specific cargos along actin filaments or microtubules.
Kinesin is an evolutionarily conserved motor protein essential for the movement
of its cargos along the microtubule cytoskeleton. Kinesin binds to cargos such
as vesicles, mitochondria, and mRNPs through specific interactions between
proteins on the cargo surface and the kinesin tail domain. Identification of
proteins that can bind to the kinesin tail domain may reveal the identity of
kinesin cargos and the signal transduction pathways that control kinesin-
mediated intracellular transport. Prior NSF funding enabled the PI to use a
yeast two-hybrid screen to identify two kinesin-binding proteins: the
transmembrane protein CALS and UNC-76, a cytosolic protein that is essential for
axonal transport. In this new project, the PI will use mutant analyses, two-
hybrid screens, immunoprecipitation, and co-sedimentation to identify other
binding partners for UNC-76 and CALS. This project will provide research-
training opportunities for a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;
