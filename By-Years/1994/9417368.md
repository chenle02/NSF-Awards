9417368 Tomasko The PI and his collaborators propose to continue with their
study of aerosols and cloud structures in the atmospheres of Titan, Saturn, and
Uranus. The objective is to determine the optical properties of those three
planetary bodies, the vertical and horizontal distributions of the cloud and
aerosol particles present in their atmospheres, and the atmospheric
microphysics. The data will be obtained through ground-based and HST
observations. From the observations and modeling, the investigators expect to
improve our knowledge of the composition and chemistry of the bodies'
atmospheres; and of how cloud and aerosol particles interact with solar and
thermal radiation to modify the atmospheric heat balance, affect the atmospheric
dynamics, and control the scattering and emission of solar and planetary
radiation. The proposed research is timely because of the plane-crossing of
Saturn's rings in 1995/96 (which virtually eliminates the usual light pollution
by the rings and which will not repeat until 2038); it is broad because of its
mutli-observatory data acquisition plan; and, despite its focus on three rather
different planetary bodies, it has a unifying theme through its focus on the
effects of cloud and aerosol particles on atmospheric structure and evolution.
