Cities&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: NeTS-NR: Towards a Service-Oriented
Internet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a novel service-
oriented Internet (SOI) architecture that circumvents the inherent limitations
of the current IP infrastructure. The new architecture provides a unified
substrate for enabling and supporting new Internet services, while leveraging
existing IP networks for data delivery. In the SOI architecture three key
abstractions are advanced: 1) the notion of service cloud which is an abstract
representation of a collection of service entities that an application or
information service provider deploys over the Internet to fur-nish its services;
2) a new two-level, location-independent addressing scheme consisting of a
globally defined, fixed-length service id which uniquely identifies each service
cloud, and a variable-length, service-specific object id which speci-fies an
object within a service cloud; 3) a new service layer that resides between the
IP network layer and end-system layers for flexible support of service rout-ing
and delivery. The SOI architecture can potentially facilitate and enable the
deployment of value-added services that will spur the further development of the
Internet, and produce great benefits to the society in general. Furthermore, the
understanding and insights to be gained as a result of this research will lead
to the establishment of design principles, mechanisms, and guidelines for
building and evolving the future Internet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr.
