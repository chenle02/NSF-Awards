9317699 Sullivan Basic and Applied Aspects of this Research: This research uses
a favorable model system, a duplication of the Adh gene in certain species of
Drosophila, to understand the causes and outcomes of important molecular genetic
events, which have occurred during the evolution of this group of insects.
Understanding of these events is central in formulating hypotheses regarding the
organization and evolution of the genome. Currently, there is substantial
interest in determining the structure of several genomes including that of
humans. A knowledge of genome structure offers the hope of therapeutic
approaches being developed for human genetic diseases. This work is based on the
premise that if one wishes to understand the structure of the genome, then one
will have to learn how the genome was put together and the mechanisms which
control its assembly.
