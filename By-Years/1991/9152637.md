Astronomical imaging can provide excellent opportunities for undergraduate
students to explore the science of astronomy, the process of scientific
investigation, and the technology of imaging and image processing. Students are
using a CCD camera attached to Grinnell's 0.61 m telescope to carry out a wide
variety of observational programs and processing the resulting images on the
observatory's Sun workstation using IRAF and other image processing software.
Projects involve the study of relatively faint objects (galaxies, nebulae, and
star clusters) and emphasize the extraction of physical information from the
images through, for example, the use of filters during the exposures, and
computer analysis of the resulting images. This instrumentation is used most
heavily by physics majors who are doing one or two-semester independent study
projects, but is also used in the general astronomy and advanced laboratory
courses. The acquisition of a CCD camera system completes the process of
development of image acquisition and analysis capability at Grinnell's
observatory that has taken place over the past several years.
