Abstract (Fefferman, 1265524)

This proposal includes several topics, including the following: The dispersion
surface of Hamiltonians for two-dimensional potentials having the symmetry of
the honeycomb lattice generically exhibit conical singularities, which persist
under certain small deformations of the lattice. In particular, graphene is
governed by such a Hamiltonian. In addition, the proposal studies the formation
of singularities in finite time for solutions of the classical water wave
equation and several variants. More precisely, the chord-arc constant for the
interface between water and air can tend to zero in finite time. A third topic
investigated is the interpolation of data by functions in Sobolev spaces. Given
a function defined on a large finite set in Euclidean space, the problem is to
compute a function on the whole Euclidean space that agrees with the given
function on the finite set, and has Sobolev norm of the least possible order of
magnitude. Efficient algorithms for such interpolation are now known for a range
of the parameters specifying the Sobolev space; but for the remaining Sobolev
spaces the problem remains open. A fourth topic of investigation is to develop a
fundamental understanding of the solutions of partial differential equations
arising from complex analysis, from the viewpoint of harmonic analysis.

Graphene is widely regarded as potentially very important in physics and
technology, precisely because of the unusual quantum-mechanical properties
studied under this grant. Fluids and the interfaces between them occur in nature
and in engineering applications, yet the fundamental mathematical understanding
of their behavior remains a major challenge. The computation of smooth functions
agreeing with data is a major theme in statistics, and is one approach to the
important problem of coping with big data. The harmonic analysis of the
equations of several complex variables is a fundamental problem of mathematics,
with relations to many other mathematical problems.
