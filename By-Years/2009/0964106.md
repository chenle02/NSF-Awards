Multicore chips with hundreds of cores will likely be available soon. Current
trends suggest that cores will be relatively simple, that on-chip memory will be
partitioned into per-core caches, and that each cache will be relatively small.
Furthermore, chips will continue to be pin-limited and therefore DRAM bandwidth
won't scale with the number of cores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parallel software
that is data intensive has the potential to run well on multicore processors due
to the large total amount of on-chip cache, but requires effective use of the
distributed on-chip caches. The dangers are that data used by many cores will be
duplicated in many cores' caches, decreasing the total amount of distinct data
that can be cached; and that some cores may incur DRAM loads trying to access
more data than fits in their caches, while other cores have spare cache
space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the number of cores per DRAM interface and the
latencies between caches on a chip increase, it is important for software to
manage the distributed caches well. A collaborative approach that involves
architects and systems researchers to extend the memory interface to provide
control over data placement and enable on-chip efficient data movement provides
a holistic solution. Specifically, this work proposes data-movement control
(DMC) interface, which includes support for cache-to-cache transfers, batching
of several cache lines, sending a message to a core that is close to a cache
that holds a particular data item, and data monitoring. The proposal also
includes techniques to route data over the interconnect that will provide high
performance for the DMC interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, DMC will
help data-intensive applications avoid memory bottlenecks and allow them to run
well on future multicore processors. A full-system simulator will allow other
researchers to explore intelligent and efficient data management and enable
research projects in MIT's graduate computer architecture class, educating
students about the challenges of multicore computing.
