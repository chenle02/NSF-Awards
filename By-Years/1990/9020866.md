This project involves the training of graduate students in cultural
anthropology at the University of Michigan. This is one of two graduate programs
funded in a new competition for support for ethnographic research training. The
program will use the funds to support the methodological training of cultural
anthropology students before their critical dissertation fieldwork. These
training activities will be suited to the individual student's needs, in
research training with a faculty mentor or as pilot research to prepare for
future dissertation fieldwork. This research training is important in order to
maintain and develop the "state-of-the-art" of cultural anthropology's
ethnographic research methods. The projects will upgrade the methodological
training of cultural anthropologists, which will maintain the intellectual
quality of this research area.
