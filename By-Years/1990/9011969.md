This research investigates the processes through which major shifts have
occurred in the curricular structure of higher education institutions. It is
based on population ecology and institutional theories of change in
organizational populations. The PI examines changes in the curricula of four-
year institutions using cohort analysis. She will use logistic and proportional
hazards models to estimate the probability of an institution having a specified
curricular structure, the likelihood of curricular change, and the impact of
curricular change on institutions' survival chances. A central theoretical
objective of the research is to clarify the general dynamics through which
change in organizational populations occurs. The study will contribute to social
theory and to educational policy.
