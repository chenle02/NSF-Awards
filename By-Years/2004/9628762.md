9628762 Wang An International Conference on Molecular Beam Epitaxy(MBE) is
being held to address new, more microscopic aspects of MBE phenomena. Chemical
kinetic reactions and mechanisms in critical aspects of interfaces, thin film
surface evolution and continuous film development during early stages of epitaxy
of both compound and elemental semiconductors ar e being addressed through
advanced processing and characterization techniques being studied by a new
generation of young scientists. Current topics in semiconductor materials growth
under lattice mismatch conditions, and related in situ advanced materials
characterization are an integral part of the conference. There will be an
opportunity to a ssess the field, and to establish ties between universities,
research institutions, and industry. It is expected that top scientists in the
field will attend, and that the Conference will provide an effective forum to
discuss and delineate critical scientific issues in this important research
area, and to consider and define the approaches and te chniques needed to
address them. %%% An evaluation of the progress and status of Molecular Beam
Epitaxy and related materials processing and characterization issues, especially
critical materials research areas of hetero-epitaxy, processing, and the
relationship of materials research to device and circuit fabrication along with
current assessments of the most important developments in this field will be of
great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of advanced materials
in the field of electronics and photonics. *** _
