Annular modes, an observed large-scale pattern of climate variability, have
marked impacts on weather throughout large regions of the globe. They have
potentially important implications for weather prediction, and they have
contributed substantially to recent climate change. This research seeks to
improve our understanding of these important patterns of variability. The
research is delineated by three principal scientific objectives: 1) to better
understand the processes whereby annular variability in the extra tropical
circulation is coupled to the circulation of the tropics; 2) to better
understand the processes whereby the annular modes orchestrate climate
variability on hemispheric scales; and 3) to better understand the dynamic
coupling between

annular variability in the stratosphere and troposphere. The PI will employ a
suite of observations and a climate model to address these objectives.

Broader Impacts. The educational outreach (through the PI's web site on annular
modes) and societal benefits (through advances in weather and climate
prediction) expected from this research are very good and of high potential
realization for this project.
