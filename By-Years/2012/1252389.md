The PI porposes to employ computer adaptive testing (CAT) to improve: STEM
learning of Physics, test performance and student retention. The PI notes that
this interdisciplinary, empirical proposal combines expertise in
testing/measurement, cognition, and STEM education to diagnose students? problem
solving and conceptual deficits prior to taking high-stakes course exams, and
then to devise interventions aimed at remedying identified deficits in order to
improve students? course performance and, ultimately, their retention in STEM
disciplines. Working within the domain of physics at the undergraduate level,
the research team will investigate the feasibility of using computer adaptive
testing (CAT) techniques to devise a cognitively diagnostic computer adaptive
testing (CD-CAT) tool that accurately predicts students? future performance on
tests in difficult STEM introductory undergraduate courses prior to their
administration. The potential findings will have relevance for other STEM
disciplines, and if successful, for broadening participation.
