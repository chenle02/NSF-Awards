The proposed activity under this award will investigate the neural
representation of affective valence during visual object perception. The objects
used in these experiments will be consumer products that are currently under
development by the companies that the team will be working with during this
award. The experiments the team plans to conduct will rely on a combination of
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral psychophysics
designed to develop strategies and analysis tools to most effectively predict,
as well as understand why, which object-based products are most preferred by
consumers. In doing so, the team will form a more neuropsychologically-based
model of how specific subcomponents of the visual system interact with both
affective processing, and with the choice and decision-making
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By applying neuro-scientific methods to consumer
testing and product development, the team will be introducing well-grounded,
cutting-edge science and technology to commercial sectors that have not
typically employed such methods. Beyond specific product evaluation and
assessment, in an effort to provide the best possible service, clients will be
instructed regarding the general principles of the approach. Thus, the team
plans to conduct workshops for any of their customers that wish to learn more
about the brain and how it functions. This will allow customers to be more
involved in the process and ultimately get the most out of the service. The
team's innovations have the potential to create a significant commercial impact
by increasing the number of products produced that are more human centered,
preferred, and which better meet human needs. This has the potential to rapidly
decrease the physical and financial waste surrounding products that are not
preferred and are therefore not consumed.
