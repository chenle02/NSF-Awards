In this study Professor David Micha of the University of Florida is being
supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the Division
of Chemistry. Theoretical methods are being developed which treat the time-
evolution of electronic excitation, electron transfer and orbital polarization
in ion-atom collisions and in electron transfer collisions. The goal of this
theory, which is based on time-dependent molecular orbitals, is to provide new
insights, concepts, and methods for describing collision- induced and photo-
induced electronic transitions. A related objective is the development of
methods for computing the time evolution of electronic state populations,
differential and integral cross sections, and electronic branching ratios.
Applications are being made to the description of atom-atom, atom-diatom, and
atom-solid surface collisions. The evolution in time of the properties of atoms
and molecules as they undergo collisions or interactions with light can be
described by modern theoretical and computational methods based on quantum
mechanics. In this study new procedures for obtaining these descriptions are
being developed and applied to a wide variety of chemically interesting systems.
