Reactions that take place at the sediment-water interface and within the
sediment column under oceanic regions of high productivity significantly affect
the global budgets of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, and silica. The Principal
Investigators have been successful in using in situ benthic flux chambers to
directly measure fluxes of these elements and have described their cycling
within the basins of the southern California borderland. They are proposing to
continue this type of work by: (1) building individual flux chambers for use
with the submersible Alvin in order to directly study the effects of the
disturbance from chamber deployment to the sediment-water interface on benthic
exchange rates; (2) deploying landers in Santa Monica Basin in order to measure
nitrate uptake rates that will enable us to confirm estimates of the rates of
oxygen and nitrogen cycling in these coastal sediments. The purpose of building
individual chambers is to perform manipulative experiments with the aid of Alvin
and quantify the relationship between disturbance to the sediment-water
interface and benthic exchange rates. This will establish an accurate value for
benthic exchange of nitrogenous compounds, silica, oxygen and carbon species.
