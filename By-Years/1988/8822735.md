This award will partially support U.S. and Latin American researchers to
participate in an international workshop on the historical biogeography of
neotropical freshwater fishes to be held in conjunction with the annual meeting
of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists in San Francisco,
California, June 17-23. Co-organized by Professor Jonathan N. Baskin of
California State Polytechnic University and Professor Naercio Menezes of the
University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, the workshop will serve to bring together
ecologists, geologists, paleontologists and others to promote the exchange and
development of ideas. The importance of understanding and conserving the
Neotropical biota is widely appreciated by both scientists and the public, but
the diversity and complexity of the freshwater fishes is at best only beginning
to be understood. By bringing together a sizable number of researchers in the
field from Latin America with their U.S. counterparts, this award serves to
fulfill the goals of the Science in Developing Countries Program.
