This award supports the research in Combinatorics of Professor Philip Hanlon of
the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Dr. Hanlon will work in two general
problem areas at the junction of Combinatorics and Representation Theory. The
first area is concerned with the homology of certain nilpotent Lie algebras, and
homological extensions to the Macdonald root- system conjectures. The second
area is concerned with problems related to Jones's basic construction, and the
algebra structures of Brauer's centralizer algebras corresponding to Stanley's
Fibonacci r-differential posets. This research falls in the broad category of
Combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.
Fundamentally, Combinatorics represents a systematization of the very first of
all mathematical activities, counting. In its modern development, however,
Combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of a wide variety of
advanced mathematical techniques, and although its roots go back several
centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past few decades
because of its importance in communications and information technology.
