Professor Raymer studies the quantum statistical properties of light generated
by "stimulated splitting" of photons in an intense laser pulse as it travels
through a nonlinear optical crystal. This light splitting technique is optical
parametric amplification (OPA) and produces strongly correlated photon pairs.
The ability to measure photon-number distribution with high quantum efficiency
makes possible a detailed characterization of nonclassical (inherently quantum
mechanical) effects.
