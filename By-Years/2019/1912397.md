The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or
careers. The project at Southern University and A&amp;M College will enhance
undergraduate education in the Department of Electrical Engineering by
establishing the Computer Engineering Research Lab (CERL) and preparing students
to meet the needs of the workforce or advanced studies with industry-like
research experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the objectives to:
establish the CERL; implement and develop web-based and mobile-based
applications; provide research experiences for undergraduate students; and
develop a summer research program for senior high school students and teachers.
The CERL will provide undergraduate students with practical skills through
industry based-courses and projects in areas such as robotics, the Internet of
Things, and smart technologies. The lab experience will offer tools, research
opportunities, lectures, and mentoring to undergraduate students. The project is
guided by formative and summative evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
