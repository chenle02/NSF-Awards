This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has the goal of
creating a signal amplification system that, while being inexpensive and simple
to use, can be combined with antibodies or other probe molecules, and can
increase detection limits of conventional ELISAs by 100- to 1000-fold, or even
higher. To prove the concept, it is proposed to apply this system to rabbit
antibodies and demonstrate that, in combination with rabbit antibodies raised
against botulinum neurotoxin A, it will be able to provide sensitivity of
detection similar to that of immuno-PCR, but at a fraction of the
cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this
research is expected in the areas of basic research, biodefense, and medicine.
This system will allow very sensitive and inexpensive detection of antigens of
choice. For those involved in basic research, the proposed immunoassay will
allow a significantly more detailed analysis of biological processes, possibly
even opening the doors to monitoring those processes and molecules previously
undetectable. In biodefense and medical diagnostics, increased sensitivity will
mean an increased security by allowing earlier detection of harmful pathogens,
as well as pathological change.
