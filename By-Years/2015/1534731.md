This award will provide support for graduate and undergraduate students to
participate in one of the world's leading accelerator conferences, the 6th
International Particle Accelerator Conference, to be held in Richmond VA May
3-8, 2015. This conference expects over 1300 participants from around the world,
including many of the leaders in accelerator science research. There are many
presentations in all major topics in accelerator science: linear and circular
colliders, photon sources, electron accelerators, alternative sources, hadron
accelerators, beam dynamics, instrumentation and controls, and others. In
addition the conference will have sessions on technology transfer and
accelerator applications applicable to a wide field of industry.

The award will be used to support, entirely or in part, approximately 35
students. They will be making presentations which will be made available on the
public web page. The students will also participate in broadening representation
programs: Teacher's Day Program, Women in Science and the National Society of
Hispanic Physicists. This program will be an excellent opportunity for young
scientists to gain information and for them to interact with more experienced
researchers.
