This award to the University of Cincinnati's Department of Geology is made in
response to a proposal submitted to the National Science Foundation's
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will provide one-
half of the funds needed to acquire a microscope equipped with transmitted and
reflected light capabilities and a closed-circuit TV camera with three monitors.
The University is committed to matching the NSF contribution for this equipment.
The equipment will be used in a series of undergraduate laboratory courses in
optical mineralogy, igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary petrology and the
geology of ore deposits where it will enhance the teaching of microscope
techniques.
