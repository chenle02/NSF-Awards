9316347 Bruhn The development of abnormally pressured fluid compartments is
crucial to the evolution of fold and fault belts. This project will investigate
three fundamental hypotheses concerning abnormally pressured fluid compartments
in the Cook Inlet region of south- central Alaska, and will involve integration
of surface mapping, subsurface geophysical and rock data, and various laboratory
measurements. Results will be incorporated into a predictive model for the
generation and evolution of abnormally pressured compartments in regional
transcurrent and related fault systems. ***
