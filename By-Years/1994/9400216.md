9400216 Hearn The overall objective of the research is to increase the
efficiency and applicability of large-scale optimization methods. Applications
include models in operations research, production systems, electrical and civil
engineering and in the sciences. The development includes both theoretical and
computational investigations of decomposition techniques which allow division of
a large problem into more tractable subproblems. The new techniques will be
specifically applied to network models where congestion or other nonlinearities
are important and to models for production planning. By doing so, the range and
versatility of the methods, as well as their effectiveness, will be
demonstrated. ***
