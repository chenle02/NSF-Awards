9353081 Sambrotto This project is to develop an interactive, computer based
program that will promote conceptualization through student exploration of
relevant scientific and societal issues in earth science. The proposed software
would provide the capability to access, analyze and model geographically based
data using a state of the art graphical interface and would retrieve data over a
distributed computer network such as Internet. The proposed curriculum entitled
EARTH VIEW is to be a general model by which computer networking can be used to
expand the classroom. A personalized notebook would be developed and used to
guide students' exploration and would provide a site for recording findings and
interpretations. This notebook would also serve as a portfolio for evaluation of
learning progress. A CD-ROM would be produced for those schools who did not have
direct access to an on-line data source or Internet.
