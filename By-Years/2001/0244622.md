DMS-0244622&lt;br/&gt;Selman Akbulut&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Division of
Mathematical Sciences Focused Research Group &lt;br/&gt;(FRG) award made under
solicitation &lt;br/&gt;http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2002/nsf02129/nsf02129.htm&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to find purely topological
(continuous or&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial) definitions of the invariants arising
out of&lt;br/&gt;Seiberg-Witten theory. These include the basic classes
for&lt;br/&gt;4-dimensional manifolds, and the Oszvath-Szabo Floer homology
for&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds. Recent progress, in particular the striking results
of&lt;br/&gt;Ozsvath and Szabo in the last two years, has brought Seiberg-
Witten&lt;br/&gt;theory seemingly close to topology, and a concerted effort by
this&lt;br/&gt;group may be able finish the task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
proposal falls under the larger topics of gauge theory and
string&lt;br/&gt;theory, which are closely connected to and motivated by
theoretical&lt;br/&gt;physics, in particular the attempt to unify the forces of
nature.&lt;br/&gt;Low-dimensional bordism theory is the mathematical analogue of
n+1&lt;br/&gt;dimensional quantum field theories, i.e. an n-dimensional space
and&lt;br/&gt;1-dimensional time correspond to an (n+1)-dimensional bordism
between&lt;br/&gt;two n-dimensional manifolds. These bordisms can have extra
structure,&lt;br/&gt;e.g. contact structures in odd dimensions and symplectic
structures in&lt;br/&gt;even dimensions. Progress in understanding the
mathematical&lt;br/&gt;underpinnings of this sort of physics feeds back into
better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the physics.&lt;br/&gt;
