This planning grant will develop well-formulated plans for a future Utilities
and Energy Regional Center of Excellence. To accomplish this goal, the project
team is focused on three objectives: 1: Develop a robust network of industry and
educational partners; 2. Investigate and document the utilities and energy
education needs in the Midwest; and 3. Develop a plan to increase the
availability of utilities training for technicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project has the potential to advance knowledge in the utilities and energy
sectors, particularly at the two-year college level. As new workers replace
retiring workers, the industry will have an influx of newly trained employees,
some of whom might not have much hands-on experience. This planning grant will
work with partners across the Midwest, including some of the Midwest's largest
energy companies, to ensure that graduates have the skills required to keep the
energy companies running. Leveraging resources across colleges and state
boundaries, whether they be state-of-the-art laboratories or industry expertise,
can help multiple colleges work together to create more options for cost-
effective utilities and energy programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing the
diversity of those who participate in energy careers with be crucial to the
health of these industries. Changing the demographic makeup of the workforce
needs to begin at the two-year college level. For this reason, this planning
grant will gather demographic information and best practices and use a planning
summit to develop a strategy for broadening participation by the end of the
project.
