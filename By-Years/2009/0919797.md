Programmed cell death (PCD) of obsolete tissues is a precisely regulated
biological process, and plays critical roles for normal animal development.
During transition from juveniles to adults, reproductive maturation is
accompanied by a significant remodeling of the central nervous system (CNS) to
accommodate adult-like reasoning and behavioral changes. PCD of selective
neurons is one of the remodelling processes, thereby contributing to the
scupturing of the adult CNS. Despite extensive biochemical and genetic studies
on PCD, the mechanisms and selectivity of neuronal PCD are poorly understood
mainly due to the lack of a model system. Previous studies, by the principal
investigator, on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster revealed that a group of
neuropeptide-producing neurons in the fly CNS are programmed to die shortly
after the onset of metamorphosis. To find molecular components of PCD of these
neurons and to elucidate how they are involed in such death pathway, this
project will use various genetic and histological tools available for Drosophila
research. It is expected that signaling of the steroid molting hormone,
ecdysone, is a key endocrine cue that triggers the PCD of the larval neurons,
and TGF-beta and Dimm are likely to control such ecdysone-regulated PCD. The
proposed research will provide an excellent model system to understand how
developmentally controlled PCD of juvenile neurons contribute to the formation
of adult CNS in insects as well as in vertebrates. This research project will
also provide undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students with various
levels of training associated with genetics and neurobiology.
