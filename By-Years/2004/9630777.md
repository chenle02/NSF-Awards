Oswald 9630777 Information in the brain is transmitted from one nerve cell to
another by the release of a messenger molecule from the presynaptic cell which
diffuses across the small space and interacts with a protein imbedded in the
membrane of the postsynaptic cell called a receptor. Glutamate is the most
prevalent excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. The receptors for glutamate
bind the amino acid, and respond by opening a channel between the outside of the
cell and the inside of the cell allowing positively charged ions to flow across
the cell membrane. Dr. Oswald is characterizing the topology of the glutamate
receptor and has found the receptors to be similar in structure to bacterial
proteins which have similar functions. The evolution of these molecules could
help understand the mechanisms cells use to communicate. Studies are continuing
to understand the mechanisms of glutamate binding to this receptor. These
investigations will yield novel data on the structure and function of glutamate
receptors in the brain and are important to understand adaptive mechanisms that
have been borrowed from simple organisms for use in higher species during
evolution. In addition, these studies may provide the first information about
the molecular basis for learning and memory.
