ABSTRACT This research will explore the interacting roles of social,
attributional, and metacognitive contributors to first-grade children's
preferences for math strategies. Children are hypothesized to accumulate a set
of preferred math strategies based on perceived social acceptability of the
strategies, their attributions about the role of effort in learning, and
metacognitive knowledge. Children who believe that effort in learning increases
ability, as opposed to children who believe that ability is stable, are believed
to develop more metacognitive knowledge about strategies and to use strategies
that result in good performance. Children who believe ability to be stable and
indicative of intelligence are expected to be more influenced in their use of
math strategies by teachers', parents', and peers' attitudes toward strategies.
The development of strategies and mathematical performance across a single
school year will be examined as a function of perceived social attitudes toward
strategies, strategy training in the school and home, attributional beliefs, and
metacognitive factors. Of special interest will be the shift from external
strategies (e.g., fingers) to internal strategies (e.g., mental calculation)
since much of children's early strategy use is external and therefore open to
the effects of social comment on the desirability of such strategies.
