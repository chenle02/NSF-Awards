Time-resolved structure determinations are at the forefront of attempts to
understand the mechanisms of protein reactions. X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XAS) provides a window on the environment of specific atoms in chemical and
biological systems, and is well suited to examining the chemistry of metal atoms
in biological milieu. In addition, XAS can be applied to a wide range of sample
phases, and can successfully probe the chemical environment of a wide range of
atoms in the periodic table (from low Z atoms, like sulfur, to heavy atoms, like
third row transition metals). We are developing a system for collecting high
quality x-ray absorption spectroscopy data on s and longer timescales. The
method can be used for both full spectra accumulation and kinetic
spectrophotometry. Experiments using this technology have vast potential, not
only for examining metalloproteins, but also for observing the dynamic behavior
of a wide range of chemical elements in conjunciton with photo-chemical, rapid
mixing, and temperature jump techniques. We have tested the system by examining
the structural evolution of the myoglobin-carbon monoxide complex after
photolysis at low temperature.
