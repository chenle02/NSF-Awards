0227936&lt;br/&gt;Villa-Komaroff &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to
Northwestern University to support the activity described below for 36 months.
The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation
Program Solicitation (NSF 02060).&lt;br/&gt;The partners include Northwestern
University (Lead Institution), Illinois Technology Enterprise Corporation and
the Women's Business Development Center, Evanston Township High School, Truman
Community College, Young Women's Leadership Charter School of Chicago, Abbott
Laboratories, Accelerated Business Solutions, Biotron Group, Counseltech, cue
BIOtech, Piper Rudnick LLC, Springboard Enterprises, Wellspring Communications,
Women Advancing Bioscience, Association for Women in Science. The program will
increase the participation of young women of all backgrounds in science and
innovation and document the partnership's activities so that similar
partnerships interested in women-focused life science economic development can
benefit from the experiences and lessons learned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
program has the following goals: (1) increase the number of women-owned and
managed life science start-ups in the Chicago region, (2) increase the number of
women receiving SBIR and STTR awards, (3) increase the percentage of venture
capital raised by women-owned businesses, (4) create wealth through additional
high paying life sciences technology jobs, (5) broaden under-served young
women's life science knowledge and participation, and (6) create a documentation
study emphasizing the people, tools, and activities needed by similar
partnerships interested in related activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will
be an increase in the number of new sources of higher-paying jobs, especially
among underrepresented populations in the region, by creating woman-owned and
managed life science companies.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
