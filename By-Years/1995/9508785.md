9508785 Teng This award supports a 24-month Science and Technology Agency of
Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Ho Teng of the Hawaii Natural Energy
Institute. Dr. Teng will work with Dr. Yuji Shindo of the National Institute of
Materials and Chemical Research (NIMC) of the Agency of Industrial Science and
Technology (AIST) within the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
in Japan. Dr. Teng will join the on-going research effort led by Dr. Shindo and
his team at NIMC that are studying carbon dioxide-ocean interaction in Japan.
NIMC has one of the few experimental systems in the world for studying the
behavior of the carbon dioxide-water system in the deep ocean. The primary
objective of the proposed research is to investigate the effects of hydrate, the
ocean current, and ocean turbulence on the dispersion and dissolution of the
carbon dioxide disposed in the ocean. It is believed that by knowing the
hydrodynamic behavior of the carbon dioxide droplets in the ocean, the
ecological impacts of carbon dioxide ocean disposal can be examined. ***
