Berger 9301438 The authors propose to study periods of known or suspected rapid
climate change at an annual resolution, using laminated sediments from Santa
Barbara Basin off Southern California. Times of interest include the "Medieval
Warm Period" (950-1350 A.D.), the climatic optimum (5000 and 8000 years B.P.),
the deglacial period and the full glacial. Cores will be scanned by Xradiography
to set up a chronology and identify levels of interest; for each level a section
representing a few decades will then be sampled with annual resolution. The
occurrence of El Ni~io intervals, intensity of upwelling and levels of primary
production, and regional precipitation will be inferred from temperature-
dependent alkenones, stable carbon isotopes and nitrogen, abundance and taxonomy
of phytoplankton fossils, and varve thickness.
