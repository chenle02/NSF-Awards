&lt;br/&gt;This grant will use NSF funds to support the International Conference
on Stochastic Analysis and Applications: From Mathematical Physics to
Mathematical Finance, to be held at Princeton University on June 13-15, 2008. We
anticipate between 15 and 25 talks by senior and junior scientists on the
following topics: Random Schr√∂dinger Operators, Wavelets and signal analysis,
Stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations, Wave propagation in
random media, Stochastic filtering, Mathematical Finance. These were inspired
partly by the unique career trajectory of Rene Carmona, of Princeton
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organizers will encourage women and
underrepresented minorities to participate in the conference. The results of the
conference, including abstracts, presentations, and preprints, will be published
online, and will address future directions of research in the field as perceived
by the speakers. The conference will create an opportunity for the education of
graduate students and beginning researchers by creating contacts, and inspiring
and uncovering possible new research topics for them. It will aid in
popularizing the idea that the interaction between theoretical and applied
mathematics is bidirectional: beyond receiving answers to their applied
questions, Finance, Statistical Physics, and other subjects provide great
problems for probability theory and applied mathematics, motivate the
development of new mathematical tools of intrinsic interest, and improve the
image of Mathematics with the general non-scientific public.&lt;br/&gt;
