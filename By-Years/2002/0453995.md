This project begins to fill a puzzling gap in the scientific literature by
undertaking a comparative study of wealth accumulation patterns of black and of
white households, as can be learned from the manuscript schedules of population
for 1850 and 1860. To better identify undercurrent of movement and their
possible explanations, a longitudinal dataset is being compiled that links
samples of Mid-Atlantic households recorded in the US census manuscript
schedules. Modern statistical methods will be used to estimate models of
socioeconomic differences in wealth ownership and wealth mobility. The research
findings will be valuable to: (1) economists who seek to understand historical
aspects of wealth inequality; (2) social scientists analyzing the relationship
between socioeconomic differences and social outcomes; and (3) policy makers who
want to address socioeconomic differences in wealth accumulation patterns.
