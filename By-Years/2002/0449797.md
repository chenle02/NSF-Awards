The goals of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program research
grant are to study two precision form grinding technologies for advanced
materials and to develop web-based mechanical engineering design courses for
undergraduate and graduate education. The increased utilization of advanced
materials, complexity of parts, and the requirements of tighter form tolerances
and surface finish along with the pressure to reduce cost demand the development
of new cost-effective form grinding technologies. Diamond, the hardest material
known to exist, has long been recognized as the only abrasive that works
effectively in the grinding of ceramics and other advanced materials. The
generation of micrometer-scale precision forms on diamond wheels has proven
difficult due to the excess wear of the diamond tool during truing of diamond
grinding wheels. This study plans to investigate the use of the cylindrical wire
Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) process to generate the desired form on a
rotating metal bond diamond wheel and to use the conventional abrasive on low
thermal conductivity ceramic materials, such as zirconia. Research tasks include
analysis of the chip formation mechanism in grinding, modeling the energy
partition and grinding temperature, studying the erosion mechanism for
cylindrical wire EDM of metal bond diamond wheels, and thermal modeling of
cylindrical wire EDM of metal bond diamond wheels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
success of this research project will lead to a better understanding of the
cylindrical wire EDM process and to the development of a new mechanism for
grinding low thermal conductivity ceramic materials. These results will help
lower the cost and improve the accuracy of machining components made of advanced
materials. The Internet technology will be used extensively to disseminate and
integrate the results in the proposed web-based course development. It will
offer rapid and efficient access to knowledge and&lt;br/&gt;information in
machine and process design and development.&lt;br/&gt;
