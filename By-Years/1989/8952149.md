This project will incorporate the study of polymers, ceramics, and composites
into the existing laboratory. The addition of this equipment makes comparisons
between the structural and mechanical properties of all major classes of
materials possible. With a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), a sensitive
and quantitative method becomes available for detecting phase transformations in
metals and polymers, and lass gransition emperatures and crystillinity in
polymers. Supplemental accessories for the existing tensile testing equipment
will permit flexural testing of ceramics and polymers. For the adequate
characterization of polymers with changes in temperature and time dependent
loading, a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) will be used. By including computer
control in these experiments, the students are exposed to modern laboratory data
acquaition and are relieved from tedious data collection which allows them to
concentrate on interpretation of the results and the development of analytical
skills.
