The International Conference on Malliavin Calculus and Stochastic Analysis, to
be held March 19-21, 2011, at the University of Kansas, will bring together many
top players in stochastic analysis and probability theory, two interconnected
branches of mathematics at the crossroads of theoretical and applied math. The
topics covered will include some of the most important recent developments,
noted because of their intrinsic beauty and intriguing new structures, as well
as for some exciting potential for new statistical procedures which may improve
our understanding of many fields from climate science, to telecommunications, to
quantitative finance. The conference will attract many graduate students and
recent Ph.D.s, who will benefit greatly from interaction with the many top
researchers present at the conference, exposing them to the state of the art in
their fields, creating career-lasting contacts, and helping develop their peer
networks. This meeting is of special significance to the world of stochastic
analysis, as an hommage to the recently departed Paul Malliavin and his
extraordinary work and influence, and as a tribute to David Nualart, arguably
the greatest disseminator of the Malliavin calculus, one who has influenced
scores of researchers over several generations, and continues to inspire in the
same way.
