&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project involves an integrated study including experiments, analysis and
simulations to develop a fundamental understanding of the effects introduced by
material property gradients on the static and dynamic fracture behavior of
functionally graded materials (FGMs). Two distinct material systems, exhibiting
brittle-to-ductile transitions will be used: polymer-based (ECO) and
ceramic/metal based (ZrO2/steel) FGMs. A detailed investigation of the effects
of microstructure as a function of manufacturing processes and processing
history on the macroscopic properties of the FGM will be conducted. The modeling
involves development of a novel cohesive volumetric finite element (CVFE) code
tailored for FGMs. All the work is developed in conjunction with an educational
program. &lt;br/&gt;
