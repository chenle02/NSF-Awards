The Divisions of Chemistry (CHE) and Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and
Transport Systems (CBET) fund this award to the National Academy of Sciences to
support the core activities of the Chemical Sciences Roundtable (CSR). The CSR
provides an apolitical forum for leaders in the chemical sciences and
engineering, with the objective of enhancing understanding of issues that affect
government, academic, national laboratory and nonprofit sectors. These
discussions provide a vehicle for interaction among the participants, and for
education, exchange of information and discussion of issues and trends that
affect the chemical sciences. CSR members are appointed by the National Research
Council's Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology; membership consists of
30-35 volunteer chemical scientists and engineers from academia, industry,
government, the national laboratories, and the non-profit sector. The results of
CSR discussions and workshops will be disseminated through workshop reports made
available through professional societies, scientific and trade publications, and
on the web.
