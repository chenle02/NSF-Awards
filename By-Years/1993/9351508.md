This project is expected to increase the range and scope of ecological research
by advanced students. Specifically, computing, laboratory and field equipment is
used in student- designed research projects. Student-directed research is being
emphasized in several upper level field-oriented courses, in ecologically
focused independent studies, and in student/faculty collaborative research. The
project is also important in maintaining an active, viable research program in
ecology at the institution.
