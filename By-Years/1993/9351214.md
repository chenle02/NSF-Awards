9351214 Tinker Four water-table observation wells and piezometers are being
installed on campus in order to enhance undergraduate instruction in
hydrogeology and water resources. Using the wells, physical hydrogeology
students are determining in the field the hydrologic properties of the aquifer
including ground-water flow directions and velocities. Slug and pumping tests,
ground-water sampling techniques, and downhole geophysical methods are being
used by these students. Chemical hydrogeology students are collecting and
comparing the water chemistry from lysimeters, ground-water wells, and surface
waters to determine the chemical differences between ground and surface waters.
Students are collecting and utilizing hydrogeological parameters for capture
zone and wellhead protection strategies. Water resource students are utilizing
the ground-water wells to determine the hydrologic relationships between surface
and groundwater and their effect on a local flood-control structure. ***y
