The seminar on Stochastic Processes 2005 will be held from March 24 to March 26,
2005, at Cornell University. This series of seminars was created in 1981 by K.
L. Chung, E. Cinlar, and R. K. Getoor to provide a forum for exchange of ideas
at the research frontiers in the area of probability. It continues to be a
uniquely styled informal working seminar focused on probability and stochastic
processes. The Seminar provides an opportunity to discuss and work on recent
advances in stochastic processes for young specialists and senior researchers.
There will be five formal lectures, informal sessions for all participants to
give short presentations on their latest research, and informal sessions
emphasizing open problems.
