This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop,
optimize, and qualify significantly better varistors by the engineering of
interfaces. The need for better varistors originates from the fact that almost
all electronic devices are subject to noise and high voltage surges from
integrated circuits(IC)integration, switching or electrostatic discharge. These
surges and noises can severely affect the performance of electrical and
electronic devices. The Phase I effort demonstrated a technology that can help
meet the current and near-term performance needs from varistors. The proof-of-
concept varistors featured higher non-linear coefficient, lower leakage current,
and higher critical electric field values while simultaneously being
miniaturizable. The Phase I results also helped attract venture capital
interest. Phase II now seeks to develop, optimize and held test file varistors.
The optimized product will be the basis lot commercialization. Nanostrtictured
varistors have significant commercial potential for pulse and surge suppression
and voltage stabilization in low and high voltage circuits as well as for noise
reduction in communications and computer systems.
