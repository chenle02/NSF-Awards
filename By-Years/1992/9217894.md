This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of Michigan. The research will examine the relationship between
indigenous politics and the regulation of natural resources in northern
Madagascar. Using ethnographic methods of participant observation, structured
interviewing, household surveys, extended case studies of resource conflicts,
and analysis of remote sensing images of land use, the student will try to
understand the local populations' patterns of resource use in the context of
competing demands from local, national, and international interests. This
project is important because Madagascar is a uniquely important ecological
resource for the world. Understanding the dynamics of resource use by local
traditional peoples can help international aid organizations design programs to
satisfy local needs as well as preserve the environment.
