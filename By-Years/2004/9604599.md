9604599 Finlay This U.S.-Brazil award will support collaborative research
between Dr. Barbara L. Finlay of Cornell University and Dr. Luiz Carlos de Lima
Silveira at the Universidade Federal do Para, Centro de Ciencias Biologicas, to
study the development and evolution of the primate retina. Drs. Finlay and De
Lima Silveira will investigate the development and evolution of the visual
system, using New World primates. The developmental mechanisms that produce the
eye must use mechanisms, which are defined at a cellular level, to solve
functional problems, such as color perception and night vision. Finlay has
expertise in the developmental neurobiology of eye growth, and control of neuron
number and topography. De Lima Silveira has experience in comparative anatomy
and physiology of the New World primate retina, with particular attention to the
differences in eyes associated with color vision and nocturnal and diurnal
niches. In addition to the benefit of combining the unique resources of the two
labs, access will be gained to the National Research Center for Primates which
is located near Belem. This facility has established breeding colonies for all
the monkeys needed for this study. Facilities such as this one, with a such a
diversity of species, are not available in the United States. ***
