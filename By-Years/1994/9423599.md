9423599 Wolford This award will improve technological literacy and foster a
better understanding of, and appreciation for, engineering in the United States
by melding the talents of leading engineers with those of the television media.
This collaboration will help Americans understand the connection between
technology and human welfare, recognize the distinctions between science and
engineering, and help them to acquire the knowledge they need to make informed
decisions in an increasingly technological age. NSF support will lay the
foundation for an expanded engineering advisory presence in Public Television.
