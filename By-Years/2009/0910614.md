&lt;br/&gt;Distributed Camera Networks: Research Challenges and Future
Directions&lt;br/&gt;Bir Bhanu, University of California-
Riverside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a two-day
workshop, to be held in spring 2009 at the University of California-Riverside,
to discuss and identify research challenges and future research directions in
the multidisciplinary research area of distributed camera networks. The workshop
also intends to encourage multidisciplinary research in this area, facilitate
greater interaction among researchers, and increase understanding of potential
applications. Participants are from academia, industry, and
government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, the
workshop addresses an emerging and potentially important multidisciplinary
research area in what is intended to be a comprehensive manner. The workshop
includes a mix of participants and topics from different disciplines. Topical
areas represented include: (i) distributed sensing, processing, communication,
and control; (ii) distributed understanding of video content; (iii) real-time
embedded systems; (iv) graphics; and (v) simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
respect to broader impact, the workshop itself and follow-on research and other
activities have the potential to have a significant impact on important
potential applications including video surveillance, monitoring of disaster
sites, traffic monitoring, in-home care of the elderly, and entertainment. The
workshop includes discussion of educational issues. The workshop intends to
engage a diverse set of participants.
