SGER: Concrete and CO2 Sequestering: How Much? How Fast?

The production of Portland cement-based concrete is considered one of the
largest contributors to carbon dioxide, which is a major component of greenhouse
gas emissions. Through life cycle assessment of the sustainability of concrete,
concrete carbonation has been evaluated as a potentially important sink for
carbon dioxide. However, the extent and kinetics of the up take of carbon
dioxide by concrete that is crushed and recycled after its primary use have not
been examined in detail. This exploratory project will develop a conceptual
model for the sequestration of carbon dioxide by concrete through data mining of
existing equilibrium and kinetic studies from diverse disciplines. The data will
be analyzed to estimate maximum carbonation potentials and optimize
sequestration. The results will be incorporated in life cycle assessment models
and experimental approaches to evaluate the sequestration potential of reuse and
recycle of concrete. Understanding the role of deconstructed materials in
greenhouse gas sequestration will influence the recycling of concrete as well as
use of concrete in future construction. The participating graduate and
undergraduate students will benefit from exposure to a broad range of
disciplines and development of conceptual models.
