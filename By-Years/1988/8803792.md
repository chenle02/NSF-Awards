This award provides one-half the funds required to purchase an automated powder
X-ray diffraction system. The system will be installed and operated in the
Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The
University will provide the remaining funds required for the purchase of the
diffractometer system. The new equipment is needed for research projects in the
Department of Geological Sciences and will also be made available to other
researchers on campus from the departments of chemistry, chemical engineering,
and civil engineering. In addition to a variety of research applications for
which the new system is needed to provide phase identification, the automated
equipment will also be intensively used for the structural analysis of layered
silicate minerals and their derivatives.
