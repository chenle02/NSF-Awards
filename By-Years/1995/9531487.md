9531487 Morrow This REU site award will bring eight undergraduates to the
University of Washington to work on inverse problems. The inverse problem for an
electrical network is to determine the conductivity of each of the resistors in
the network when the response of the network to boundary voltages is known. The
inverse problem in impedance tomography is to determine the conductivity
throughout the interior of a conducting body from measurements of potentials and
currents on the boundary. Students will investigate relations between the
response matrix of an electrical network and the conductors in the network. They
will also work on applications of these discrete problems to inverse problems
for conducting bodies. The program will run for eight weeks. During the first
week there will be lectures describing known results, open problems, and
numerical approaches. Students will then begin working on projects of their own
choosing, using the available computing facilities, if appropriate. Students can
work on their own or in teams of two or three. They will continue to meet at
regularly scheduled times for the remaining weeks. At the end the students will
write papers on their projects.
