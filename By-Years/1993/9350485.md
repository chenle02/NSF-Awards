This project would planfor the development of a unified environment where
researfh mathematicians, scholars in mathematic education, school and college
teachers, skilled programmers, amd material developers can interact to develop
materials for mathematics education at all levels. The central focus would be
geometric visualization. High priority in the major project would be on the
development of materials which were easy to use for both teacher and student and
upon dissemination. The materials to be developed would include computer
programs, narrated videos, text materials, and manipulatives. The planning
process would include the establishment of contacts and ties with various
producers of visualization materials, commercial publishers, nationwide
curriculumprojects, and experts in dissemination and testing, as well as
mathematics education specialists and schooland college teachers.
