The John Day Formation of the Pacific Northwest includes volcanic deposits
interlayered with terrestrial strata, in which plants and animals from the
Tertiary Epoch are preserved. The Condon Museum of the University of Oregon
houses more than 32,000 fossil vertebrates from the John Day beds of Oregon, as
well as plant and invertebrate fossils that cover a wider spectrum of geologic
ages. This collection ranks as an important resource for paleontological
research, and Dr. William Orr, Curator of the collection, proposes significant
improvements in its condition. The collection will be installed in high density
compactorized storage units in newly renovated quarters, and will be inventoried
and reorganized in the process. A computer database of the collection's contents
will be implemented, thereby providing the research community with better access
to these important fossils. Regionally important collections such as the Condon
Museum are critical elements of the nation's research infrastructure. They
provide easier access by researchers and students within the region, and they
support advanced training in systematics, ecology, and evolutionary biology.
These and other advantages would be lost if regional collections were to be
subsumed into a few national repositories. The proposed collection improvement
will enhance important paleontological research and graduate training, and
preserve part of our nation's natural heritage.
