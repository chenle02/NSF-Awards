Study of the Earth's Deep Interior is an essentially multidisciplinary activity.
The CSEDI program at EAR, NSF was conceived a decade ago to facilitate such
multidisciplinary research activities. So much has happened in the last decade
that the time is right for the "Deep Earth" community to revisit the CSEDI
science plan and think about how we would like the CSEDI program to evolve. This
proposal requests funds for a community-wide workshop to do just
this.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Breaking down barriers to doing truly
multidisciplinary research is particularly important in improving our
understanding of the way the Earth works. The proposed workshop will not only
evaluate where our science is but also will also consider the question of how
best to do multidisciplinary science to solve the problems that face
us&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
