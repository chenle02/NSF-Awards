This award will enable collaborative research between Dr. Romeo Flores of the
U.S. Geological Survey, Denver and Mr. Simon Nathan of the New Zealand
Geological Survey. They will collect and describe stratigraphic and
sedimentologic data from the Buller Coalfield in the northwest South Island, New
Zealand. The investigations will emphasize study of the facies of the coals and
associated sedimentary rocks with the intent of constructing a depositional
model. This model will then be used to evaluate the stratigraphic architecture
and areal distribution, as well as the thickness, lateral variation, geometry,
and quality of the coal deposits. Construction of depositional models of ancient
coal measures is useful in predicting stratigraphic architecture, lateral and
vertical distribution, thickness, geometry and quality of associated coal
deposits. Because the physical and chemical properties of coal are directly
related to environmental settings, such predictive models can serve as guides to
exploration and development of economic coals. Simon Nathan's working knowledge
of the Buller Coalfield will be complemented by Romeo Flores' expertise in
developing coal basin facies models. Knowledge gained in this project, in
addition to directly impacting methods of exploration and mining of coal
deposits in New Zealand, will add to our general understanding of the nature of
world coal resources and their distribution and origin.
