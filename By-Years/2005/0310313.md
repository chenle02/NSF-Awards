Anderson&lt;br/&gt;0310313&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Coastal
California, marine terrace uplands are being farmed above steep hillslopes. This
study investigates source areas and amounts of upland storm runoff. It probes
the weathering processes and chemical denudation rates on the steep hillslopes
and compares chemical denudation rates and weathering processes among upland
soils, hillslope soils, and riparian lands. The comparison looks at differences
in runoff sources, runoff dynamics, and chemical flux over a wide range of
rainfall intensities. The results are directed to contributing to better use of
river analysis in assessing chemical weathering. The project is training
students in field work and supporting undergraduate teaching. Findings are
contributing to the resource management program for the California State
Parks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
