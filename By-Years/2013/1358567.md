The ability to mathematically model complex systems has become a prerequisite to
successful science in any field. Writing a simulation is not enough; career
scientists today should be able to analyze results, recognize statistical
regularities, formulate conjectures, and pursue possible proofs about why these
conjectures are true. The goal of this REU site is to enhance students'
understanding and use of computational and mathematical modeling within their
respective disciplines, and to create a new generation of mathematically and
computationally sophisticated researchers. The program is designed for students
from computer science, pure and applied mathematics, physics, chemistry,
quantitative biology, and social science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
project provides an educational and research experience for 10 undergraduates
each summer at the Santa Fe Institute (SFI), an independent, nonprofit
multidisciplinary research institute dedicated to the study of complex adaptive
systems, including physical, computational, biological, and social systems.
SFI's REU site explores how a tier-one research institution successfully bridges
the divide to under-represented minorities (URM) and to undergraduates at
institutions with limited research opportunities; the aim is to provide
participants with an authentic research experience in the emerging field of
complex systems. The program aims for highly talented participants who attend an
institution with limited research opportunities.
