This project will upgrade the electrochemical instrumentation and computer
facilities in two undergraduate analytical chemistry courses: "Quantitative and
Instrumental Analysis" and "Instrumental Analysis." The first is a
sophomore/junior-level course required for chemistry, biochemistry, and medical
technology majors. The second is a senior level course required for chemistry
majors. A microprocessor-based electrochemical instrument will replace
antiquated analog equipment. This commercially available system is constructed
around a cybernetic potentiostat and has control software for a variety of
electro- chemical techniques. An external personal computer is interfaced with
this instrument as a data station for mass storage and data manipulation. This
system enables students to perform modern electrochemical experiments and to
learn the techniques of digital data acquisition and computerized data analysis
encountered in today's academic and industrial laboratories.
