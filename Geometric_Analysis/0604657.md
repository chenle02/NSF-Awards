This proposal aims to obtaining information about converging Ricci and Kahler
Ricci flows and understanding the structure of possibly singular limit metrics
one gets. This proposal is also concerned about the uniqueness of a limit and a
rate of convergence of the flow. The uniqueness of a limit of the converging
Ricci flows under the integrability assumption on one of the limit metrics has
been considered by the principal investigator in her dissertation. The principal
investigator proposes to study the uniqueness question in the absence of the
integrability assumption.

Broadly speaking the given program deals with some nonlinear partial
differential equations on manifolds. Though the problem sounds very geometric,
it is tightly related to the estimates and techniques that come from PDEs. In
this proposal these two methods come together and the PI will explore the
question of how to understand the limit of the flow and describe the
singularities that can occur.
