High Performance Computing (HPC) resources on university campuses have
traditionally provided multiple tiers of storage (scratch, project and archive)
to accommodate the various I/O patterns, data sizes and retention requirements
of scientific computing workflows. Traditionally, these have been provided by
POSIX based storage systems and robotic tape libraries. Recent campus level
adoption of cloud native technologies like Kubernetes have produced scientific
computing workflows that require additional data access methods not possible via
traditional methods. Campus storage offerings must evolve to support non-POSIX
data access methods and provisioning of purpose-built storage devices, providing
additional storage types alongside traditional POSIX based ones, for a holistic
offering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project closes the gap between campus and
cloud storage through the deployment of a central, shared, multi-petabyte Ceph
distributed storage system that: 1) Enhances campus shared storage capabilities
by establishing a model for Software Defined Storage as a Service (STaaS) at the
campus level, offering unified access to and on-demand provisioning of block,
object and filesystem storage across composable and HPC resources. 2) Supports
Science Domains via innovative storage infrastructure, providing new data access
methods between instrumentation, campus composable and HPC resources and the
public cloud. 3) Enables education and workforce development by engaging with
undergraduate students in deployment, operation and integration of storage
infrastructure and supports cloud native applications used by researchers and
experiential and residential learning programs on the Purdue University
campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
