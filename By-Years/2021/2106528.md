The project is aimed at the study of nonlinear phenomena in fluids and plasmas
that are of mathematical interest and of physical and engineering importance.
They include cavitation, jet pinch-off and drop formation under the influence of
surface tension, viscosity, and electrical fields, in compressible and
incompressible fluids. The project is also concerned with singular thermal plume
interactions with multiscale flows. Dynamics near multiscale equilibria of
incompressible fluid equations with complex structured symmetry and the
construction and confinement properties of quasisymmetric plasma equilibria are
a second component of the project. These issues are relevant to plasma fusion
confinement. The project will also provide opportunities for the involvement of
graduate students in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main areas of
the project concerns topological change in two phase fluids and singularity
formation in fluid interfaces. Physical experimental and numerical evidence show
that surface tension and electrical forces can produce instability and finite
time pinch-off of slender fluid jets. Surface tension may rupture thin threads
connecting fluid cells embedded in another fluid. Advances in nonlocal and
nonlinear analysis, coupled with geometric analysis are going to be developed to
study these singular events. Thermal plumes play an important role in turbulent
convection and are relevant to geophysics. The dynamics of thermal plume
interactions will require the use of methods of analysis involving the interplay
of singular integral and Lagrangian points of view. The construction of
magnetostatic equilibria with nontrivial quasisymmetry involves geometrical and
nonlinear PDE methods. The investigation of the confinement properties of these
equilibria involves studies of inhomogeneous kinetic models with very singular
coefficients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
