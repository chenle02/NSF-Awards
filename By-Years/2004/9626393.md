This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Grinnell College to acquire an
upgrade of the computer and operating system of an existing 300 MHz NMR
Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1) Structural, equilibrium and kinetic studies of
platinum complexes, (2) Synthesis and electrochemical studies of polymeric
materials, (3) Novel reactions of organosilanes, (3) Preparation and
characterization of compounds of molybdenum (VI) and molybdenum (V), and (6) NMR
study of low molecular weight molecules in micelles. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
