This conference on Yeast Chromosome Structure, Replication and Segregation is
being held under the auspices of the Federation of American Societies of
Experimental Biology (FASEB) from July 5-10, 1992 at Snowmass Colorado. The
meeting will follow the guidelines established by the first FASEB conference
held on this subject August 5-10, 1990. Participation will be limited to 155
scientists chosen from applicants on the basis of their expertise and interests
as being most likely to create a stimulating and informative meeting. There will
be nine major scientific sessions. In addition, an afternoon session will be
devoted to discussion of the complete DNA sequence analysis of S. cerevisiae
chromosome III. Remaining afternoons will be devoted to poster sessions and
informal workshops. %%% This meeting will fill an important niche for scientists
interested in yeast chromosome replication and segregation by allowing extensive
communication between laboratories at an important time in this rapidly
developing field.
