This project consists of a series of experiments to study interacting cold atoms
in far-off-resonant optical lattices (FORLs). In one experiment the three-
dimensional FORL will be adiabatically altered into a two-dimensional FORL to
achieve effective one-dimensional collisional behavior that has been predicted
to lead to a Tonks' gas. Other experiments include continued efforts to achieve
Bose condensation in a fully optical trap and atom interferometry experiments in
the three-dimensional FORL.
