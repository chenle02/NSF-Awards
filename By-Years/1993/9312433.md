Distributed programs are complex and hard to reason about. An important source
of difficulty in actual installed distribution systems is their open-ended
nature; unlike modules described in traditional programming languages, over time
distributed components may be added or removed, and they may change their
connectivity. The goal of this project is to study how large systems can be
divided into extensible modular components about which one can reason
separately. Such a separation can facilitate the development and incremental
modification of code. The research is based on a model of Actors: The model
supports data encapsulation, procedural abstraction, asynchronous communication,
reconfigurability, and dynamic creation. A formal algebra of actor
configurations is being developed and methods for composing properties of open
actor systems is studied. The research seeks a foundation for the formal
verification of safety-critical distributed software systems.
