An ultracentrifuge system will be obtained for studies in plant biology. The
instrumentation will be used in studies of plant virus growth and in the
purification of plasmids. The goals are to examine the specificity of plant
virus infections, the molecular biology of plant resistance to viruses, and the
mechanism of plant virus growth. These studies in plant pathology are important
both for understanding fundamental biology and for their potential in
controlling plant virus diseases.
