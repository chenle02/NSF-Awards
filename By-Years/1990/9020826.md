The 25th Annual Spring Topology Conference will be held this year at California
State University, Sacramento, from April 11 to 13, 1991. Over the years the
conference has managed to maintain its traditional core of point set topology,
general topology, and continuum theory and at the same time expand its breadth.
Dynamical systems was integrated into the conference in 1987 and has become one
of the central topics. Low dimensional manifold topology has been included for
somewhat longer. This year there will be seven invited one-hour plenary
addresses, one of which will be of a general nature to the university community.
In addition, there will be about twenty invited half-hour talks, parallel
sessions of 15-minute contributed talks, and three or four problem sessions. At
least one Japanese topologist will give an invited talk. Hour talks will be
given by Alan Dow (York University, Ontario, Canada), Lex Oversteegen
(University of Alabama), and Robion Kirby (University of California at
Berkeley). Stephen Smale (University of California at Berkeley) will give the
highlight address to the university community.
