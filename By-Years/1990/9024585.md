Singh The goal of this project is to construct an attached processor using
application specific integrated circuits. This processor will perform high speed
partial pattern matching of biological sequence data (such as DNA or protein
sequences) against entries in a database. This processor will serve as a filter
to provide information on partial matches (of segments) at a very high speed.
This partial match information is used by the host processor to determine which
sequences merit further detailed comparison (i.e., this prefiltering greatly
limits the number of sequences which must be subsequently compared when
considering insertions and deletions of subsequences). The subsequent full match
will be carried out in the host processor.
