Cornell University will initiate a six-week, residential, Young Scholars
project in environmental sciences for 20 students entering the 12th grade and 4
high school teachers. This summer program will include a one-week orientation at
Cornell's Arnot Forest, a five-week on-campus component focusing on research,
careers, community outreach, and science ethics, and follow-up activities in
schools, after- school science clubs, 4-H clubs, and other informal educational
settings. A six-week MSTP component will be included, through which science
teachers will design research curricula and kits which will enable them to
continue their research with students in classrooms and after-school science
clubs.
