9321925 Abrams This is a proposal for a planning trip to the Desert Ecological
Research Unit (DERU) at Gobabeb, Namibia, to finalize a collaborative research
effort on resource cycling efficiency, for both water and nutrients, of several
plant communities along the Kuiseb River near Gobabeb. The project will be
integrated with an ongoing DERU study on ecosystem dynamics within ephemeral
rivers and the associated Faidherbia stands. The collaboration will allow a more
extensive study of the soil's role in resource cycling in arid ecosystems, using
the Namib as a relatively undisturbed model. Data obtained during this trip will
then be compared with existing studies in the United States. This project in
ecosystem dynamics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Namibia to
combine complementary talents and conduct research in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence. ***
