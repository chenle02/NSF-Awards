Atmospheric blocking events are an important contributor to high impact extreme
weather events. Improving the forecasts of blocking events and assessing how the
frequency, severity, and location of such events may change with climate change
are of substantial societal importance. Synoptic eddies have been shown to play
a critical role in the dynamics of atmospheric blocking events by maintaining
the blocking pattern but the understanding of their role is currently not
sufficiently complete and quantitative. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the
proposed research are 1) to improve the dynamical understanding of atmospheric
blocking events through developing a quantitative assessment of synoptic-eddy
forcing of blocks. 2) to employ this dynamical understanding to investigate how
blocking events will change with climate change and how blocks can be better
simulated in climate and weather models. The proposed research will employ
numerical experiments with a hierarchy of general circulation models, reanalysis
data, and archived results of full-physics general circulation models such as
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models. The research has three components:
the first is to study the eddy-forcing mechanism using idealized modeling
experiments which to isolate and develop a quantitative understanding of this
mechanism. The same idealized framework will be used to investigate how the
speed and latitude of jet streams, different patterns of quasi-stationary
planetary waves, and moisture modulate this mechanism. The second component is
to test this understanding using the reanalysis data and to gain further insight
into the dynamic of observed blocking events. The third component is to apply
this understanding to examine the performance of full-physics models in
simulating blocking, and to provide a more reliable and conclusive prediction on
how blocking events will change in the future.
