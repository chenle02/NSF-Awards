This collaborative award, made under the Materials Chemistry and Chemical
Processing Initiative, is supported by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials
Research. The theme of the research is the development of structure-property
relationships for optimizing second-order nonlinear optical properties of
organic materials. The goal is to develop and implement synthetic strategies,
guided by theoretical studies, which will optimize molecular hyperpolarizability
by tuning the degree of bond alternation in the pi-electron system between donor
and acceptor. A novel theoretical method will be used to calculate the effective
anharmonic potential surfaces associated with the nonlinear optical
chromophores. Spectroscopic studies will provide a quantitative measure of bond
alternation. These measurements, correlated with measurements of
hyperpolarizability, will provide the basis for synthesizing optimized
structures. New optimized materials will make feasible fast, low-power, high-
contrast electrooptic switching elements. %%% Materials with large second order
nonlinearities are desired in applications such as telecommunications, optical
data storage, and optical information processing.
