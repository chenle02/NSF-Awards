The cataclysmic variable stars are a broad class of close binary stars in which
a white dwarf star gains mass from a cool main-sequence companion star. There
are a rich range of phenomena associated with these stars and they constitute
astrophysical laboratories in which to study accretion disks and binary stellar
evolution. Exciting and important discoveries about cataclysmic variable stars
rest on fundamental astronomical measurements. Here, a long-standing and very
productive program of orbital period determinations through radial velocity
measurements is being continued, encompassing a wide sample of cataclysmic
variable stars. As part of this spectroscopic program, phase-resolved spectra of
selected stars are being obtained to elucidate disk precession and gas flows,
and to search for more examples of the anomalously warm secondary stars
discovered just last year. A program of astrometry and direct imaging also is
being continued, resulting in very accurate parallaxes and proper motions for a
number of these objects. This firms up the distances and luminosities of
cataclysmic variable stars and constrain their ages. The cumulative impact of
this work on our understanding of cataclysmic binaries will be large.

The broader impact of this work is largely through the opportunities it provides
for student research. Undergraduate students are thrilled to participate in
observing trips to Arizona; several students have gone on to become professional
astronomers, in part because of this exposure. This grant supports a graduate
student. The work also generates useful astronomical software, some of which has
been spun off to the community.
