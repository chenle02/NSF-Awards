The objective of the proposed program is to provide undergraduate members of
groups traditionally underrepresented in computer science and engineering with a
practical and inspiring summer study experience to reinforce and supplement
their regular course of study, build their leadership and teamwork skills, and
motivate them to go on to pursue graduate
degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interns
will gain expertise in the science of design learn to understand and frame
problems, capture requirements and derive specifications for software
engineering. The design of software will be applied to network systems,
mathematic and simulation models, geographic information systems and renewable
energy systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU-
RMS at HSU will contribute to the broader goal of attracting more women and
minorities to fields in computer science and engineering in which they are
underrepresented, and preparing them for successful careers in those
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HSU will provide minority and women faculty in
computing science, mathematics, engineering and natural resource sciences to
serve as mentors for minority and women students in the program.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HSU is nationally known for its successfulprograms to
recruit and support Native American students, particularly in sciences, natural
resources, and engineering, and in addition has existing solid and successful
recruiting and support programs for women and minority students.&lt;br/&gt;
