Brizard&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops and analyzes low-frequency
plasma&lt;br/&gt;kinetic and fluid models for studying the long-time-
scale&lt;br/&gt;transport processes and global magnetohydrodynamic behavior
of&lt;br/&gt;strongly magnetized imhomogeneous plasmas. He uses Lie
transform&lt;br/&gt;methods to formulate the models. This provides certain
technical&lt;br/&gt;advantages, both analytically and computationally, in
exposing&lt;br/&gt;important features of global nonlinear plasma
dynamics.&lt;br/&gt; Astrophysical plasmas, space plasmas, and
"laboratory"&lt;br/&gt;plasmas seen in magnetic and inertial confinement plasma
systems&lt;br/&gt;share certain fundamental properties that are not
well&lt;br/&gt;understood. In part this is because a plasma consists of a
great&lt;br/&gt;many charged particles in motion, and the plasma's
collective&lt;br/&gt;behavior is the result of interactions between all
these&lt;br/&gt;particles. These interactions take place on very small
length&lt;br/&gt;scales and time scales, and show themselves on larger scales.
The&lt;br/&gt;investigator develops formal methods to produce
effective&lt;br/&gt;descriptions of the behavior of plasmas across multiple
scales.&lt;br/&gt;This leads to a better understanding of fundamental properties
of&lt;br/&gt;plasmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
