This research is on developing a probabilistic diagnosis model for adaptive
system level diagnosis. In this model the faulty probability of a unit
(calculated by a Bayesian approach) is used to determine whether a diagnosis is
successful. This limits tests to only those that contribute to the detection of
faulty units. Research tasks are: (1) deriving an optimal algorithm for
selecting the next test in the adaptive diagnosis based on current post-
diagnosis fault probabilities; (2) determining a fixed sequence of tests which
minimizes the average number of possible fault patterns; (3) find the minimal
subset of tests that lead to a successful diagnosis, assuming all tests pass
without detection; and (4) explore the relationship between the diagnosis time
and the coverage.
