9419539 Hawkridge, Fred With this award, the Chemistry Division and the the
Bulgaria, Poland and NIS Program of the the International Division are co-
supporting Dr. Fred M. Hawkridge of the Department of Chemistry of Virginia
Commonwealth University and Dr. Alexander M. Pisarevsky of the Chemical Research
Institute of St. Petersburg University, Russia. The two investigators will
collaborate to develop a new laboratory experiment appropriate for a senior
level Instrumental Analysis course in Chemistry. The experiment, relevant to
environmental concerns, will use a novel glass electrode for measuring chemical
oxygen demand in water samples such as natural waters, sewage samples and
processing solutions.
