The study of fast reactions constitutes an important, fascinating and demanding
area of work to which undergraduates should be introduced. The focus of this
project is the use of laser spectral techniques in the physical chemistry
laboratory to study fast kinetic processes and to thereby reinforce concepts
presented in the classroom. This Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement
(ILI) award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program will help the Department
of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee to acquire laser
instrumentation that will be used to enhance undergraduate laboratory
instruction.
