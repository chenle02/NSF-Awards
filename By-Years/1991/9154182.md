The two-week workshop is being conducted at the National Training Center in
Denver, Colorado, for 25 selected undergraduate college instructors of
introductory courses with hydrology and water resources content. The major
purposes of the workshop are: (a) to bring participants up-to-date on the
science of hydrology and those technologies used to measure, analyze, and
calculate hydrologic flows, surface and groundwater resources, and pollutant
loadings and consequences, and (b) to equip and encourage these teachers to use
the latest in water resources information and instructional materials in their
classrooms. Educational materials developed by Workshop participants will be
presented at the Twenty-Ninth Annual American Water Resources Association
Conference in Fall 1993.
