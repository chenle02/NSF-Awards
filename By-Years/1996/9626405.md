9626405 Ilmanen The proposed research lies in the general area of Riemannian
geometry. More precisely, it deals with the following geometric evolution
equations: the Ricci flow, mean curvature flow, and Yang-Mills heat flow
equations. The methods to be used include geometric measure theory, blowup
arguments, nonlinear elliptic equations, minimal surfaces, and computer
solutions of variational problems. Geometric evolution equations arise in the
description of physical processes, and at the same time they are interesting
from a purely geometric standpoint. They can be used to describe various heat
flows, long time fluid dynamics, and other phenomena in nature where the change
occurs gradually and continuously over time.
