There appears to be a recognition that the existing models of travel behavior do
not adequately reflect the mechanism of interrelated decisions underlying daily
travel behavior. This results in an inability to predict future behavior when
extrapolation of observed relationships is no longer applicable. This project
will identify the decision mechanism underlying trip chaining behavior. The
study will investigate theoretically derived properties of trip chaining
behavior based on hypothesized decision mechanisms. The objective of the study
is to lay the basis for the development of comprehensive and practical models of
daily travel behavior based on the basic data developed in this study.
