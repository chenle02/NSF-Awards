The development of inexpensive computers, made possible by the advent of
integrated circuits, provides markets with unprecedented opportunities to access
and manipulate information economically. The next step is to integrate the
sensing or data acquisition into the VLSI signal processing capability. An
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for VLSI Integrated Sensors
appears to be one approach to achieve the noted goal. Researchers are studying
the feasibility and viability of establishing an Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for VLSI Integrated Sensors at the University of California -
Berkeley. Alternative organizations, operations, and policies are being studied
as are industry's interests and needs in research. The study is also determining
if the Center has the potential to become self-sufficient with industrial
funding in a 5-year period.
