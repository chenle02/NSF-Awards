Dr. Randal A. Seburg has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Seburg received the doctoral degree from the University of
Wisconsin at Madison under the supervision of Professor Robert J. McMahon. Dr.
Seburg will continue research at Purdue University under the sponsorship of
Professor Robert R. Squires. The postdoctoral research will focus on the
investigation of reactive intermediates using a flowing afterglow apparatus
equipped with a triple-qualrupole mass analyzer. Such gas phase investigations
probe the intrinsic properties of molecules, providing data that is free of
solvent and counter-ion effects and directly relevant for comparison with
theory. Studies include the thermochemistry of carbynes using both theoretical
computations and experimental results, as well as the gas phase reactions of
charged biomolecules such as oligopeptides and oligonucleotides generated using
the electrospray ion technique. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
