The production and processing of materials into finished goods constitutes a
large part of our present economy. A significant portion of new products are
developed from synthetic polymeric materials including composite materials. The
Chemical Engineering Department at Rose-Hulman introduced a senior elective
course in Polymer Engineering some years ago. and it includes laboratory
experience. A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) is being added to
the laboratory to allow students to perform compositional analysis, structural
analysis, and analysis on polymer morphology on homopolymers, copolymers,
polymer blends and composite materials. The capabilities of the FTIR instrument
also allows performance of these analyses on opaque materials which was almost
impossible with the existing, older dispersive instruments.
