0932606&lt;br/&gt;Landis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to
quantify the water quality degradation tradeoffs associated with 2nd (cellulosic
ethanol) and 3rd generation (e.g., algae-produced) biofuels. A Life Cycle
Assessment (LCA) framework will be applied. Strategies for avoiding or
mitigating unintended consequences of the introduction of 2nd and 3rd generation
biofuels will be evaluated. The research targets to inform a more sustainable
trajectory for biofuels development in the U.S. The LCA developed within the
research effort will be broadly applicable and potentially will guide future
assessments of biofuels. Education and outreach will include the incorporation
of research into undergraduate and graduate courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is co-funded by the Environmental Sustainability Program and the Energy
for Sustainability Program of the CBET Division of the Engineering Directorate.
