This research will examine goodness-of-fit tests for multivariate data modeled
using distribution-free or nonparametric models. The small sample behavior of
test statistics based on spacings will be investigated using Monte Carlo methods
and will be compared to limiting distribution theoretical results. By
constructing statistically equivalent blocks, test statistics can be extended to
the multidimensional case. When trying to represent an underlying explanatory or
descriptive model for real multivariate data, a crucial difficulty is to
determine when a postulated model is adequate. The fewer the mathematical
assumptions made initially, the more difficult in general to be sure that the
model does represent the important features, but not any artifacts of a
particular sample. Some mathematical theory has been developed for the case of
an arbitrarily large sample; some theory has been developed when the data is
assumed to follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. This project will examine
tests of model adequacy when the samples are not extremely large and at the same
time the distribution cannot be assumed to be normal. The work will concentrate
on multi- variate observations.
