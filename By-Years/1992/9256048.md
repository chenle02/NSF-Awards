The Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology will initiate a three-week,
residential, Young Scholars project in mathematics for 30 students entering the
9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades. This summer program will emphasize the study
of mathematics including set theory, graph theory, and operations research. The
project is a combination of a nine month correspondence problem solving
competition and a summer session. The program will provide participants with
opportunities to improve problem solving skills, to explore coherent, axiomatic
bodies of mathematics, and to investigate mathematical, scientific, and
engineering disciplines as potential career choices.
