The research focuses on the interaction of atomic particles with
electromagnetic fields. The major theme is the study of the effects of strong,
oscillating fields on bound-free transitions. Negative ions are studied because
it is easier to understand the short range interaction from both an experimental
and theoretical point of view. The second major theme of the research is the
study of the correlations in two electron atomic systems such as the negative
alkali ions. These are easily accessible with tunable dye lasers and the
experiments will be carried out using laser photodetachment in an ion beam and
an ion trap. The work will lead to an enhanced understanding of the interaction
of strong, oscillating fields with atoms and of electron correlation effects.
