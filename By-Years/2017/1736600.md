The PI proposes to use geometric methods to attack problems in representation
theory and number theory. Recently the PI has found a way to construct motives
with exceptional Galois groups using automorphic forms and the geometric
Langlands correspondence. This idea will be systematically developed in the
following years and will have applications to the classical inverse Galois
problem. The PI will also use moduli spaces of Hitchin type to study
representations of rational Cherednik algebras, enumeration of Galois
representations, and global analogs of Lusztig's character
sheaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In mathematics, it is a general rule that the most
interesting symmetries should arise geometrically. For example, the ancient
classification of Platonic solids is seen nowadays as an instance of finding all
'finite symmetries' in three-dimensional space. With the revolution of algebraic
geometry in the second half of the 20th century, we now have powerful geometric
tools available to solve classical and new problems in number theory and group
theory. The PI will use these geometric tools to attack problems in the
Langlands program. In the 70s, Langlands made a series of conjectures which
links arithmetic invariants (e.g., solutions to Diophantine equations) to
analytic invariants (e.g., modular forms). The predictions that Langlands made,
if proved, will be extremely powerful in solving classical problems (including
the Fermat Problem which was solved in this way). Through this project, the PI
hopes to shed light on some problems in the Langlands program and to discover
more symmetries that appear in geometry.
