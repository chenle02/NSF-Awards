9414423 Logan This is an award to support research on the potential utilization
of sodium chlorate as an electron acceptor for metabolic processes in
microorganisms that are capable of utilizing organic contaminants of soil and
aquifers as a source of respiratory carbon. The proposal leading to this award
was submitted under conditions outlined in NSF 89-85, Small Grants for
Exploratory Research (SGER). The investigator plans on exploring the use of
sodium chlorate to permit white rot fungi, known for their capability of
degrading aromatic hydrocarbons of pollutional significance, to continue
respiring after the formation of a fungal mat at the gas/liquid interface
inhibits or prevents the entry of atmospheric oxygen into the fluid containing
the contaminants. Results of this project are expected to provide the basis for
further exploration of the potential use of sodium chlorate as a source of
respiratory oxygen under conditions that prevent or inhibit use of oxygen from
atmospheric sources. Success in that respect is likely to result in application
of this concept to decontamination of soil and groundwater aquifers contaminated
by biodegradable organic substances.
