Proposal Number: ECS-9633015 Principal Investigator: Harold Broberg Title:
GOALI: Advanced Weather Satellite Instrumentation In this research, a
university-industrial collaborative project between Indiana University Purdue
University Fort Wayne and ITT-Aerospace/Communications Division to investigate
more accurate and reliable imaging (visible spectrum) and sounding (infrared
spectrum) for next generation weather satellites is proposed. Adaptive control
techniques will be investigated and modeled to improve the useable spectral
bandwidth of infrared Michaelson interferometers infrared Michaelson
interferometers are under consideration by the industry as the next logical step
to improve the useable spectral bandwidth. Adaptive control to replace
electromechanical control in the following areas are proposed for investigation:
(1) adaptive control to improve imaging and sounding. This refers to control of
the interferometer itself; (2) digital post-processing of spectra to replace
complex electromechanical dynamic alignment techniques currently in use. This
could results in a considerable weight savings which is important in space-based
applications. Post processing to compensate for the mirror tilt is the main
focus; (3) development of an adaptive filter of estimation method to accurately
determine the position of the moving mirror and (4) basic research and
development of microbolometric techniques for used in space-based systems.
Currently available microbolometers are unusable for space-based applications
due to slow response time, low efficiency and high self-heating.
