This research has developed a very important and novel means of measuring blood
flow. In a conventional Doppler flow measurement, the sensor and transmitter,
which produces the ultrasound waves in the blood, must be positioned such that
the sensors and blood flow must be nearly parallel. It is known that for angles
close to 90 degrees, a small error in the angle leads to a large error in the
flow estimate. However, this problem is resolved if one uses the method proposed
here namely a "spectrum band-width" to estimate frequency. This technique of
using spectrum band-width for velocity estimates opens up the previously
inaccessible range of angles which are nearly perpendicular to the flow of
blood. Placement of the sensor directly on the blood vesicle without having to
bend the vesicle will greatly increase the utility and convenience of the
measurement.
