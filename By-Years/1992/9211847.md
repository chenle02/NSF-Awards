The object of this review is to investigate a physical mechanism for
destabilization and disintegration of structure of coherent vortices which occur
in many practical flows such as the horseshoe vortices which form at the
junction of an appendage on a body in motion, and the coherent streamwise
vortices in a turbulent shear layer. The vortices in these flows represent a
significant drain in energy and have considerable bearing on the fluid forces
exerted on the associated body or system; the vortices induce structural
vibrations, contribute to flow noise, generate excess flow drag and in the case
of the vortex pair in the wake of a large aircraft present significant hazard
during landing to other aircrafts taking off from busy airports. A common
feature of these flows is that the vortices persist either in an imposed weak
strain or shear, one of the effects of which is to distort the shape of the core
structure of the vortices. Available experimental or numerically simulated
results suggest that imposing an external periodic pressure field or flow
perturbation at certain frequencies on these flows has dramatic effects on the
coherent vortices, inducing their suppression in some cases.
