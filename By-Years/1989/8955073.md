This project will undertake exploratory research and development of
microcomputer-assisted laboratories in introductory university physics courses,
especially those courses which provide the pool of high-school physics teachers.
Previous work has led to the initiation of Socratic-Dialogue- Inducing (SDI)
labs which pre- and post-course tests show to be effective in changing students'
conceptual understanding of mechanics. The investigator will attempt to write
Socratic- dialogue computer tutorials based on his earlier work and will attempt
to utilize the very high performance new NEXT microcomputer in a way that would
allow the computer to supplement and enhance the work of the professor in charge
of the laboratories.
