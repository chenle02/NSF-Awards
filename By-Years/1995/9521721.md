ABSTRACT CTS-9521721 This is a study of the feasibility of using fully densified
(nonporous) ion-conducting perovskites as catalytic membranes in membrane
reactors for the oxidative coupling of methane. It is a collaborative effort
between Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, who prepares and characterizes
the membranes, and Washington State University, which performs the reactor
studies. Two membranes will be studied, one a lanthanum-strontium-cobalt-iron-
oxygen system, the other a lanthanum-barium-cobalt-iron-oxygen system.
Measurements of oxygen permeation and catalytic selectivity are done at elevated
pressures. Dynamic X-ray diffraction is used to monitor the stability of the
membrane. Oxidative coupling of methane is a process that converts natural gas
to a valuable chemical feedstock in a single step. Despite its obvious
attractiveness, a cost-effective technology using this approach has been
elusive. This project combines advances in catalytic science, reactor design,
and new materials to this problem. ***
