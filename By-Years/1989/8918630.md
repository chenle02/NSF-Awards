Morphometrics is a relatively new family of approaches to the changes in
organismal size and shape. Morphometric techniques have been used in the study
of individual growth as well as evolutionary change. Its precursor, multivariate
biometrics, was based on the statistical analysis of measurements made on sets
of component parts of organisms (e.g., leg length, or body weight). In contrast,
morphometrics attempts to capture and distill the essential geometric patterns
of change by studying discrete landmarks, or whole outlines, or surfaces of
biological interest. The past decade has witnessed a profusion of these
geometric/statistical techniques, and the advent of microcomputer-based image
analysis systems has made their application widespread. Unfortunately, most
biologists are ill- equipped to understand the mathematical underpinnings of
these techniques, and they are therefore unable to make critical choices between
alternate approaches. Dr. F. J. Rohlf has focused on the various strengths and
weaknesses of different techniques, and has sought to guide biologists to the
technique that is most appropriate for the organisms and hypotheses under study.
His software programs have provided access to subtle and complicated approaches,
and his continued research into the full spectrum of morphometrics will have
benefits for the entire biological research community.
