The program continues a successful existing program into the study of organized,
multimolecular assemblies of surfactant molecules. Chemical composition,
physical structure and the extent of organization of these assemblies will be
investigated. The project aims to measure the fluidity of synthetic phospholipid
bilayers as a function of phospholipid structure and surface concentration; to
characterize the effect of cholesterol on the membrane fluidity and studies that
may lead to a cholesterol sensor; to investigate the electron hopping and proton
diffusion in these assemblies; and to develop chiral selectivity and gating
properties at electrode surfaces using monolayer films. %%% The research, in the
general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses on studies of the
dynamics of lateral processes in monolayers and bilayers at interfaces. The
research is intended to mimic the structures and functions of biological
membrane systems. The project continues an important program aimed at developing
new methods for the study of model membrane systems at solid-solution and air-
water interfaces. The outcome of the research will be important not only in our
understanding of electrochemistry and thin films, but will also have
considerable importance in the understanding of membrane action in biological
systems.
