The dynamics of complex polynomials and rational maps has been intriguing and
inspiring mathematicians for many years. Their Julia sets provide prototypical
examples of fractals and exhibit fascinating dynamical behavior starting from
very simple rules. In this project, the PI will work to better understand the
geometry of fractals, particularly those generated by "rational maps",
generalizing the polynomials used in the Mandelbrot set. The PI has developed a
simple description of such maps using graphs, thought of as networks of rubber
bands. This promises to be more accessible than previous approaches, lowering
the barrier to participation by undergraduates and beginning graduate students,
and letting them experience and understand first-hand the structure behind the
beautiful pictures. In particular, the project will allow for a classification
of the simplest rational maps, and a new test for when a loose (topological)
description of a rational map can be tightened up into the rigid picture that
generates the fractal.

In more technical terms, the project will study certain maps from the sphere to
itself (topological branched self-covers) that are related to rational maps. To
determine the behavior of the rational map, the key points to look at are the
critical points, where the map branches. A map can be described by giving an
appropriate spine for the complement of the post-critical set on the sphere,
along with its inverse image. One key question is to characterize when a
branched self-cover can be made "rigid" into a rational map. William Thurston
gave one answer in 1982, in terms of certain obstructions, collections of annuli
that could not exist inside actual rational maps. This answer is complicated to
state and difficult to apply, but it nevertheless provides one of the few tools
for constructing rational maps. In this project, the PI will study a
complementary criterion, which loosely says that the spine (with elastic weights
on the edges) get looser under repeated backwards iteration. The new criterion
promises to be both simple and powerful, and the PI will work with other
researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students to explore it. They
will use the new characterization to, for instance, construct a new census of
rational maps. They will also investigate extensions of the main theorem and
study the new structure it reveals.
