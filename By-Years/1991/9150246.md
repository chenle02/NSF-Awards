Mr. Don Herbert, also known as "Mr. Wizard", has entered into a collaborative
effort with Nickelodeon Cable Television for production and broadcast of 70
teacher workshops on elementary science education. These 15-minute programs will
feature exemplary hands-on science teaching, and will offer teachers and school
administrators current information on teaching methods, instructional materials,
and models for managing educational change. The programs will be broadcast over
cable television in the early morning hours for videotaping and later use.
Newsletters and teachers guides will be produced and distributed, and a toll-
free telephone support system will answer teachers' questions. Mr. Wizard's
reputation as a science educator will attract a broad audience, and Nickelodeon
will provide the means to reach this audience. This partnership has the
potential to reach hundreds of thousands of teachers across the country, thereby
improving their understanding of effective science teaching. Cost sharing
provided by Nickelodeon amounts to 35% of the NSF support for this project.
