This research involves a search for lithosphere and mantle downwelling beneath
the Hindu Kush, Burma Arc, and southern Tibet by means of a residual sphere
approach and 3-D finite difference calculation for theoretical travel times.
Data will be collected from WWSSN, Canadian network and digital (IRIS/GSN,
GEOSCOPE and GDSN) network data for earthquakes extending from the Hindu Kush
eastward to Burma. Determination of differential residual spheres for pairs of
events on the order of 400 km apart should test for the existence of a major
downwelling proposed in the region by other scientists. For each group of
differential spheres, indications of deep high velocity anomalies will be
forward modeled using the finite difference scheme. The methods and results
developed will have application to seismically active areas of proposed
downwelling in the U.S. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program.
