Abstract CMS-9505339 Columbia University Beti, Raimondo This international
conference will give experts in the area of structural retrofitting the
opportunity to gather and to share their professional experiences. Practicing
engineers as well as university researchers and government representatives will
take the podium during the three days of the conference to critically analyze
the state of the art and to define future directions for retrofitting of
structures. The program under the general umbrella of retrofitting, will cover a
broad spectrum of research areas, varying from risk assessment, bridge and
building structures under wind and earthquake excitation, to effects of blast
loads on structures, to innovative retrofitting techniques and nondestructive
evaluation. This conference is limited to invited speakers and attendees and
will represent a unique opportunity for knowledge/technology transfer, creating
an intellectually challenging environment for exchanging ideas and techniques
among various sectors of engineering.
