Stroock works in the area of diffusion processes. In particular, he is studying
the Glauber dynamics associated with lattice gases. Recently, these studies have
led to the use of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, thus bringing together two
different areas of mathematics. Stroock will continue his research in these
areas. Stroock works on various aspects of stochastic analysis and its
applications to other fields. At present, his major interest is in mathematical
models of the statistical mechanics of gases. In particular, he has been
studying a class of dynamical systems which are sufficiently simple that they
are mathematically tractable and are sufficiently intricate to be physically
intriguing. In addition to physics, these same dynamics arise in other contexts
as models of interacting systems of huge systems of particles.
