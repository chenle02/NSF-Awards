This project is creating an open knowledge collection of promising practices and
lessons learned from the work to date on the development of NSDL. This rich,
dynamic resource consists of: i) reflections, stories and recollections (formal
and informal) about what participants learned; and ii) an annotated bibliography
of articles, papers, presentations associated with various NSDL projects. The
project is using an open mechanism (wiki technology and the KEEP Toolkit) for
collecting, creating and sharing the knowledge it is accruing; and by its very
nature it is disseminating this knowledge to NSDL's communities, as well as the
larger digital library and technology enhanced learning communities. Through an
ethnographic approach the project seeks to identify and highlight the full range
of experiences of the NSDL community. Two particular elements of the project
speak to its intellectual merit. First is the team of investigators who have
extensive experience with the NSDL and bring their individual backgrounds in
technology and evaluation, along with their relationships with past and current
funded NSDL projects. Second is that the project exploits social networking
tools and mechanisms to collect and organize the stories and experiences of
those involved with building the NSDL. The broader impacts of the project lie in
sharing the NSDL "story" beyond the initial NSDL community of projects, to wield
an influence on the future direction of other large-scale technology enhanced
learning initiatives involving multiple institutions and collaborative projects.
Examples of such efforts include those being undertaken by the Open Educational
Resources movement supported by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and
other nascent cyberinfrastructure projects underway at NSF.
