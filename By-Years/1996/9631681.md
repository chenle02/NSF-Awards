9631681 Jensen This Americas Program award will support collaborative research
between Dr. Richard G. Jensen of the University of Arizona and Drs. Omar Pantoja
and Bronwyn Barkla of the Instituto de Biotecnologia of the Universidad Nacional
Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca, Mexico. The objective of this project
is to focus on the biochemical and regulatory uptake of sodium through potassium
channels of halophytic plants. The two research groups share an interest in
higher plant salinity tolerance, and in comparing mechanisms identified in the
halophyte Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (ice plant) with corresponding
mechanisms in glycophytes. They plan to characterize the AKT/KAT and HKT
transcript complement in the ice plant; study cell-tissue development and stress
specific expression of genes; characterize the channel/transporter proteins
expressed in suspension culture cells and in Xenopus oocytes; and investigate
protein responses to external stimuli and pharmacological agents. The joint work
will be complementary and offer an opportunity for students and researchers to
explore concepts and techniques relevant to each laboratory. ***
