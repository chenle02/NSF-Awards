The PI will carry out collaborative research activities with the Electronics
Technology and Devices Laboratory (ETDL) at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey involving
the design, fabrication, modelling and characterization of a novel real-space
transfer switching MODFET device structure. The design details of the test
device structure will be jointly developed between the two laboratories. The
actual device fabrication work will be carried out at the ETDL with direct
participation of a senior graduate student from PSU who will stay in Fort
Monmouth area on a temporary basis.
