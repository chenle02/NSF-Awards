Travel funds are provided to bring a group of 12 distinguished lecturers to a
meeting on "Brain.gut Peptide Regulation of Reproductive Hormone Secretion" to
be held at Washington State University in Pullman, Washington. The meeting
involves approximately 150 participants representing a large geographical
distribution. The renowned lecturer will present a summary of recent advances
concerning their particular peptide area emphasizing its role in the regulation
of reproductive neuroendocrine function. The objective is to integrate the
presentations to formulate hypotheses about the sites and mechanisms of
action/interactions of these neuropeptide>s> in carrying out their regulatory
action. The results and discussion will provide important information concerning
the central mechanisms of neuroendocrine regulation and will define clear
directions for future research in this area. This valuable information could
lead towards the development of novel therapeutic regimens for treating clinical
reproductive dysfunctions associated with aberrant reproductive hormone
secretion. The proceedings from the meeting will be published in a book. >***
