A new source of polarized light ions, including protons and deuterons, will be
produced for use with the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility (IUCF). IUCF is
a national user facility for nuclear physics, with particular emphasis on
studies of the meson exchange character of the nucleon- nucleon force. IUCF
serves a user community numbering in the hundreds. The new source will increase
the intensity of polarized beams available using the IUCF Cooler ring
accelerator (a 500 MeV synchrotron) twenty-fold, opening up new and more
stringent tests of our understanding of the nucleon-nucleon potential. The IUCF
research program also includes tests of theories of the strong interaction
relating to synthesis of the structure and dynamics of complex nuclei from the
fundamental nucleon-nucleon potential. These topics are of high priority within
U.S. nuclear science, as established by the joint NSF/DOE Nuclear Science
Advisory Committee in its 1996 Long Range Plan. Education of students and
postdocs is a strong component of the IUCF experimental program.
