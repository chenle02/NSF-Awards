Martin Feldstein SBR-9511383 The NBER Summer Institute brings together
economists from universities, government, and international organizations for a
few days or weeks of seminars, workshops, conferences and collaborative
research. The 1994 Summer Institute included 677 economists from 171
universities and nonacademic institutions, of whom 58% were not affiliated with
the NBER. A similar number of economists from a large number of institutions is
expected to attend this summer. Special efforts were made to include younger
economists and economists not affiliated with the NBER. The Summer Institute
provides a unique opportunity for economists to work closely with others for
extended and intense periods of research. The Summer Institute lasts long enough
to allow serious collaboration among economists from different institutions.
While research nearing completion is presented, emphasis is placed on "workshop"
aspects of the program, where new ideas are raised, preliminary research ideas
are developed, and plans for joint or coordinated research are established. The
Summer Institute is organized into twelve programs or areas of study, including:
economic fluctuations, economic history, monetary economics, corporate finance,
asset pricing, industrial organization, health and aging, international studies,
labor studies, productivity and taxation. Each program has its own group of
participants and its own group structure. Although there is considerable
variations among the programs, a typical program will last from one to three
weeks, with time allowed during the day for research. Programs may include a
variety of subjects or they may be organized around specific topics.
