9401874 K. Becker Experimental investigations of collision cross sections of
interest to low-temperature plasma processing are investigated. The emphasis is
on reactive species containing F, Cl and Br atoms with the goal of producing
data on excitation and dissociation by analysis of the optical spectra produced
by electron impact on the parent molecules. The data is essential for
characterizing and modeling reactive plasmas used in industrially important
processes such as plasma etching.
