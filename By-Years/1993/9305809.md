9305809 Lee Collaborative research between investigators at Miami University and
Ohio State University will focus on physiological mechanisms used by insects for
overwinter survival. Both the entry into diapause and cold hardening are
essential for survival of most temperature zone species. This study examines
mechanisms utilized by two types of insects, one that can not tolerate freezing
(the flesh fly, Sarcophaga crassipalpis) and a species that tolerates extensive
internal ice formation (the goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis). The
presence of ice nucleating agents play a critical role in determining the
temperature at which an insects freezes. One part of the project will focus on
the role of these ice nucleates, including yeast, bacteria and crystals of
calcium phosphate, in determining seasonal changes in the supercooling point. A
second part examines the nature of cold injury using crymicroscopy and vital
dyes to directly observe the effects of chilling and freezing on insect cells.
Additional experiments will probe the nature of cold injury inflicted on the
neuromuscular system. Our recent discovery that insects produce stress proteins
in response to cold exposure suggests that such proteins may play an important
role in providing cold tolerance. Experiments are designed are designed to
determine the relationship between stress protein synthesis and the acquisition
of cold tolerance. This work will not only provide an understanding of new
mechanisms of cold tolerance, but may provide new tools for disruption of insect
pest populations, and for long term storage of insects and other organisms at
low temperature. *** v s t $ $ ( F / C Dutch (scalable) Symbol " Swiss
