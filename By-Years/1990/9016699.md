Technical Narrative: This U.S.-Rwanda collaborative research planning project
involving the University of Minnesota and the Universite Nationale de Rwanda is
in the general area of aquatic resource conservation. Proposal funding will
allow the team from the University of Minnesota to work with their Rwandan
counterparts for a three week period to develop a research proposal to study
stream ecosystems in high altitude forests of Rwanda. One of the proposed
outcomes of this research will be the establishment of a resource management
protocol for the conservation of tropical rainforest biomes. This project in
resource conservation fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Rwanda to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
