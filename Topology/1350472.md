In the sixties, Grothendieck had the motivic idea that one should replace all
the different cohomology theories of algebraic varieties (Hodge, de Rham, etale,
crystalline, etc) by the "universal" one. This insight led to major
breakthroughs and to several categories of motives. Noncommutative algebraic
geometry, a recent branch of mathematics, is concerned with the study of
noncommutative algebraic varieties, i.e., differential graded (=dg) categories.
Recently, Kontsevich had also the motivic idea of replacing the different
homology theories of noncommutative algebraic varieties (K-theory, cyclic
homology, topological Hochschild homology, etc) by the "universal" one.
Similarly, this led to several categories of noncommutative motives. The main
objective of this project is to bridge the gap between the above two motivic
ideas. Concretely, the Principal Investigator (PI) will construct appropriate
symmetric monoidal functors relating the categories of motives and
noncommutative motives. Among the manifold uses of such functors, the PI will
exploit them to address the Schur/Kimura finiteness of motives as well as the
rationality of motivic zeta functions.

The theory of motives was envisioned by Grothendieck in the sixties and greatly
developed since then by Beilinson, Deligne, Voevodsky, and others. In contrast,
the theory of noncommutative motives was only recently introduced by Kontsevich.
The PI proposes to construct precise bridges between motives and noncommutative
motives. These will enable the interchange of results, techniques, ideas, and
insights between the commutative and the noncommutative world. In order to make
these results accessible to the mathematical community, the PI will lecture
graduate courses, disseminate them online, organize working seminars, and write
the first book on the subject. Complementing these educational activities, the
PI will also mentor undergraduate students through research projects on
applications of motives to several areas of mathematics.
