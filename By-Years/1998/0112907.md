Modern computation methods (parallel computing and object oriented programming)
will be used to develop a plasma simulation code, which will be made freely
available. A scheme for domain decomposition is planned which permits nearly
arbitrary load balancing. The code will be used to simulate three dimensional
problems in advanced acceleration via laser-plasma interactions.
