SBR-9528766 Richard Florida Carnegie Mellon University This award, through NSF's
Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing initiative, will support research into
the relationships among three innovations in manufacturing systems: continuous
quality improvements, lean or low-inventory production, and reduction or
elimination of waste/ by-products. The research is guided by the research
literatures on quality, lean production, and "green" production. In addition,
the research investigates the influence of local characteristics on innovation
adoption or non-adoption, working from the thesis that localized networks of
information, labor, and regulation (public and private) provide an important
source of industrial innovation. Based on the results of a recently-completed
survey of manufacturers, the project will support the development of intensive
case studies of a set of facilities and their management, competitive structure,
and localized regulation. The results of the research should have relevance to
the fields of geography, regional development, and industrial innovation.
