This project addresses the need to provide students with better mechanisms
within digital libraries, such as the National Science Digital Library (NSDL),
to find information. Prior research in the design and cognition of hypertext
systems points to the use of graphical aids to help navigation and learning; and
educational psychology research shows the value of concept maps to support
learning of rich relationships between science phenomena and principles. The
project, therefore, is using conceptual linking in the form of concept maps to
enable students to explore questions and follow their own paths. To achieve this
aim, the CoMPASS-DL system is being developed with an interface that provides
navigable concept maps that helps students to select resources based on the
relatedness of the documents to each other as well as to students' goals.
CoMPASS-DL is being used in middle schools in Wisconsin to understand the impact
of digital libraries in classroom learning. The project also enables NSDL
community members who are designing resources for K-12 students to better
understand how digital resources can be integrated in inquiry-based science
classes. &lt;br/&gt;
