The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on
the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the
full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.
Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes,
practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE "Adaptation"
awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based
strategies to academic and non-academic non-profit
organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Society for Engineering
Education's (ASEE's) ADVANCE Adaptation project will engage engineering deans
across the country in the Engineering Deans Gender Equity (EDGE) Initiative. The
EDGE Initiative leverages a pledge made by over 200 engineering deans to enhance
equity and diversity in engineering started in 2015. The EDGE project will: 1)
reduce institutional and system-level barriers to engineering deans' ability to
advance the recruitment, retention, and professional advancement of faculty; and
2) conduct research to determine if reducing impediments promotes deans'
capacity to effect positive change for faculty. The EDGE project will result in
the creation of a National Gender Equity Indicators Database; and centralization
and dissemination of evidence-based, faculty gender equity leadership resources
and strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ASEE EDGE Initiative will advance
engineering deans' knowledge and understanding for making intentional, research-
based changes to promote equity for faculty by addressing barriers to culture
change. This work is grounded in three premises: 1) we know a great deal about
engineering faculty cultures; 2) engineering faculty culture change is needed
and can be accomplished; and 3) deans can provide leadership for changing
engineering faculty culture. The EDGE Initiative will advance knowledge through
the study of the impact of the EDGE project on engineering deans'
actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
