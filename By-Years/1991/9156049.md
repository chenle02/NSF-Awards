An introductory undergraduate course in biomechanics and computer graphics is
being developed, geared toward enhancing general computer literacy with regards
to human motion modeling. A course goal is to encourage students to assume
responsibility for their intellectual development through active learning and
independent investigation. With both a lecture and laboratory component, the
course emphasizes the analytical development of kinematic models, the
acquisition of kinematic data with laboratory experiments and the use of
computer graphics techniques for human motion rendering. An educational software
tool, Biomechanica, is being developed as a multipurpose dynamic simulation
program with a user-friendly programming interface. The personal computer is an
inexpensive medium for educating our future engineers, scientists, and medical
practitioners about the physiological capabilities of the human body. The use of
computer graphics in biomechanics usually occurs at the graduate level. This
course and software development effort make these topics accessible to lower
division students.
