The proposed work will develop algorithms for motion planning of three-
dimensional manipulators operating amidst unknown obstacles of arbitrary shape.
The robot arms considered here are assumed to have a contact-sensitive sensory
skin such as nearly all animals possess. (Such arms are being developed in a
parallel project at Yale.) Prior studies of the two-dimensional case produced
fast algorithms guaranteed to converge to a global position goal. This work will
extend the simulation and mathematical analyses to three-dimensional arms of
increasing complexity.
