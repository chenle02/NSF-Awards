This project from an EPSCoR state, adding a new visualization capability by
upgrading current RCF machine, provides high performance resources and training
to a broad user base. The infrastructure doubles the current capacity and
memory, servicing 15 departments distributed over four campuses. The shared-
memory presented to the user by this SGI instrumentation provides a suitable
architecture for algorithms that require large amounts of inter-processor
communication. The visualization feature allows researchers to view animation or
graphical output on their own display, making it possible to work remotely. The
visualization capability enables up to 16 researchers to interact simultaneously
from remote sites, thus enhancing distance collaboration and educational
outreach. Research activities involve:&lt;br/&gt; Grid Computing,&lt;br/&gt;
Middleware Research,&lt;br/&gt; Atomistic Computer Simulation for the
Nanoscale,&lt;br/&gt; Mesoscale Meteorological Modeling,&lt;br/&gt; Genome
Research&lt;br/&gt; Roadway Safety - Modeling Vehicle Crashworthiness,
and&lt;br/&gt; Reducing the Design-Testing Cycle in Systems on a
Chip.&lt;br/&gt;The university will use the infrastructure to enhance
diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
