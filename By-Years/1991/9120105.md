The goal of this research is to develop parallel system solvers for symmetric
indefinite and non-symmetric systems such as those occurring in computational
fluid dynamics, develop parallel techniques for solving time-dependent problems,
and construct a rapid prototyping environment for developing and experimenting
with algorithms in sparse matrix computations on shared and distributed memory
multiprocessors. In particular, the are examined: (1) parallel solution schemes
for solving Stokes-like linear arising in CFD and other augmented Lagrangian
problems such interior point methods of linear programming, (2) incomplete
Newton methods with Krylov or row projection solvers for the inner iteration,
(3) solution of time-dependent problems using high-order methods in time, (4)
defining and developing sparse matrix primitives analogous to the highly
effective BLAS-3's for dense computations, and (5) implementing sparse
factorization and solution schemes. The goal is portable efficiency and
scalability, by parallelism on multiple levels. This in turn allows the work be
used across a wide spectrum of existing and future architectures, instead of
simply a particular machine.
