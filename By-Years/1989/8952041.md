In the last twenty years, expensive scientific instrumentation has become
essential in chemistry. The chemistry is currently involved in an intensive
effort to increase the time undergraduates spend using modern instrumentation.
This project increases our capability in the area of UV/Visible absorbance
spectrophotometry, ones of the most versatile techniques in the laboratory. As
part of this project, improved and new experiments are introduced in organic,
physical chemistry, biochemistry and instrumental analysis. Computer interfacing
introduces students to powerful data analysis techniques, and allows them to
spend more time critically evaluating their results. Given Lehman's two-thirds
minority and two-thirds female student population, these improvements in the
department's programs should help address the current underrepresentation of
these groups in chemistry and related fields. The institution is matching the
NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
