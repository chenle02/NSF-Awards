9618315 Kincaid This work addresses questions related to how on- and off-axis
mantle plumes interact (thermally, chemically, and dynamically) with ridges for
cases of unsegmented versus segmented spreading geometries and for cases where
the ridge migrated relative to the plume source. The fluid dynamics of plume-
ridge interaction will be constrained through a combination of laboratory and
numerical modeling techniques. The addition of sub-components to the numerical
models that calculate axial patterns in melt volume and chemistry, axial
bathymetry and gravity will provide a predictive capability for further
constraining mantle processes.
