The North Carolina Council on Minorities in Science, Mathematics and Industry,
jointly organized by the Governor's office, North Carolina State University, and
the state Department of Community Colleges, is working with 17 school systems
and 55 industries to increase technological literacy of junior/senior high
school students and to increase the number of minorities entering technical,
scientific, and engineering trades and professions. Through this program, the
Council will enhance local understandings of the importance and relevance of
modern technology by developing greater technological literacy among teachers
and students and extending that literacy to the general public. Activities with
teachers will include placing teachers in summer internships in industry,
development of technology education materials through joint efforts of these
teachers and industrial scientists and engineers, and providing in-service
programs for sharing these materials with other teachers. Students will use
these materials in science and mathematics courses and in new or expanded
courses in Principles of Technology courses. Industry on Parade exhibits,
rotated among different sites in the state, will be a part of the program by
bringing to the general public as well as to students and teachers an improved
appreciation of the nature and importance of modern manufacturing and product
technology. Cost sharing by the partners will total 245% of the NSF funding.
