The various problems proposed fall in three categories, extreme value theory,
point processes and time series. Sequences of extreme values or record times
form a point process and hence the theory of point processes offers a powerful
tool to analyze the related problems. The principal investigator has a number of
results in this area and will continue his investigation further. The point
processes methods that proved to be so useful in showing the convergence of
functionals of moving average processes will be extended to the continuous time
processes. New point processes methods need to be developed since the random
points generated in many relevant situations have a very complicated dependence
structure. The ideas of convex hulls of a set of points lead to one possible way
of defining multivariate extremes. Thus the multivariate order statistics depend
on the distribution theory of the convex hulls.
