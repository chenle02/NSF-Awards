This Presidential Young Investigator will continue to work in two areas of
probability theory: classical stochastic processes and interacting particle
systems. In addition he will work on the subject of the diffusions of fractals.
This award will allow Mountford to continue collaborations in these areas and
will allow him to bring visitors to the UCLA campus.
