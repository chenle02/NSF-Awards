Professors Meyerhofer and Eberly will carry out a joint experimental and
theoretical study on the interaction of strong- field laser pulses with atoms
and ions. The experimental work concentrates on high-field ionization and the
nature of higher- order harmonic generation. The theoretical work will emphasize
the interpretation of photon-emission and electron-photon correlations during
strong-field ionization.
