When solutions exhibit localized features, adapted finite element meshes based
on error estimations are a frequently used technique to reduce the effort to
compute a good approximation. They can accelerate the solution process by orders
of magnitude. This short course will deal with the derivation, analysis and
application of such methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal lecturer, Rolf
Rannacher, has been among the leading researchers in this field for 15 years and
is a driving force behind goal oriented error estimation. This technique
produces estimates directly related to measurements relevant in applications. As
opposed to many other techniques, it has been applied successfully to a wide
class of nonlinear problems. The CBMS conference will give a detailed overview
over a posteriori error estimation for a variety of problems in partial
differential equations, optimization, and eigenvalue computation. The
presentation of theory will be augmented by hands-on sessions allowing
participants to explore practical aspects of these techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
