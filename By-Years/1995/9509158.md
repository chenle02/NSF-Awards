ABSTRACT Athanassios Z. Panagiotopoulos Cornell University CTS-9509158 The main
objective of this project is to develop intermolecular potential models suitable
for predictions of phase equilibrium for industrially important fluid mixtures
by simulation. The target accuracy of representation is comparable to
experimental measurements of moderate precision. The models developed need to be
reliable over a wide range of physical environments, temperatures, pressures and
compositions. Especially important is the ability to do well for both liquid-
phase and gas-phase properties. Transferability of molecular group potential
parameters from component to component is also highly desirable. In order to
achieve the primary objective, methods for extracting model parameters from
experimental data by adaptive simulations in which the potential is changed
during sampling of configuration space will be developed. Initial systems of
interest include one, two and three-component systems with short-chain
hydrocarbons and monofunctional organic alcohol's and ketones, water and carbon
dioxide.
