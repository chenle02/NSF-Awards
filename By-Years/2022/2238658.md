This NSF CAREER project aims to improve the resiliency of smart transmission
grids to cascading failures. Cascading failures in power grids are successive
interdependent failures of components, which can lead to large blackouts with
significant societal and economical impacts. The project will bring
transformative change in supporting operation and mitigation functions during
and before cascading failures through various graph-empowered predictive,
descriptive and prescriptive analyses. These will be achieved by bridging the
gap between graph-based and data-driven modeling and analyses of cascading
failures in power grids. The intellectual merits of the project include
developing a graph signal learning framework for analyzing cascading failures in
power systems using graph signal processing (GSP) and graph-empowered machine
learning techniques. The broader impacts of the project include an integrated
education and workforce training component to foster interdisciplinary training
in the area of energy data analytics through new course developments and
mentoring and advising efforts with the help of industry and academic partners,
as well as efforts to increase participation of underrepresented students in
STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop new
methodologies to enhance the reliability of power transmission grids to
cascading failures by integrating the system’s structural and components
interaction data along with temporal data, capturing dynamics of the states, in
the form of graph signals. The proposed research will make new discoveries in
the dynamics and properties of power systems’ graph signals during cascading
failures through vertex domain, graph-frequency domain, and the joint vertex-
frequency domain analyses and through modeling power system dynamics in a GSP
framework using tools including graph filters. The analyses through the proposed
framework will enable developing new techniques for detecting the proximity to
cascade transition and identifying areas for protective control. Moreover,
graph-empowered machine learning techniques, including graph neural networks,
will be developed to learn the signatures and patterns of cascade stresses in
various graph signal domains and to develop tools to support optimizing
corrective and preventive decisions for improving cascade
resiliency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
