0241244 Lien&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thermocline waters of the equatorial
region are coupled to the "cold tongue" through turbulent processes that entrain
and mix water between them. In the past, large-scale mooring arrays and remote
sensing have provided estimates of other aspects of the heat budget except for
this entrainment term. The PIs propose to measure this term through measurements
made on Lagrangian floats deployed in the Pacific equatorial region. This will
provide time series of turbulent entrainment fluxes. One goal of this research
is to better understand how El Nino develops.&lt;br/&gt;
