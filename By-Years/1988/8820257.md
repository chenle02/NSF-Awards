A new type of analog signal processor module for digitizing the output of
charge-coupled devices (CCDs) will be built. The unit is designed around a very
fast 16-bit analog-to-digital converter and a digital signal processor (DSP)
integrated circuit. By taking multiple samples of the waveform at the output of
the CCD it will be possible to increase the dynamic range of the readout and to
apply optimal filtering techniques to lower the readout noise. The DSP will
store the samples and numerically process them to derive a single number to send
to the host computer, thereby relieving the load on the host. The DSP will also
generate the clocking waveforms to drive the CCD, as well as carry out other
time-critical tasks such as the operation of motors and shutters. The new
electronic system is simpler than previous designs, and is also capable of high
speed readouts of the CCD for field finding or high-speed photometry. We plan to
experiment with various methods for improving readout noise and large signal
handling capabilities using several CCDs. The project is expected to last about
two years and involve, in addition to the Principal Investigator, an electrical
engineer, an electronics technician, and a graduate student.
