This award is made in the Materials Chemistry and Chemical Processing Initiative
in support of the collaborative research of Professors Cowley, Jones, Ekerdt and
White at the University of Texas/Austin. Joint funding is provided by the
Divisions of Chemistry, Materials Research, and Chemical and Thermal Systems.
The principal objective is to achieve precise control of the physical and
electronic properties of epitaxially grown semiconductor thin films through the
rational design and chemical synthesis of single-source precursors. Novel
single-source precursors will be prepared and their structures and stabilities
determined. Thin films will be grown by chemical beam epitaxy and the
adsorption, decomposition and surface desorption kinetics of the precursors will
be studied by advanced surface science techniques. The relationship between
precursor structure, surface reactions and materials properties will be explored
in order to develop an atomistic description of how the precursors react at the
interface and how film growth progresses.
