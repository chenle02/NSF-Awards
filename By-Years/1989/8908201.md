The objective of the research is to conduct laboratory experiments that will
provide data on the effects of flow rate, cation exchange capacity, and permeant
fluid characteristics on the leachability of heavy metals from fly ash liner
materials. The laboratory tests will be conducted on fly ash in various
combinations with cement, bentonite, and/or two well- characterized soils. Flow
rates ranging from those expected to be operative under field conditions will be
used in the experiments. The characteristics of the permeant fluids will range
from tap water to a synthetic electrolyte solution varying in both concentration
and composition. The concentrations and amounts of specific chemical species
being leached from fly ash mixtures will be monitored to draw conclusions about
the effect of cation exchange capacity, and the effect of electrolyte solution
on the leachability of heavy metals. As a result of the research, a more valid
assessment of the use of fly ash in waste impoundment facilities will be
possible. Such an assessment will have far reaching technical and economical
implications, especially for the electric power industry.
