Much progress has been made during the past decade in observations of
interstellar clouds of gas and dust and of the formation of new stars that takes
place in cold, dense clumps in many of these clouds. The question that is
unanswered is "Do any of these currently forming stars acquire planetary systems
similar to our own?" The question is unanswered because up to now observers
lacked the angular resolution to detect planets or planetary precursor object
across interstellar distances. The Principal Investigator proposes to overcome
this difficulty by using lunar occultations of star forming regions, which he
thinks will increase the angular resolution sufficiently to allow him to observe
planetary systems in the making.
