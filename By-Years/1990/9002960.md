This research project will concentrate on the analysis of the low resolution
spectra obtained with IRAS in order to establish the characteristic dust grain
signatures found in the 8-22 micron region. With these spectra, Dr. Little-
Marenin will be able to investigate and possibly extend the chronology of dust
formation and microwave maser development in relatively older and optically
thick circumstellar shells associated with M stars. The time variability of the
emission from the circumstellar shells will be investigated by analyzing the
IRAS broad band fluxes and the spectra of individual IRAS observations. Analysis
of the emission and absorption features observed in the circumstellar shells
associated with C stars should provide observational evidence for the carbon-
bearing dust grain formation sequence that has been proposed. In addition, Dr.
Little-Marenin will teach an Introductory Astronomy course, develop a research
seminar on the late stages of stellar evolution and organize a lecture series
given by women astronomers. She will also give departmental colloquia, seminars
and informal presentations. This project furthers VPW program objectives which
are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in
engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to
encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing
greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,
government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the participation of women
in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific
vitality.
