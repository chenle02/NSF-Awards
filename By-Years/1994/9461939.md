This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project investigates a high-
power surface-emitting single-longitudinal-mode, single-spatial-mode lasers
based on a unique cavity that combines high spatial selectivity with surface-
emitted output. The proposed device will yield a high-power (>1 W) feedback-
resistant diode with a round, diffraction-limited beam. Due to the flexibility
of the cavity architecture, surface-emitting diodes can be fabricated in any
material system, thereby allowing high power diffraction-limited cw sources to
be realized from 0.63-2.0 um.
