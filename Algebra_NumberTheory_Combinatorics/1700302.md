Algebraic combinatorics is an area of mathematics that uses finite and discrete
structures to study more complex algebraic and geometric structures. Ideas and
techniques from combinatorics are increasingly being used in other areas of pure
mathematics such as algebraic geometry and representation theory, as well as
applied areas such as mathematical physics and complexity theory. The central
theme of this project is to adapt definitions of classical types of objects in
algebraic combinatorics, usually defined perhaps only for partitions or the
complete graph, to apply to general diagrams or graphs. Often studying this
generalized setting reveals geometric and algebraic connections of which only a
shadow is visible in the original setting.

This project includes several directions for research. One direction of study is
to investigate the structural relationships between Specht modules for general
diagrams, the cohomology classes of diagram Schubert varieties, and the geometry
of matching ensemble polytopes. Another topic is to investigate certain weighted
lattice point sums on flow polytopes of graphs, which in the case of the
complete graph are related to the combinatorics of parking functions and the
Hilbert series of the space of diagonal harmonics. A third topic is to study
various generalizations of Schubert polynomials from a geometric and
representation-theoretic perspective.
