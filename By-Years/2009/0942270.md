Engineering-Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to enhance
mathematical proficiency of engineering students in an effort to increase
retention of incoming engineering students, especially those who have had
limited prior math opportunities. To accomplish the goal the project creates a
four-week preparatory distance course for incoming students and develops a set
of modules with engineering problems for the Calculus I and Calculus II courses.
In addition, the project creates a mentoring system such that upper-level
engineering students meet weekly with the calculus students to cover the
engineering content of the modules. The mentors provide real time instructive
feedback, offer guidance on efficient studying habits and time management, and
connect students to campus resources.
