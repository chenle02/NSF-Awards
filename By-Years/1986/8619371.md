The primary objective of this interdisciplinary Symposium is to promote the
development of a "molecular technology" via the communication of experimental
and theoretical scientific results. The term "molecular technology" might be
defined as techniques for the development of 2- and 3- dimensional nanocomposite
functional structures. Molecular electronics could then be defined as the
"technology of signal transport and control in nanocomposite structures". The
previous two symposia on molecular electronic devices (MED) were held at the
Naval Research Laboratory in 1981 and 1983 with proceedings published by Marcel
Dekker (1982 and in press respectively). The proceedings of the 3rd Symposium
will be similarly published.
