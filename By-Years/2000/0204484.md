This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "New procedures
for modelling the thermal environment of small animals." The spatial and
temporal distribution of thermal resources across landscapes influences the
abundance and distribution of organisms. Existing techniques to evaluate thermal
habitats do not adequately represent the complexity of most environments. Novel
procedures are being developed to generate detailed, dynamic, thermal maps using
artificial neural networks that incorporate thermographic imaging and
microclimate data.
