The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry
Division supports Professor Scott Gronert of Virginia Commonwealth University
for the study of organic reaction processes in the gas phase. Using an ion trap
mass spectrometer with variable temperature capabilities, fundamental processes
such as the competition between SN2 and E2 reactions as well chiral recognition
are examined. Also, the mechanisms and reactivity of synthetically important
organometallic species, including copper and gold carbenes, are being
investigated. Third, the reactivity of aryl halides with nucleophiles is being
explored. Preliminary work indicates competition between several pathways
including an unusual SN2 reaction on a halogen center. The rationale for this
work is that gas-phase studies allow one to probe the bonding characteristics of
specific, isolated intermediates and gain mechanistic information that is not
readily available from experiments using conventional techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The information gained from this research can be very valuable in the
development of more effective chemical processes in the synthesis of new
materials or the remediation of hazardous materials. The grant also focuses on
developing new scientists and is designed to offer many research opportunities
for undergraduate and graduate students. As a part of an outreach program,
students from local historically black universities (Virginia State and Virginia
Union) are recruited to participate in summer research.
