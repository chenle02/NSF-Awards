The principal investigator will extend (in both complex analytic and Lie
theoretic directions) his previous work on analytically representing
intersection cohomology of singular spaces by L2-cohomology. In particular, he
proposes to find complete Kaehler metrics on the smooth locus of projective
varieties whose L2-cohomology represents the intersection cohomology of the
singular variety. The principal investigator will extend ideas used in his
solution to the Zucker conjecture to the case of complete Kaehler metrics. This
conjecture stated that except in certain specified cases, the L2- and
intersection cohomology were essentially the same. Cohomology is the dual of
homology. Thus, cohomology consists of a sequence of groups of functions which
are tied together by a sequence of "co-boundary" functions. These structures
have been used to catalog hypersurfaces of many dimensions.
