9619366 Moyer The Linked Learning in Mathematics Project (LLMP) is a thirty-
month Teacher Enhancement leadership and dissemination project that provides
supportive infrastructure and resources for: validation and refinement of an
Algebraic-Thinking Framework for mathematics teachers of grades 6-9, and
leadership development for the purpose of bringing about systemic mathematics
reform. LLMP builds on the work of the Urban Mathematics Collaboratives (UMC)
and its derivative NSF-funded Teacher Enhancement projects, Assessment
Communities of Teachers (ACT) and Leadership for Urban Mathematics Reform
(LUMR). LLMP holds promise for its contributions in addressing the difficulties
faced by districts implementing "algebra for all" policies. This partnership
between Marquette University and the Milwaukee Public Schools provides for
participants to be recruited/selected in school teams comprised of mathematics
teachers of grades 6-9 and their principals. For the first cohort of LLMP,
priority is given to teams that are piloting NSF-funded instructional materials.
The project provides 109-126 hours of professional development for each of 110
teachers of mathematics and 34 hours for each of approximately 20 principals. In
addition, the project refines and validates an Algebraic-Thinking Framework
intended to guide instruction based on NSF-funded and other reform-oriented
instructional materials in mathematics. An end product of the project is to be a
publication "that captures the Algebraic Thinking Framework and offers
guidelines for its use" and that will be disseminated nationally. Non-federal
cost-sharing in the project is approximately 34% of the NSF contribution and is
derived from Marquette University ( 4%) and the Milwaukee Public Schools (29%).
