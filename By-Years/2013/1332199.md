This grant will allow research to continue on streamer-to-spark modeling, with a
main goal of developing an efficient and accurate air heating model to study
streamer-to-leader transition in lightning and air heating processes in
transient luminous events (TLEs). New observations of events like gigantic jets
and space leaders in lightning show the need for the development of streamer-to-
leader transition models capable of simulating leader formation and propagation
in a broader range of values of leader electrical current and ambient air
pressure. The research aims of the award are to answer questions about: the
scaling of streamer-to-leader transition with pressure, parameterization of
channel decay time, polarity asymmetries in positive and negative leader
formation and propagation, possibility of air heating in sprites, and long
persistency of bead structures in sprites.

The broader impacts of the research include the education and training of a
graduate student and the inclusion of undergraduate students in the research
through direct funding and the association with an existing Research Experiences
for Undergradutes program. Models developed during the award period would be
made available to the community.
