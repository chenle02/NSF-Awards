The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
revolutionizing how farmers grow their crops and significantly reduced the
dependence on fertilizers or pesticides to maximize yields. Understanding how to
manipulate natural components of the plant stress response to provide desirable
beneficial traits will potentially lead to reductions in chemical use in
agriculture. This technology provides a novel mechanism to express broad
spectrum immune response that would normally stunt plant growth. This novel
mechanism has large potential societal and commercial impacts. Currently,
agricultural companies express resistance genes using promoter systems that are
specific for one strain of pathogen. Each resistance gene included in the plant
seed results in a negative fitness cost. The technology developed here can
potentially eliminate the need to express multiple resistance genes by replacing
them with one broad spectrum resistance gene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project further develops a TBF1-Control Cassette technology (TCC) to regulate
translation that is both inducible and specific. Current gene expression methods
are primarily based on transcriptional regulation utilizing synthetic or native
promoters, which were shown to be insufficient in overcoming negative fitness
costs associated with expression of stress response genes. The TCC technology
remediates these negative fitness cost by "stalling" the translation of the gene
of interest until a trigger is present. This mechanism allows for the
accumulation of transcripts without the subsequent translation, and hence no
negative fitness costs until the protein is translated. The technology was
proven to work in rice and can be applied to other economically important crops,
such as wheat or corn.
