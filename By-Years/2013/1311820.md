Professor Miller and his group will study the spatial distribution of galaxy
clusters, paying specific attention to the bias of cluster-sized dark matter
halos. Such a bias results from massive dark matter halos forming within the
largest fluctuations in the primordial matter density field. This induces a
correlation between the halo mass and the amplitude of the clustering itself.
Observational constraints on bias are a prerequisite to high precision cosmology
using galaxy clusters. The program will publish a sample of approximately 1000
clusters with measured masses and well characterized
errors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of a
graduate student, building tutorials for web-based astronomy tools which lead
non-specialists through some of the greatest astronomical discoveries, allowing
non-scientists to discover for themselves the fundamental laws of the Universe.
