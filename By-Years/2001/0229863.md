This project will extend the WINDMI model of magnetospheric substorms. A new,
spatially-resolved nonlinear dynamics model of the coupled magnetosphere-
ionosphere system will be developed. That coupled system is driven by inputs
from the solar wind. The model is derived from Maxwell's equations and nonlinear
plasma dynamics. It has numerous feedback and feed-forward loops that provide a
low-dimensional dynamic system that can capture most of the important physical
processes that lead to substorms. The method of treating the magnetosphere-
ionosphere system as a low-dimensional, nonlinear dynamical system is very
different from, but complementary to, the global scale simulations that are
being done by a number of other research groups. The project will examine the
differences in the power flow and energy releases that give rise to different
types of substorms and intensifications. Because the model can be driven by
information on the state of the solar wind that can be obtained either from
observations at the L1 point or from solar observations in conjunction with
solar-wind modeling, the model has predictive capabilities that are useful for
space weather forecasting.
