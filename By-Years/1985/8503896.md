The objective of this project is to develop analytical models to investigate
parts routing in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS). To be processed in a
FMS, a part normally has a large number of alternative routes to follow. These
alternative routes contribute to the flexibility of the system, and enable it to
cope with random disturbances. It is therefore desirable that parts routing in a
FMS should follow a dynamic scheme which is adaptive to the on-line state of the
system. Earlier work on dynamic routing is extended through studying the concept
of routing flexibility. Specifically, the required on-line information for
managing routing flexibility will first be identified and an information-
theoretic measure, "routing entropy," will be developed to quantify routing
flexibility. Based on this measure, a routing principle, "least reduction in
routing entropy," will be proposed which aims at maximizing the routing
flexibility in the on-line system. A dynamic routing scheme will be studied
which implements this principle and is developed through modeling the FMS as a
closed queueing network.
