9524061 Vandermeer Most global warming models predict an increased frequency and
intensity of tropical storms. The frequency of hurricanes will almost certainly
have a long-term effect on the biodiversity of tropical rain forests.
Understanding the details of post-hurricane succession will enable a more
accurate assessment of the exact nature of these impacts on biodiversity. This
project continues an ongoing project which has followed recovery and reassembly
of a tropical forest since Hurricane Joan struck in 1988. The forest is now
entering a new phase of recovery where competition has become more intense and
competitive thinning is beginning as the forest enters another stage of
succession. Measurements of tree diameters and crown heights of a large number
of marked trees will test several theories of competitive thinning. Biodiversity
will be measured for arthropods, and physical and chemical factors will be
followed in the soils and at ground level. This research will provide a basis on
which to predict the biodiversity consequences of increased hurricane
frequencies.
