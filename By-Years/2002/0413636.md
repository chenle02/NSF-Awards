The Soundprint Media Center will conduct planning for "Evolution Discoveries," a
multi-part radio series on evolutionary science, contemporary issues and new
discoveries. The project will help educate the public about the insights
evolutionary science can offer current problems and issues, while at the same
time help to explain basic principles of evolutionary science.

Key planning activities over five months will include identifying gaps in public
understanding of evolutionary science, creating a framework for the radio series
and producing and testing a pilot program. They will work with an advisory group
that includes museums and researchers that are studying visitor understanding of
evolution -- geographically, developmentally and by gender.

They plan to develop partnerships with informal science organizations (museums,
zoos, aquariums, etc.) to extend the reach of the audio material beyond those of
public radio. Other components of the project include a public radio station
resource guide to help establish local collaborations between stations and local
scientists, museums, zoos, aquariums and others; a resource guide for teachers
and a website that will complement and be compatible with other online resources
such as those supported by natural history museums and the Human Genome
Management Project.
