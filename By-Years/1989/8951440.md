This project will support the expansion of a computer laboratory which will be
used to provide a setting in which students will gain insight into the nature of
mathematical problems, the physical phenomena they represent, and the procedures
used to study them numerically. It is being funded under the Instrumentation and
Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of improving the
quality of the undergraduate curriculum by supporting projects to develop new or
improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory and/or field courses in
science, mathematics, or engineering. In particular, this project will consist
of a coordinated program in numerical methods and differential equations which
will make significant use of computational experimentation and graphics. The
facility will be used to study dynamical systems, partial differential
equations, and linear and nonlinear systems; the students will be introduced to
nonlinear phenomena of recent interest, including chaos and strange attractors,
arising from models of systems such as the weather, the heart, and the damped,
driven pendulum.
