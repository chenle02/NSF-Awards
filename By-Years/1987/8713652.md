The objective of this research is the structure and dynamics of the atmosphere
in complex terrain, particularly selected valleys in the Mountain West. Both new
and existing observations will be used to investigate the heat balance and its
relationship to diurnal heating, the interaction between the valley atmosphere
and other scales of motion, particularly how the former is related to the
vertical transfer of heat, moisture and momentum. Professor McKee is well
qualified to pursue this research, particularly the field measurements. Also, he
has trained excellent students in the past. A successful, even empirical,
understanding of valley air circulation could be crucial to problems in air
pollution and other issues of air quality. I recommend support as a three year
continuing grant at the revised budget level.
