Two numerical models will be developed to simulate the three- dimensional
velocity field in shallow free-surface water flow. One is based on large eddy
simulation, and the other utilizes a space-time filtering approach. The models
will be applicable in the prediction turbulent motion of lakes and coastal water
bodies.
