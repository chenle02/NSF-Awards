The PI proposes to purchase a Carbon, Nitrogen, Sulfur Elemental Analyzer for
analyses of earth materials. The purchase of this instrument will permit
institutional users to analyze a wide variety of oceanic and atmospheric
particles caught on sediment traps/filters, rock powders, marine sediments, and
biological materials. The new instrument will augment the capability to study
global biogeochemical cycles and link the results to paleoclimatic and
paleoceanographic variations in the earth's history. One-third of the total cost
is to be borne by the institution in the form of matching money.
