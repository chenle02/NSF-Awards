This research will investigate the morphogenesis of the larval head of
Drosophila. Mechanisms for the establishment of the pattern of head segmentation
at blastoderm stage and early embryonic development of the head will be
investigated, specifically with regard to the action of the CNC gene of
Drosophila, which is expressed in three head segments. This work will
characterize the genetic controls activating CNC expression in the proper
segments, analyze the effects of loss of and of ubiquitous over expression of
CNC function on embryonic development and investigate the possible DNA-binding
activity of the CNC protein. This work will also characterize a set of mutants
that affect the principal process of head morphogenesis, head involution, which
occurs after the initial pattern is established, by using the expression of CNC
and Dfd to follow specific segments in the abnormal morphogenetic movements of
these mutants. This research will provide additional insight into how genes
interact during pattern formation in development and what role they play in the
control of the morphogenetic movements that manifest that initial pattern.
