In this project it is proposed to investigate the characteristics of dielectric
resonator radiating structures. Antennas comprising dielectric material are
expected to be more efficient and more economical in the high microwave
frequency range than are microstrip and similar metal antennas. The circular
dielectric disk radiator will serve as the fundamental radiating element for the
study, but other configurations, such as the use of several layers of dielectric
to make the element suitable for use over an increased range of frequencies, may
also be investigated to better understand the effects of various parameters on
the performance of the antenna. Rigorous numerical modeling of the dielectric
structure will be based on the Surface Integral Equation Formulation, but other
numerical methods such as the Finite Integration Technique will also be used
where appropriate. Precision measurements will consist of radiation pattern,
radiation efficiency, and input impedance investigations, and will serve to
validate the theoretical results obtained for various configurations. Different
excitation methods for the conductorless dielectric resonator antenna, as well
as different antenna configurations, will be analyzed. The three investigators
will cover the numerical aspects, the electromagnetic system aspects, and the
experimental aspects of the conductorless antennas.
