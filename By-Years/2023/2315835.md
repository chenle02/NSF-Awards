This project advances the scholarship of future developmental scientists by
creating a Faculty Learning Community (FLC) that fosters connections between
scholars in teaching-intensive, minority-serving institutions (MSIs) and mentors
appointed at research-intensive institutions. Barriers to opportunities and
resources can hinder the research productivity of scholars appointed at teaching
intensive institutions. These barriers include limited library resources;
limited access to statistical/survey software; and insufficient mentoring
pertaining to research development, proposal writing, and grant management.
Scholars impacted by such barriers often have compelling research questions;
without the capital and mentoring to move their ideas to the next stage;
however, their research questions remain unanswered, and their unique
perspectives remain neglected in the scientific literature.

To meet this need, the FLC pairs early career faculty or postdoctoral fellows at
MSIs with tenured faculty (“Faculty Mentors”) who share similar areas of
research and have been successful in grant-smithing and mentoring research
scholars. The FLC catalyzes cutting-edge, developmental research using projects
focused on underrepresented families at pivotal developmental transitions while
considering the familial, financial, and social factors impacting those
developmental stages. The FLC brings scholars together to enrich their learning
and awareness, build their strategies for success, engage in constructive
dialogue and reflection, and foster a sense of belonging. The FLC is designed to
provide a supportive scholarly community and mentoring experience to encourage
early career faculty or postdoctoral fellows at teaching intensive MSIs to
acquire the skills needed develop successful grant proposals and cultivate their
network of professionals who share their research interests.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
