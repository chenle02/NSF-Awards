9706374 Burgmann This project will establish an InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic
Aperture Radar) data analysis center at UC Davis to study active crustal
deformation in two target areas, the San Francisco Bay region, California, along
a complex juncture of the San Andreas fault system, and the strain accumulation
zone along the Greater Himalaya in central Asia. The measurements complement GPS
(Global Positioning System) and leveling data to better constrain models of the
active deformation processes. The analysis of interseismic faulting and strain
accumulation will lead to improved understanding of the earthquake hazards in
the target areas. Results from this investigation will include detailed mapping
of the complex distribution of creeping and locked segments along the San
Andreas fault system, a better model of the distribution of strain among the
interacting faults of the San Francisco Bay region, and a better definition of
the strain accumulation zone near the down-dip edge of M>8 earthquake rupture
zones along the Himalaya. ***
