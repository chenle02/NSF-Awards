9218583 Emslie PI has excavated cormorant bone beds, which present an
opportunity to investigate formation of avian death assemblages in relation of
marine stratigraphy and taphonomy. PI now will complete taphonomic and
paleontologic analyses, cooperating with an invertebrate paleontologist (W.
Allmon) and a palynologist (F. Rich). PI has generated a hypothetical scenario
of mass deaths followed by storms to concentrate bones. Outstanding preservation
will also allow systematics study and phylogenetic revision of fossil cormorants
of North America. ***
