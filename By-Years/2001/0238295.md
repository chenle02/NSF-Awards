More than three hundred genomes have been sequenced in the last decade. A new
self-trained gene prediction program that can be applied to any eukaryotic
genome will be developed. The method builds the required training set in three
steps, beginning with a seed set from existing resources for transcribed
regions. The set is extended and combined with a structure model into a complete
gene finder. The performance will be evaluated on the reference organism,
Toxoplasma gondii, which has both draft sequence and EST sequences. The
eukaryotic genomes provide information that will be of benefit in both economic
and health considerations. As the coupling between different disciplines grows
strong, a more interdisciplinary educational structure will be needed. The
education aspects of this effort will address this at both undergraduate and
graduate levels.
