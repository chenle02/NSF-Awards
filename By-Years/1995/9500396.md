9500396 Banerjee The use of virtual environment could provide a major
advancement for manufacturing information management and decision support
technologies. In this research virtual reality will be used in facilities and
product layout information management and optimization systems. In the layout
domain, the research will address three important problems: (1) three-
dimensional (3D) general layout design, (2) layout of manufacturing cells and
material flow paths in factories, and (3) layout of multi-module assemblies. The
short-term objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of using virtual reality
in reducing the manufacturing cycle time. The long-term objective is to develop
raw technology for a real-time-virtually-real management control and decision
support tool. There is also a major software development component. In addition,
the research involves collaborations with Motorola and five other industrial
firms, the Chicago Manufacturing Center, and National Institute of Standards and
Technology, and industry collaborators will co-fund the work. The research aims
to enable a shorter lead time in manufacturing. It will enhance the fundamental
understanding of manufacturing decision support in light of integration of new
technological developments in virtual reality. It will provide a new generation
of tools for training, develop alternatives to physical prototyping and provide
avenues for sustaining employee interest in better design of manufacturing
systems through continuous improvement. The research will be introduced through
lectures and laboratory experiments to graduate and undergraduate students.
Concepts will be incorporated into courses in computer-aided design, virtual
environments, production control, intelligent manufacturing systems and
facilities layout. Seminars will also be conducted for industrial partners and
other companies.
