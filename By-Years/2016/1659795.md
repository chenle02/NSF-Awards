This award establishes a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site
at Old Dominion University. The REU Site is led by faculty from the Center for
Cybersecurity Education and Research (CCSER) at the university. CCSER includes
faculty from a large number of departments and colleges across the university
that can provide a range of multidisciplinary research projects that focus on
problems that are important and attractive to undergraduates. The REU Site will
host 10 students from across the nation to conduct research during the summer
with faculty mentors. The students will live in the Cybersecurity Living and
Learning Community associated with CCSER. The project plans to recruit a diverse
cohort of undergraduate students each summer, including students from under-
represented minorities, women, and veterans. In addition to their research
activities, the students will participate in other professional development
activities that will prepare them for entering the computing workforce and for
possible futures as researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU site is led by
faculty mentors from the Center for Cybersecurity Education and Research. The
faculty of the Center have significant research expertise and offer state-of-
the-art facilities that should provide a compelling research experience to
undergraduates. This REU site offers unique multidisciplinary learning and
research opportunities for undergraduate students in the inherently
multidisciplinary cybersecurity discipline. Students will explore topics across
multiple disciplines including networks, machine learning, decision science,
sociology, criminal justice, and philosophy. Students will be advised by a
multidisciplinary mentoring committee with faculty from at least 3 different
areas. This approach should promote multidisciplinary collaborations among
students and increase their interest toward careers in the important field of
cybersecurity.
