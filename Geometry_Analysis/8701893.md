Helmut Groemer will carry out research into stability problems associated with
convex sets. Many theorems in the theory of convex sets state that under certain
conditions a body is of an important special type or that two bodies are related
to one another in a particular way. Corresponding to such results it is often
easy to pose an associated stability problem. For example one might ask how
close a body is to being a ball in terms of its isoperimetric deficit. The
investigator has already made some progress in this direction notably in the
case of results connected with projections of convex bodies. His future research
will focus on stability problems associated with the Brunn-Minkowski theorem,
symmetrization procedures, inscribed and circumscribed bodies. The anticipated
techniques will involve geometric adaptations of spherical harmonics and Radon
transforms.
