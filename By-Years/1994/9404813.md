ABSTRACT P.I. Alan Walker SBR-9404813 Alan Walker and Meave Leakey, two very
well known and widely respected paleoanthropologists, will excavate a most
promising early hominid site at Lake Turkana, Kenya, in this project. This site
has already yielded a few scattered hominid reamins from superficial surface
collections, and the time period represented in this site currently represents a
gap in our knowledge of human evolution. The earliest known hominid fossils date
back to 3.6 million years. and these deposits date to 4 million years, getting
close to the hypothesized time of splitting of the ape and human lineages. ***
