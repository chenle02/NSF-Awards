CTS-9308258 Johns Hopkins University Timothy A. Barbari ABSTRACT A new approach
to improve polymeric membranes for gas separation will be explored in this
project. Rather than synthesizing membranes of new materials or new composite
structures, chemical modification to form charge-transfer complexes in various
membrane polymers in current use is to be evaluated as a means of augmenting
their gas separation properties. Bromination of nucleophilic sites alters the
free volume and free volume distribution in polymers so that molecular
diffusivity increases and selectivity changes. Permeabilities of CO2 and CH4
through a treated polysulfone film will be measured and compared with the
untreated material. Growth in membrane sales for the next few years has been
estimated at 12-15%. A large portion of this market is in gas separations to
produce commercially important gaseous materials including the removal of carbon
dioxide from natural gas and the separation of pure oxygen.
