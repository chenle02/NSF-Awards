9521204 Kovacs The proposal is focused on the problem of fluid flow in
microvalve MEMs. The research uses rapid deep RIE (DRIE) of silicon combined
with silicon fusion bonding (SFB) to offer unique mechanical structures with
particular advantages to the field of microfluidics. These novel techniques can
be combined with a monomorph thermal actuator to fabricate novel microvalve
structures which are able to control fluids in MEMs. The application of these
MEMs is in the area of high-performance liquid chromatography systems. ***
