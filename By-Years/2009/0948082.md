We propose to hold a workshop in winter 2009 or spring 2010, as a sequel to the
inaugural symposium on memristor and memristive systems held in November 2008
under NSF sponsorship, to discuss scientific principles, experimental findings
for both devices and circuits, and potential exploration of related topics,
especially on novel systems applications. Continued NSF sponsorship is necessary
to build the momentum at this point through a follow-up workshop that will bring
together larger community of practicing engineers, graduate and undergraduate
students, academics and entrepreneurs that will subsequently lead to starting a
self-supported annual conference. Sustained effort is necessary to educate the
mainstream CMOS community about this intriguing new technology and thereby build
a critical-size research community so that rapid advancements can be made in
different frontiers, thereby enabling this CMOS-compatible new technology to
make commercial market inroads. The second workshop is imperative with a view to
developing understanding of and plans to solve the open problems and grand
challenges that beset on the way of commercialization of this new technology.
