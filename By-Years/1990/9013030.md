Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) Spectroscopy is the primary technique for studying
molecules which contain unpaired electrons. An ESR spectrometer is useful in
areas such as solid state chemistry, surface chemistry, solid state physics,
electrochemistry, and material science. The Department of Chemistry at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison will use this award from the Chemical
Research Instrumentation Program to help acquire a state-of-the-art Electron
Spin Resonance (ESR)/Spectrometer. The areas of chemical research that will
enhance by the acquisition include the following: 1. Spectroscopic Studies of
Guanylate Cyclase 2. Small-to-Giant Transition Metal Clusters 3. Organic and
Organometallic Reactive Intermediates 4. Radical Cation and Electron Transfer
Chemistry 5. Silicon Chemistry
