This award is to support undergraduate students attending and participating in
the Laser Science XXIX Conference, October 6-11, 2013 in Orlando, FL.
Specifically, the students present their research in the "Symposium on
Undergraduate Research" on Monday Oct 7, 2013. Previous years' programs are at
http://www.aps.org/units/dls/meetings/symposium/index.cfm. The intellectual
merit of this project is that the undergraduate students present and disseminate
the results of the research, many from NSF-supported REU
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is to provide the opportunity
for these young students to attend a national meeting of this stature and give
their first public talks. A secondary benefit arises because collaborations
among them are often born in these sessions since very often students in
different universities are involved in similar projects. A third impact is to
initiate networking among these students that will be vital to their future
careers as professional scientists, and to encourage them to continue along such
a career path.
