9320654 Wolfe This grant will support a workshop concerned with environmental
issues of major concern to manufacturing. The workshop is intended to bring
together institutions of higher education, business, and industry throughout
Arizona and the surrounding region. The intent of the workshop will be to
promote awareness and understanding and to discuss planning and practical
courses of action for companies in relation to environmental issues, laws and
regulations which affect the manufacturing world. This workshop will be
organized around three tracks: Waste management issues; air pollution and the
impact of the Clean Air Act Amendments on business and industry; and issues of
water pollution and the impact of the Safe Drinking Water Act on business and
industry. Given the concern for environment and the impact of the design,
production, use and recycle lifecycle on the environment, this workshop will
address important and relevant topics for industry and the university.
