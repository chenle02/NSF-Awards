9318522 Kieber This a starter grant for the NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow in
Plant Biology. Dr. Kieber has completed his tenure as the NSF Postdoctoral
Fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Joseph Ecker at University of Pennsylvania and
is now Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at the
Unversity of Illinois at Chicago. With this starter award, Dr. Kieber plans to
initiate his independent research program with a long-term goal of understanding
the mode of action of the plant hormone, ethylene. Specifically, Dr. Kieber will
further characterize a mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, ctr 1. This mutant is
deficient in ethylene perception in both seedlings and adult plants. There is
some evidence to indicate that the ctr1 gene product may encode for a kinase. It
is hoped that the results from these studies will build the foundation for
continued studies of the important problem in plant biology. ***
