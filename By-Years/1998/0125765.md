"Thinking SMART" is a comprehensive five-year program that will encourage young
women to pursue careers in science, mathematics and technology. The project
focuses on girls ages 12-18, and will especially target those who are
underserved and underrepresented in the sciences, including girls from diverse
backgrounds and persons with disabilities. Key elements include four
science/engineering module options, a two-tiered mentoring component, training,
resource materials, online activities and an awards program. The modules
(Material Girls, Eco Girls, Galactic Girls, Net Girls), focus on engineering,
ecology, physics and computer science respectively, and will be aligned with
national standards. The modules are implemented during the school year and
include weekly programming, a summer camp and a spring "Women in Science and
Engineering" conference organized by girls. Weekly meetings are augmented by
online activities, in which girls interact with other participants and mentors,
publish reports and obtain career information. Additionally, participants who
complete all four modules are eligible to become paid mentors for younger
participants. Five publications will be produced to support the program,
including manuals for mentors (both adults and youth), module activities, a
parent guide and a guide for implementation sites on community partnerships.
Thinking SMART materials will be developed and piloted tested at eight sites in
conjunction with Girls, Inc. affiliates in Nashua, NH, Worcester, MA, Oakridge,
TN and Shelbyville, IN, with input from the Society of Women Engineers.
Extensive training will also be provided for pilot programs and future
dissemination. Finally the E3 Awards Program will motivate implementation sites
to create high quality local programs. It is anticipated that more than 1,500
Girls, Inc. affiliates will adopt "Thinking SMART."
