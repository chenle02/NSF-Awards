9614674 Stock Baja California has been rifted from mainland Mexico within the
last 15 Ma, however the amount of displacement, thought to be approximately
300km, is not well known. A better measure of displacement is need for several
purposes including relating slip within the Gulf of California to net motion
between the Pacific and North American plates and understanding the kinematics
between Gulf rifting and the San Andreas fault motions. Because magnetic stripes
are not developed in the Gulf, the present estimate is based on a single tie
point across the Gulf, and this project is aimed at re-evaluating this critical
lithologic correlation and to apply modern methods to establish additional ties.
Results are expected to provide a more robust and accurate measure of Baja
displacement across the Gulf of California relative to mainland Mexico.
