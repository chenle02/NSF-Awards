Modern displays have become the most prevalent portals for information
processing and distribution and most of the information we consume is channeled
visually through displays of various forms and sizes. Colorful, high-contrast,
sunlight readable, and power efficient electrophoretic displays will further
close the digital divide between paper and electronic displays. Unfortunately,
amalgams of these requirements are the key technical challenges faced by modern
display technologies. The proposed new display technology is capable of
overcoming these inherent problems to display content in a manner similar to
print on paper. Consumers will benefit from the colorful, dynamic display
alternative as it causes much lower eyestrain when compared to bright LCDs. The
ramifications of such technological advancement are dramatic. The age of
digitally dynamic signage may soon be upon us and power consumption efficiency
is a key factor in making 'print on paper' a thing of the past. Colored
electrophoretic displays consume 54% less energy when compared to conventional
LCD?s. In conjunction with energy savings, this technology also reduces the
amount of paper consumed, and therefore the environmental benefit of saving
trees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This team has proposed a novel particle-based, low
power, colored, reflective and fast response display technology that can be used
in ambient lighting conditions. The proposed display platform is enabled by
electric-field driven particle suspensions, which offers fast response times
capable of displaying colorful images and video. This approach evades many
technical issues faced by current electrophoretic methodologies, and scalable to
large area displays. Due to its facile fabrication needs, the proposed display
geometry could be fabricated by roll-to-roll processing techniques resulting in
substantial cost savings. This team's technological advancement uses existing
manufacturing techniques and uses 80% less material by volume than conventional
displays making it economical and sustainable. Because of this technology's
remarkably low power consumption, its applications extend to products as small
as key fobs and as large as camouflaged tanks. Considering these merits this
team envisions that its low power, color based, particle-driven display
technology finds application and increases the value of existing products, while
making them sustainable and more enjoyable for consumers.
