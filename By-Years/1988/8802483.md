This research addresses several related topics of control theory. The first
problem is concerned with issues of controllability of linear systems with state
and control constraints which is of interest to control engineers when
attempting to deal with system elements that can overload or saturate. The
second problem of parameterization is important in adaptive control applications
when simultaneous control and plant identification is important. Finally, the
idea of feedback transformations (linearization) of nonlinear systems in a
multivariable setting provides a possible means of controlling certain
complicated nonlinear systems.
