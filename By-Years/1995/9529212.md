9529212 BROWN As a participating agency in the Committee on Environment and
Natural Resources (CENR) of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC),
the National Science Foundation is committed to bearing its share of collective
responsibilities. In order to provide long-term assistance in overall program
direction, quality, balance, and priorities as well as special analyses and
assistance, CENR has entered into an agreement with the National Research
Council's Board of Sustainable Development (NRC/BSD). This agreement is
supported through a task-order contract administered by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This interagency agreement transferring funds
from NSF to NOAA provides $10,000 toward NSF's $25,000 FY 1995 contribution for
support of the CENR-related activities of the NRC/BSD. (The remaining $15,000
are being handled through a separate financial agreement.) Through this transfer
of funds, NSF is fulfilling its responsibilities to share in the establishment
of an effective mechanism for the broader research community to work with CENR
agencies through the activities of the NRC/BSD. These activities will help
strengthen programs at NSF and other federal agencies, and they will facilitate
efficient and effective use of government funds.
