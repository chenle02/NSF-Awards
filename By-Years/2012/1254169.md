This project takes a new approach to problems involving sensitive data, by
focusing on rigorous mathematical modeling and characterization of the value of
private information. By focusing on quantifying the loss incurred by affected
individuals when their information is used -- and quantifying the attendant
benefits of such use -- the approaches advanced by this work enable concrete
reasoning about the relative risks and rewards of a wide variety of potential
computations on sensitive data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this work
has four main technical thrusts. The first is the development of new models and
definitions, enabling privacy considerations to be incorporated into agent
utility functions. The second is analysis of the feasibility and costs of
eliciting sensitive information, in light of these models. The third focus is on
enabling more sophisticated computations in settings where individuals value
their privacy. Finally, more complex settings incorporate the interests of
additional actors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the goals of this project is not
only to develop a science of the value of private information, but to build
bridges between computer science and economics that will enable such work.
Further, the models and algorithms developed by this project could inform future
regulation regarding the use, exchange, and monetization of sensitive data. The
project supports and is supported by a wide variety of educational goals,
including significant research involvement of students at a range of stages,
development of a course series with a substantial research component, and
assessment of a pedagogical technique created to facilitate meaningful
engagement with research literature.
