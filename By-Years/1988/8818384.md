It is the purpose of this project to develop and use a new facility at the South
Pole for the purpose of making astronomical and atmospheric observations in the
sub-millimeter wavelength region of the spectrum. This new telescope will have a
aperture of 1.2 meters, a state-of-the art superconducting-insulating-
superconducting hetrodyne receiver and an acousto-optic spectrometer. The
instrument will take advantage of the very low water vapor content of the cold
polar atmosphere, conditions that are unique to the polar plateau. It is
normally the water vapor that limits the sensitivity of observations in this
spectral region. The project is called Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and
Remote Observatory (ASTRO). Some specific science objectives are: Atomic carbon
and carbon monoxide surveys of selected regions of the southern skies;
Observations of star-forming clouds, nearby galaxies and envelopes of mass-
losing stars; Measuring the profiles of atmospheric ozone, carbon monoxide and
possibly other trace gases to further understanding of the polar stratosphere
and the causes of the annual ozone hole, and; A search for protogalaxies. The
project will be jointly supported by NSF's Division of Polar Programs, Division
of Astronomical Sciences, AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, The University of Illinois
and Boston University. The telescope will eventually be made available for
observations by investigators from institutions other than the original three.
