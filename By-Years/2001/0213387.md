In this project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
Professor Joern Ilja Siepmann and at the University of Minnesota and Dr. Mark
Schure at Rohm &amp; Haas Corporation will use molecular simulations to predict
chromatographic retention times and to elucidate the molecular-level process,
i.e., bulk partitioning or interfacial adsorption, that contribute to retention
in gas-liquid, reversed-phase liquid, and micellar chromatography. These
simulations will employ Monte Carlo methods and transferable force fields that
allow for calculations with the precision and accuracy required for
chromatographic applications. In addition, the dynamics of chromatographic
retention processes will be investigated using mesoscopic-scale lattice-fluid
Boltzmann simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chromatographic separation and the
analysis of complex samples play a pivotal role for research and development in
the chemical and pharmaceutical sciences and industries. This project combines
research groups from university and industry for the task of predicting
chromatography retention times; it is the difference in retention times that
allows chromatography to separate one compound or protein from another. The
predictions will be made with computer simulations of the compounds and proteins
absorption into the chromatographic media. In addition, the flow of the
compounds and proteins in the mobile phase will be computed. The particle-based
computer simulations will provide a molecular-level understanding of the factors
contributing to chromatrographic separations, a knowledge that is required for
the next-generation of industrial-scale separations and for microfluidic
separations. The close university-industry collaboration affords unique training
for the undergraduate and graduate students participating in this
project.&lt;br/&gt;
