This is a two-year collaborative project between Hsien-Kei Cheng of the
University of California, Los Angeles, and Luo Shijun of Northwestern
Polytechnic University, Xi'an, China. It is sponsored jointly by the NSF and the
Northwestern Polytechnic University. A combined CFD-asymptotic study is proposed
to investigate several unresolved, nonlinear aspects and related issues in the
theory and application of equivalence rules involving lift. Among the topics to
be considered are new aspects of transonic and supersonic equivalence rules
involving a nonlinear near field and the use/development of Euler and Navier-
Stockes solutions via domain decomposition (and programming parallelism), with
the main objective of ascertaining the degree to which shocks and flow in the
near field can affect the rule's validity/applicability. Included is also a
computer-program development for a 3-D transonic small-disturbance equation with
the specific purpose of applying the equivalence rule for predicting shock loss
in the far field, which is unavailable heretofore. Among the configurations to
be analyzed are wind-tunnel test models, for which drag and flow-field data are
available for comparison, as well as oblique, all-wing designs, of which the
performance gain with a nonlinear near field is most apparent.
