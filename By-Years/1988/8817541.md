Reliable analytical measurement of photosynthetic pigment concentrations is
crucial to the success of numerous mesoscale oceanographic programs (JGOFS,
GOFS, WOCE, NASA, etc.). For these multi-investigator, multi-year programs
standard and/or minimum precision, accuracy, and representativeness guidelines
must be established to avoid the acquisition of biased, meaningless or
unreliable results. Any program that acquires data over long periods of time
and/or from many different laboratories needs a mechanism to insure the
integrity and continuity of the data base that is being acquired. The activities
described here are a first attempt to establish guidelines and set realistic and
meaningful precision, accuracy and representativeness goals for photosynthetic
pigment measurements. Based on the recommendations outlined in the GOFS/JGOFS
planning reports, this study will (1) develop and implement a quality assurance
program for the analysis of plant pigments by HPLC; (2) provide external and
internal pigment standards to laboratories participating in the GOFS/JGOFS (and
related) programs; and (3) coordinate intercalibration exercises among
laboratories participating in the GOFS/JGOFS programs.
