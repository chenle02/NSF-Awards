A modern composite materials laboratory is being developed by Embry- Riddle
University with the recent acquisition of a scanning electron microscope, an
induction furnace and a data acquisition system. With this facility, students in
aeronautical engineering are able to fabricate composite materials and
structures to meet temperature and other standards common in industry. Students
test the materials and structures to determine their behavior and capabilities.
The data acquisition system is being used to monitor test results and collect
data to develop stress/strain curves, S-N curves (stress against number of
cycles) and perform statistical analyses on the uniformity of composite
materials. Analyses of test samples at high magnification determine bonding
mechanisms, microstructure, fracture mechanics and failure modes. Through these
experiences, aeronautical engineering students are being prepared to undertake
state-of-the-art work in industry and/or to enter advanced research programs.
