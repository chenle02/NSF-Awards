This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is designed to
provide a new probiotic product for public consumption that will address the
rising US and global obesity issue and related concurrent increase in health
problems such as diabetes and heart disease. According to the Centers for
Disease and Prevention, 60-65% of the adult population in the US is overweight
or obese. While implementation of lifestyle change (dietary modification and
increased physical activity) improves this condition, relapse with additional
weight gain is well documented. Current treatments are limited and include
surgery and pharmacological agents with well documented health risks. This
product is designed to work within the gastrointestinal tract, decreasing the
amount of energy available to the host, and providing a means to the consumer to
halt weight gain and decrease the risk of relapse, with possible positive
modulation of underlying risk factors which contribute to declining health and
contribute to increased health care costs.

The broader/commercial impacts of this research will be to reduce the high
incidence of obesity. The rising cost of health care in the US has been well
documented. Much of this cost is associated with increasing obesity, an
underlying factor in the development of diseases such as diabetes and heart
disease, commonly associated with an increase in abdominal
circumference/inflammatory processes. According to the World Health
Organization, three-fourths of the world population depends upon some form of
non-pharmaceutical product for health care, providing a world-wide marketing
opportunity for future commercialization.
