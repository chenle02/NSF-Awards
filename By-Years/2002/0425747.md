This project will capitalize on recent advancements in wave propagation theory
by developing a suite of regional tomographic methods using the 3D sensitivities
of finite-frequency body and surface waves across a regional seismic array. The
new methods will be applied to Iceland and will integrate presently separate
seismic data sets.&lt;br/&gt;
