This proposal seeks support to increase the participation of US researchers to
the Conference on the Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM) which will
be hosted by the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in Hungary
between July 4-14, 2011. The conference is the seventh in a sequence of
international meetings organized by the Society for the Foundations of
Computational Mathematics. The meetings are held every three years and the
preceding ones have been held in different countries in North and South America
and Europe. The NSF funding will cover the travel costs (airfare and partial
subsistence support) for 30 conference participants who are US
citizens/permanent residents, or work/study at a US institution. The supported
participants will be predominantly students and young researchers from the US,
but the organizers expect to also cover the travel and subsistence expenses of
some senior participants. NSF funding to support travel and other participant
costs for approximately 30 junior researchers and graduate students. The
conference organizers have been traditionally and continue to be dedicated to
attracting young participants and participants from under-represented groups and
providing valuable opportunities for networking with the leaders of the
disciplines. The conference will facilitate the flow of ideas between the
theoretical computer science, computational and core mathematics communities.

The research areas represented at the conference span a diverse array of topics
on the broad interface between mathematics and contemporary computation. The
agenda of the conference includes 20 workshops on a broad array of topics
including Approximation theory, Computational harmonic analysis, Computational
algebraic geometry, Stochastic computation, Computational dynamics,
Computational number theory, Combinatorics and intractability in computation,
Discrete Optimization, Continuous Optimization, Learning theory, Information-
based complexity, etc.
