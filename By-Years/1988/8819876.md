Humans and other higher animals must select relevant information from the huge
amount of data provided by the senses at every moment. The Bloughs' research
project seeks to clarify how this selective process, "attention," works in the
case of visual information. They chose the pigeon as their subject because it
has extremely good vision, unlike most small and inexpensive animals studied by
biologists and psychologists. The pigeon is an excellent animal model in which
to explore how the brain is able to interpret the visual world. Although most of
our understanding of perception and attention comes from studying humans, that
understanding is limited in a number of ways. Biological processes have always
been understood most deeply by comparing and contrasting them in different
species. Learning and motivation play a major role in attention, and researchers
can vary and control these factors in animal subjects. Attention may be simpler
and easier to understand in pigeons than in humans; humans use complex
strategies and thought processes that may obscure relatively simple mechanisms.
Above all, by using an animal subject, the Bloughs hope eventually to contribute
to the complete understanding of mental processes that will come only from
relating behavioral results directly to evidence from physiological experiments
in the same species. This understanding of neural processes is a major goal of
science and a necessary background for the treatment of behavioral and mental
disorders.
