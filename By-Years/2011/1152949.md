With this grant, the Chemical Synthesis Program is funding Professor James L.
Leighton of Columbia University to explore the use of silanes as Lewis acids in
the design of asymmetric nucleophilic imine addition reactions. Silicon is in
many ways the ideal element on which to base such a program - it is abundant and
inexpensive, and its derivatives are generally non-toxic and easily prepared
shelf-stable compounds. Its derivatives are also, however, chemically inert in
many instances, and the conceptual underpinning of the program is the
identification of ways to modify the silanes so that they display the desired
reactivity. The Leighton group will continue its efforts both to devise new and
better ways of inducing the desired reactivity in silanes and to elucidate the
mechanistic origin of the induced Lewis acidity.

Other major focuses of the project are the reactions themselves and the products
to which they allow access. Chiral carbinamines are of importance in drug
design, and the reagents and methods that have thus far emerged from this
program have found a commercial market and have been adopted by pharmaceutical
chemists, in the design, discovery, and scale-up phases of the drug candidate
evaluation process. Additionally, this project will provide sound practical and
mechanistic training for graduate and undergraduate students, including those
from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.
