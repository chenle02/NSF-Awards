9309359 Brooks The objective of this Research Initiation Award is to develop
improved methods to extract maximal information about cardiac electrical
activity from non-invasive measurements on the torso surface. Both time-domain
and frequency domain characterizations will be used to develop realistic
constraints for a refined inverse solution. This research is important since it
has the potential to substantially improve noninvasive diagnosis of
cardiovascular disease. The research may also have applications in solving other
inverse problems in other areas that are ill- conditioned. ***
