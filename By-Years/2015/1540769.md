In recognition of the national shortage of STEM teachers, especially in high
needs schools, collaborators at the University of Houston-Downtown have designed
a Noyce Teaching Fellows (TF) project to increase the number of highly qualified
science and math teachers in at-risk schools in the greater Houston area. A
complementary goal of this project will be to increase the supply of dual credit
STEM teachers. The project will facilitate the transition of 20 STEM
professionals into teaching careers through a program of coursework and
professional development featuring (a) a Masters of Arts in Teaching (b) field
experiences with teacher/leaders, (c) classroom observations, and (d) an online,
professional community of practice.

This project, led by STEM faculty and collaborators from the Urban Education
Department, relies on current research on teacher preparation related to
improving their ability to thrive in high-needs urban schools with diverse
learners and to cope with standard issues that such schools face. It also takes
advantage of current trends for creating online learning communities and
training high school instructors to teach college-level courses. Formative
evaluation will involve the assessment of the TF's progress throughout the
project, regarding their perceived competence and self-efficacy, certification
test scores, and results of observations by faculty, mentors and principals.
Summative assessment will also include the impact of TF's teaching on student
achievement scores and career interest. Results will be presented at conferences
and meetings of professional societies such as the National Science teachers
Association and the Association of Science-Technology Centers.
