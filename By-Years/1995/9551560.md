The project is designed to increase the involvement of undergraduate sociology
students in research. Using MicroCase software on a portable microcomputer with
high quality projection equipment, instructors test student-generated hypotheses
in 11 substantive and methodological sociology classes. Students also
participate in research by doing assignments and writing term papers that
involve testing hypotheses using microcomputers located in a Social Science
Computer Cluster. The faculty coordinates in selecting software so that the same
software is used across several courses. For the first year and in lower-
division courses, simple software, such as MicroCase, is being used. In upper-
division courses, software such as SPSS-Windows, PC Globe, and U.S. Census
software for the CD-ROM is being used. This project funds the purchase of the
computers, software, and projection equipment that is necessary. Involving
students in research across the entire curriculum is important because (a)
students retain more of the content of the courses, since they are active
learners; (b) students are challenged to think critically, and (c) students gain
experience and training they can use in a variety of occupations as professional
sociologists.
