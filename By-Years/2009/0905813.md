This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009
and is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public
Law 111-5). The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host
laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in
biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to
Zomary Flores is "Role of methionine sulfoxide reductases in the oxidative
stress response of Vibrio fischeri and Euprymna scolopes light organ
colonization." The host institution for this research is the University of
Georgia under the sponsorship of Dr. Eric Stabb.

Humans, animals, and plants interact with microbes throughout their life. Some
of these interactions may be beneficial or harmful to the host's health. Host-
derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in the maintenance of
beneficial and pathogenic microbial infections as they can cause protein,
membrane, and DNA damage in the microbe. The bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio
fischeri forms a natural symbiosis with the bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes).
This interaction is an important model for more complex and less well-defined
beneficial animal-microbe interactions. This research focuses on a protein
repair system from V. fischeri, called methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr).
Specifically, the results clarify the roles of Msr in the bacterium's ROS
resistance, bioluminescence, and host interaction. In addition, proteins
targeted by this repair system in V. fischeri are being identified.

Training objectives of this research include developing and expanding laboratory
technical skills. Host-microbe interactions play important roles in host health,
so further understanding of the mechanisms that are involved in maintenance of
these beneficial infections is critical for understanding plant, animal, and
human health. This research contributes to understanding host-associated microbe
resistance to host-defenses and provides insight into the behavior of microbes
that form persistent pathogenic infections. Broader impacts also include
mentoring undergraduate students from underrepresented groups.
