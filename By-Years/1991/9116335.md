The focus of this research is to synthesize structurally intriguing molecules.
Particular emphasis will be placed on constructing systems wherein cyclobutane
sigma orbitals can relay pi-electronic information from two sectors rigidly
arranged in orthogonal fashion. Other targets include
biscyclooctatetraenophanes, beltenes and a semibullvalene having a neutral
homoaromatic ground state. Studies on the limits of neighboring group
participation on classical first order substitution reactions will also be
carried out as will research on the catalytic role of Group 4 transition metal
complexes in asymmetric synthesis. %%% With this accomplishment based renewal
award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Leo A.
Paquette of the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University. Dr. Paquette
will focus his work on the synthesis of structurally intriguing polycyclic
molecules whose electronic and reactivity characteristics test the limits of
existing theoretical models.
