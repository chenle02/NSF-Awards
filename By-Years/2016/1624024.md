This is a proposal to analyze the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) in order
to bring to light important ways in which infrastructures adapt to changing
scientific and social knowledge, and how such knowledge changes the way the
object of study is understood. The researcher will use both archival and
ethnographic research methods in carrying out the analysis.

The results of this research will be of interest not only to scientists
interested in the relatively recent history of HIV/AIDS, but also political
scientists, sociologists, organizational theory experts, and a wide-range of
health policy experts. The results of the study will have substantial potential
to impact science policy by providing insights for improving the design of
future research infrastructure investments.
