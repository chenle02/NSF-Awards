An international workshop, "The Measurement of Dissolved Organic Carbon in
Natural Waters," will be convened in late spring of 1991 to critically compare
currently available methods for the quantification of DOC in natural waters.
Specifically, this workshop will address recent evidence that high-temperature
catalytic oxidation (HTCO) techniques measure a major component of DOC in
natural waters that is not quantified by conventional UV/persulfate (UV/PP
methods. The main goals of the workshop will be to: (1) define consistent trends
among DOC measurements by HTCO versus UV/P and other methods (based both on
existing data and results for a small set of representative samples analyzed by
workshop participants; (2) critically evaluate procedures for collecting,
processing and preserving water samples for DOC analysis; (3) identify possible
mechanisms for consistent differences in DOC measurements (as they relate both
to handling and analytical methodology; and (4) recommend guidelines for future
research on problems related to accurate DOC quantification as well as interim
procedures for DOC measurements in ongoing field studies. Considerations will
also be given to that analogous measurement of dissolved organic nitrogen.
