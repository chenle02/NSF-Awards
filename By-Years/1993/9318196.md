9318196 Battelle The Whitney Laboratory, a research institute of the University
of Florida, was established in 1974 and is dedicated to the use of marine
animals as experimental models for the study of basic processes in cell- and
neurobiology. This mission is augmented by a teaching program that provides
practical research training using marine organisms to investigators at all
career levels from established scientists to high school students. Because of
the cell biological emphasis of research at the Whitney Laboratory, we rely
heavily on the techniques of anatomy, biophysics, and biochemistry and, most
recently, molecular genetics. The expertise and specific research interests of
the faculty at the Whitney Laboratory are diverse, but all of our work falls
within the common themes of cell signalling and molecular evolution. Central to
the research efforts of all groups at the Laboratory is our molecular genetics
core facility that was established in 1989. The current and growing importance
of the tools of molecular genetics and modern protein chemistry in the research
effots of the Whitney Laboratory has produced a critical need for an image
analysis system that will permit us to efficiently analyze the results of
biochemical and molecular biological experiments. For this reason we are
requesting funds to purchase an electriphoresis analyzer system that will be
centrally located in the Laboratory so it can be used conveniently by all
research groups. This system is essential to the continued success of many of
our NSF-funded research programs. Without it, many of our on-going projects will
be slowed significantly, and other critical projects simply will not get off the
ground. ***
