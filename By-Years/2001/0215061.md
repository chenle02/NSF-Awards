This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
accurate measurement of the composition and microphysics of atmospheric aerosols
that have significant implications for global and regulatory environmental
issues. This project would replace the quadrupole mass-spectrometer (QMS) with a
compact time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS). This would enable the
measurement of complete chemical composition on a particle by particle basis.
Key to this is the electronic and data acquisition system, which will make semi-
continuous TOFMS practical computationally. The Phase I project will lead to the
construction of a prototype instrument that will have unique capabilities for
real time monitoring of ambient aerosol chemistry and microphysics. Moreover,
the coupling of high efficiency EI to the compact TOFMS will have many other
potential mass spectrometric applications.&lt;br/&gt;The commercial market for
the existing aerosol mass spectrometer includes government and educational
research labs, and may expand to include regulatory monitoring efforts and
process industrial laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;
