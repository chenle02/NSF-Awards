The PI will perform theoretical studies of the high pressure properties of
candidate mantle and core phases in order to better constrain the chemistry and
mineral composition of the mantle and core. Several important and basic
questions will be addressed, including: 1) phase transitions in SiO2 stishovite
that would lead to extreme shear elastic softening, 2) possible high temperature
phase transitions in MgSiO3, 3) bonding characteristics of iron in search for
new candidate high pressure-high temperature phases.
