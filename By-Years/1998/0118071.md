Abstract of OCE-0 118071; "Physical and Chemical constraints on fluxes at LExEn
and proposed ODP sites in the Gulf of Mexico"

The proposed project will focus on unraveling the dynamics of the gas hydrate
reservoir at and between moderate and high flux sites. Through 1.) direct
measurement of fluid flux with osmotic flux meters, 2) acquisition of high
resolution heat flow data, 3) use of porewater and solid-phase proxies for gas
flux and 4) imaging of flux conduits with high-resolution, deep-tow Chirp
profiles, the study will constrain spatial and temporal variations in fluxes
critical to the formation and long-term stability of gas hydrates. The results
provide a test of the hypothesis that quantifiable spatial variations in energy,
fluid and gas flux are related to observable changes in the distribution of free
gas and gas hydrate. The study sites coincide with two sites chosen for focused
microbiological research as part of an NSF funded Life in Extreme Environments
project. The study sites also coincide with two sites proposed for Gulf of
Mexico gas hydrates drilling and the project will provide additional site survey
data for the proposed drilling.
