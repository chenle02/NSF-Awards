Proof-of-concept tests of a complete computer-based course covering the
standard material in the AB Advanced Placement Calculus Syllabus will be
undertaken in two settings where the same computer-based technology can be used
as solutions to different problems. (1) Middle schools with mathematically
precocious students. (2) Colleges or Universities where students use the
computer program for problem solving and tutorial help. The computer-based
course makes extensive use of graphics, interactive on-line problem solving, and
interactive expository techniques appropriate to the level and complexity of the
calculus. On-line problem solving and exercises are supported by a symbolic
computation environment called the Equational Derivation System in which
students construct solutions to problems step by step using natural mathematical
operations. The REDUCE computer algebra system is used as an internal algebra
engine by this program. The effectiveness of these main components of the course
will be evaluated. The program runs on UNIX-based color graphics workstations.
