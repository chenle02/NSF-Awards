Professor Yan will continue his research into multivariable spectral theory
through the approach of Hilbert modules. The goal is to apply methods from
algebraic geometry, homological algebra, and complex geometry. He will study
topological and algebraic invariants of Hilbert modules, the structures of C*-
algebras associated with natural Hilbert modules and the spectral theory of
subnormal modules. Professor Yan's work involves the theory of C* algebras. The
notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of a family of linear
transformations on a space. These transformations can also be thought of as
having values in the states of the space, and the property of this family which
is responsible for the symbol * is that the algebra is generated by
transformations whose values in these states are real numbers. The fact that
these objects appear naturally in many branches of mathematics and physics make
them important to study.
