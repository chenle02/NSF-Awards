Particulate material which is exposed to moisture typically has the surface of
each particle coated with a thin film of water. It is often necessary to remove
this water before the material can be used. The water may contain dissolved
substances which are important to recover. Drying and recovery are tedious and
expensive operations. A new technique shows that surfactants spreading at the
air-water interface in such "unsaturated" porous media drag a significant amount
of water with them. This water movement occurs with essentially no external
energy input. The criteria for surfactant effectiveness in moving thin water
films are different from bulk systems, and are not understood. The objectives of
this research are to understand and optimize water transport by surfactant
spreading. Definitive experiments will be conducted using classical surface
chemistry techniques available in the laboratory. The work will shed new light
on the character of water at interfaces, and on thin film properties in general.
It has direct applications to room temperature drying or de-watering
stabilization of building foundations without mechanical tamping of the earth,
and underground mining and environmental cleanup without expensive excavation.
