The Younger Dryas climate event is important in earth history because it is a
rapid reversal in climate change that occurred without any known, direct
external forcing. Thus it is the best example of the earth's internal feedbacks
causing climate change. At present, the effects of the Younger Dryas cooling
event are poorly known in many parts of the world. The purpose of this research
is to determine the timing and climatological effects of this event in Minnesota
and Wisconsin. The PI will use annually-laminated lake sediments to precisely
date the timing of this vegetation change. Then the PI will evaluate the pollen
in the cores to determine the changes in temperature and precipitation that
accompanied the climatic event. Given the possibility of internal feedbacks
altering the effects of future greenhouse warming, it is important to study this
past example in order to better predict future changes in climate.
