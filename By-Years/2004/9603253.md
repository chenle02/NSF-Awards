The goal of this collaboration between the PI and Peter Markwich of the
Technische UniversitÂªt in Berlin is to advance the state of mathematical
modeling to accommodate the rapid advances in miniaturization of semiconductor
devices. The computer simulations derivable from the mathematical models are
used to optimize process and device parameters, thereby reducing the number of
faulty chips, and increasing throughput on the assembly line. Some existing
models are unable to describe all of the features of cutting- edge technologies,
while others are too complex computationally to be practical. This proposal
seeks to use a linkage of models using techniques of asymptotic analysis. The
research will yield new, hybrid models which represent a compromise between
physical relevance and computational feasibility.
