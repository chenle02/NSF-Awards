Africa appears to be the place in which our earliest ancestors evolved. While
the original discoveries of these earliest hominids were made in South Africa,
most of the recent discoveries have been in East Africa. There are nonetheless
many sites in South Africa which are potential sources of fossils which could
shed light on a multitude of exceptionally important questions related to the
early stages of our evolution. For instance, we are uncertain as to the ages of
the South African fossils known to date, their relationship to the East African
materials, the numbers of species represented, the tool- manufacturing
capabilities of the South Africans etc. All of these are of clear importance in
elucidating human evolution. Yet, looking for fossiliferous sites is a truly
risky undertaking. Sites may be searched in vain for years on end and thus
programs are hesitant to invest in projects which have a limited likelihood of
"paying off." The current proposal requests funds to survey a region of South
Africa which is known to contain limestone deposits of the appropriate age. No
systematic survey of these deposits has yet been undertaken and the PI intends
to determine which breccias have indications of bearing fossils, more precise
ages of the deposits. The PI has done some prior work in an area to the north
and east. There are reasonable geological and paleontological reasons to think
that the caves here to be investigated may prove to be fossiliferous.
