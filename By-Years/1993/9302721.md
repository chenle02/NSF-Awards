Xu 9302721 This project concerns applications of the theory of special functions
to problems of quadrature. Quadrature is a term given to methods of integration,
especially numerical. It has been highly developed in one dimension with tools
such as the Gaussian quadrature formula. The present work seeks to carry out
numerical integration through methods of cubature in several dimensions. The
generalization is far from straightforward. The quadratures and cubatures
require knowledge of orthogonal polynomials, particularly with common roots. In
the multidimensional case, orthogonal polynomials with common roots were thought
to be rare. However recent work now establishes that there are many Gaussian
cubatures. The purpose of this work is to use the newly developed tools to
investigate this topic further. Several goals are established. First, to obtain
applicable characterization of Gaussian cubatures, then to construct new
efficient numerical integration formulae. Work will also be done applying the
cubature formulae to the theory of interpolation in several variables. The use
of orthogonal polynomials in numerical integration provides formulas which are
optimal in the sense of being exact for polynomials of the highest possible
degree. As such they provide good approximations to integrals of smooth
functions. The recent breakthroughs in carrying these ideas over to several
variables holds out the possibility of a robust multivariate cubature and
approximation theory in several variables, a subject still in its infancy. ***
