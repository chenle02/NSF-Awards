While it has been known for centuries that some plants inhibit the growth of
neighboring plants through chemicals released into the soil, virtually nothing
is known about the genetic or molecular mechanisms associated with subterranean
interactions between plants. This is due in large part to the difficulty of
assaying the effects of underground chemical signal transferred between
different plants. The clearest manifestations of how one plant can alter the
growth and development of a second are displayed by parasitic plants. Parasitic
plants in the Orobanchaceae directly invade the roots of nearby host plants in
order to rob them of water and nutrients. These parasites recognize potential
host plants using certain molecules released by host roots as identification
signals. One of the morphologically obvious changes to parasitic plant roots
exposed to host root signals is the development of haustoria, parasite specific
root organs that function in host attachment, penetration, and nutrient transfer
from host to parasite. Haustorium development is rapid, highly synchronous,
completely dependent on external host factors, and can be readily monitored in
vitro. Molecular genetic approaches are being taken to determine how root
factors from host plants triggers the development of haustoria in the parasite
Triphysaria, a spring time annual wildflower common throughout the Pacific Coast
and closely related to the devastating parasitic weeds Striga and Orobanche.
Surveys of natural populations and subsequent genetic analyses demonstrated the
existence of heritable variation in host factor recognition within interbreeding
populations. The expression of a candidate set of host recognition genes is
being compared in parasitic and closely related non-parasitic plants to identify
genetic pathways specific for haustorium development. Exposing Triphysaria roots
to either purified haustorium-inducing factors or structurally related, non-
active molecules will further define these processes. In addition to determining
the evolutionary origins of how novel plant organs arise, this work should lead
to the development of biologically based strategies for controlling unwanted
weeds.
