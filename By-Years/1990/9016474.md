A long-baseline spatial interferometer for the 10 microns wavelength region
using two movable 1.65 m telescopes has recently been completed and installed on
Mount Wilson. Baselines have been laid out for distances up to 35 m; they can be
extended in some directions to about 100 m. Although in the long run an
extensive and varied observational program can be carried out, present
observations emphasize an intensive study of the structure of dust shells around
stars, their change with time, and the sizes and changes in the disks of stars
obscured at visable wavelengths. Support is requested for some improvements to
the system to facilitate work on stars with weak emission at visible
wavelengths, to enhance the precision and facility with which data on
visibilities can be taken, and to provide better facilities to analyze the
substantial amount of data which is produced.
