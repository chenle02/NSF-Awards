The project concerns questions in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.
Algebraic geometry is the study of algebraic varieties, which are solution sets
for systems of polynomial equations. For example, in the xy-plane, the solutions
for y=0 consist of all points along the x-axis, while the solutions for xy=0
consist of all points along both coordinate axes. Since the tangent line at the
origin (0,0) is not defined for the algebraic variety defined by xy=0, we say
that this variety has a singularity at the origin (0,0). The first goal of the
present project is to further develop the theory of singularities of algebraic
varieties and more general objects. The second goal is to build the tools and
techniques necessary for this research program, which would have applications to
other fundamental open questions in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.

The research will investigate singularities of algebraic varieties over
arbitrary fields, or more generally of arbitrary Noetherian rings and schemes.
Even when the primary interest is in non-singular complex algebraic varieties,
working in this much more general context is often unavoidable. A major focus in
the present project is to build the foundations necessary for birational
geometry and the minimal model program for schemes of arbitrary characteristic.
In previous work, the PI proved that Kodaira-type vanishing theorems hold for
schemes in equal characteristic zero of arbitrary dimension and developed new
methods to replace Kodaira-type vanishing theorems in positive characteristic.
In the present project, the PI will apply the techniques from this previous work
to study the behavior of singularities under flat morphisms. The PI will also
investigate inversion of adjunction-type results for various classes of
singularities. Finally, the PI plans to extend techniques in positive
characteristic to study positivity of line bundles on algebraic varieties over
arbitrary fields.
