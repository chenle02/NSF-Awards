Devinder Mahajan &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal request seeks funding to
establish a multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
(I/UCRC) for Bioprocessing Research and Development (CBRD). The proposed center
is comprised of six universities, and is focused to make transformative
discoveries to enable the lignocellulosic and fats and oil based bio-industries
meet the challenges set forth by the US President, federal and state agencies
and the American public. The research proposed is highly consistent with the
USDA and DOE roadmaps and well integrated with the Sun Grant centers. The topic
is timely and very crucial to the US, with strong academic and industry
interest. The proposed research is highly interactive and multi-institutional,
and has strong potential to be transformative through new discoveries.
Universities participating in the proposed center have identified six initial
research foci, and each of these focus areas will be addressed through numerous
research projects. Additionally, the focus of the proposed center will be on
activities that support and extend recent advances made by industrial
partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CBRD is positioned to make transformative
discoveries that enable the lignocellulosic and oil and fats based bio-
industries to meet the challenge of declining petroleum supply. The wide range
of institutions and projects proposed present numerous mechanisms for broader
impact. The proposed center will serve as an educational environment, to fill
the workforce pipeline with engineers and scientists needed to make use of these
opportunities. This center will also provide a network of information flow to
the public sector: involve K-12 outreach activities and involvement from
minority participation throughout the country. It Is anticipated that the center
will have direct participation from tribal colleges and historically black
colleges and universities. Technology transfer is well addressed in the center
plan.
