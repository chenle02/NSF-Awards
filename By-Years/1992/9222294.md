ABSTRACT Five structural linguistic features give strong promise of being
useful as genetic markers, i.e. of having sufficient diachronic stability,
resistance to borrowing, and independence from other structural properties that
they can point to deeper genetic relatedness between families of the greatest
age now reachable by the standard comparative method. All five are abstract
properties of the verbal lexicon, realized in verbal derivations, verbal
inflection, and text frequencies of valence patterns and derivational types.
This project will trace the five features through 120 or more languages (using a
pre-existent worldwide sample, genetically based at a controlled time depth) and
survey a dozen language families and three high-diversity language areas in much
more depth. This data base will suffice to establish the degree of variation of
these features within language families, the extent of borrowing between
families in contact situations, and any statistically significantly correlations
between these features and standard typologically relevant features (already
surveyed in previous work). The anticipated result will be a demonstration that
these features are useful genetic markers, demonstration of their structural
independence from other features and of their usefulness in typology, and
concrete hypotheses of deeper genetic relatedness between certain language
families, chiefly of northern Eurasia.
