Fundamental for the sense of smell is the molecular binding of odorant
molecules to appropriate receptor molecules in chemosensory organs. Molecular
techniques recently have allowed identification of the genes encoding odorant
binding proteins in the vertebrate nose, but we know very little about such
genes in invertebrates. Insects have highly sophisticated chemosensory antennae
for detecting odorants, but we know very little yet about the molecular
receptors used by insects, to compare with vertebrate olfaction. This project
uses molecular biology and antibody labeling techniques to isolate the genes for
olfactory receptors in the model system of a moth antenna. Results will be
extremely important for understanding insect olfaction, and so have will impact
beyond neuroscience to evolutionary and environmental biology and to
agriculture.
