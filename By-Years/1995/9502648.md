9502648 DiMilla This project is on research to study cell-biomaterial
interactions. The elements of this research include: (1) the synthesis of
polysiloxanes in which the rheological properties will be systematically varied;
(2) the further alteration of this media by fibronectin adsorption, or the
incorporation of biologically active peptides; (3) the measurement of the
motility, morphology, and proliferation of adherent glioblastoma cells on these
materials; and (4) the development of a mathematical model to describe the
influence of surface mechanical properties on cell behavior. In addition to this
research activity, the investigator will enhance education by developing a new
course, and eventually a book, on the engineering analysis of cell and tissue
systems. ***
