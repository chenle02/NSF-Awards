Dr. Kohler is examining the history of Drosophila and Drosophila geneticists as
an example of the history of experimental practice. He is exploring four key
ideas. First, "standard" experimental organisms can be understood as constructed
technological artifacts. Second, experimental practices are shaped by tacit
moral rules that govern the ownership and sharing of tools, resources, ideas and
credit. Third, these "moral economies" of practice are embodied in
institutionalized career patterns. Fourth, experimental practice in biology
often involves a dynamic interaction between laboratory and field, domesticated
and wild organisms and work styles. Dr. Kohler is using these four themes to
explore five closely related topics: the initial construction of Drosophila as a
genetic instrument by the Morgan school; the operations and tacit rules of the
mutant exchange network which defined Drosophilists as a community of
practitioners; the diversification of Drosophila from an instrument for
chromosome mapping into a multi-purpose instrument; and the invention by George
W. Beadle and Theodosius Dobzhansky of new modes of practice in developmental
and evolutionary genetics. These case studies are being used to develop concepts
and methods that may be applied to experimental practice in any discipline of
natural science. The aim is an empirically based, integrated account of
experimental practice: one that may make science understandable to non-
specialists not as a finished product but as a dynamic and evolving process of
production.
