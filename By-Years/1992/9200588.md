This project, sponsored jointly by the Chemistry Division (Experimental Physical
Chemistry) and the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (Biochemistry
and Molecular Structure and Function), is devoted to understanding primary
photochemical processes in photosynthesis. Professors Fleming and Mets (Univ. of
Chicago) will perform genetic modification of purple bacteria and of higher
plants, obtaining modified reaction centers which are suitable for ultrafast
(femtosecond) laser spectroscopic studies. The electronic and vibrational
dephasing times obtained from these measurements will be used with appropriate
theory to build up a complete molecular description of the photosynthetic unit.
%%% Understanding the chemical mechanisms by which plants convert sunlight into
energy (photosynthesis) is a problem of outstanding technological importance as
well as fundamental scientific interest. The very early steps in this process,
in which light first strikes the plant and is somehow trapped, occur so fast
that light itself has time to travel less than 0.00001 feet before the trapping
event is over. Professors Fleming and Mets (University of Chicago) will
genetically engineer plants with special pigments suitable for performing
ultrafast spectroscopic measurements of the primary chemical reactions. This
will permit a complete molecular description of the photosynthetic unit.
