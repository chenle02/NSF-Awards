The project is concerned with the continuation of the author's research efforts
toward the development of a general theory for the design of nonlinear feedback
control systems. Such a theory would be highly instrumental for the design of
modern control systems for industrial robots and production equipment, for
flight control systems, space vehicles, missile control systems, tracking
devices, and many other applications in modern engineering.
