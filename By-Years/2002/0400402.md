This proposal includes three topics for investigation, in the framework of
overlap&lt;br/&gt;fermions. These topics are:&lt;br/&gt;(i) QCD in the large N
limit, The PI has made very important contributions to the&lt;br/&gt;development
of the overlap method to deal with chiral fermions in lattice field
theory.&lt;br/&gt;The present proposal is to implement this method in lattice
QCD in the limit of a large&lt;br/&gt;number of colors. This work is technically
very challenging and will lead to a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of
theoretical and computational issues surrounding chiral fermions
and&lt;br/&gt;large N QCD.&lt;br/&gt;(ii) Chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, and
(iii) Cancellation of gauge anomalies in chiral gauge theories.
