This Phase I CCI will explore promising molecular materials for spintronics:
diamagnetic metal complexes of phthalocyanines, bistable paramagnetic molecules,
and semiconducting oligomers. The highly integrated research program will
include synthesis and characterization, detailed surface structure and bonding
studies, spin injection and transport measurements, and computational modeling.
The initial goals of the interdisciplinary team of researchers are to elucidate
the structure-spintronic property relationships of paramagnetic complexes and
also to study how the electronic structure and magneto-electronic structures of
these molecules are influenced by integration into solid state
environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Molecular Spintronics will
develop new coursework in the emerging field of molecular spintronics. Students
and postdoctoral researchers trained in this interdisciplinary (chemistry,
physics, materials science) environment will be prepared to be scientific
leaders in this field. The Center for Molecular Spintronics will partner with
the local and regional companies to ensure that this science can be incorporated
into the next generation of molecular electronics and nanotechnology
innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI)
Program supports research centers that can address major, long-term fundamental
chemical research challenges that have a high probability of both producing
transformative research and leading to innovation. These Centers will attract
broad scientific and public interest by sharing the results of their innovative
approach to this challenging question.
