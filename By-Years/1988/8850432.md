The goal of this three-year project is the revitalization of high school
geometry under a model in which the university gradually transfers to the
schools the responsibility for curriculum development. Under the guidance of the
district's mathematics supervisor, a university mathematics educator, and a
research geometer, 16 high school mathematics teachers from a school district in
Northern California will study new topics in geometry and related classroom
activities and will develop 24 curriculum modules. Throughout the course of the
project, the participants will meet for two hours per day with the project
staff. Printed materials and videotapes will be used for dissemination, and the
evaluation will assess the project's effect on teachers' knowledge of geometry,
their teaching skills, and their students. An amount equal to 25% of the NSF
award is being contributed as cost- sharing by the Campbell Union School
District.
