Brown University will purchase advanced, state-of-the-art workstations to
populate a unique classroom laboratory for computer science instruction. This
laboratory will use advanced software, now under development, to provide a
consistent visual programming environment to undergraduates from their first,
introductory programming course, through the most advanced software engineering
course or independent study. This environment will significantly improve the
teaching of computer science and will affect the whole undergraduate curriculum.
The unique feature of the proposed environment is a set of integrated tools for
program and data structure visualization. These tools will enable students to
visualize concepts and the programs that embody them throughout their
undergraduate experience. A simple, "read-only" version of the system BALSA, has
been used at Brown successfully for four years and has already had a significant
impact on their curriculum. The system envisioned, not only will provide more
powerful visualization tools, including color and real-time animation of three-
dimensional representations, but also will allow the student to interact with
visualizations during the course of a lecture as well as during the
implementation of the student's own programs.
