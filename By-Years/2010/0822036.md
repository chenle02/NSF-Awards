The objective of this research is to study fundamental and applied aspects of
novel devices based on molecular self assembly at the surface of organic
semiconductors that exhibit remarkable electronic properties, such as high
electrical conductivity and chemical sensing. The approach is to perform growth
of aligned 2D layers of polar molecules at organic surfaces, leading to a
surface-restricted doping of organic semiconductors and to utilize these devices
in development of novel chemical sensors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
merit of this Project consists of (a) understanding the electronic properties of
these self-assembled monolayers on organic semiconductors by investigating their
nanoscale structure and surface conductivity, and (b) paving the road to novel
chemically selective sensors based on this system. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact
of the Project is the underpinning of several cutting-edge technologies crucial
for our society, such as flexible electronics, semiconductor physics, sensors
and nanotechnology. The interdisciplinary nature of the Project provides
excellent educational and outreach opportunities. Undergraduate and graduate
students will be exposed to the state-of-the-art tools of modern semiconductor
research. The skills learned by the students in this Project are highly
marketable and will serve as a valuable asset for employment in industrial,
governmental or academic institutions. The focus of the proposed research on
novel semiconductor devices will help to achieve the main educational goal of
the Program: teaching the students experimental skills of semiconductor research
and incorporation of modern topics on Semiconductor Physics in the graduate
curriculum. Proposed research is therefore closely integrated with the
educational component of the Project.&lt;br/&gt;
