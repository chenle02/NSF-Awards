The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Office of
Opportunities in Science (OOS), is requesting $9,720 from the NSF for support of
a meeting on "Middle School Mathematics: A Meeting of the Minds." This meeting
is scheduled for June 11-12 at the AAAS headquarters in Washington, D.C. The
purpose is to bring together mathematicians, mathematics educators,
representatives of community-based organizations and experts on early adolescent
development to discuss the problems and possibilities of impacting the
mathematics learning of middle school students, particularly minority, women,
and disabled students. The findings of this meeting will be published as a AAAS
occasional report and will be distributed to mathematics- based organizations,
researchers, educators, community-based organizations, policy makers, and
business leaders. NSF's support will be acknowledged in this publication.
