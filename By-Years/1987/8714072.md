The PI will synthesize and characterize new transition metal compounds with
quasi-low-dimensional properties. Systems of interest include ternary reduced
molybdenum oxide phases, phosphate tungsten bronzes and their molybdenum
substituted analogs, ternary transition metal chalcogenides, and high
temperature superconducting materials. Particular emphasis will be placed on the
preparation of single crystal specimens to study the structural and orientation
dependent physical properties. Transitions associated with the onset of charge-
density waves and/or superconductivity will be sought and characterized. These
studies will yield new materials with metallic and high temperature
superconducting properties, and provide fundamental insight on the mechanism of
electronic transport in quasi-low- dimensional compounds.
