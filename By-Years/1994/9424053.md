DMS-9424053 PI: Collingwood The proposed research will investigate the
connection between the singularity theory of Harish-Chandra modules and the
matrix coefficient asymptotics of Harish-Chandra modules. The first step is to
link the existence of global Whittaker models, the structure of cell
representations of the Weyl group, the theory of nilpotent orbits and the
structure of Jacquet modules. Next one uses recursive algorithm to compute the
weight filtration of any degenerate series. Finally, relating the PI's earlier
work on smooth embeddings with the embeddings of Matsuki-Oshima, one obtains
better understanding of the embeddings of irreducible representations into
principal series representations. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of
the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in
twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the
symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had
a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number
theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
elementary particle physics.
