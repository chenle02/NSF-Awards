This award is for support of the Third International Conference on Women in
Physics to take place in Seoul, Korea, in October 2008. The workshop is planned
and organized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP)
through its Working Group on Women in Physics. The workshop has three main
goals: (i) to provide an opportunity to view and analyze of the current status
of and progress in promoting women in physics in each country and
internationally; (ii) to provide an arena for women in physics to share their
scientific accomplishments and create international scientific collaborations;
and (iii) to build capacity in each participating country to design and
implement changes that improve the participation and advancement of women in
physics.
