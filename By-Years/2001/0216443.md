This award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will enable the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at The University of Texas in Austin to
acquire a Raman microscope/nanoscope. With these new capabilities, faculty will
carry out the following investigations: a) semiconductor materials
characterization; b) quantum confinement in group IV nanostructures; c)
compositional studies of advanced photoresists; d) nanoscale compositional
mapping of nanostructured materials for electrochemical energy
conversion/storage; e) light-emitting polymers; f) characterization of polymer
micelles adsorbed on surfaces; g) the nanomechanics and interphase chemistry of
interfacial fracture; and h) Raman imaging as a diagnostic probe for cervical
cancer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optical and electron microscopy have informed
essentially every area of modern science and technology whereas the vibrational
spectroscopies (infrared and Raman) have been the most incisive probes of
structure and bonding in molecules and solids. Recent developments in
vibrational microscopy have made it possible to characterize materials on the
micron and submicron length scales, probing, for example, chemical composition,
crystalline phase, microcrystallite orientation and stress in both homogeneous
and heterogeneous samples. Raman microscopy has very high intrinsic spatial
resolution, and sample preparation is minimal. These studies will have a strong
impact in a wide variety of fields including microelectronics, optoelectronics
and polymer science.
