Indirect interactions among organisms are emerging as widespread, important
factors in many ecological communities. This research tests the general
hypothesis that phytophagous insects interact indirectly through strong effects
on the spatial dynamics of natural enemy activity. In particular, it assesses
whether aphids (typically among the most abundant and widespread of all
phytophagous insects in temperate ecosystems) influence spatial variation in the
intensity of parasitism of other insects; parasitoids may accumulate in local
areas, and increase their longevity and fecundity, by consuming aphid honeydew.
Insect communities of alfalfa provide an excellent test system. Field
experiments in alfalfa will test for indirect effects of pea aphids on the
alfalfa weevil, as mediated by a parasite wasp specific to the weevil, and as
influenced by natural enemies of the pea aphid (ladybeetles). Investigating the
web of indirect as well as direct interactions in alfalfa insect communities
provides opportunity not only to test for processes of general ecological
interest, but also to contribute to more effective management of alfalfa insect
pests.
