This research project is concerned with homotopy theory and how it impinges on
several related areas. Friedlander works on the interface of algebraic geometry
and algebraic topology. His investigations involve algebraic groups, algebraic
geometry and algebraic k-theory. The common theme is the exploitation of
relationships between algebraic geometry and homotopy theory. Priddy's current
interest is in the emerging area of homotopy theory which uses modular
representation theory and invariant theory. Stable splittings of spaces are an
important example of such applications. Mahowald's work is primarily in stable
homotopy theory and also in the unstable homotopy of spheres.
