The unique length and time scales characteristic of suspensions of charge
stabilized polymer spheres are exploited to study the basic equilibrium and
nonequilibrium properties of strongly interacting spherical particle systems.
Proposed experiments include optical microscopy, light scattering intensity
fluctuation spectroscopy, laser trapping of particles, x-ray and neutron
scattering, and digital image processing. Nonequilibrium studies will focus on
shear induced structure changes in suspension samples which form liquid-like and
crystal-like structures in equilibrium, the dynamics of the crystallization
process, and the glass transition. Equilibrium studies will investigate local
order, dynamics and phase transitions in one, two and three dimensions.
Theoretical studies including analog and molecular dynamic computer simulation
will continue, support and extend work on local liquid structure, and
nonequilibrium behavior.
