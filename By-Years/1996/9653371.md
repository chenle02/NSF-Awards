An Engineering Faculty Enhancement Workshop on: THE ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES OF
ENGINEERING DESIGN It is widely accepted that 70-80 percent of a product's total
costs over its life cycle are determined during conceptual/preliminary design.
Yet the impact of the design activity upon the ultimate success (or failure) of
a product is not fully integrated with economics in most engineering curricula
across the United States. The mission of this workshop is to address this
shortcoming by "educating the engineering educators" in how to integrate
economics and design in the undergraduate curriculum. Our central purpose,
therefore, is to provide a workshop to transfer knowledge regarding the
economics of engineering design to all engineering faculty who teach design-
intensive courses. This knowledge was gained, in part, from a three-year multi-
disciplinary, multi-institutional National Science Foundation grant entitled,
"Integration of Economic Principles with Design in the Engineering Science
Component of the Undergraduate Curriculum" (DUE-9155917). During 1996 two three-
day workshops and a one-day follow-on workshop were funded by NSF's UFE program.
In view of the strong reception for our 1996 workshops dealing with "The
Economic Principles of Engineering Design," we will offer two more workshops in
1997 (each 2 days in duration). Participation in each will be limited to 25
individuals in order to encourage dialog and in-depth interaction with the
workshop instructors. These workshops will be followed by a one-day colloquium
in 1998 during which teaching experiences and curricular issues associated with
courses presented in the workshop will be discussed by participants who have
implemented these ideas at their respective institutions.
