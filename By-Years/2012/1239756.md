Self-awareness is the capacity to comprehend that one exists as an individual,
separate from others and the environment. It is the highest cognitive function
and, interestingly, the least understood. Self-recognition in front of a mirror
has been used as an indicator of self-awareness in animals and young humans
because they cannot articulate what they perceive and experience.

Aside from humans, who start to recognize themselves in the mirror at about 18
months of age, mirror self-recognition has only been shown in species that
cannot be used for physiological studies of the function of the nervous system,
i.e., in primates chimpanzees and orangutans. Recently, however, we have shown
that rhesus monkeys, the animal model closest to humans available for
electrophysiological studies, are indeed able to recognize themselves in the
mirror despite failing the most traditional mirror self-recognition test, the
mark test (Rajala et al. 2010). This finding has cleared the way for the
investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying self-awareness. The similarity
of the monkey brain with the human will allow us to draw important parallels
between the two species. The studies will use a combination of behavioral
(oculomotor) and physiological techniques (single unit recordings from higher
order areas of the cerebral cortex) in awake, behaving rhesus monkeys. This
approach is expected to reveal the connection between the subjects'
psychophysical reports of self-awareness and the underlying neural substrate.

The broader impacts of the project will include educational and training
components from elementary to graduate school levels. Presentations about the
structure and function of the nervous system will be given at elementary and
high-school levels, and undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in
science through research opportunities in the laboratory.
