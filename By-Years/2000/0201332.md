Over the last decade there have been dramatic improvements in proton exchange
membrane (PEM) fuel cells that enabled fuel cell power to transcend from the
laboratory to experimental vehicles. However, the viability, efficiency, and
robustness of this technology depend on understanding, predicting, and
controlling the unique transient behavior of the Fuel Cell (FC) breathing
system. Although steady-state FC behavior is considered the normal operating
mode; start-up, shut-down, and sudden load changes are characteristic and
ubiquitous to all power producing devices. During all operating modes, our
ability to precisely control the reactant flow and pressure, stack temperature,
and membrane humidity is critical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To this end,
phenomenological models and robust control methodologies are developed to
address the subsystem conflicts and account for the nonlinear interactions and
constraints imposed by sensor fidelity and actuator authority. Insight and
rigorous metrics are provided for the vehicle power management and level of
hybridization with battery and/or ultra-capacitor. Finally, the impact of the
control architecture for the coordination of all the three electric power
sources (FC, battery, ultra-capacitor) with the traction motor inverter is
systematically analyzed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project allows students to
develop control theoretic tools for the highly interdisciplinary areas of FC
vehicles and power systems. Both of these technologies are important to our
national competitiveness and a sustainable environment.
