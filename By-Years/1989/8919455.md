This investigation will study the formation and early evolution of galaxies with
particular attention paid to how these processes are affected by the
environment. This will be done by observing old stellar populations in early
type galaxies and in our own galaxy. Recent work by this investigator has
suggested that star formation is truncated in early type galaxies in dense
cluster cores. This work will be greatly extended to confirm or modify this
result. In addition, his recent discovery that nearly half of the early type
galaxies in the nearby, dynamically young Pega- sus I cluster show clear signs
of recent star formation will be followed up to determine if this result can be
related to other workers observations of a similar effect much more distant
galaxy clusters. Finally, the results of these observations will be applied to
the case of our own galaxy, in trying to understand its collapse and early
chemical evolution.
