The thrust of this research is to understand the biology of deep-sea organisms
(especially the amphipod, Eurythenes gryllus, and the grenadier fish,
Coryphaenoides sp.), from the abyssopelagic region, and their role in the
cycling of carbon in the deep sea. Smith will continue development of a free
vehicle acoustical array for monitoring the movements of animals across
insonified boundaries above the abyssal sea floor. Emphasis will be placed on
determining target strength and improving the technology to estimate the flux of
carbon represented in the vertical migration of these animals, a phenomenon that
has been termed "active flux," and that may have considerable importance to the
energetics of deep-sea communities. One of the important goals will be to make
more accurate and representative estimates of organism chemical composition vis
a vis acoustical target strength under both controlled laboratory and field
conditions. The study will take place at a test station in the Santa Catalina
Basin and at an abyssal station in the central gyre of the N. Pacific.
