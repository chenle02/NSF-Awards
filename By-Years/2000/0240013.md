The ordered movement of chromosomes during meiotic cell division is essential to
the final development of the organism. In most instances, meiosis is comprised
of three basic cellular processes: pairing, recombination and segregation.
Pairing identifies homologs, recombination acts to lock them together, and
segregation moves them to opposite poles at the first meiotic division.
Establishing stable co-orientation requires a balancing of plateward and
poleward forces acting on the kinetochores. This balancing of forces is usually
achieved by chiasmata, the physical consequence of recombination. However, many
organisms also possess systems that ensure the segregation of chromosomes that
do not undergo recombination and the Drosophila female is one such organism. The
focus of this project is an analysis of the mechanisms that allow proper meiotic
segregation in the absence of chromosome exchange. NOD protein has been shown to
control the poleward movement of achiasmate homologs as the meiotic spindle
elongates during prometaphase. Preliminary data suggests that NOD has two
additional functions: 1) providing a plateward balancing force that facilitates
proper centromere coorientation; and 2) interlocking homologous chromosomes
during early prometaphase. It has also recently been learned that NOD appears to
be regulated extra-cellularly during meiotic prometaphase, perhaps via a cAMP-
dependent signal transduction system. The specific aims of this project are: 1)
Dissect the structure and regulation of the NOD protein. 2) Continue studies of
the Axs-transmembrane protein and its possible role in regulating the NOD
protein. 3) Genetically test the hypothesis that Nod plays a role in mediating
centromere coordination.

Failures in achiasmate segregation account for a high fraction of spontaneous
nondisjunction in fly and human oocytes. The observation that the protein(s)
responsible for achiasmate segregation may be regulated by hormonal cues
provides the first insight as to why achiasmate nondisjunction may increase with
advancing maternal age in human oocytes.
