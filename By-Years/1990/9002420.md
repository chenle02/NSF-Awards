This project continues work on modern aspects of Fourier analysis related to
wavelet theory, weighted inequalities for the Fourier transform and restriction
theorems for the transform. Weighted Fourier transform inequalities are
motivated by some of the central issues of signal processing. In linear system
theory, weights correspond to various filters in energy concentration problems.
Another area of application, prediction theory, weighted Lebesgue spaces arise
for weights corresponding to power spectra of stationary stochastic processes.
The object of the research is to obtain bounds on the q-th power norm of the
weighted Fourier transform in terms of the weighted p-th power norm of the
signal (original function). The program seeks best possible estimates. This
search gives rise to uncertainty principle inequalities; these provide natural
constraints for determining the effectiveness of spectrum estimation techniques
used in signal processing. The methods of wavelet theory play a basic role in
this activity. Initial efforts will focus on the special case of quadratic
(weighted) norms. Inequalities may be obtained when information concerning the
(integrals of) decreasing rearrangements of the weights can be computed. The
same condition obtains without rearranging the weights when the inequalities are
valid. What needs to be worked out is what happens between the necessary and
sufficient conditions. Techniques derived from balayage combined with atomic
decompositions of underlying tent spaces will be employed in efforts to clarify
the different conditions.
