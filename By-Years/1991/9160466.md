This work is to make available a high resolution, full color autostereoscipic
3-D display. With this design there is no need for the glasses, shutters or
polarizers which in the past have caused viewer discomfort and dimmed images.
The display is scalable in size, lightweight and environmentally stable. The
approach is based on a stationary multiplexed volume reflection holographics
screen and a simple conventional projection system. Three-color images are
received by each eye separately because of the construction of the screen. It
will be efficient and compatible with current output devices.
