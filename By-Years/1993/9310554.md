9310554 Wilk Around the world, the past is an increasingly contested terrain.
Historic and prehistoric remains play prominent roles in peoples' attempts to
define ethnic and national identities, at the same time that looting, illegal
trade, and site destruction are accelerating. Archaeology is coming under closer
public scrutiny and archaeologists today are more concerned about ethical
practice and accountability. There has been little research on the
archaeological enterprise, however. Although archaeology can promote cultural
preservation and sustainable community development, it can also fuel site
destruction and contribute to social conflict. The overall problem this project
addresses is the ethical relationship between archaeologists and the communities
where they work, particularly in foreign cultural settings, and the practical
ramifications of this relationship in the forms of looting, support for
preservation, and public perceptions of the past. This project will survey and
interview a broad sample of archaeologists, finding out about their views about
ethical standards and behavior, and asking about the ways they have conducted
their own field research. The survey will have three sections: one about
practice, how do archaeologists conduct themselves in the field in relation to
host communities; the second is an opinion survey aimed at eliciting
archaeologists' perceptions of minimal ethical behavior; and the third uses
scenarios to investigate the relationships between professional ethics and
broader social concerns for cultural integrity, autonomy, hierarchy, and
equality. The survey is expected to sample 300 to 500 archaeologists; telephone
interviews with 50 will provide further detailed information about cases
involving ethical concerns and conflicts. Results will provide documentation of
prevailing attitudes and practices among archaeologists, and ask if current
ethical standards and safeguards are sufficient. ***
