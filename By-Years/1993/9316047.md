9316047 Van Schmus The formation of Gondwana during late Precambrian to Early
Paleozoic times represents one of the major assemblies of a large continent in
geologic history. This event fused several Archean to Early Proterozoic cratonic
masses, continental fragments and marginal orogenic belts of Africa and South
America during the 600 My Pan African-Brasiliano orogeny. This project continues
efforts to define the crustal history of the Borborema Province in the
northeastern Brazilian shield prior to the formation of Gondwana by developing a
precise chronology for assembly of the diverse lithospheric elements. The data
obtained, along with studies underway by other groups in Brazil and Africa will
provide better understanding of the ancestry and assembly of western Gondwana.
