The objective of this project is to understand how compressed fluids influence
polymer morphology based on molecular interactions and phase behavior. Many
different polymers can be prepared into various physical forms through a variety
of processes using compressed or supercritical fluids. Structures include
microspheres, fibers, and foams as well as more unusual forms. Theoretical and
experimental thermodynamic studies are planned to examine polymer morphologies
and processes with compressed fluids. One part of the project involves
determining the effect of CO2 on glass transition temperature with supercritical
fluid chromatography. A prediction of retrograde vitrification of glassy
polymer, based on lattice fluid theory and the Gibbs- DiMarzio criterion for CO2
sorption and Tg, will be tested. Polymers are versatile materials which are
widely utilized in many commercial products. New physical forms can improve
performance and quality in existing applications or create new uses.
Applications anticipated for these materials range from new polymeric membranes
and chromatographic packings for separations to lightweight structural
components or even a matrix for artificial skin.***//
