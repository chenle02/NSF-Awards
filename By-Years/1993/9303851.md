9303851 Slingerland This study will investigate the processes of avulsion, i.e.,
the permanent diversion of flow away from an existing river channel, and the
role of avulsion in the evolution of river floodplains and alluvial sedimentary
deposits. The approach will be collaborative, focusing on mathematical modelling
experiments, and modern and near-modern river floodplains. The project will
attempt to address such questions as the causes of avulsion, the processes by
which avulsions initiate and propagate through flood basins, the manner in which
floodplains subsequently react to avulsion, and the effects of avulsion on the
character of floodplain deposits. Because avulsion is an inevitable consequence
of floodplain aggradation, it may play a vital, and heretofore underappreciated,
role int he evolution of alluvial sedimentary sequences because it is likely to
be a major process of deposition instead of merely a mechanism by which old
channels are abandoned and new ones formed. When properly understood, avulsions
may require modifications in the way we view the origin and role of meander
belts, the relative importance of avulsive vs overbank flooding, and the manners
in which floodplain deposits are generated.
