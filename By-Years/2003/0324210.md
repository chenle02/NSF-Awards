The project provides a total of 107 annual scholarships (214 semester
scholarships) for students pursuing associate degrees in Computer Engineering
Technology, Electrical Engineering Technology, Electronics Engineering
Technology, Engineering Science, and Electronics Technology. The project targets
students with financial need who have demonstrated aptitude and potential in
these disciplines. The principal objectives of the program include increasing
full time enrollment in the engineering and technology programs, reducing the
average time required for degree completion, improving student retention,
enhancing and expanding the college's present education to employment (E2E)
transition program, and boosting the enrollment and graduation of female and
minority students. Building upon the college's established internship program,
the project also provides additional part-time internship opportunities provided
by local industry and government during the school year, mentoring for job
placement, tutoring opportunities to enhance interpersonal skills, and
participation in engineering colloquia series for professional growth.
