This award will provide partial support to enable junior scientists to attend
the meeting entitled, "Hot Quarks 2016: A Workshop on the Physics of
Ultrarelativistic Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions for Young Scientists," to be held
in South Padre Island, TX, 11-18 September 2016. Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCS),
the theory describing the forces acting within atomic nuclei, predicts that at
sufficiently high temperatures and/or densities, matter should undergo a
transition from the standard hadronic phase to a plasma of deconfined quarks and
gluons (Quark Gluon Plasma, QGP). According to our cosmological models, this
transition took place in the early universe at about 10 microseconds after the
Big Bang. The scientific scope of this field has broadened significantly with
new measurements and theoretical developments. The discussions in this workshop
will include an interdisciplinary combination of concepts from elementary-
particle physics, nuclear physics, QCD thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, and non-
equilibrium transport theory. Attendance at the workshop will enhance the
scientific communication among the junior members, particularly graduate
students, postdocs and junior faculty, both from experiment and theory.
