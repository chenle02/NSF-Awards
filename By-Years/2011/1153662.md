The proposal is to obtain support for a teacher symposium at the National
Science Teachers Association (NSTA) Annual Meeting in April of 2012 in
Indianapolis called ?Clues to the Cryosphere.?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on
both Arctic and Antarctic researchers make presentations and the proposers?
experience in organizing a similar symposium at NSTA in 2010, researcher
Christine Foreman and Education and Outreach specialist Susan Kelly plan a
variety of high-profile education and outreach polar science activities on
behalf of the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) during the four-day conference.
These will include a four-and-a- half-hour symposium for educators, six
individual sessions that are designed to follow the symposia, a staffed OPP
booth in the exhibit area for the duration of the conference, two workshops for
teachers held in conjunction with the exhibit hall, and three web seminars that
serve to extend learning opportunities after the national conference.&lt;br/&gt;
