This project is concerned with research on motives and motivic cohomology. The
principal investigator will continue his research in the various properties of
his new definitions of motives and notivic cohomology. Given any quasiprojective
scheme X over an algebraically closed field k, the Suslin complex of X should
give the mixed motive of X as an object in the derived category of abelian
groups. The principal investigator has already shown that this is a very natural
definition for X an arbitrary curve over k, and he will investigate the case of
surfaces. In addition, he will investigate the extent to which his generalized
definition of the Suslin complex can be shown to satisfy the desired axioms.
This research is concerned with algebraic K-theory. In a broad sense algebraic
K-theory concerns th evolution of concepts from linear algebra such as basis and
vector space. This work has significant implications for number theory and
algebraic geometry, and promises to make exciting connections between a number
of different areas in mathematics.
