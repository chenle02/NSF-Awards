This project has two objectives: (1) to develop a theoretical framework that
integrates and extends existing models of capital investment; and (2) to apply
this framework to data on capital investment by firms and by industries. The
theoretical framework emphasizes the costs of adjusting the size of the capital
stock and includes the facts that firms may pay a higher price for capital when
they buy than when they sell capital, that it may cost more per unit to adjust
the capital stock quickly rather than slowly, and that adjusting the capital
stock may involve fixed costs. Rather than explore the role of a single
adjustment technology in isolation, this model specification allows the nesting
of possible adjustment costs, resale market imperfections, and acquisition
costs, while further allowing for fixed adjustment costs and irreversible
investment. Also, the resulting investment function is simple enough to admit
direct empirical examination, and the tractability of aggregation problems
allows estimation in both firm-level and industry level data. This research is
important because it holds the prospect of making an important break through in
better understanding the investment behavior of firms and industries.
