The Program for Women in Mathematics is an annual, ten-day mentoring program for
women, co-sponsored by the Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton
University. The program takes place at the Institute each spring and is
organized by senior women in mathematics. Participants include a mix of
undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, as well as
established senior women as organizers and lecturers. The goals of the program
are: 1) to enhance the mathematics education of talented women mathematicians
through a rigorous academic program; and 2) to retain these women in the field
by providing mentoring and by establishing an extensive network of women
mathematicians. The topic for the 2004 program is Analysis and Nonlinear PDEs.
Organizers are by Sun-Yung Alice Chang, Professor of Mathematics at Princeton
University, and, as in past years, Karen Uhlenbeck, the Sid W. Richardson
Foundation Regents' Chair in Mathematics at the University of Texas at
Austin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Program for Women in Mathematics addresses
issues facing women at transition points in mathematics. Program activities
include an undergraduate-to-beginning-graduate lecture in an applied area
related to the research subject of the year; an advanced graduate course
intended as an introduction to state-of-the-art research in that year's chosen
field of mathematics; a research seminar in which participants present their
research; problem sessions; and a women-in-science seminar that includes
interviews with senior women in the field and organized panel discussions on
topics of interest. The program has helped to establish a network of women at
various levels in the field who can support and mentor one another through
difficult career (and life) transition points; expanding and strengthening that
network is an ongoing aim of the program.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
