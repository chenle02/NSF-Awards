9707151 Clearfield The aim of this proposal entitled Pillared Layered Compounds:
Their Synthesis, Structure and Properties is to synthesize and characterize
novel materials obtained from the pillaring of layered compounds both with
inorganic polymers and organic cross- linking agents. Four areas are emphasized:
pillared metal phosphates; organically pillared phosphates; pillared clays; and
layered double hydroxides. A large amount of synthetic work will be carried out
coupled with materials studies related to structure determination, magnetic
measurements, and sorption and catalysis. %%% The emphasis on the synthesis of
novel materials and their properties, and the manipulation of layered compounds
to produce porous materials with unusual properties such as knowledge of
magnetic phenomena in layered compounds, will result in significant
contributions to materials chemistry of potentially functional materials for
applications such as sensors, molecular sieves, separations media, and
catalysts. ***
