This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It is a study of urban agriculture in Kampala, Uganda, examining this
form of farming as an adaptive response to the economic crisis which besets much
of Africa. With a diverse set of research methodologies, this project will
collect and analyze dietary and nutritional anthropometry data, land access and
tenure data as well as socio-economic and agricultural data. Theoretical
analysis will focus on the reasons for urban agriculture, the constraints on
this practice, and the impacts on individual well-being and on the household.
This study promises to collect information of significant value for African
urban policy, and it will contribute to the sociological understanding of human
adaptations to social and economic crisis. In addition to the scientific gains
to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly
promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it
contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough
training of the next generation of sociologists.
