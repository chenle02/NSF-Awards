The Information Sciences and Telecommunications (IST) programs at the School of
Information Sciences (SIS) and the Health Information Management (HIM) program
at the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences (SHRS) in the University of
Pittsburgh are working collaboratively to develop an integrated curriculum on
Security Assured Healthcare Informatics (SAHI). The result is a novel curriculum
that comprehensively integrates Health Informatics with Information Assurance
(IA) and provide BS, MS and PhD level curriculum enhancements, and a development
of integrated facility to foster educational and research activities in SAHI
areas.The SAHI curriculum contributes to preparing high caliber professionals
with comprehensive HIM and Information Assurance expertise that will help to
address the critical and immediate need for a workforce trained to secure
America's cyberspace. The project produces professionals to fill research and
employment needs in the Western Pennsylvania region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
SAHI curriculum consists of multiple graduate level SAHI tracks with components
focused on Healthcare IT (HIT) within the IST programs, and a track focused on
Healthcare Security and Privacy (HS&amp;P) within the HIM program. BS curriculum
is being modified to provide HIT S&amp;P curriculum through course enhancements.
A new SAHI track is being implemented by modifying the existing Networks and
Security (N&amp;S) track. Finally, the existing BSIS track is being extended to
create a SAHI 4+1 FastTrack program that allows a student to earn BS and MS
degrees in 5 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is being rigorously evaluated
using both formative and summative effectiveness evaluations through extensive
reviews and feedback collection. The Center for Instructional Development and
Distance Education will create appropriate evaluation methods according to
Kirkpatrick's four-level evaluation model.
