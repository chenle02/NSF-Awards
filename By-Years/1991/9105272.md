The Department of Systems Science and Mathematics at Washington University, St.
Louis, will purchase Sun Microsystems Graphics Workstation equipment which will
be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The
equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular:
1. Computational theory of Riccati partial differential equations, fundamental
to the control of nonlinear systems, directed especially to a visualization of
their classical blow- ups and nonlinear shock waves; 2. Optimization for
probabilistic systems, in which the objective function is estimated by Monte
Carlo simulation, which is computation intensive; 3. The p-version of the finite
element method, pioneered here and now being extended to nonlinear and time-
varying problems; 4. Symbolic algebraic computation for nonlinear control
theory, using Lie algebra and formal power series methods, and numerical
experimentation with resulting new invariant-preserving integration methods,
with graphic output.
