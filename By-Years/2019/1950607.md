This "Socially Relevant Computing and Analytics" Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site (SRCA-REU) will immerse a diverse group of undergraduates in
a vibrant research community of faculty and graduate students working on
cutting-edge interactive and intelligent media, improving learning and
healthcare outcomes, educational technologies, and diverse forms of interaction
with and through computers. “Socially relevant computing” is a term used in a
broad sense to include systems and data that have social relevance. Students
will be recruited from underrepresented groups and colleges and universities
with limited research opportunities through the STARS Computing Corps, an NSF-
funded national consortium of institutions dedicated to broadening participation
in computing. The project's focus on relevant cutting-edge technologies is a
proven focus that can improve retention for minorities and
women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students in SRCA-REU will participate in a variety
of research projects that range from interactive systems/games (addressing theme
such as humans in learning, health, creativity, and providing food and shelter)
to machine learning/analytics research (that deals with data generated from
people interacting in these systems as well as the need for ethics in machine
learning/analytics of such data). These research activities can potentially lead
to the discovery and evaluation of innovative, interactive solutions to open
problems in serious games, data analytics, intelligent tutoring, narrative
generation, and biological algorithms. The SRCA-REU will provide explicit
research mentoring training to faculty and graduate student mentors, and
explicitly encourage faculty and student publication of results. SRCA-REU
students will present their work at an undergraduate research competition and
will be encouraged to submit their technical papers as peer reviewed
publications. Using the Affinity Research Groups and STARS Training for REUs
models, faculty and graduate student mentors will be engaged with undergraduates
to create a supportive culture of collaboration while promoting individual
contributions to research through just-in-time training for both mentors and
students throughout the summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
