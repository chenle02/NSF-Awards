The growth of intersegmental pathways will be examined at early developmental
stages in the chick embryo spinal cord. Retrograde and anterograde labeling of
growth cones and pathways will be carried out using HRP histochemistry and the
material examined in the light and electron microscope. The localization of
several molecules that may be involved in axonal guidance and pathway formation
will be examined by immunocytochemistry. A variety of perturbation experiments,
including deletion of specific pathways or pathways cues, heterotopic spinal
cord transplants, spinal cord rotations, and supression of neuronal activity
will be used to begin to reveal some of the possible mechanisms involved in
pathway formation. The long-term goal of these studies is to gain a better
understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are critically
involved in the ontogeny of specific axonal pathways in the vertebrate spinal
cord. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate pathway formation during
development is directly relevant to the important topics of spinal cord
regeneration and related forms of neuronal plasticity.
