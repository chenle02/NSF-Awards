The over-availability of data and the under-availability of knowledge present a
critical challenge for biological informatics in the years to come. Clearly,
effective techniques are need not only for storage and retrieval purposes, but
also for mining genomic data to increase our knowledge. However, the high
dimensionality and enormous size of genomic data pose very challenging problems
in analysis and visualization of the data sets. This project investigates novel
approaches to analyzing gene expression data and integrating them into
biological research. New algorithms and tools that can be used iteratively and
interactively to mine the data will be developed. The strategies include a meta
data hierarchy for integration of heterogeneous data, cluster-based indexing for
high-dimensional data, inter-dimensional analysis for classification, and
dynamic interactive visualization for pattern analysis. The approaches will be
field-tested by biologists investigating an organism's phenotype and genotype
iterations. The project will deliver a flexible, scalable workbench environment
ready to be used for general genomic data analysis. In addition to education
development activities, the project's impact will be enhanced by
&lt;br/&gt;broad applications in other fields that handle large-scale multi-
dimensional data sets.&lt;br/&gt;
