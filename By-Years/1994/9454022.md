The Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park
respectfully requests five traineeship positions in the subdiscipline area of
Civil Infrastructure Systems (CIS). CIS is an area for which the Department of
Civil Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park has outstanding
resources and personnel. Research in the area of bridge and building
infrastructure systems has been targeted to benefit from the Graduate Research
Traineeship program. The research will focus on extending useful life and
retrofitting to resist natural hazards. New structural systems, new techniques
and materials that are modified or not previously used in construction will be
considered. The research will also consider technology developed int he
aerospace, automotive and industrial sectors for transfer and use in civil
engineering and construction. Enhanced traditional construction materials, as
wee as, new emerging construction materials will be considered. The University
of Maryland has formal academic linkages with several traditionally Black
universities. The Project Directors will take advantage of this existing network
to recruit trainees. Recruitment plans include intensifying current efforts, as
