Dr. Andrew Goudy of the Chemistry Department, West Chester University of
Pennsylvania, is jointly supported for work on hydrogen absorption by
intermetallic hydrides by the following programs: Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry; Experimental Physical Chemistry; and Interfacial,
Transport and Separation Processes (Engineering). The project will investigate
the influence of phase, surface structure, and particle size on the rate of
uptake of hydrogen by mixed rare earth-transition metal compounds. Some mixed
transition metal systems will also be investigated. Methods for pretreatment
have been developed which make consistent kinetic results possible. %%% These
materials are known to absorb significant amounts of hydrogen at moderate
temperatures and so have potential application for hydrogen storage.
