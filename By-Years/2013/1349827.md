The main goal of this CAREER proposal is to examine whether extreme
hydrometeorological events cluster in time. Temporal clustering refers to the
tendency of events to occur together in time, with the occurrence of an extreme
event affecting the likelihood of a subsequent event. The proposed work is
delineated in three phases, with research motivated by the following main
questions: Do extreme hydrometeorological events exhibit temporal clustering,
and, if so, which key physical processes explain this behavior? Can outputs from
General Circulation Models (GCMs) reproduce observed clustered behavior? Is it
possible to take advantage of temporal clustering to improve the forecasting of
hydrometeorological extreme events? The underlying hypothesis is that extreme
hydrometeorological events exhibit temporal clustering that is controlled by
climate processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The continental United States will be
the focus as this area is plagued by a large array of natural hazards yielding
extensive socio-economic impacts. Some of the most damaging hazards in this
general area will be included: flooding and heavy rainfall, high and low
temperature extremes, and tropical and extra-tropical storms. Cox regression
models will be developed to examine the dependence of extreme events on climate
processes. The methodologies build on analysis tools and data sets that the PI
has used extensively. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research represents a
comprehensive step forward in the understanding of the frequency and causes of
extreme events; this has substantial broader impacts.
