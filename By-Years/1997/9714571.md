ABSTRACT CTS-9714571 Douglas J. Raber The National Research Council (NRC)
requests partial core support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the
continuing activities of the Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology (BCST) of
the Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Applications. As defined
in its mission statement, the Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology is the
recognized and respected body within the National Research Council that provides
independent, objective information and recommendations in chemical sciences and
technologies to the government to assure a sound basis for policy decisions.
Accordingly, the Board serves as the focal point within the National Research
Council for concerns and issues effecting chemistry in its broadest sense. To
function effectively, the BCST must undertake extensive planning for potential
studies, carry out oversight of ongoing activities, engage in private-sector
fund raising, and maintain a broad effort to communicate with the chemical
sciences community. All of these are core activities, for which costs cannot be
charged to specific projects and which therefore require core funding. The
capacity to develop new projects, while paying costs partially or fully from
core funds, greatly enhances the freedom and capacity of the BCST to act
responsively and responsibly to important issues in the chemical sciences and
technology.
