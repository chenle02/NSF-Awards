The quality of the science of astronomy depends, like all the natural sciences,
on the acquisition of fundamental data about the objects of its concern. Three
of such fundamental data in astronomy are the masses, radii, and luminosities of
stars. These data vary greatly with stellar types. So do the problems associated
with their acquisition. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to continue
with his current NSF-funded research program of obtaining mass, radius, and
luminosity data of stars by measuring the velocity variations of eclipsing
binary stars. In the past, the PI focused on early type main sequence stars,
which are relatively bright and, hence, easy to observe. In the present
proposal, he intends to focus on binary systems with G- and K-type main-sequence
stars, for which relatively few reliable results have been obtained to date
because of these stars' faintness. To overcome the problems associated with
faintness, the PI will be using the recently developed Hamilton Echelle
Spectrometer and a charge-coupled device (CCD) of the Lick Observatory. In
addition to the project just described, the PI will be alert to "targets of
opportunity" and search for faint secondary components of bright evolved B
stars.
