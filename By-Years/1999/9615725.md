Bittman 9615725 The pineal gland has long been known to be integral to the
regulation of seasonal reproduction and its principal hormone, melatonin, is an
important transducer of circadian information in the neuroendocrine axis. This
system provides daylength information to the reproductive axis and allows
photoperiod to adjust the secretion of pituitary hormones to seasonally
appropriate levels. The receptors for melatonin are concentrated in several
brain sites but the highest concentration resides in the pars tuberalis.
However, the functions of melatonin in this region are unknown. In this SGER,
Dr. Bittman is using sophisticated molecular biological techniques to identify
novel genetic targets of melatonin action in this tissue, and the brain, in
general to uncover previously undescribed fundamental mechanisms by which the
environment regulates reproduction. These investigations will lead to
significant new insights into the regulation of fertility which may improve our
ability to foster the reproduction of endangered species in the wild and in
protected environments.
