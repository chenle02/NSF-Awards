9720470 Scarlatos, Lori L. CUNY Brooklyn College Smart Object Interfaces for
Collaborative Learning Environments Smart objects are physical objects that
serve as input devices to a computer system. This effort aims to use pieces of a
physical puzzle -- such as the Towers of Hanoi -- as smart objects that will
help K-12 students to understand and appreciate mathematical and scientific
concepts. The goal is to reach those students who are currently turned off by
math and science, providing a way for them to learn collaboratively by
manipulating real objects in the world around them. The PI will use this
planning grant to study the feasibility of this new research direction, and to
devise a sound technical approach for implementing smart object interfaces for
collaborative learning environments. Unlike traditional interfaces, a computer
system employing smart objects must track multiple input devices in a three-
dimensional space in real time, distinguishing between objects and accounting
for precision errors. Current sensor technologies are being examined to discover
their capabilities and limitations. The PI is talking with other researchers and
sensor experts and also exploring the software issues, aiming to ultimately
develop a set of smart object interface tools. This effort will culminate in a
long-term research plan and the beginnings of a new research laboratory.
