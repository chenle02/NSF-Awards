Modeling of the fast solar wind and streamers will be carried out based on a
pair of interlaced computer codes. One will be a 3D three-fluid code
encompassing electrons, protons and one species of heavy ion. The other is a
kinetic hybrid code where the protons and heavy ions are treated as particles
and the electrons as a fluid. The hybrid code will be used to study the effect
of high-frequency kinetic Alfven waves on the distribution functions, and in
particular to determine the damping of these waves and their heating of the
plasma. The results will be incorporated in the fluid simulation, and the
results compared with observations, like ion flow speeds and effective
temperature, derived from instruments on board SOHO and TRACE.
