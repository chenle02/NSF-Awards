This three year project sponsored by Arizona State University will offer a five
week workshop to 32 "master" teachers in microchemistry techniques and in the
learning cycle method of instruction. The learning cycle is an effective
inquiry-oriented method which helps students acquire key scientific concepts and
improve their general thinking skills. In each of the first two years 16
learning cycle modules will be prepared and microscale laboratory techniques
will be included in these modules if appropriate. After each summer the master
teachers will conduct an inservice program of eight 15 hour workshops for peer
teachers in their districts or from nearby schools. In the third year these 32
learning cycle modules for chemistry will be revised and a teachers guide for
the use of these modules will be prepared. The Master teachers in the project
will become student teacher supervisors, assuring that the techniques of the
program will continue to be implemented in the schools. The matching funds from
the University and the school districts constitute 27% of the NSF grant.
