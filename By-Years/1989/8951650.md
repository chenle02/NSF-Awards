Alma College will purchase new equipment to upgrade its optics laboratory and
enhance the teaching of optics. The new equipment will be used to (1) provide
laboratory experience and undergraduate research opportunities for students
enrolled in an upper level optics course, (2) enhance optics teaching in other
courses, and (3) support the College's science teacher training and recruitment
program. The equipment includes an optical table with vibration-isolating legs,
an optical bench, a He-Ne laser, 3 spatial filters, 3 precision mirrors, a laser
spectrometer, and a laser power meter. These items, along with equipment already
on hand or to be purchased by the College, will equip the laboratory for
experiments in electro optics, coherent imaging, spatial filtering, Fourier
optics, and holography. Specific experiments in an upper level optics course
will illustrate the concepts of coherent optics while preparing the students to
work independently in undergraduate optics research. The newly equipped
laboratory will also serve students studying optics in introductory physics,
physical science, and astronomy courses, and it will support cooperative summer
research experiences for secondary science teachers and selected high school
students. The college will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
