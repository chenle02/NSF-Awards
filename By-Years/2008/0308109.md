DMS-0308109 PI: Peter J. Brockwell Title: Applied probability and Time Series
modeling

Abstract:

Properties and applications in finance of Levy-driven linear and non-linear
continuous-time autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) processes will be
investigated. Questions concerning existence of stationary solutions for non-
linear continuous-time models and relations between discrete-time models and
their continuous-time analogues will also be addressed. In discrete time, the
stochastic stability of generalized linear versions of ARMA models will be
studied with a view to modeling time series of counts. Efficient estimation
techniques for these models and for all-pass models driven by non-Gaussian noise
will be developed. The results for the latter processes will be applied to the
problem of identification and estimation for non-causal and/or non-invertible
ARMA models.

In the last decade there has been a widely recognized need for the development
of new models and techniques for the analysis of time-series data from
scientific, engineering, biomedical and financial applications. Major features
giving rise to this need include non-linearity, complex dependence structures
and strong deviations from normality, with discrete-valued data arising in many
genetic and biomedical applications. In financial applications there is a need
for continuous-time models exhibiting these characteristics. The proposal
addresses these needs, with the goal of enhancing scientific understanding of
the physic and economic processes represented by the models.
