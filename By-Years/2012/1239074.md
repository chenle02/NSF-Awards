A Hydrogeophysics workshop will be held 8-11 July 2012 at the Boise State
University. The conference will address current hydrogeophysical approaches to
predicting and/or monitoring hydrologic properties and processes in both the
saturated and unsaturated zones, at scales ranging from centimeters to
watersheds. The conference will also include ?homework sessions? that will
enable attendees to independently analyze a shared dataset, which will provide
insight into uncertainty in solutions, differences in processing algorithms, as
well as variations in rock physics assumptions. The workshop will enable the
hydrogeophysics community to come together to think creatively about new ways to
share resources (people, equipment, access to field sites) to advance the
science. Discussion will be organized into a white paper designed to provide a
statement of the current state of the art. The meeting is open and students are
encouraged to attend.
