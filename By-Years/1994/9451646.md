9451646 Duttera A new biotechnology/molecular biology course using collaborative
learning experiences includes: review of microbiology techniques; analysis of
genomic, phage, and plasmid DNAs by restriction and electrophoretic techniques;
cloning of genes; restriction analysis of recombinant products; preparation of a
gene library; PCR; Southern Blot; and site-specific mutagenesis. The theory and
relevance of the laboratory experience is related (through lecture and outside
reading) to current research and ethical issues. The students propose, defend
and are offered the opportunity to perform an independent research project.
