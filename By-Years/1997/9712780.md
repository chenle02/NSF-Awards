9712780 Guffy The proposal is for a Development phase Rural Systemic Initiative
grant from West Texas A&amp;M University, on behalf of a consortium of
educational leaders and institutions in the state of Texas. The project targets
178,000 students in 196 school districts in 73 rural counties. The proposers
would accomplish the goals of the development phase by organizing 6 Focus
Groups, each representative of the rural regions of Texas. The groups will focus
on: 1) SMT education; 2) Rural Workforce and Economic Development; 3) Scientific
Literacy and Appreciation in Rural Communities; 4) Rural Community
Infrastructures; 5) Integrated Systemic Reform; and 6) Rural Resource
Partnerships and Alignments. In each of these areas, the Focus Groups will
document the current state of several key indicators. ??
