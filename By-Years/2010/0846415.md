Proposal Title: CAREER: Numerical and Experimental Study of Photon-Electron
Interaction in Surface Plasmon-Polariton Nanophotonic Devices

PI Name: Kuang, Wan

PI Institution: Boise State University

The objective of this research is to study the optical property of surface
plasmon-polariton nanophotonic devices due to photon and electron interactions.
The approach is to develop a self-consistent model by incorporating electron
dynamics in finite-difference time domain Maxwell?s equations using a quantum
hydrodynamic transport model. The electron flow is described by a single-
particle effective mass Schr√∂dinger?s equation with many-body field described by
density functional theory. The electrodynamic and the transport equations are
coupled through the polarization-induced current density. Intellectual Merit The
proposed research will greatly impact the field of nanophotonics, which is a
major driver in the era of nanotechnology. The research seeks to understand how
the carrier transport can be utilized to shape the optical properties of
nanoplasmonic devices, a subject that has been largely unexplored. The program
opens the door to breakthrough in active plasmonic devices. Broader Impact The
impact of this research also extends to solar cells, bio sensing and imaging. To
facilitate research collaboration, numerical program will be hosted as an open
source project. The research also has a broad educational impact on many levels.
The subject of self-consistent modeling will be integrated into Ph.D. program on
quantum optics. The undergraduate curriculum developments aim at offering a high
quality education to students, who have become one of the major sources of local
technical industry. The outreach program provides an innovative opportunity to
expose younger adults to science and engineering. The program includes
activities that specifically target the communities of a fast growing Hispanic
population.
