The University of Colorado and Colorado State University will establish an
Engineering Research Center with the goal of creating optoelectronic devices and
systems for computing signal processing and artificial intelligence.
Multidisciplinary research thrusts will include: (1) the design and fabrication
of a bit-serial optical computer as a test-bed for determining device
reliability and functional complexity; (2) fabrication of novel devices using
new materials and processes; (3) the development of a general methodology for
identifying optoelectronic signal processing systems; and (4) the design of
symbolic computers and associative memories for optical artificial intelligence.
