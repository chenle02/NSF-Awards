The ability to control of interfacial interactions is important for the efficacy
of drug/gene delivery, the protection of therapeutic proteins, the performance
of surface-based diagnostic devices and the bio-compatibility of implantable
materials. It is particularly tricky to develop non-fouling materials that can
preserve the bioactivity of proteins at the same time. The novelty of the
proposed research is focused on non-fouling, enzyme stabilizing interfacial
interactions of naturally occurring poly-zwitterions and proteins. This proposal
seeks to address critical structure-property relations, e.g. ion separation
distances, hydration and counter-charge distibution and their relation to enzyme
stability. If successful, such a broader understanding of zwitterionic materials
could provide guidance towards novel building blocks for better multifunctional
materials, and could have impact on the field of biomaterials and biointerfaces.
