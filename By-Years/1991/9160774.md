This proposal aims to: (1) conduct an international patent analysis for two
product technologies that are believed to be in the growth stage of the life
cycle, (2) identify non-patent technology indicators that can be collected for
analysis at the level of a specific technology and collect them for the two
technologies, (3) look for correlations between the patent and non-patent
indicators, (4) determine the life cycle stage of the technologies using patent
indicators and forecast future technological activity, 5) look for correlations
between the number of subsequent patent citations and other indicators of
importance or value, and determine whether the importance of an invention can be
predicted early in its life, (6) review and assess models of technological
innovation and technological evolution for whether they can be supported with
patent data. The proposal's commercial objective is to develop decisionmaking
tools based on this research.
