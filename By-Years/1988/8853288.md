Northwest Nazarene College will purchase six high-speed oscilloscopes, a high-
resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy system, and an X-ray spectroscopy system. This
equipment will be used to improve instruction in both lower-and upper-division
physics laboratory courses. Courses affected include a microcomputer interfacing
laboratory and a spectroscopy laboratory. In addition, the equipment will be
used by upper-division physics majors for required individual projects.
Northwest Nazarene College will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of
funds.
