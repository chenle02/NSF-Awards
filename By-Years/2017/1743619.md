This project will support a workshop for new and future Principal Investigators
(PI's) in the Condensed Matter Physics Program within the NSF Division of
Materials Research. The workshop will be held in Arlington, VA on June 8th and
9th, 2017. The workshop will provide PI's who have just received their first
award, or are attempting to obtain funding, from the CMP program with valuable
information and advice on the policies, procedures and opportunities available
at the National Science Foundation. The workshop will focus on:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Individual Investigator Programs in DMR &lt;br/&gt;- DMR
Centers &lt;br/&gt;- DMR Facilities &lt;br/&gt;- Other user facilities
&lt;br/&gt;- Special DMR programs &lt;br/&gt;- NSF Policies and Procedures
&lt;br/&gt;- The Merit Review Process &lt;br/&gt;- What makes a review effective
and helpful &lt;br/&gt;- Preparing highlights &lt;br/&gt;- Preparing successful
proposals &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;as well as other topics of interest to new PI's.
The workshop will provide ample time for discussion and opportunities to meet
with various DMR program officers
