Photographs are a highly useful anthropological tool. While its potential has
been realized by many scholars, only recently has the value of the vast number
of images held by anthropological institutions been emphasized for its research
potential. Unfortunately, many collections have been badly maintained and are
pooly recognized. Because of the nitrate base of our earliest documents, use is
even dangerous. The Maxwell Museum of the University of New Mexico is conducting
a two year program to organize, catalogue, index, and rehouse their photographic
materials. A pilot project for this project was funded last year. A computerized
catalogue, a visual reference index and an organized storage system will be
developed, thereby permitting researchers ready access to these premier
collections for the first time. The Maxwell Museum's photographic collections
document a century of culture change around the world and a similar span of
archaeological and ethnographic research. In many cases, the subject societies
no longer exist as integrted units; in others they have been drastically
modified. Thus the surviving imagery represents a valuable resource to both
anthropology and the members of societies whose traditions have been recorded by
the camera.
