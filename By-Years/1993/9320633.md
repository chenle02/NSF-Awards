Professor Katharine Hunt is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue her theoretical work which exploits
the properties of the nonlocal polarizability density to find relationships
connecting observable molecular properties such as infrared intensities,
vibrational Raman intensities, overtone intensities, electric field shielding
tensors, force and anharmonicity constants, and field gradients at nuclei. The
nonlocal susceptibility tensors describe the reaction to changes in the fields
due to the nuclei in the same molecule when the nuclei shift. She also plans to
extend the theory to cover nonlocal response to inhomogeneous magnetic fields
which would then make it possible to relate chemical shifts to other magnetic
properties, and to increase the information obtainable from magnetic probes of
local chemical environments. Electromagnetic radiation is the primary probe of
microscopic molecular systems, and most of our knowledge regarding the
electronic behavior of molecules arises from various experimental spectroscopic
techniques. There are a number of quantities which can be observed in
spectroscopic experiments, and we rely on theoretical models to relate these
observations to various molecular properties. Hunt's research is uncovering new
and important relationships which exist between various spectroscopic
observables. These relationships further our understanding of molecular
electronic structure, and assist in the interpretation of experimental
spectroscopic data.
