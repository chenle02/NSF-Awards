The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project potentially
include dramatically improved emergency-response systems for public safety in a
number of different scenarios ranging from active shooter threats in college or
enterprise campuses, emergencies involving fire or police departments, medical
response teams in indoor hospital buildings or outdoor settings. The commercial
impact of this effort is to potentially transform the mass alerting market
today. The planned customer research will also help inform and enhance the
underlying networking and distributed systems technology for agile contextual
communication and, in the longer term, fundamentally advance our understanding
of how to realize a next-generation Internetwork, research on which contributed
to the origins of the underlying contextual communication technology driving
this I-Corps project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project activity builds
upon contextual communication, a technology that enables powerful new mobile
communication capabilities that are highly customizable to the needs or
preferences of individual users or groups. For example, in the event of a campus
emergency, emergency managers can send hyperlocal alerts to specific buildings
based on real-time locations of users, and such alerts can be further customized
to special needs of users trapped in the building. The underlying research
advances making contextual communication practical originated from a "future
Internet architecture" project that showed that it is possible to generalize
name- or IP-address-based communication in today's Internet to communication
based on arbitrary contextual attributes such as geo-location, age, and special
needs. Research results show that it is possible to provide contextual
communication services in a scalable (or cost-effective), privacy-preserving,
and accurate manner for a broad class of mobile applications, including but not
limited to emergency notification, an application domain of particular interest
to this I-Corps customer research project.
