A grid-tie inverter is a critical need to guarantee the integration of
residential solar systems with the public utility grid. Installers and designers
of solar systems for residential and commercial buildings are the main potential
customers of the proposed grid-tie inverter. The capacity range required for
installed photovoltaic (PV) systems ranges from hundreds of watts for typical
residential rooftop customers to hundreds of kilowatts for commercial rooftop
customers. Currently, the majority of customers that utilize PV systems face two
major challenges: cost and limited surface area available to install the panels.
It is expected that the proposed grid-tie inverter, with better efficiency,
translates to an installer being able to use fewer solar panels to obtain the
same amount of electrical power. Conversely it could be stated that it is
possible to generate more power from the same number of solar
panels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project transforms a state-of-the-art power
electronics technology developed in the PI's laboratory into a commercially
viable grid-tie inverter. The compelling value proposition is higher efficiency,
reduced semi-conducting components and implementation of active functions. The
proposed grid-tie inverter has a potential impact on ways in which next-
generation of grid- tie inverters can be developed. By increasing the efficiency
of solar energy conversion through the proposed grid-tie inverters this product
will likely impact: (a) security - reduced energy consumption would help
decrease demand for foreign sources of fuel, (b) environment - more efficient
energy conversion stages will conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gas
production, and (c) economy - increased efficiency equates to reduced material
and installation costs as well as resale of surplus energy back to the utility
grid. An energy conversion unit (grid-tie inverter) able to reduce a fractional
amount of loss interfacing solar panels and the utility grid will save millions
of dollars in wasted spending across the U.S. every year.
