Abstract The purpose of this project is to discover and to understand efficient
data structures and combinatorial algorithms and the tools and techniques by
which they can be discovered and analyzed. The goals are four-fold: o to devise
specific algorithms and data structures tailored to the needs of various
importatnt combinatorial problems, thereby producing more efficient solution
methods for these problems; o to develop implementations and perform empirical
studies with these new methods and their older competitors, with the aim of
understanding their essential properties and developing improved variations; o
to perform theoretical studies of the worst- and average-case performance of the
methods under consideration, with the aim of being able to predict which method
is most suitable in a given situation; o to develop general themes of design and
analysis, and to apply these themes systematically in the construction of new
algorithms and data structures.
