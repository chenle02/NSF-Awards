This award to the State University of New York at Buffalo (UB) is for the
acquisition of a hybrid sputtering/e-beam thin film deposition system. The
instrument will be used by an interdisciplinary group of UB faculty from four
different departments: Physics, Chemistry, Chemical &amp; Biological
Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. The instrument is capable of depositing
multilayer thin films combining metal, semiconductor, and insulator materials,
in situ device fabrication and in situ characterization of a broad range of
physical properties. It will enable the exploration of novel energy-related
materials and devices, spin effects and materials in solid state devices,
electronic materials and sensors, and optical materials. These materials and
devices will contribute to applications ranging from solar cells and batteries,
data storage to biological sensing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hybrid
sputtering/e-beam thin film deposition system will foster cross-disciplinary
interactions, and realize previously undiscovered synergies in research. It is
an important addition to UB's material research infrastructure and is a key
priority for the newly planned Materials Science and Engineering Ph.D. program
as it will help to attract new faculty members from various fields strategic to
the University. The instrument will be house in the Integrated Nanostructured
Systems Instrument Facility where it will be available to the broader UB
research community and regional companies and institutions. A large number of
post-doctoral scholars, and graduate and undergraduate students will gain hands-
on experience in the operation and maintenance of what has become an essential
tool in modern materials research. A new course will be developed concentrating
on nanoscale materials and devices. The PIs will work closely with Buffalo State
College and UB's Cora P. Maloney College to involve underrepresented groups in
research using the instrument.
