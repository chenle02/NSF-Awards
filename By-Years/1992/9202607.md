This project equips the new Economic Science Laboratory (ESL). The laboratory
consists of 40 subject decision stations, which under this project, would be
equipped with 32 model 386 personal computers and 8 NeXT UNIX work stations plus
support units and equipment. In the last decade ESL has been instrumental in the
development of software programs for the design of new "Smart" computer assisted
auctions for network and other technologically complex coordination markets. The
applications include natural gas pipeline networks, electric power networks, and
combinatorial resource packaging for airport slots, timber rights, scheduling
problems, radio/TV spectra licenses, and many more. The next generation of
computer based experimental market designs will require human decision makers at
each station to be supported by expert systems for data analysis, optimization,
and strategic analysis. Development and exploration planning and programming in
this direction has already begun at ESL using two workstations acquired on
loans. Computerized experimental projects include: private and common value
auctions; oligopoly competition; markets for emission permits; financial market
designs; individual decision making and markets; bargaining; neural models of
adaptive behavior; public goods; marketing and laboratory experimentation.
