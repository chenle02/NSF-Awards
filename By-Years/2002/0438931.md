ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0438931&lt;br/&gt;Barry W. Boehm&lt;br/&gt;U of Southern
California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Value-Based Science of
Design&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant's research objectives are to develop the
foundations for a science of value-based design of software-intensive systems.
It is based on the PI's stakeholder win-win Theory W, which emphasizes that
"value" includes not only monetary factors, but also any non-monetary factors
that strongly motivate or demotivate a project or organization's success-
critical stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase I of the research will use
value considerations to parse and better understand the design space. It will
focus on two areas, COTS-based design and design to achieve quality attributes.
Phase I will also consider other areas such as transformational design, modular
and agile design, and cost/schedule constrained
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase II will test the hypotheses formulated in
Phase I by experimentally applying, evaluating, and iterating value-based design
capabilities in two areas -- COTS-based design and design to achieve quality
attributes -- using both small and large project
testbeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase III will develop working abstractions and
composability relations based on Phase II results. The abstractions will include
composable process patterns for value-based software design, tested for
composability across the focus areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research benefits
will include a tested framework with principles, processes, methods, and tools
for better performing value-based software design.&lt;br/&gt;
