This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Professor
Theodore J. Burkey at the University of Memphis to prepare light-driven
molecules that undergo reversible sub-picosecond isomerizations with unit
quantum yields. These molecules are potential devices in optical switches,
digital memory or light-driven computers. The molecules are designed to function
by exchange of chelated ligands through an isomerization based on ring opening
followed by the formation of another chelate ring. Ligands, metal centers and
chelate rings will be designed so that the photochemically driven isomerization
is ultrafast and efficient to the exclusion of all other processes.
Organometallic compounds based on cymatrene-type complexes will be studied to
analyze important structural features. Two types of rotational motion around a
single carbon-carbon bond will be studied: 1) A conrotary motion of different
geminal functional groups on a single side chain, and 2) A disrotary motion of
different vicinal functional groups on a ring that formally is a two side-chain
derivative. Selected compounds will be examined by ultrafast IR to determine the
mechanism of isomerization, participation of solvent and dissociated ligands,
and the time scale of related processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecules for
potential use in light-driven electronic devices will be studied. These studies
will provide a fundamental understanding of ultrafast processes of photochemical
bond breaking and subsequent bond formation.&lt;br/&gt;
