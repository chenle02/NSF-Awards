Funded by a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, a numerical calculation will
be carried out to test the validity of a scheme for rapidly and efficiently
obtaining optimized flows. The test case will be turbulent flow in a two-
dimensional diffuser. The optimization is to attain the maximum pressure rise
for given inlet conditions and diffuser length. A conventional engineering
turbulence model will be incorporated into the calculation. The optimized
configuration will be tested with the same model in a continuous validation as
the optimization scheme proceeds. Fast optimization methods to maximize or
minimize some performance parameter (pressure, drag), without recourse to time
consuming trial and error, would be of great utility in a variety of engineering
flow systems.
