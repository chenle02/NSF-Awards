Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1309029, Principal Investigator: Ioana
Suvaina &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the proposed research is the
study of Riemannian geometry of orbifold spaces in dimension four, and how they
appear as boundary points of the space of canonical metrics on smooth manifolds.
The principal investigator proposes to analyze a family of problems addressing
the study of the space of constant scalar curvature Kaehler surfaces. The
projects proposed concern both problems on the local development of
singularities, but also the understanding of compact smooth spaces. The
principal investigator aims to establish connections between the algebraic
geometry aspects of the problems and their counterparts in Kaehler geometry. The
resolution of these projects will provide constructions of new examples of
constant scalar curvature Kaehler surfaces, or constant scalar curvature almost
Kaehler 4-manifolds. In another direction, the principal investigator proposes a
series of projects on the relations between estimates of the curvature
components, the topological and differential invariants of a 4-orbifold, and
existence or non-existence of Einstein metrics. The main approach is via the
Seiberg-Witten theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of the four dimensional
spaces has a long history both in mathematics and physics being motivated by the
study of the space-time model. In mathematics, there is strong evidence that the
four dimensional spaces are very special as they admit infinitely many smooth
structures. This research program plans to use techniques from different fields
in mathematics: differential topology, Riemannian and Kaehler geometry, and
algebraic geometry to study four dimensional spaces. In particular, the
principal investigator aims to establish new connections among these various
fields.
