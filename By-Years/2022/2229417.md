The number of outages caused by severe weather as a result of climate change
rose from about 50 annually nationwide in the early 2000s to over 100 annually
on average over the past five years. With the increasing trend of cyber-physical
threats and extreme weather events due to climate change, resilience of the
power network has emerged as a problem of utmost societal importance. By
facilitating the cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas, this project will develop
a novel geometric deep learning model to significantly improve the security,
reliability, and efficiency of the modern power grid by leveraging clean energy
resources â€“ thereby, impacting the safety and economic well-being of our society
across a broad front. The project will provide training opportunities to
graduate students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In particular, the PIs will develop a
novel geometric deep learning model supported with topological data analysis
tools for robust decision-making and efficient knowledge transfer for
disruptions with time-dominant characteristics, particularly focusing on
predicting the distribution network evolution and operational decisions (by
leveraging distributed energy resources and clean energy resources) for
resilience under disruptive events such as natural disasters and adversarial
attacks. Envisioned gains in generalizability, robustness and learning
efficiency via knowledge-transfer (across events and operation timescales) will
be demonstrated by studying response and recovery operation problems in power
grids. The developed model will be applied to enhance the resilience of the
power distribution network under disruptive events, ranging from preparatory to
restorative tasks. The pre-emptive measures adopted include (i) outage
prediction and defensive islanding, while (ii) network reconfiguration is used
as a restorative action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
