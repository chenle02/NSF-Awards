The investigators will design and develop a computer-based radar simulator that
includes the transmitter, ionospheric scattering, and receiver system. The
simulator provides a framework by which experimenters can optimally configure a
radar system for particular ionospheric conditions. There is a long-standing
need in the space science radar community for more well-trained students and
scientific radar users. The Advanced Radar System addresses both of those needs.
If successful, it can be used in a classroom setting in which students can
interactively modify different parts of the system and examine the resulting
effect on the received radar signal. This is an excellent means for training the
next generation of radar experts. For radar users, the Advance Radar System
provides a means to configure a radar-operating mode in a virtual fashion prior
to the actual experiment. This will enable the experimenter to modify the
operating mode to gain the optimal results from the observations. Finally, the
proposed system may eventually replace outdated hardware and software at
existing and planned radar systems. The versatility of the digital approach to
signal analysis will be demonstrated by configuring the simulator to reproduce
the functions of a simple AM radio.
