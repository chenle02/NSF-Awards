Rigid body dynamics with impact and friction is a subject which is of vital
importance for many applications (robotics, manufacturing, biodynamics, virtual
reality) yet there has been curiously little development of the underlying
theory both for computation and analysis. The principal difficulties arise due
to impulsive forces (giving discontinuous velocity functions) and the
discontinuities due to Coulomb's friction law. Notable developments in the
theory of rigid body dynamics can be found in the work of J.-J. Moreau and
M.D.P. Monteiro-Marques, who use time-stepping methods for discretization and
measure differential inclusions for the continuous-time problem. These methods
are notable in that they directly incorporate the effects of discontinuities and
impacts directly, without needing to handle them separately from other effects.
Taking their work as a starting point, this project will advance the theory and
practice of rigid body dynamics by developing new complementarity formulations
of time-stepping methods, extending the theory of measure differential
inclusions for the continuous-time problem, and providing new convergence
results based on weak* convergence of measures.

Everyday life is full of examples of impact and friction. Walking, for instance,
involves impact at every step, and friction to prevent from slipping. Yet what
people do naturally, is very difficult for a machine to do. It is difficult even
to simulate walking, or even to simulate machines that try to walk.
Manufacturing processes involve many parts coming into contact, touching and
sliding, yet simulating these basic processes has not been done well. There are
several reasons for this: the computational models of these processes have been
inadequate, and there has been little or no theoretical basis for evaluating the
computational models. The purpose of this grant is to improve both the
computational models and to develop the theoretical basis for rigid body
dynamics. The result of this will be better simulation software, able to
properly simulate the dynamics of robots, manufacturing machinery, and (perhaps)
the way people walk. This software will become vital manufacturing
infrastructure for the 21st century.
