This is the first year of a three year continuing effort. This research is to
study the feasibility of human-computer interaction through the use of on-line
recognition of electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns. A system that can identify,
on-line, which of several mental tasks a person is performing could provide an
alphabet with which a severely disabled person can compose commands to devices
like a wheel chair. Most prior research has focused on recognition accuracy
rather than on fast, real-time responses. The goals of this research are to
characterize the limitations of current EEG recognition methods, to increase the
accuracy and decrease the computation time of EEG recognition by use of a neural
network approach, and to develop a practical real-time method. The performance
of conventional methods and of neural network learning methods designed for
high- dimensional data will be compared. Evaluations of feature and classifier
characteristics will be based on classification accuracy, robustness and
computation speed. This project has relevance to the field of pattern
recognition in general, and to the neural network and human-computer interaction
fields in particular.
