With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor
Michael Schramm from California State University Long Beach and colleagues
Lijuan Li, Young-Seok Shon, Stephen Mezyk and Paul Buonora will acquire a 400
MHz NMR spectrometer with SmartProbe and autosampler. This award is aimed at
enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a)
characterization of chiral tricyclic lactams; (b) characterization of non-heme
iron nitrosyl complexes of biological importance; (c) development and
application of unnatural amino acids to investigate enzyme function and
dynamics; (d) characterization of gold nanoparticle-cored dendrimers for the
treatment and imaging of cancer; (e) development of organophosphorus Alzheimer's
therapeutics; and (f) the study of selective small molecule membrane transport.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials
chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching
as well as research by undergraduate and master students at California State
Long Beach University and students from two neighboring colleges.
