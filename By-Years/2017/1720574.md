This proposal develops a 3-day science communication workshop tailored to polar
scientists spanning a broad range of expertise and career stages. Scientists
have a responsibility to share the meaning and implications of their work. Doing
so in a direct, vivid manner enables scientists to engage public interest and
inform public decision-making. Workshop participants will be required to engage
in a wide range of dissemination activities, including relaying effective
communication strategies to their home institutions through brown-bag seminars,
thus translating communication training into action within the scientific
community.

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the International Glaciological
Society's symposium in Boulder, Colorado on August 14-19, 2017 so that
participants can immediately apply their new skills at an international
conference. Workshop organizational partners will include the Association of
Polar Early Career Scientists, the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science
(Stony Brook University), and the University of Colorado Boulder National Snow
and Ice Data Center and Center for Science and Technology Policy, and the
International Glaciological Society. The workshop is designed to bring together
32 scientists (including 20 early career researchers, defined as graduate
students and professionals within five years of their terminal degree) in a
range of polar research disciplines (both Arctic and Antarctic).
