There are various techniques used to investigate the structure and dynamics of
the upper atmosphere. Cornell University has developed a Portable Radar
Interferometer that can measure the scattering from the atmosphere in the
mesopause region of the atmosphere. Analysis of these data leads to information
on winds, densities and energy loss mechanisms in that region. The project of
concern here is to take correlative data in collaboration with the incoherent
scatter radar in Sondestrom fjord, Greenland to study polar mesospheric clouds
during the summer. Similar studies obtained at the EISCAT radar in Norway will
be jointly analyzed in an attempt to fully understand the polar mesospheric
clouds, their relationship to noctilucent clouds and the dynamics of the region.
The relative response of the different radar frequencies from the different
instruments will assist in the interpretation of the data.
