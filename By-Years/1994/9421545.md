IBN 9421545 Terri Grodzicker This proposal is to support a conference on Cell
and molecular biology of Aplysia to be held at Cold Spring Harbor April 19-24,
1995. The mollusc Aplysia, and a number of other invertebrate animals, have
proven extremely useful in studies of basic cellular neurobiology. In large part
this is because of the extraordinarily large size of the cells of its nervous
system and the ability to recognize these cells as unique individuals. This has
allowed the investigation of individual cells, their patterns of
interconnections, modulation of synaptic strength, behavior, learning and
development. The 1995 meeting will provide a format for discussing new methods
and findings that have emerged in the cell and molecular biology of Aplysia and
other model invertebrate systems. These findings will be considered in eight
different session, each concerned with a different level of analysis: ion
channels, neurotransmitter, synaptic transmission, cell imaging, circadian
rhythm, circuity and behavimr, learning and development. About 150 participants
from 60 laboratories throughout the world are expected to attend.
