The goal of this Young Scholars Program at Northern Kentucky University is to
increase the awareness and interest of junior high school and high school
students in mathematics, science and engineering as potential career options, by
presenting these fields as the tools to solve exciting problems. To provide the
necessary opportunities, a two-phase program is proposed for forty 8th, 9th and
10th graders. The first phase is a five week commuter program during the summer
of 1988, where activities will focus on research methodology. The academic year
workshop will focus on selected topics in science and mathematics. Again, these
activities will not only increase participants' skills in math and science, but
encourage them to select courses in school that will allow them to pursue
careers in science, engineering and mathematics. As always, women and minorities
will be encouraged to participate.
