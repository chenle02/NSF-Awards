A transmission electron microscope will be acquired for the Bodega Marine
Laboratory. This instrument will be used to conduct research projects that
include: 1) investigations on mechanisms of gamete activation, fertilization and
early development; 2) studies of the relationships between cytoplasmic
organization and metabolic processes; 3) research on structure/function
relationships of extracellular matrices, and 4) research into the
endocrinological based on growth, reproduction, and acclimation of acquatic
organisms.
