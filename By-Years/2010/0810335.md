This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project develops assay chips
that can detect, identify, and quantify the presence of Category A or B
bioagents at the required sensitivity within 10 minutes. The assay chips will
employ silver particles in a porous sol-gel to selectively extract and bind a
specific bioagent with detection using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SERS). The chips will be part of an analyzer that also includes an aerosol
collector and a field usable Raman spectrometer. Feasibility of the approach
will be demonstrated during Phase I by developing the silver functionalization
method to bind Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis spores, and to detect the
capture event by SERS. During the Phase II project, assay chips will be
developed and field-tested for several Category A or B
bioagents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research an
enchancement of our ability to monitor public places targeted by terrorists, and
to implement rapid response and countermeasures. This information will save
lives and substantially reduce the terror associated with such attacks. The
device can also be adapted to detect more common Category B pathogens regarding
food and water safety (e.g. E. coli 0157:H7).&lt;br/&gt;
