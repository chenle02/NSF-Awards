This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Georgia Tech. David Collard is the
site's Program Director and Thomas Moran is the Co-Director. Over the award
period (2002-2004), ten students will be supported each summer in a ten-week
program. The student participants choose from more than thirty projects in
analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, physical, and polymer chemistry.
Each student will work closely with a faculty mentor. Activities will include
regular group meetings, REU gatherings, and two REU Symposia. Field trips to
local industrial organizations and government agencies are planned. Students are
expected to be co-authors on submissions to scholarly journals. A series of exit
interviews and follow-up surveys to both the participants and their
undergraduate advisors at their home institution are planned as part of the
assessment of the program.
