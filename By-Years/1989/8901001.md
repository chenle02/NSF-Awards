The research involves the estimation of the covariance matrix of a multivariate
normal distribution and using the basic approach to treat some related problems.
The estimators of the covariance matrix are formal Bayes and orthogonally
invariant, so the focus is on estimating the eigenvalues subject to the natural
order. The formal marginal densities that determine the estimators will be
developed. In addition the methods may be applied to the problem of estimating
the mean vector when the components satisfy order relations. These estimators
will be compared with the classical isotonic regression. Furthermore a problem
in quadratic discrimination will be examined which originates from an
application in ophthalmology.
