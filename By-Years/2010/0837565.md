With support from the National Science Foundation, a major social neuroscience
conference will be held November 21-22, 2008 at the science museum of the Caixa
Foundation, Barcelona, Spain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of the
conference will be to examine our most fundamental human impulses--the motives
to affiliate, cooperate and empathize as opposed to ostracize, compete and
aggress--from the perspective of social neuroscience. Social neuroscience is an
interdisciplinary field that incorporates behavioral and biological theories and
techniques from many sister disciplines to understand the mechanisms underlying
human social behavior. Across three core symposia, participants will examine
cooperation and conflict at the level of biological systems, including studies
of genetic markers and brain circuits, the level of individual behavior,
including biological and behavioral models of cooperation and conflict, and the
level of the group, including studies of intergroup conflict and terrorism. The
symposium will bring together international leaders and young investigators in
neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, economics, sociology and policy. This
conference is anticipated to increase communication and subsequent collaboration
between complementary research groups.
