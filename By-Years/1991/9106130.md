Regulated transcriptional termination and RNA processing of the immunoglobulin
(Ig) heavy chain gene during B cell development will be examined. The long-term
goal of this research is to understand the general mechanisms governing these
events as well as to determine the basis for the developmentally regulated
changes that occur during B cell maturation. Transcriptional termination of
normal and altered Ig u-o genes, introduced into established B and plasmacytoma
cell lines, will be analyzed using the standard nuclear run-on assay or a
proposed PCR-based assay. The contribution a functional poly (A) site and the
downstream termination region make to termination within the u-o gene will be
analyzed by deleting the poly (A) sites, altering the poly (A) site strength and
mutating the termination region sequences. To determine whether the regulated
production of us and um RNA, which is dependent on the efficiencies of two
competing RNA processing reactions, is a u gene-specific event or is instead due
to global changes in processing efficiencies, a non-Ig gene that can be
alternatively processed by splicing and polyadenylation will be expressed in B
and plasmacytoma cells. The u gene will be expressed in non-B cells to identify
the non-regulated processing pathway and, by inference, the regulated pathway.
The results from this study could have significant impact in other systems where
alternatively processed pre-mRNAs are invoked as well as increasing our insight
into the switching process in immunoglobin maturation.***//
