Abstract for Proposal No. 0105195 by Jiang-Hua Lu

In this project, the PI will continue to develop Poisson Morse theory, the
theme of which is to use Poisson structures to study the topology of the
underlying manifolds. She will also study a moduli space of a class of Poisson
structures, which is closely connected to semi-simple symmetric spaces and their
compactifications.

Poisson structures first arose in the 19'th century in the study of classical
mechanics. Nowadays Poisson geometry is being influenced by and has applications
in theoretical physics such as string theory. In the same spirit, this proposal
is about the rich connections between Poisson geometry and various other fields
of mathematics and mathematical physics, such as topology, Lie theory, Hopf
algebras, and integrable systems. It also has applications in control theory and
robotics.
