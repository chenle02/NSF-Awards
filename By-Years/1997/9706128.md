9706128 Steeples This research involves the understanding and controlling of the
shallow seismic wavefield to improve imaging in near-surface and deeper
exploration seismology. Various near-surface seismic techniques are increasingly
useful in helping to solve environmental, engineering, and resource-evaluation
problems. Recent research showed the importance of near-surface soil moisture on
seismic P-wave data quality. These results will be expanded to include a larger
range of time and moisture conditions, and extended to include three-component
data and waves other than reflected P-waves. ***
