The purpose of this project is to design, prove, and implement efficient
distributed algorithms to perform a variety of network computations securely and
with high fault-tolerance. The security of interactive and distributed
computations is a natural and extremely relevant issue to the current, highly
interconnected world. Computations distributed among several interacting
processors provide greater reliability and security than centralized
computations, which are prone to failure and malicious attacks. Large networks
can employ redundancy to correct errors, and it is easier to ensure - and more
reasonable to believe - that a majority of processors are correct than that a
particular processor remains absolutely invulnerable. The goal is to replace
centralized computers (name servers or authentication servers, for example) by
fast, interactive computations that obviate the need to trust a given host. The
project will prove the protocols secure and fault-tolerant using a new set of
formal methods the researcher has developed to define and prove security in
distributed systems. These formal methods capture intuition clearly, provide
concise and modular proofs, and have already been demonstrated useful in finding
flaws in seemingly secure (and even published) protocols. The project's standard
of efficiency is stricter than just requiring polynomial or polylogarithmic
upper bounds. The researcher is implementing the protocols to judge their
efficiency, to demonstrate their utility, and to determine the factors that are
relevant in an applied setting.
