This is a multinational, multi.investigator, project to analyze a diversity of
existing optical and radar data sets describing the climatology of the
atmosphere at 70.100 kilometers over Antarctica, and to develop a model of the
dynamics of this region of the antarctic atmosphere based on the observations.
The objective is to characterize the meteorology of the antarctic mesosphere and
lower thermosphere (MALT), and to determine how it compares with (and differs
from) the complementary arctic region. The emphasis will be placed on
understanding the winds and tides. Of particular topical interest are studies of
the height and seasonal.latitude structures of turbulent diffusivities implied
by gravity wave and tidal breaking, with a particular view towards evaluating
the accessibility of nitrogen oxide (NO), produced by energetic particle
precipitation in the high magnetic latitude upper atmosphere, to stratospheric
levels where it can catalytically destroy ozone.
