0245216 Brezonik The CLEANER Workshop 2 will build on the results of CLEANER
Workshop1. In that workshop, it was explicitly recommended to convene another
workshop devoted to Environmental Field Facilities (EFFs). Thus, CLEANER
Workshop 2 is in response to that recommendation. The continuing development of
the CLEANER initiative leads to an effort devoted to defining the concept of
(EFFs). The agenda for CLEANER Workshop 2 has been developed and will include:
review the results of CLEANER Workshop 1 "Large Scale Environmental Challenges:
CLEANER as the Engineering Approach"; Status/Experience for CLEANER; Defining an
EFF(with breakout sessions); Modeling; Environmental Cyberinfrastructure; Sensor
Needs, Development, and Networking: Initial Insights, and the Path Forward. This
workshop is an important next step in securing a cross-discipline view of the
evolution of CLEANER.&lt;br/&gt;This Workshop will be held at the University of
Minnesota, in Minneapolis, on October 20-22, 2002. The workshop will be attended
by approximately 50 scientists and engineers from the academic, consultant and
governmental communities. A report summarizing the results of the workshop will
be prepared by the steering committee and submitted to the Environmental
Engineering Program Director by December, 2002.&lt;br/&gt;
