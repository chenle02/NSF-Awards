9303568 Sooryakumar This project will support the study of carriers in narrow
channels of widths comparable to the electron de-Broglie wavelength through
Fabry-Perot optical interferometry methods. It will allow for the determination
of the plasmon dispersion, their lifetimes and coupling between neighboring
lateral wires that are vital to an understanding of the electronic properties of
quantum wires. In addition, the effects of electron-electron interactions on the
spin wave dynamics and elastic stability of bulk 3d ferromagnets will be
investigated through light scattering studies on a novel set of Fe1-xCox
epilayers. This will provide important data on the interplay between electron
correlations and elastic stability, a connection that has surfaced in recent
year. %%% This project will support a laser spectroscopic study of charge
carriers in ultra-narrow channels a few hundredths of a micron wide that
underlie the next generation of high speed electronic devices. The study
focusses on the collective response of carriers within individual channels as
well as their coupling to neighboring lateral wires. In addition, the effects
ofinteractions between charge carriers, that present one of the greatest
challenges to understanding magnetism in metallic materials, will be addressed.
This will be investigated through optical spectroscopy and varying the strength
of the electron interactions made possible by a recent breakthrough in alloying
different magnetic elements. ***
