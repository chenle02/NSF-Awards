This is a Research Planning Grant under the Research Opportunities For Women
Program. The objective of the research is to study the fundamental aspects of
bonding at ceramic grain boundaries. The forces that exist at the grain
boundaries will be measured directly with a new instrument which determines the
forces required to bring two ceramic surfaces together and then separate them.
The forces will be measured as a function of crystallographic direction in the
crystalline ceramic surfaces. Scanning electron microscopy and analytical
transmission electron microscopy will also be used to characterize the ceramic
crystals and the amorphous grain boundaries. Microcrack propagation and
electrical properties will also be measured for the boundaries. No such direct
measurement of the repulsive/attractive forces between the two crystal surfaces
has yet been possible. The surface forces apparatus provides an exciting
opportunity to obtain new information on the physical properties of ceramic
grain boundaries and the role of the amorphous intergranular phases.
