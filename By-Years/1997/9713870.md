9713870 Blidberg This grant provides support to encourage the participation of
Women and Under Represented Minorities in the student paper competition at the
10th International Symposium on Unmanned Untethered Submersible Technology. The
Autonomous Undersea Systems Institute has organized a series of symposia focused
on unmanned untethered submersible technology. The first Symposium was held in
1980 and the 10th in the series will be held September 7-10, 1997. The symposium
seeks to provide a mechanism for the exchange of information among members of
the research and user community involved in the development of autonomous
underwater systems. Technical papers are solicited and the submitted abstracts
are reviewed by active researchers within the community. Accepted papers are
presented in an informal atmosphere which encourages questions from
participants. ***
