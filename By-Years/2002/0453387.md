WSIA is an eight-week research experience hosted by Wabash College in Indiana.
Twelve undergraduates will spend a summer immersed in three areas of Algebra:
Commutative Ring Theory, Automated Theorem Proving and Applications to Loop
Theory, and Computational Linear Algebra. Participants will be introduced to
each of these areas and will form teams that investigate an open problem in one
of these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WSIA participants will take part in a week-
long workshop investigating the ethics of research. In addition, participants
will spend time on the campuses of Indiana University and Purdue University
attending seminars, giving talks and interacting with current graduate students
and professors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The director of WSIA is J.D. Phillips who
along with Mike Axtell and William Turner, all of Wabash College, will serve as
research mentors to the participants. Noted expert David Neidorf will conduct
the Ethics Workshop.&lt;br/&gt;
