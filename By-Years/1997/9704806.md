9704806 Ivany Deciphering the complex relationship between evolutionary change
and environmental change requires a detailed and simultaneous record of both
variables so that patterns in each can be compared. If the records dovetail,
then there is compelling evidence for the role of environment in influencing the
direction of evolutionary change. The P.I. will explore this issue with a case
study in the Eocene Gulf Coastal Plain. She will construct a temperature curve
specific to the coastal region by analyzing the isotopic composition of biogenic
carbonates. Secular trends in both temperature and seasonality associated with
mid-Eocene to Oligocene global cooling will be examined through geochemical
analysis of biogenic carbonates and careful microsampling of growth lines in
organisms showing accretionary growth.
