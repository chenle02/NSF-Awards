ABSTRACT EEC-9711282 Arens This award provides funding to support the operation
of a new NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for the Built
Environment (CBE) at the University of California, Berkeley. The Center will
dedicated to the industries and professions that design and construct buildings,
manufacture building components, and operate and maintain buildings. Its
objective will be to improve the performance of buildings by enhancing their
indoor environmental quality, and by improving the energy efficiency with which
that quality is produced. "Quality is being broadly defined as any
characteristic of the building affecting the comfort, health, or productivity of
its occupants. There are great opportunities to improve the performance of US
buildings through applied research and development. Additional funding is
provided in this award by the General Services Administration (GSA) to augment
the ongoing research program and to obtain a membership in the Center.
