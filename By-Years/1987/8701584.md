Ergodic theory is an active, central area of Modern Analysis. Its origins lie
in the theoretical formulation for classical statistical mechanics at the end of
the nineteenth century. The modern point of view derives from the profound
mathematical theory of recurrence and ergodicity, as developed by Poincare,
Birkhoff, von Neumann and other giants earlier in this century. As the subject
has evolved and sophistication continually increased, ergodic theory has
acquired close relationships with other branches of mathematics, such as
dynamical systems, probability theory, functional analysis, number theory,
differential topology, and differential geometry, and with applications as far
ranging as mathematical physics, information theory, and computer design. The
principal objects of study in ergodic theory are transformations of an
underlying set or space, and the ultimate goal is to determine long-term
behavior. Professor Feldman is a leader in ergodic theory whose research has
been highly influential. His recent work has involved rigidity of flows on
negatively curved manifolds, positive entropy for certain flows on Euclidean
space, non- measure-preserving transformations and random walks, and amenable
group actions and consequences for von Neumann algebras of operators. The
current proposal continues this ongoing research. In particular, Professor
Feldman will study problems related to horocycle and geodesic flows, Kakutani
equivalence, recurrence for nonstationary processes, and ordered pairs of
ergodic equivalence relations.
