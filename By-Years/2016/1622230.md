The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a medical device that
accelerates wound healing and prevents infection. Wound contamination and
infection are notoriously challenging to treat and are a significant cause of
patient morbidity and mortality. Bacterial and other microbial colonization in
wounds delay healing, cause further degradation, and can lead to severe
complications including deep tissue and bone infections, as well as stroke and
sepsis. The wound care field is large and diverse and includes acute and chronic
wounds, pre- and post-surgical care and scar prevention, burns, as well as
emergency wound care in war settings and homeland security. Due to the aging
population and increasing rates of diabetes and obesity, the entire global wound
care products market is expanding rapidly at an estimated 7% per year and
currently totals over $21B. Moreover, new financial reimbursement policies to
reduce the estimated $50B US economic burden of wounds are incentivizing
hospitals to improve care, reduce infection, and accelerate patient recovery.
The market is ripe for a medical technology that treats wound infections.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports the
development of a high voltage power supply capable of driving a cold plasma
medical device that treats wound infections. Cold plasma is ideal for treating
wound infections because it is effective against all bacteria types and is
unlikely to confer bacterial resistance. It is superior in its anti-microbial
effect compared to topical antibiotics and antiseptics but safe for human skin.
Our research objectives include scaling the output voltage, shortening pulse
width, enabling thermal, overvoltage, and overcurrent protections, and
incorporating voltage control feedback. Anticipated technical results include
completion of these research objectives and testing of the power supply with the
cold plasma device on bacterial cultures to confirm antibacterial effects.
