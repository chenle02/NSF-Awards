Funds are provided for the PIs to reconstruct thermocline hydrography in the
Western Pacific Warm Pool/Indonesian Seas spanning the lat 2000 years of the
late Holocene. The existing sediment cores have high sedimentation rates and the
proxy records can be compared to the instrumental record. The proposed work will
involve stable-isotopic anlayses and Mg/Ca ratios on planktic foraminifera as
well as benthic foraminifera H. balthica, for which the study will refine the
existing Mg/Ca-temperature calibration. In addition, a Cd/Ca calibration for
this benthic species will be established. The study, if it is able to better
characterize the upper-ocean hydrography in the Indonesian Seas will lead to a
greater understanding of late Holocene climate change in the Western Pacific
warm pool. The work is considered to have a modest risk but a high return, if it
succeeds in its objectives. Broader impacts include support of a female graduate
student who will conduct 300 Mg/Ca analyses. Part time undergraduate student
support is also included at SUNY Albany for basic lab tasks. Understanding of
the long-term ENSO dynamics would be important for other workers and modelers
alike.
