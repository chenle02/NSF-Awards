0334050&lt;br/&gt;Holland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation enhancement
award supports US-France cooperative research in theoretical atomic, molecular
and optical physics and involves graduate student Joshua N. Milstein and his
advisor, Murray J. Holland, of the University of Colorado and Christophe Salomon
at the Laboratoire Kastler Brossel, Ecole Normal Superieure (ENS) in Paris. The
project's focus is controlled interactions in ultra-cold atomic gases. This
dissertation research addresses several important issues. Among them are the
temperature level required to create a super-fluid Fermi gas, the effects on
molecular formation within a condensed Bose gas, and exploitation of the
generated molecules. ENS' Laboratoire Kastler Brossel is performing leading
experiments directly related to the student's dissertation on the theoretical
aspects of ultra-cold atomic gases. The experiments involve the use of novel
double resonance that is fundamental to understanding the behavior of ultra-cold
atomic gases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award provides travel and living
expenses for a four-month visit to France by Joshua Milstein and for his
participation in an international conference in Spain on cold atomic gases.
