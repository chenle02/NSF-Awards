This proposal involves a combined structural, petrologic, and geochemical study
of granitic plutons that formed in vast quantities in southern Alaska during
Mesozoic to Tertiary time in a convergent margin setting. Because quite alot is
already known about the region, detailed studies are likely to elucidate the
problems of magma genesis and thermal-tectonic evolution in convergent margin
settings.
