This award supports a new, multidisciplinary research training program focused
on understanding microbial gene regulation in bioremediation. A group of 16
faculty drawn from the departments of Microbiology, Biology, Chemistry, Chemical
and Biochemical Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Medicinal
Chemistry at the University of Iowa will provide education and training for
graduate students in the fundamentals of molecular genetics, microbial
metabolism, biochemical engineering, and environmental engineering. In addition
to normal departmental requirements, the training will include a set of four
required courses in biology and engineering, required laboratory rotations in
both areas, and participation in an RTG-sponsored symposium and seminar series.
Multidisciplinary thesis research, during which students will be advised by two
graduate mentors, will also be required. Undergraduate and postdoctoral students
sponsored by existing institutional and external funding sources are expected to
participate, but are not directly supported by the award. Students trained by
this program will have an unusual combination of training in basic and applied
aspects of both biology and engineering, and will have a new perspective on
environmental regulation of gene expression and the metabolic diversity of
microorganisms.
