9632604 abstract Linda Jaslow The Maricopa Community College District (MCCD)
representing the Phoenix Urban Systemic Initiative (USI), has a three-year,
$902,514 professional development program designed to enhance the USI primary
training process to broaden teachersO capacity to understand studentsO thinking
and increase access for all students so that they have a meaningful and relevant
experience with primary mathematics through the integration of Cognitively
Guided Instruction (CGI). The project will provide specific CGI enhancement for
776 teachers and instructional leaders. In addition, all 1476 teachers of
elementary mathematics will receive mathematics enhancement that has a CGI
component. This program consists of eight components that will ultimately impact
student success in primary grades not only in Phoenix but in Tucson and
Flagstaff. They include the: (1) development of a CGI leadership cadre who are
knowledgeable about CGI and its classroom implementation, (2) development of CGI
courses and integration of CGI into the USI Academies, (3) 100% of the USI
teachers trained in CGI to insure aligned curriculum and instruction for K-4
children in eight elementary school districts, (4) implementation of CGI with
University of Arizona and Tucson teachers and Northern Arizona University and
Flagstaff teachers and the establishment of local networks, (5) alignment of the
K-12 system with the university pre-service program in Tucson, Phoenix and
Flagstaff, (6) alignment of philosophy and content for the mathematics methods
courses across the state universities, (7) alignment of mathematics methods
courses and Mathematics for Elementary Teachers (MTE 180) from the Mathematics
Department at ASU, (8) networking with San Diego State University and University
of California-Los Angeles CGI projects.
