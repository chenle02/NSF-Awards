The objective of this research is to develop the theory and algorithms for
implementation of a constructive solid geometry (CSG) based 3-D object
recognition system. The proposed system starts with segmenting an object in a
range image into primitive surface patches. Then, the primitive surface patches
are classified as surfaces of primitive volumes such as spheres, cylinders,
cubes, or cones. In addition, the scales, locations, and orientations of these
primitives are estimated. The next step is to determine the order and types of
set operations on these primitives. This will be done using a precedence graph
describing the order of operations. Recognition is achieved by matching the
derived precedence graph with those in the database. Results of this research
should provide a means to unify CAD and vision databases and help to advance the
technology of automated manufacturing systems.
