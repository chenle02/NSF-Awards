Shaul Mukamel is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his research in the area of molecular relaxation
and radiative processes. He is applying Liouville space Green function
techniques to the interpretation of a variety of nonlinear optical and
spectroscopic phenomena in liquid phase systems. A number of applications are
being considered including: 1) high-order echoes in vibrational spectroscopy of
liquids; 2) multidimensional spectral density and the Kramers-Kronig
representation of optical response; 3) semiclassical simulation of nonlinear
response functions; and 4) a many body Green function approach to cooperative
radiative dynamics of confined excitons in clusters and nanostructures. The
theoretical research is being used to assist in the interpretation of
experimental spectroscopic data. Ultrafast spectroscopy has capitalized on major
technological innovations in optics and electronics to enable scientists to
interrogate molecular motions on the subpicosecond level. This has provided
chemists with new ways of studying fundamental molecular processes on the time
scale of a chemical reaction. Mukamel's research provides the necessary
theoretical interpretation of the experimental observations.
