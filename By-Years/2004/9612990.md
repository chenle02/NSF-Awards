With this Technology for Sustainable Environment award, the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program, as part of the NSF/EPA
Partnership, is supporting the research and educational activities of Dr.
Terrence J. Collins of the Department of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon
University. Professor Collins will focus his work on developing new activators
for oxidations associated with special purpose bleaching and cleaning agents.
This is a collaborative effort with the Clorox Company, a major US corporation
specializing in the laundry additive business. The activators of interest show
high reactivity, longevity, aqueous solubility and stability. Studies will be
focused on investigating the mechanism of oxidation and changes associated with
variations in reaction conditions. The studies performed under this award will
provide a basis for the design of environmentally benign and highly stable
activators for eventual use in the bleaching industry. Industries associated
with bleaching technologies are multibillion dollar global activities. The
widespread use of these activators could substantially reduce the quantities of
oxidants currently in use.
