This research is in algebraic geometry and will consider three specific
problems. One will be the study of Picard bundles on the Jacobian of an
algebraic curve and higher order differential properties of the Abel-Jacobi
mapping for a curve. Another will be the study of projective coordinate rings of
abelian varieties and complete homogeneous spaces under affine algebraic groups.
The last will be the study of the singularities of invariant hypersurfaces in
representation space of reductive groups. Algebraic geometry is one of the most
active areas of mathematical research today. Its applications stretch to all
areas of mathematics and becoming more and more important in computer science
and engineering as well.
