Summary

If funded, this project would result in the continuation of work towards
understanding the reproductive and developmental biology of Eleutherodactylus
frogs. Specifically, this would include work towards the objectives of defining
the abilities of sympatric Eleutherodactylus species to hybridize using an in
vitro fertilization assay, developing methods for sperm microinjection into
unfertilized eggs, and development of methods to enucleate unfertilized eggs.
This work will involve the development and use of techniques to manipulate both
eggs and sperm from these frogs. The long-term goal is to use these methods to
revive one or more extinct species of Eleutherodactylus frog using sperm from
long-term frozen specimens. The intellectual merit of this project is that the
genus Eleutherodactylus is the largest monophyletic genus of vertebrates and by
understanding the reproductive and developmental biology of a few species in
this genus, we gain insight into the biology of an incredibly large number of
other species. In addition, the ability to revive an extinct species would be of
considerable significance. The broader impact would include the first
demonstration of the reversal of extinction. This would open the possibility of
using these techniques for conservation, ecological remediation and the direct
study of the causes of extinction.
