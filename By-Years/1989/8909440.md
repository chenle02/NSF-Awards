Sulfur compounds in the atmosphere are known to contribute to acid
precipitation. More recently, the chemical sulfur cycle has been suggested to
influence global climate by promoting cloud or aerosol formation. Sulfonic acids
participate in the atmospheric sulfur cycle, but the fates of these acids and
their role in the eventual formation of sulfate is poorly understood. This
project will investigate the aqueous reactions of methanesulfonate and
hydroxymethanesulfonate with hydroxyl radical in order to assess the importance
of free radical oxidant interactions in governing the fate of the sulfonates in
atmospheric droplets. Pulse radiolysis and relative rate methods will be used to
obtain kinetic data. Mechanistic details will be probed by optical and esr
spectral evidence of transient intermediates. The findings should assist in
clarifying the role of organosulfur compounds in the global sulfur cycles. It is
expected that a clearer distinction between anthropogenic and natural sources of
droplet acidity will emerge from his work.
