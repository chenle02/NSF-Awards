9410613 Chang This research is focused on the development and use of a fuzzy
controller to address the problem of process design and control in a short run
production environment. The controller will provide recommendations on the
choice of machine operating parameter in a given production instance in order to
produce a part of acceptable quality. Computer simulation will be used to test
the controller in the initial phase of the research. Subsequently, data
generated from other currently existing models for process control purposes will
be used to test and fine-tune the performance of the controller. Upon the
successful development of the controller, sample parts will be designed and
processed on computer numerical control (CNC) machine to simulate a short run
production environment to further test the controller. A second objective is to
develop a process monitoring approach that uses neural network control chart
(NNCC) to integrate observations from quality characteristic and process related
information to determine process status. The outcome of the research has some
potential for industrial application to improve process quality and process
parameter selection for short-run production situation. The integration of
process control and process design provides opportunity for on-line process
monitoring for process data collection with the objective of improving product
quality through reduction in process operational variation.
