The ribosome is a large (2.5 MDa) macromolecular complex made of RNA and protein
that is responsible for translation of the genetic code in all living organisms.
Recent progress on the three-dimensional structure of the ribosome has given
many new insights regarding the molecular mechanism of action of the ribosome in
protein synthesis, including specific models that explain how specific
structural features give rise to specific functions. This project is aimed at
testing models for four functions: (a) discrimination of initiator tRNA; (b) the
role of protein S7 in E-site function; (c) the role of intersubunit bridges in
translocation of tRNA; and (d) the mechanism of unwinding of mRNA secondary
structure by the ribosome. These models will be tested by introducing mutations
in critical elements of ribosomal proteins and/or ribosomal RNA that are
proposed to be involved in these functions, followed by in vitro and/or in vivo
functional assays.
