Funds are provided to improve the output from climate field reconstructions
(CFRs) by using reduced space optimal interpolation (RSOI), which requires
climate proxies to be locally calibrated as opposed to most current approaches
which use with non-local calibration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will
analyze the currently employed non-local multivariate CFR methods and test RSOI-
derived CFRs using locally-calibrated proxies. Results will be compared and
contrasted both empirically and theoretically and will be used to reduce the
uncertainty in estimates of millennial climate variability and produce better
estimates of the spatial and temporal variability of climate.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has broad appeal to the wider science and
policy making communities in that it is attempting to improve the quantitative
nature of climate reconstructions.
