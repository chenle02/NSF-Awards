This award supports cooperative research between George Bertsch of Michigan
State University and Dr. M. Hussein of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The
principal investigators will study the theory of nuclear reactions, with
applications to phenomena under experimental investigation. In the past, they
have made studies in parallel but completely independently. Both Bertsch and
Hussein have calculated gamma decays of giant resonances; both the Michigan
State and the Sao Paulo groups are now studying fragmentation reactions related
to the properties of exotic nuclei. It will be productive to continue this work
in collaboration to take advantage of MSU's facilities and close connections in
both the theory and experimental communities. One of the collaborations, to
study pion production from exotic beams, has already started. The aim is relying
on the experience of both sides on the agreement in nuclear structure and
reaction theories and to develop a consistent and practical theory for the decay
of the giant resonances.
