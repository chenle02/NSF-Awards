Parallel algorithms for numerical models used in semiconductor device simulation
of nonequilibrium transport in two dimensions using Monte Carlo particle
methods. Such models are currently used and computed using vector serial
computers. However, by adapting Monte Carlo to parallel systems, e.g. NCUBE or
Sequent could result in substantial speedup and greatly enhance the scale and
sophistication of such models. The methodology here will be to employ a general
algorithmic analysis based on 'grain packing', a technique developed at the
Oregon State University, in order to determine the optimal parti- tioning of the
problem in a multi-processor systems. The research focuses on the parallel
versus sequential speedup obtained through parallelization of existing
sequential algo- rithms for bulk transport in GaAs and MESFET simulation using
Monte Carlo methods.
