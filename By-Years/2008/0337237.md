Understanding how the compositions of garnet and coexisting silicate melt
influence partitioning of trace elements is critical for understanding mantle
evolution in terrestrial planetary interiors. Garnet is one of the two most
important minerals (along with clinopyroxene) for fractionating trace elements
during upper mantle melting and crystallization. However, no model exists that
predicts how these fractionations evolve as a function of pressure, temperature,
and composition at pressures exceeding 4 Gpa, severely hampering development of
petrogenetic models of large-scale differentiation processes through melting in
planetary mantles. This experimental program is designed to investigate critical
controls on garnet-melt trace element partitioning at high pressure. Some of the
elements to be studied (e. g. Sm, Nd, Lu, Hf, Th) define the behavior of
isotopic systems of fundamental importance in unraveling the evolution of
planetary interiors. The project builds on recent experimental and theoretical
work that has revealed important factors affecting partitioning between garnet
and anhydrous melt, including the roles of the elements iron and titanium and
the garnet's majorite and grossular contents. We seek to acquire the data needed
to understand fully the interrelationships between these compositional controls
on garnet-melt partitioning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
