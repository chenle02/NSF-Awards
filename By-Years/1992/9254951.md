PEPP proposes to install a simple seismograph in schools and colleges, to
create a computer network to share data and information, and to form a network
of supporting IRIS-members* to train and support science teachers. The main
goals are: . To develop "hands on" seismological equipment for use at high
schools and colleges, to increase the curiosity of students to explain nature, .
To increase the understanding of physical concepts through connected lab
experiments, while developing a sense of familiarity with the seismometer as an
instrument based on these concepts, . To train teachers to do real "classroom
science" with their students and provide scientific back-up for these
activities, . To stimulate interaction between teachers in Earth sciences and
physics with researchers in geophysics, . To give teachers organizational and
intellectual support by providing materials, computer networking as well as
research opportunities, . To disseminate PEPP nationally and build a unique
seismological array that allows students and teachers to make real discoveries.
Rather than stop at the classroom "demonstration" level, PEPP tries to extend
all the way towards real science. This unique feature of PEPP will greatly
contribute towards the enthusiasm of both students and teachers. It will take
three years to develop the first PEPP modules with the necessary infrastructure
and to show the feasibility in a pilot project before moving on to a final
project at national scale.
