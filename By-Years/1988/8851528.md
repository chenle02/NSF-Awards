The aim of this project is to establish a design and analysis laboratory based
on networked engineering workstations for use by junior and senior year
undergraduates in the Civil Engineering and Mechanical Engineering design
courses at the University of Vermont. The major instruments to be purchased are
seven engineering workstations, a laser printer, and one graphics plotter for
hard copy output. The equipment is to be used in upper level design and senior
project courses for instruction and practice in modeling, design, analysis and
simulation appropriate to each course. The project is significant on several
counts: it is a logical extension of present micro-computer based design and
analysis laboratories used in freshman and sophomore courses; upper level
courses can coordinate the use of this equipment with lectures to teach design
and evaluation rather than simply analysis; it will allow rapid, effective
combination of scientific and engineering principles in areas that are normally
taught and considered independently; and it will promote rapid and effective
assimilation of our graduates into productive contributors to the nation's
industrial base.
