This research program involves the study of glasses, primarily through the use
of nuclear magnetic resonance. The proposed research is in several different
areas. One area is a collaboration (S.W. Martin, Iowa State) on 29Si magic angle
sample spinning NMR on alkali borosilicate glasses over an extremely wide range
of compositions. A second area is an continuation of studies with P. Bray
(Brown) on the 10B and 11B nuclear quadrupole resonance properties of alkali
borate glasses. Further studies will also be made of extremely high alkali
content alkali borate glasses with the emphasis on exploring the relationship
between structure and physical properties. A new collaboration with Kamitsos
(National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens) on joint infrared and Raman
spectroscopic studies of very high alkali contnet borate glasses will be
initiated.
