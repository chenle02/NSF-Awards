The investigator studies mathematical models for interfacial phenomena. The
objective is to provide a systematic study for multi-phase transitions based on
both existing and newly developed models. These are macroscopic free boundary
models, based on observable quantities and needed to deal with singularities due
to topological changes of free boundaries, and microscopic continuum models,
derived at the molecular level and (always) well-posed. One goal of the project
is to derive critical information from continuum models for free boundary models
when the latter become indeterminate. Another is to develop new microscopic
continuum models for phase transitions among phases such as solid/liquid and
different grains in polycrystals. The project is aimed at the fusion of
mathematics and material science and new developments for systems of
differential equations. The main tools used here are theories of partial
differential equations, singular perturbations, asymptotic expansions, complex
analysis, bifurcation, center manifolds, global analysis, dynamical systems, and
geometric measure. Computational simulations are used to stimulate, validate,
and further extend theoretical conclusions.

The interfacial phenomena studied in this project are commonplace in nature.
They occur whenever there is a continuum that can exist in at least two
different phases and there is some mechanism that generates a spatial separation
of these phases. The spatial boundaries that separate these phases, referred to
as interfaces or free boundaries, evolve with time due to some mechanisms of
transitions between phases. A typical two-phase transition is a solidification
process of a liquid. A classical multi-phase transition arises from evolutions
of grains in a polycrystal where alignments of atoms in different grains do not
match at grain boundaries. The growth of a solid polycrystal from a liquid
involves a two-phase transition between liquid and solid and a multi-phase
transition among grains. The use of microscopic continuum models to study phase
transitions has undergone a strong development in recent years, but major
advances have been made mostly in the case of two-phase transitions. This
project focuses on multi-phase transitions. These problems motivate new
theoretical development in free boundary problems, systems of parabolic/elliptic
partial/ordinary differential equations, and dynamical systems. Part of the
project, involving the Riemann mapping theorem, is integrated into a
graduate/undergraduate course on complex analysis to provide students with a
real-life application of mathematical theory in material science. In addition,
graduate students are involved in the project. New models developed here provide
scientists with tools in understanding and designing new materials.
