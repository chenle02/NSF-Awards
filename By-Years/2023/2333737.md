This project aims to create a prototype knowledge graph concentrating on often-
undervalued contributors within the science realm, such as individuals, research
areas, and organizations affiliated with Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) and non-Carnegie R1 institutions. The primary objective of
this project is to illuminate the expansive research landscape of the US,
promote varied collaborations, and provide an open platform for budding research
partnerships. The knowledge graph, named CollabNext, utilizes open data sources
and infrastructure and integrates AI and machine learning for data processing,
while emphasizing human-in-the-loop input to ensure data accuracy and
sustainability. A collaborative effort between Georgia Tech, Morehouse, and
Clark Atlanta University, CollabNext aims to boost research collaborations
through effective data utilization.

The project involves a multi-university collaboration and draws upon
computational thinking skills, data, and machine learning from various fields.
Its focus is on democratizing data for broader societal benefit and the
practical application of knowledge graphs. Collaborators range from academic
institutions such as Fisk University and Morehouse College to industry and
research partners like the Renaissance Computing Institute and TDP Data Systems.
CollabNext's effectiveness lies in its integration of diverse knowledge graph
entities and its commitment to an inclusive and standardized data
infrastructure. By prioritizing feedback from underrepresented researchers, the
tool is poised to increase visibility for emerging research institutions, boost
research collaborations, and foster a more diverse research workforce. Its
comprehensive database will be fully integrated into the Open Knowledge Network,
thus establishing a robust data infrastructure for other use cases.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
