The NSF-owned Research Vessel ENDEAVOR, operated under a charter party
agreement by the University of Rhode Island, has operated continuously for 16
years. The average projected life of a research vessel is 30 years. This project
will make major modifications and upgrades to the vessel to prepare her for the
second half of her operational life. The viability of an oceanographic research
vessel to conduct the changing needs of ocean science research diminishes with
time. The modifications and upgrades will modernize the ENDEAVOR and equip her
to be as effective and reliable as when she was originally delivered for service
in 1976. The improvements focus on three major areas. Improvements to increase
and enhance the ability of the ship to conduct ocean science research; upgrades
to improve the day to day operation and maintainability of the ship; and
refinements to improve the habitability of the ship. Attention to all these
areas will result in a vessel well equipped to continue a long standing
tradition of good service to the community of ocean science research.
