The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to
significantly alter the current state of electric propulsion by providing a
thruster platform with extended capabilities. Such a change would allow Hall
thrusters to span a wider range of operating parameters with added benefits of
increased efficiency, lower cost, exploration of deep space, and backup power
via a radioisotope power system (RPS). By using a RPS, the thruster platform
will produce one watt of electrical power for every nine watts of heating power.
The heating power will enable the use of high-density metal propellants such as
zinc. The electrical power will provide a backup for solar generation and can
potentially power basic satellite systems. This work will provide scientific
knowledge regarding nuclear fuel recycling, power generation, and related space
technologies. Lastly, this work will be highly collaborative and will contribute
to the training of a highly diverse workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses a
longstanding issue in space propulsion; the reliance on xenon as a fuel. The
primary objective of the proposed work is to produce a prototype Hall Effect
thruster utilizing zinc fuel and a RPS unit. A thermal management system will
manage the heat produced by the RPS unit to deliver fuel to the thruster.
Initial work will use an electrical module that will act as a placeholder for
the RPS unit; the latter can be inserted when necessary. Design of the prototype
will follow Hall Effect thruster scaling laws to reduce risk. The results of the
tested prototype will provide information on the expelled ions, thruster
efficiency, and divergence of the thruster plume. More broadly, the results will
provide data on realizing an alternative to xenon fuel for space propulsion as
part of an improved thruster platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
