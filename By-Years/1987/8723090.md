Environmental stress (thermal, osmotic) causes elimination of symbiotic algae
from reef-building corals and other tropical cnidarians, e.g., sea anemones,
often with catastrophic results. A continued investigation will be conducted on
the organismic and cellular mechanisms by which corals and other cnidarians
maintain stable symbioses, and mechanisms by which stress causes elimination of
symbiotic algae. Emphasis will be placed on studies of expulsion and digestion
of zooxanthellae, and nutrient limitation phenomena.
