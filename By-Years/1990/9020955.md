The application of radar techniques to studies of the atmosphere provides an
important means for advancing our understanding of its behavior. This work will
employ special radar facilities at the University of Illinois for a
comprehensive set of studies of the dynamics of the upper atmosphere between
altitudes of about 2 km to over 100 km, encompassing regions known as the
troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. The primary goals of the research are
(i) to improve understanding of how radar signals are scattered by the
atmosphere, and thereby to improve techniques for extracting atmospheric
information from radar data; (ii) to study turbulent structures in the upper
atmosphere, and (iii) to better our understanding of the sources and climatology
of atmospheric wave motions.
