The Meadowcreek Science Institute is a four week residential science program for
minority students from throughout Arkansas who are entering the seventh, eight
or ninth grades. A total of 50 different students who have an interest or
aptitude in science, engineering or mathematics (SEM) will participate in each
year of the three year program. The primary goal of this initiative is to
encourage underrepresented minority students from Arkansas to pursue secondary
and university level studies and subsequent careers in science, engineering and
mathematics. Students will explore energy, physics, mathematics, chemistry.

thrmugh active participation in a diverse natural setting. Students will take
part in scientific, hands-on, and interactive activities while in residence at
Meadowcreek's 1500 acre outdoor classroom which includes an 18,000 square foot
solar powered education center. Students will experience the excitement of
scientific discovery as they study biology by the side of a stream or sample
beneficial insects as part of a mathematics activity. The program is designed to
make the sciences relevant while developing communication skills and cooperative
approaches to problem solving. The Meadowcreek Science Institute will inspire
students to reach beyond self-imposed limitations through interactions with
teaching assistants, mentors and other role models. Field trips will enable
students to see science in action, while exposing students to professionals in a
variety of scientific fields. The program collaborates with the Arkansas
Statewide Systemic Initiative, Arkansas Science Crusade, Arkansas STRIVE,
Teachers of Tomorrow and the Arkansas Educational Cooperatives. Student progress
will be carefully tracked and mentors will maintain contact and continuity with
students throughout the year. A program advisory committee will monitor the
entire program as well as follow-up and ev aluation activities. ***
