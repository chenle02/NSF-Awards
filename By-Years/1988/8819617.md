The purpose of this research is to study the neurochemical, physiological and
genetic mechanisms of convulsive behavior in two different types of seizure
prone mice: those susceptible to audiogenic seizures and those susceptible to
spontaneous temporal lobe seizures. A great deal of knowledge is surfacing
regarding seizures and we are now better able to put this knowledge into a
theoretical framework. It is now possible to study seizures using genetic
approaches. The information gleaned from the projects to be undertaken will have
great bearing on how epileptic brain activity is researched in the future.
