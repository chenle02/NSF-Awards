The PI?s propose to develop an Autonomous eXpendable Instrument System (AXIS),
an advanced probe autolauncher system with higher capacity, greater
interactivity, and more efficient operation than existing research-oriented
designs. AXIS will streamline data collection using expendable probes,
facilitate novel and interactive observational approaches, and reduce both the
operational cost and logistical complexity of probe deployments from research
and commercial vessels. Support is requested to advance AXIS development from an
existing mechanical prototype to a pair of fully-functional and field-tested
systems. Initial installation of AXIS is proposed aboard the R/V Oceanus and the
M/V Oleander, a container vessel that is continuing a 30-year program of regular
measurements spanning the Gulf Stream between Bermuda and New Jersey.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
of this proposal mainly the community benefits of improved sampling. AXIS will
help to optimize sampling with these probes. It will help to reduce at-sea
personnel requirements and costs. The 2-way communication aspect makes possible
adaptive sampling to resolve transient or sparse features. There is no explicit
mention of teaching or training, although Fratantoni does interact with graduate
students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
