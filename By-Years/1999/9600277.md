9600277 Srivastava This U.S.-Brazil cooperative research effort will be led by
Santosh Srivastava at California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory (JPL) and Lee Mu-Tao of the Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos in
Brazil. They will collaborate on studies related to electron collision
properties of atoms and molecules of interest to planetary and astrophysical
environments and to the semiconductor industry. Accurate knowledge of electron
collision cross sections for more complex molecules than previously studied is
necessary for understanding the plasmas found in outer space and those used in
the semiconductor industry. The principals in this project are already funded in
their respective countries for carrying out cross section measurements, and the
laboratories involved have collaborated productively in the past. A new state-
of-the art laboratory in Sao Carlos and several students will contribute
significantly to the effectiveness of the team. Part of the funding for this
project will be provided by the Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Program of the
Physics Division at NSF. ****
