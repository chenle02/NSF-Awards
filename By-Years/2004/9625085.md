This research is a study of fundamental issues arising in multi-user
communications in environments subject to severe interference and/or noise
conditions. Important applications include mobile, indoor, and PCS wireless
systems and two-way hybrid-fiber coax (HFC) networks for broadband services to
the home. The research addresses three broad topics: (i) optimum and near-
optimum demodulation of multiple-access signals, (ii) the influence of
interference and communications techniques (e.g., modulation, demodulation,
coding, power control) on system capacity, and (iii) robust multi-user detection
and interference suppression. These topics address important challenges to
practical realization of high-performance multi-user communications in wireless,
HFC and other environments.
