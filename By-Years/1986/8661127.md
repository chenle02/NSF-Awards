The increasing application of lasers in free-space and guided wave communication
as well as remote sensing has created a need for means to detect laser signals
effectively with the desired signal-to-noise ratio in the presence of strong
ambient light. In the research, a fundamentally different approach to
discriminating laser signals from ambient background is devised by taking into
account the degree of coherence of the incident laser signal besides its well-
defined wavelengths and linewidths. In this concept, a special coherence
holographic reflecting filter will be fabricated that can discriminate between
light signals of different coherence. The novel Coherence Discriminating
Reflection (CDR) filters from this research also represent a new class of
holographic elements fabricated using photorefractive crystals (lithium
niobate). In addition to enabling more effective laser detection, the concept in
this research can also lead to a new scheme of multichannel signal multiplexing
and transmission, namely Coherence Length Multiplexing (CLM).
