ABSTRACT CTS-9412687 California State University-Long Beach P. I.: Hamid Hefazi
Under the auspices of the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry
- Engineering Faculty Internships Program, It is proposed that the PI work with
an industrial partner to develop computational tools. A numerical optimization
procedure coupled with a computational fluid dynamics analysis will be used to
maximize the efficiency of a supersonic impulse turbine blade. The results of
this project will provide the industrial partner, Allied Signal, a tool to
markedly improve their design procedures. This project will bring modern
computational techniques to bear on industrial problems. In turn, students will
benefit from contact with the industrial sponsor and enhancement of existing
courses due to industrial input.
