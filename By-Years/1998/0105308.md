This award supports the investigation of the discharge variablility of Ross Ice
Streams over the last millenium, using a combination of numerical simulation and
satellite remote sensing of flow features on the Ross Ice Shelf. The proposed
collaborative research will use the Ross Ice Shelf record of flow variability to
deduce variations in ice stream discharge over the last 1000 years. Changes in
ice stream discharge disrupt flow of the ice shelf, in both profound and subtle
ways, distorting flow features and changing crevasse patterns. The result in an
integrated record of many changes over the lifetime of the ice within the shelf.
Interpretations of flow-trace and crevasse geometry already made by Fahnestock
and others will be used as a template for the design of numerical modeling
experiments. The primary objectives are to verify the imagery existing concepts
of ice stream dishcarge variability and will produce new data sets, both which
will be use to the Antarctic glaciology community. Landsat-7 imagery will be
used to measure velocity in areas of particular interest where existing data are
inadequate. MODIS data, which has better radiometric and spatial resolution will
be used to improve feature mapping on the ice shelf in sensitive areas.
