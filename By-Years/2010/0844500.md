This project is investigating linguistic extensions to map/reduce abstractions
for programming large-scale distributed systems, with special focus on
applications that manipulate large, unstructured graphs. It targets real-world
graph analysis tasks found in comparative analysis of biological networks as an
important case study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is investigating the
following specific questions: (i) how can highly unstructured graph-based
formalisms be cast in the map/reduce framework? (ii) how effectively can these
specifications leverage existing map/reduce infrastructure? (iii) how can these
abstractions and their execution environments be enhanced to provide the
semantic expressiveness necessary for programmability and scalable performance?
(iv) how can these analysis tasks be integrated into comprehensive scientific
resources usable by the wider applications community? Answers to these questions
entails exploring linguistic extensions to existing map/reduce abstractions,
defining new implementations on wide-area multicore/SMP platforms, and crafting
an expressive graph analysis toolkit suitable for realistic deployment in
important domains such as systems biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results that
arise from this project advance the state-of-the-art in analysis of large sparse
unstructured graphs and directly impact a very broad class of scientific
applications. Beyond specific target applications in biology, graph-based
formalisms find direct applications in social sciences (social networks),
recommender systems, and commerce (networks of transactions).&lt;br/&gt;
