This is a novel electrical/computer engineering approach to a difficult problem
of determining disease states of the heart from EKGs. A new era is emerging,
namely, that of "smart computers", ie., computers that have sufficiently large
CPUs (central processing units) that the ability to make "judgments" can be
programmed. This proposal utilizes this capability to "make judgments" on the
physical condition of the heart from voltage measurements on the skin, ie., an
EKG. It is clear that this is a high-risk high-gain research proposal. If
successful, this type of research could revolutionize diagnosis in cardiology.
