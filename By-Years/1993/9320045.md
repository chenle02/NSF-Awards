ABSTRACT 9320045 Hogan This grant will support research on two projects in
observational cosmology. As a test of hot big bang cosmology, the PI and a
graduate student propose to measure the cosmic abundance of deuterium in high
redshift QSO absorption clouds, using high-resolution spectra (about 10- 20
km/sec) of five QSO's with high column density hydrogen absorbers known to be
optically thick in the Lyman continuum. Using fits to a number of Lyman series
absorption lines in each absorption system they aim to obtain D/H in the
absorbing clouds with sufficient accuracy for a rigorous test of cosmological
theory, a test of the universal character of the deuterium abundance, and a
measurement of the abundance in a relatively pristine environment where the
universe is much younger. The PI and another graduate student propose to detect
and catalogue line-emitting galaxies near damped QSO absorbers, using narrow-
band imaging of damped QSO absorber and high-redshift protogalaxies, which will
be used to constrain theories of cosmic structure formation. Data for both
projects will be gathered primarily at the new 3.5M telescope at the Apache
Point Observatory. ***
