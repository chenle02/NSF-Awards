social and scientific attention to ethical issues arising in the undertaking of
scientific research and in its social impact. This workshop brings together
interested and knowledgeable persons from a wide range of backgrounds to
facilitate the development of undergraduate course material dealing with ethical
issues in physics. These issues involve interactions within the physics
community (such as those related to the publication process and research
standards) as well as between physicists and society (such as those related to
the role of physicists as technical advisors and the impact of physics research
on society). Workshop participants will identify topics suitable for course
modules, ethical issues or problems associated with the topics, and relevant
bibliography and key references for classroom use. Results will include a
publication detailing the results of the workshop and shorter papers for
relevant physics journals. This effort lays the groundwork for further proposals
to develop the course modules and related activities. ***
