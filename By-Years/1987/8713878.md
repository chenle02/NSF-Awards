This award supports collaborative research on the interaction between the
cryosphere and climate to test hypotheses concerning relationships of snow with
other climate variables in western China. Dr. George Kukla, Lamont-Doherty
Geological Observatory, Columbia University, Dr. David Robinson, Rutgers
University and professor Lo Peiji, Lanshou Institute of Glaciology and
Geocryology will use ground truth data gathered in western China, a ten year
long satellite derived record of snow cover, and a thirty-year climate record to
define the mean characteristics and variability of snow cover and surface
albedo, and to test certain hypotheses about relationships between snow and
other climate variables in western China and adjacent regions. It is anticipated
that through this combination of remote sensing historical data and on-site
observations, valuable data sets will be collected which may lead to improved
forecasts of seasonal weather, including summer monsoons, throughout central and
eastern Asia. This project is jointly supported by NSF and the Chinese Academy
of Sciences under the Protocol on Cooperation in Basic Sciences.
