This award is for partial support for the activities of the Government-
University-Industry Research Roundtable (GUIRR). NSF is one of twelve Federal
agencies and 13 industry/university partnerships providing core financial
support to GUIRR. The Roundtable has two objectives: to provide a place where
national leaders from all sectors of the research enterprise can discuss in
candor and in a structured way opportunities and issues that challenge or
trouble them; and, to contribute to national policy by structuring and
illuminating issues, and injecting imaginative thought into policy
deliberations. The Roundtable's agenda focusses on the central issues facing the
research enterprise, particularly where there are conflicts and differing
perspectives between the sectors.
