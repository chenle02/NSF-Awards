This grant funds participation of academics for an interagency workshop on
Computational Science &amp; Engineering Software Sustainability and Productivity
Challenges (CSESSP Challenges), which will take place on Oct 15-16. See
https://www.nitrd.gov/csessp/. Government agencies that fund and develop
software for Computational Science &amp; Engineering are concerned that planning
for software pays attention mostly to the initial development of software and
not for the operation, maintenance and ongoing sustainability. Computational
Science &amp; Engineering software often demand decades of useful life, thus
these factors are of utmost importance. The productivity and sustainability
issues impede the advancement of computation science and engineering, which is
important to US competitiveness. The workshop will involve a diverse set of
participants from different sectors and regions and will pay attention to
Inclusion of under-represented groups.
