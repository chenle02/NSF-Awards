This three part research project to study the details of chemical vapor
deposition processes is supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program. It is carried out in the laboratory of Professor Nuzzo at the
University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign. New methods are developed for the
direct deposition of sub-micron structures, using a combination of sol-gel
chemistry, patterned metallization, and patterned catalyzed polymerization.
Molecular beam deposition coupled with surface spectroscopic characterization of
adsorbed intermediates is used to characterize the details of the CVD growth
process. Phase behavior in self assembled organic thin films forms the focus of
the third part of this project. The results of this research are applicable to
the developing technologies of nanoscale fabrication and electronic device
preparation. Understanding the details of the synthesis and growth of thin films
of electronically interesting materials is the focus of this research project.
Self assembled organic overlayers, sol-gel chemistry, and detailed kinetic
studies of chemical vapor deposition combine to provide the knowledge base
essential to apply new thin layer growth methods to the preparation of material
microstructures. Electronic device processing technologies are impacted by this
work.
