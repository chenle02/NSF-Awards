9526904 Nielson This project is the continuation of technical and logistical
support of the U.S. Continental Scientific Drilling Program. DOSECC (Drilling,
Observation and Sampling of the Earth's Continental Crust, Inc.) seeks funding
for the Office of the Drilling Engineer at Texas A & M University and the Office
of the Executive Director at the University of Utah. The efforts proposed here
are essential for a coordinated U.S. Continental Scientific Drilling Program.
DOSECC represents the scientific drilling interests of 43 universities, 3
national laboratories and 1 state survey. DOSECC is well-placed to support the
International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) and to maintain a
close working relationship with the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP). In spite of
budget limitations and the perceived competition with other important science
programs, continental scientific drilling is alive and well and active as a tool
to assist modern earth scientists in determining the true three dimensional
structure of the upper part of the earth's crust and the processes at work in
it. ***
