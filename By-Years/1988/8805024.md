The University of Texas at El Paso will provide an unusual research environment
for six students, probably Hispanics and women, from the University and the
neighboring El Paso Community College during the summer and academic year. The
projects planned include instrumentation for surface adsorption studies, a
charged particle energy analyzer, and astronomical measurements, in addition to
radiometer analysis, acoustics experiments and other surface science
experiments. Students will be working half-time on the project during the summer
and part-time during two long academic year sessions to allow them to continue
to work outside the University to contribute to family income. This project is
supported under the \program of Research Experiences for Undergraduates to help
ensure an adequate supply of scientists for the future.
