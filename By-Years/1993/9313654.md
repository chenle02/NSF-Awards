9313654 Candela The goal of this proposal is to obtain long time series of data,
which can be used to examine the annual and inter-annual signal in the flow
through the straits of Sicily and Gibraltar, and to develop a method for long-
term monitoring of the Atlantic- Mediterranean exchange. The proposed work
consists of a two-year (1/94-1/96) moored array of current-meters, and pressure,
temperature and conductivity sensors at the Strait of Gibraltar. It will be
undertaken in cooperation with the European Community-sponsored PRIMO-1 program.
Four six-month deployments are anticipated, all using a Spanish naval vessel. In
addition a total of six sea level (PTC) sensors will be installed bracketing the
Gibraltar moorings and the European's ones in the strait of Sicily. *** P Q R S
