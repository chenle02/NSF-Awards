California State University, Office of the Chancellor, proposes to hold a
national video conference in October, 1993. This would be the fourth in a series
of similar conferences offered in April, 1992, March and April 1993. This
conference is directed toward teachers of Calculus. Its intent is to inform
teachers of Calculus about new curricula and approaches to teaching and learning
in an environment of reform. Examples of successful Calculus programs will be
shown and individuals in sites around the country will participate by two way
audio between the site and Long Beach, CA, the origination point of the video
signal. A marketing plan includes promotion, registration, advance materials,
self assessment tools, evaluation and follow-up.//
