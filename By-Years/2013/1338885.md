This project will examine how energy is processed by collisional energy transfer
through rotational and vibrational states of water and other small organic
molecules. These fundamental processes, which are at the core of many chemical
phenomena, are very poorly understood and are not amenable to simple
experimental analysis. In collaboration with a leading computational expert at
the University of Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris, France, the researchers will
conduct benchmark calculations for these processes. The data from this study has
the potential to have a profound impact on the fields of astrophysics and
astrochemistry.

Understanding energy transfer in a molecule as important as water will provide a
clearer understanding of how energy is processed, in both terrestrial and
astrophysical environments. This study has the potential to yield insight on the
early history of the Earth?s atmosphere and make a significant contribution to
global databases of astrophysics and astrochemistry. The international
collaboration will offer the postdoc involved in the study outstanding access to
the facilities and expertise of leading scientists in the field, and ensure that
the US postdoc can participate in a globally competitive workforce.
