The Institute for Rock Magnetism (IRM) at the University of Minnesota will
conduct research on rock magnetism as a multi-user facility for the next five
years. They will operate a full suite of sensitive instrumentation for detailed
study of magnetic properties of natural materials, provide for training of
graduate and postgraduate students in state-of-the-art paleomagnetic analysis
techniques and facilitate international collaborations through the Visiting
Fellows program and a biennial conference series. Paleomagnetic and geomagnetic
research crosscuts many of the disciplinary areas of the Earth Sciences
Division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research facilitated by the analytical and
technical capabilities of the IRM includes high resolution studies of
variability in the intensity of the Earth's magnetic field in order to elucidate
fundamental questions surrounding the origin of the geodynamo, characterization
of the properties of microbial nanophase magnetic minerals, and the origin of
magnetization in minerals and the behavior of magnetic minerals in response to
environmental perturbations in temperature and applied magnetic fields. The
scale of investigations extends from bacterial magnetic particles and
environmental reconstructions to plate tectonic reconstructions and magnetic
mapping of other planets.
