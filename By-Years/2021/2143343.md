There is currently and autocratic revolution where autocratic regimes become
increasingly technologically capable, economically vibrant, and politically
stable, yet researchers have not explored the long-term consequences of such a
development. This research will use a series of large data sets and innovative
research methods to study the political, economic, and social consequences of
artificial intelligence innovation (AI) led by modern autocracy. The research
project first examines whether frontier innovation can be sustained under
autocracy; then investigates the impact of AI-led political and social controls
on citizens; and finally assess the consequences on global politics through
trade. Specifically, the research studies conditions under which autocracy can
coexist with innovation and whether citizens may be able to use AI to protect
themselves from autocratic control, and finally, how autocratic rule may be
spread globally through the exports of AI technology that bolsters autocracy.
The results of this research will provide important inputs into policies to
strengthen democratic governance globally and to solidify the U.S. as the global
leader in promoting democracy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research will
use three projects to study the interaction between technological innovation as
exemplified by artificial intelligence (AI) and modern autocratic rule. The
first project will use a large data set to investigate whether a different
political economy equilibrium in which autocracy and sustained technological
progress are in symbiotic relationship where AI innovation is stimulated by
political control can emerge. The second project combines field experiments with
administrative data to study how citizens change their behavior when a large
number of daily actions are explicitly monitored by autocratic rulers, and
whether such experience shapes privacy preferences. The third project will build
a large data set on AI exports and use the data to investigate whether: (i)
autocracies have comparative advantage in AI technology, and (ii) countries
importing AI technology from autocracies subsequently increase political
suppression. The results of this research will provide important inputs into
policies to strengthen democratic governance globally and to solidify the U.S.
as the global leader in promoting democracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
