Dr. Provine is investigating the origins, development, and influence of the
neutral theory of molecular evolution in relation to modern evolutionary
biology. The neutral theory states that the vast majority of changes at the
molecular level in natural populations are caused by random fixation, through
random sampling drift, of selectively neutral or nearly neutral mutations. This
is a strikingly new theory unrelated to earlier theories of selectively neutral
evolution except in certain formal aspects, and has stimulated more than two
decades of intense controversy among evolutionary biologists. Dr. Provine is
using the selectionist/neurtralist debate as a window through which to view the
complex interactions of the new molecular biology with evolutionary biology of
the 1970s and 1980s. He is examining this debate through an historical and
cultural perspective.
