Dr. James Nowick has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Nowick's doctoral degree was from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology under the supervision of Professor Rick Danheiser. Dr. Nowick intends
to continue research at M. I. T. under the sponsorship of Professor Julius
Rebek. Dr. Nowick's area of postdoctoral research will be the development of a
chiral macrocyclic host as a catalyst for HCN addition of aldehydes. These
macrocycles may serve as models for synthetic enzymes. The Postdoctoral Research
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
