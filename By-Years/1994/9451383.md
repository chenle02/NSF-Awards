9451383 Bocarsly An undergraduate laboratory for computational chemistry is
being established. This laboratory and the accompanying computational exercises
are designed to interface with laboratory courses at each level of the
undergraduate curriculum, including general, inorganic, organic and physical
chemistry. Each of the computational exercises concerns aspects of compounds
which are the subject of experimental studies in the course curricula. Thus, in
each case, students are either synthesizing and/or performing physical studies
on the same materials which are the subjects of their computations. The
intention behind this approach is twofold. First, each exercise provides the
student with a demonstration of the power of computational techniques in
chemistry. In addition, the use of a combination of methods (experimental and
computational) to study a given molecular system illustrates for students that
science often progresses by focusing a broad variety of techniques on a single
problem. The computer laboratory is structured as follows: two graphics
workstations with large computational capacity are networked to ten Macintosh
and ten personal computers. The small systems serve as terminals for the
workstations. Students construct their molecular models at the small computer
systems and submit their calculations to one of the workstations. This structure
makes the software capacity and the computational power of the workstations
available to all users. Both Macintosh and personal computers are available so
that educational software written for either of these platforms can be
incorporated.
