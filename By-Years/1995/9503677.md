The study of plasma physics is common to both laboratory experimentalists and
space experimentalists; yet the interchange between these two groups is
frequent. We are organizing a third workshop for these two communities to
discuss experiment, simulations, and theory of common interest, to be held in
Pitlochry, Scotland, July 24-28, 1995. The subjects chosen will emphasize areas
where progress is being made both in the laboratory and space. The include
topics such as: Critical Velocity, Reconnection, Ion Cyclotron Waves, Beam Drive
Instabilities, Anomalous Resistivity, Double Layers, Collisionless Shocks,
Nonlinear and Kinetic Alfven Waves, Active Space Experiments, Turbulence and
Transport. The need for these two communities to interact more closely has
already been recognized by the AGU which held sessions on this subject at AGU
meetings. We also held a successful meeting in Alpbach, Austria July 1-6, 1991,
and in Banff, Canada, June 21-25, 1993. We expect that the attendees will be
primarily specialists from the laboratory and space communities. Some advanced
graduate students will also attend.
