9354124 Hall St. Mary's University will use the MIE planning grant to form
collaborative teams of educators representing undergraduate and graduate higher
education institutions and leaders in industry to assess current strengths and
weaknesses of the SEM disciplines at St. Mary's and then develop a comprehensive
proposal for Phase II Implementation designed to address the MIE program goals.
These goals are to increase the number of minority students who will be prepared
to enter SEM fields, excel in their studies, and pursue advanced SEM degrees.
The planning process will consist of activities designed to: 1) assess the
quality and effectiveness of selected SEM disciplines at St. Mary's by
recognized leaders in academia and industry; 2) analyze existing models of
excellence in targeted SEM disciplines at collaborating universities in order to
transfer appropriate elements of those programs to St. Mary's; 3) establish a
plan-or-action to link St. Mary's SEM graduates to participating universities
with outstanding graduate degree programs; and 4) to develop and write a
comprehensive proposal for Phase II Implementation of the MIE program.
