The research is aimed at elucidating the behavior of various doped silicon-
germanium alloys during rapid melting and solidification. The emphasis is on
understanding the kinetic and thermodynamic behavior of rapidly moving
interfaces, and the mechanisms by which phenomena such as crystal nucleation,
crystal growth, and solute trapping occur. Laser melting and solidification are
being studied. Characterization techniques include transient conductance,
transient reflectance, transmission electron microscopy, and Rutherford
Backscattering spectroscopy. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics is being used to
model the structure.
