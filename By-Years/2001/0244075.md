0244075 Jones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support to Louisiana Tech
University to establish a three-year Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) Site for 10 students each year for research in the area of micro and nano
engineering. The REU site is designed as a ten-week summer experience and will
provide students with an understanding of micromanufacturing and nanotechnology
for research in the interdisciplinary fields of biomedical engineering,
trenchless technologies, and electromechanical engineering. Students will be
recruited primarily from the region around Louisiana Tech University with a
focus on students from colleges and universities that either do not currently
have graduate programs in engineering or have limited masters programs in
engineering. Student participants will be actively sought from Grambling State
University, Southern University and A&amp;M College, Prairie View A&amp;M
University, and Jackson State University. This REU Site is supported by the
Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU
Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
