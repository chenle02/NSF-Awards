9419600 Robertson This proposal is to develop a prototype network and associated
databases to link engineers using modern communication technology. This project
will use the World Wide Web with a dedicated server to access the relevant
databases. This facility will be used initially by the engineering community in
connection with sustainable development activities in the United States and in
Latin America. It will enable that community to collaborate on problems of the
environment and engineering in a manner not now possible. After being
demonstrated, and using the World Wide Web, it will be possible for engineers
throughout the world to collaborate on sustainable development and related
issues with improved ease. ***
