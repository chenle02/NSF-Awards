This NSF EAGER project is to develop novel prototypes for (1) iconic image
analysis and recognition for retrieval, classification annotation, and analysis
of iconic digital imagery of Cypriot cultural heritage materials, and (2)
searching and exploring the Ancient Cypriot Secretariat Corpus. (The corpus
contains works from antiquity to early Christian era written in period text and
describing scientific, philosophical, social commentary, etc.) The project will
involve computer scientists, archeologists and art historians from Penn State
and The Cyprus Institute. The systems developed will allow users to search for
the iconic images in representative of Cypriot culture at various times of
history based on such characteristics as image content, shape sketches, and
metadata. From the Secretariat Corpus, end-users will be able to search for
items belonging to different categories such as daily life at different periods,
mythology, religion, politics, language, landscape, events and other categories.
Strong support for this project has been pledged by the Cyprus Institute. The
NSF Office of International Science and Engineering will co-sponsor the award.
