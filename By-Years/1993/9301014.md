The overall objectives of this research program are to synthesize novel
precursors containing metal-sulfur linkages; to develop a fundamental
understanding of the molecular processes involved in the formation of precursors
and structural evolution of the sulfide ceramics; and, to correlate the
precursor chemistry with the microstructure and optical properties of the dense
ceramic. Cubic lanthanum sulfide is selected as the representative system in the
studies. Other sulfides, such as titanium sulfide, zinc sulfide, and gallium
sulfide, can also be selected for this study. %%% This proposed research aims to
use modified metal alkoxide and metal thioalkoxide to synthesize sulfide
ceramics of reactive metals which have strong affinity for oxygen. These metals
include lanthanum, titanium, zinc, and gallium. This studies will seek
fundamental understandings of the molecular processes involved in the formation
of precursors and the subsequent evolution of sulfide ceramics. This study shall
enhance our knowledge in the area of controlled chemical synthesis of non-oxide
sulfide ceramics.
