Serverless computing promises to revolutionize the computation is structured in
many of the cloud services that power the modern world. Unfortunately, while the
operational and cost benefits of serverless architectures make it an attractive
alternative to today’s server-oriented deployment, for users with existing
services, migrating to the new paradigm can be challenging due to some
fundamental differences between the architectures. The project’s novelties are
the exploration of the requirements, opportunities, and limitations of automatic
migration from more traditional application architectures to the serverless
paradigm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet these goals, the researchers develop a
formal notion of correctness for the desired migration as well as a provably
correct and methodical translation between the vocabulary of traditional
microservices and that of serverless infrastructure. The correct translation
will then be iteratively optimized to create successively more efficient
implementations. Finally, these techniques are integrated into practical and
deployable systems, which are evaluated on real code and workloads. The
project’s impacts are to make the development of cloud services both simpler and
more efficient. The project trains graduate students at the intersection of
formal methods and distributed systems, engages undergraduate students in
research, and disseminates results in the form of publicly available course
materials and open-source software artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
