This proposal requests funds to augment our current NSF program to establish
and maintain a deep-water hydrographic station near Oahu, Hawaii as part of the
Global Ocean Flux Study (GOFS) program. Our scientific objectives are: (1) to
observe and interpret the seasonal and interannual variability in the biology
and chemistry of the mixed layer and the euphotic zone, (2) to observe and
interpret the seasonal and interannual variability in the rates of particle flux
and apparent rates of particle remineralization over the water column and (3) to
understand the interrelationships between the processes mentioned in (1) and (2)
above and the physical characteristics of the water column. Water column
physical characteristics will be analyzed as part of the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) during joint GOFS-WOCE cruises. If successful, this
augmentation request will support: (1) a full-time data specialist who will be
responsible for record keeping, quality control and distribution of data to the
scientific community, (2) a half-time marine technician for additional field
support of HOT program activities and to interface with other NSF grantees
working at Station ALOHA.
