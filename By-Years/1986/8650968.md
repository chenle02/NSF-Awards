In this project, the Aeronautical Engineering Department at California
Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo is using an Aerolab sting balance
to utilize fully the capabilities of the Cal Poly wind tunnel. This system
exhibits the basic principles of aerodynamic design and introduces the student
to modern instrumentation and experimental techniques. Students conduct tests of
realistic (3-dimensional) models, investigate pitching movement (nose up), study
asymmetric characteristics, test devices without a two-dimensional counterpart,
and investigate stability and control. The sting balance system is used in
several required undergraduate courses of the Aeronautical Engineering
Department, and significantly improves undergraduate instruction.
