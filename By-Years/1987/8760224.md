This proposal describes research on bioreactor scale up of plant cell culture
directed toward plant propagation. In Phase I research, the PI proposes to clone
a breeder's cross hybrid of celery in a 1 to 4 liter bioreactor. Using this
system, he proposes to identify the importance of agitation, aeration, and time
in liquid culture on the yield and performance of developing celery somatic
embryos. He further proposes to determine the level of singulation and
synchronization of embryos resulting from regeneration in the bioreactor. A
method for separating embryos from debris and immature embryos will be
determined. Finally, several hundred somatic embryos will be regenerated and
transplanted to the field. During Phase II research, he proposes to complete the
field evaluation of plant variation as well as continue bioreactor studies.
Development of these techniques could enable commercialization and delivery of
hybrid crops where hybrid seed production methods do not currently exist.
