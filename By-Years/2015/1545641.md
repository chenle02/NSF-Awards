"Big Data" has emerged as a new approach to computing that is transforming
science, engineering, medicine, health care, finance, business, and ultimately
society itself. The IEEE International Conference on Big Data 2015 (IEEE BigData
2015) provides a leading venue for disseminating the latest research in big data
research, development, and applications. The conference will take place in Santa
Clara, California from October 29 - November 1, 2015. The conference co-chairs
are Dr. Laura Haas (IBM), and Prof. Vipin Kumar (U. Minn.). The program
committee co-chairs are: Dr. Howard Ho (IBM), Prof. Beng Chin Ooi (National
Univ. of Singapore), and Prof. Mohammed J. Zaki (RPI). This award will help
support travel of Ph.D. students at U.S. universities who are primary authors on
full papers that have been accepted to the technical program or are
participating in the doctoral student symposium. Special efforts are being made
to recruit and fund women and minority students.

This conference solicits high-quality original research papers in any aspect of
big data, including infrastructure, management, search and mining, security and
privacy, and applications. Contributions will advance the state of the art in
techniques, algorithms, and systems.
