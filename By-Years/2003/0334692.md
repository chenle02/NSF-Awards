This is a post-doctoral research proposal to simulate radio-meteor echoes and to
create a parameterization model of meteor observations. Testing and development
of the parameterized model is to be accomplished using observations made at a
range of frequencies with the USAF ALTAIR, Piura, Jicamarca, Arecibo, and MU
radars. The model is then converted to an automatic reduction system capable of
automatically converting observations to the specified meteor properties of
mass, density, velocity, composition, and ion-to-neutral ratio. The product is
to be made available to researchers using radar techniques to study meteor
influx into the atmosphere.
