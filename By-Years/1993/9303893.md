This research is to use regional broadband data to study Pn and Sn propagation
in North America, initially concentrating on the western United States. The
regional phases Pn and Sn are sensitive to structure in the uppermost mantle,
providing information that is difficult to obtain from other seismic phases on
the degree and nature of heterogeneity and anisotropy in the subcrustal
lithosphere. The work will investigate the questions of frequency- dependent
travel times and azimuthal anisotropy, both of which address the larger question
of the small-scale structure of the continental upper mantle. This funding is
under the NSF Research Planning Grant program for women.
