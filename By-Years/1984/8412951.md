The objectives of this research are the identification of the dominant processes
producing and consuming hydroxyl, carbon dimer, and hydrocarbon radical and the
chemistry leading to the chemiluminescence of these species and determination of
kinetic rate constants, where possible, for the participating reactions. A
suitable series of rich acetylene/oxygen/nitrogen flames which burn stably and
cover a wide range of stoichiometries with temperatures ranging from about 1800
to 2500K will be established. The measurement program will consist of
characterizing the laminar, one-dimensional burnt-gas flows above a flat flame
burner. Each measured parameter will be monitored at several points along the
hot gasprofiles corresponding to times of 0.25 to 5.0 ms from the reaction zone.
Laser-induced fluorescence will be employed to monitor OH, C2, and
CHconcentration variatons, and Na/Li measurements will be made for
H-atomconcentrations. Chemiluminescence of OH, C2, and CH will be followed
inemission along each flame profile. Flame temperatures will be measured by the
sodium line-reversal method.
