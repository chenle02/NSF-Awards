The principal investigator will study interacting super- Brownian motions.
Super-Brownian motion is a measure-valued diffusion that arises as a high
density limit for a population of particles evolving in such a way that the
total number of particles grows as a critical, continuous-time, Galton-Watson
branching process, whilst in between births/deaths the particles move as
independent Brownian motions. The goal of this research is to construct similar
models for two populations which incorporate localized interaction terms. The
import of these extra terms is to capture competition effects in which the
presence of individuals from one population adversely affects the chance for
individuals from the other population to successfully replicate themselves.
