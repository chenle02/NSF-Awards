Compile-time type information is believed to be very valuable in efficient
compilation of functional languages such as Standard ML. But little is known on
how to support type-directed compilation in real compilers and how much
performance gain one can get from various type-based optimizations. The goal of
this research is to design and identify important type-directed compilation
techniques that can significantly improve the performance of ML programs. These
new compilation techniques are expected to lead to the following nice results:
(1) data objects (including recursive data structures) in ML programs will be
able to use unboxed data representations that are as efficient as those in C
programs; (2) polymorphic functions and parametrized modules will be implemented
efficiently through cross-module type specialization and inlining expansion; (3)
type information propagated into the compiler back end will be used to assist
program analysis such as closure analysis and instruction scheduling. The
educational component of this CAREER award seeks two objectives: the
construction of a new compiler lab kit (based on the above type-based ML
compiler) and the incorporation of state-of-the-art compiler technology into the
undergraduate and graduate curriculum.
