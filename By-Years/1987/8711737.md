This award supports a two year continuing grant for Dr. Wofsy and his co-
investigator Dr. Lipschultz to begin work on nitrogen uptake by various
subpopulations of marine particulate material. Previous measurements of nitrogen
uptake by marine microbes has been done on bulk samples and this method has
grouped the activity of many contributing subpopulations. The present
investigators will separate the particulate populations using a cell sorter and
analyze these small samples using newly developed modifications to emission band
spectroscopy. This work will produce our first quantitative analysis of the
influence of detrital material on nitrogen rate measurements that are thought to
limit the biological productivity of much of the world ocean.
