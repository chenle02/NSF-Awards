This is the second offering of a "Short Course on Applied Optics for College
Teachers" by the staff at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan. Twenty
undergraduate teaching faculty are instructed on the principles and applications
of optics in engineering. Lectures, demonstrations, with "hands-on" laboratory
experiments and projects represent the core of this course. Topics include
geometrical optics, Fourier analysis, diffraction theory, interferometry,
holography, Moire' methods, optical data processing methods and nondestructive
testing. Prepared notes on most of the topics are available to the participants.
Participants receive intensive experience with the latest in optical equipment
and instrumentation, much of which is computer-controlled. In addition to the
extensive optical facilities of Oakland University, the latest equipment
available is on loan from manufacturers and suppliers and set up for participant
user. Follow-up evaluation of this experience will be conducted one year later.
Participant travel expenses are cost shared by the participant's home
institution.
