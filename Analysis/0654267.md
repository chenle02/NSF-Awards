Analytical and Geometrical Problems in Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations

Abstract of Proposed Research Luis Caffarelli

This research is to study the mathematical analysis of a number of scientific
phenomena that are modeled by nonlinear partial differential equations. Specific
topics include the properties of solutions of nonlinear problems involving
anomalous (in particular integral) diffusion processes, such as phase
transitions, fluid dynamics and optimal control. Also nonlinear random
homogenization of fully non linear equations or constrained problems in randomly
perforated domains. Antenna design for general signal propagation laws, and
other Minkowski type problems

Specific examples of the type of phenomena being studied include the analysis of
equations modeling boundary control (optimizing insulation shape across a
surface, or the behavior of semi permeable membranes), surface flame propagation
and the pricing of options when processes are highly discontinuous ( Levi
processes). Also the effective heating of a family of small, randomly
distributed, heating sources, the propagation of a flame on a medium with random
occlusions or the sliding of a drop on a rough surface and the design of an
optimal reflecting surface in a periodic medium.
