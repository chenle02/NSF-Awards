This project will focus on problems arising in the field of analytic torsion
and the classical analytic torsion of Riemann surfaces. The work centers on
classical moduli problems in theta-functions, analytic torsion and vector
bundles on Riemann surfaces. Studies of tau-theta functions constructed from
analytic torsion, from the loop-group approach using the Szego-kernel and from
matrix singular integral operators using abelian Cauchy kernels will be carried
out. The Szego-kernel and theta-functions will be developed for monodromy groups
on punctured Riemann surfaces; this will help in the further understanding of
isomonodromy deformations on higher-genus Riemann surfaces and the spectral
curve (double-cover) approach to the moduli space of rank-two bundles. There
will also be research on the spin-zero torsion divisor and the meromorphic
extension of the classical Bergman and Szego kernel-functions to the moduli
space of flat bundles with connections. This work is related with both classical
mathematical function theory as well as deep questions arising in mathematical
physics concerned with monodromy preserving deformations.
