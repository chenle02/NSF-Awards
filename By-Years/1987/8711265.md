It is now widely recognized that the acquisition of information plays a key role
in real world economies as well as in theoretical economic analyses. This
project studies experimentation by consumers and firms with different decisions
to acquire better information for future decisions. For example, firms will
choose output levels above or below what they think is profit maximizing in
order to test and improve their information about the market. This type of
experimentation is widely observed but is not adequately explained by existing
economic theory. This project will help improve our understanding of
experimentation by consumers and by producers by formulating general models of
information acquisition through experimentation and analyzing the comparative
statics and the existence of solutions to these models. Specifically, the
project studies a maximizing consumer who chooses output to get both present
utility and better information for making future decisions. Preliminary results
show that consumption with experimentation will be greater than myopically
optimal levels of consumption. But these results depend on very restrictive
assumptions about consumer uncertainty. This project relaxes these assumptions
in order to find more general and realistic results and to examine interesting
special cases. The project deals with models of entry in which the incumbent
firm has more information than potential entrants. Preliminary work by the
investigator demonstrates that the incumbent firm can discourage new entrants by
producing more than the output that maximizes current profits. This result holds
even when the potential entrants know that the incumbent firm is trying to
persuade them through its pricing and output policies that the industry is less
profitable than it actually is. These entry models assume that potential
entrants choose either to enter or not. This project analyzes the much more
complicated but also more realistic situation in which potential entrants can
test the market by output decisions.
