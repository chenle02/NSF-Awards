The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a 300 Mhz Fourier transform nuclear
magnetic resonance spectrometer. The spectrometer is being integrated into the
curriculum beginning with hands-on training in 1H and 13C NMR techniques in the
sophomore Organic Chemistry course. Students in nine other required courses are
expanding upon these techniques in multi- dimensional experiments. Extensive use
of the instrument is also being made by undergraduate students engaging in
research projects on, for example, polysaccharides, synthesis of compactin
lactones, organometallic compounds and, histone proteins.
