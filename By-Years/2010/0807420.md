This research will pursue some new directions in the area of control and
differential games. Three main topics will be investigated: (i) Nash equilibrium
solutions in feedback form, for non-cooperative differential games. These will
be studied by looking at the system of Hamilton-Jacobi equations for the value
functions, and using a homotopy approach to connect solutions of the
differential game to the solution of a corresponding optimal control problem.
(ii) The control of mechanical systems by means of active constraints. In
particular, it is proposed to study the issues of global controllability,
optimal control, and the asymptotic stabilization to an equilibrium position.
(iii) A new mathematical model describing the spreading of a wild fire in terms
of a differential inclusion. It is here assumed that fire propagation can be
stopped by constructing barriers, in real time, along rectifiable curves in the
plane. In this connection the existence and the properties of optimal
strategies, which minimize the total area of the burned region, will be
investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research on differential games will
specifically focus on price-inventory games, providing a better understanding of
what should the ?rational strategies? be in a competitive economic situation,
where different groups of producers and consumers try to manipulate the market
to their own advantage. The study of mechanical systems is primarily motivated
by applications to swim-like motion in fluids. Maneuverability and optimal
strokes for a swimmer that achieves locomotion by periodically changing its body
shape will be investigated. Finally, the analysis of fire propagation models
will provide indications on how to optimally manage fire-fighting resources in
real time, in the presence of a forest fire advancing along a large
front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
