The goal of this Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) Critical Science
project from the University of Colorado is to understand the role of sound waves
on the lower atmosphere of the sun. This project will examine how the waves are
excited and how the conditions in the atmosphere change the dynamics. This will
be studied using two different codes, whose outcomes will be compared with each
other and be used to design an experiment for NSF's DKIST. This project supports
NSF's mission to promote the progress of science by examining an understudied
layer of the sun - the chromosphere. The broader impacts include support for a
graduate student and an early career scientist. Outreach talks using the 3D data
generated are planned through CU Boulder's public talk series. The results would
also be made available to the Fiske Planetarium and the Nature, Environment,
Science &amp; Technology studio. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use
simulations and forward models of DKIST observations to examine the role of
acoustic waves in the solar chromosphere. The results of two 3D radiative
magnetohydrodynamic codes, MANCHA and Bifrost, will be examined to determine how
acoustic wave excitation events and atmospheric preconditioning change the
thermodynamics and ionization state of the chromosphere. The results will be
assessed for observational implications and forward models of DKIST specific
observations will be constructed to guide experiment design for an observing
proposal to be submitted to DKIST.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
