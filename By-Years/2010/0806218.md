This award supports participation in the Conference on Undergraduate Research,
Innovation in Teaching, and Diversity in the Mathematical Sciences, to be held
at Montclair State University in June 2008. The conference promotes the
dissemination and further development of successful practices in the supervision
of undergraduate research, including those practices that increase participation
by students who are members of underrepresented groups. The conference also
facilitates dissemination of other innovations in the teaching of mathematical
sciences at the college and university level. Invited speakers include college
and university faculty who have had significant success in these areas.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting also serves as a gateway to the mathematical
sciences research community for undergraduate participants, who will present
their own research in a poster session and will contribute their perspectives on
innovations in undergraduate teaching. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web
