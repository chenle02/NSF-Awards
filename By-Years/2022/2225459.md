This award supports participation of 40 graduate students, postdocs, early-
career researchers and speakers at the 32nd Annual Workshop on Recent
Developments in Electronic Structure Theory, which will be held in New York City
in June 2022. This will be a hybrid meeting with approximately 120 in-person
attendees (up to 200 attendees including the virtual component). The workshop
will facilitate the exchange of ideas between junior and senior researchers in
electronic structure theory and serve as an opportunity for creating new
collaborations. The workshop will focus on the latest developments in electronic
structure theory and computational materials science. The simulation techniques
covered by the workshop are used across a variety of fields including physics,
chemistry, and materials science, both in academia and in
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
