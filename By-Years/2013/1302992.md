The National RF Ionospheric Effects Workshop is held annually to discuss the
science of ionospheric modification experiments. The focus of the workshop is on
the interaction of high-power radio frequency (RF) waves from ground-based
transmitters with the ionospheric plasma and resultant phenomena such as the
generation of ELF waves, ionospheric irregularities, and induced optical
emissions. The 2013 meeting will be held April 21-24 at the National Astronomy
and Ionosphere Center Arecibo Observatory in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. This award is
to coordinate and facilitate the meeting, and to provide support for fifteen
students to attend the meeting. In high frequency ionospheric modification
experiments interesting and potentially useful effects can be produced. For
example, under suitable ionospheric conditions, operating the transmitter in a
mode that couples the energy into the D-region can alter the ionospheric
conductivity and modulate the electrojet currents, which then radiate
electromagnetic waves at the modulation frequency. Waves generated in this
manner have been measured with significant amplitudes both on the ground and in
space. Other effects include the generation of field-aligned irregularities of
the plasma, large-scale modification of the plasma density, and stimulated
electromagnetic emissions. There is a community of researchers dedicated to
understanding these effects and an annual meeting provides a forum for
communicating their results. Providing support for students to attend the
workshop serves the goal of ensuring that future generations of radio scientist
will have background in this area of research.
