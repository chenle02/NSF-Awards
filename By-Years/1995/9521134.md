9521134 Sanford This ocean sciences instrumentation development project involves
a feasibility study to determine how to best implement electric field
measurements to derive ocean transport and velocity profile observations from a
modified ALACE float. The proposed Motional Induction Transport Explorer (MITE)
is an ALACE float modified by the addition of a compass, electrode arms,
amplifiers and new software. At present, ALACE floats can provide month-long
displacements and conductivity weight flow averages. The modifications would
also provide a measure of shear versus rise, and provide an estimate of short-
term fluctuations of the float trajectory and record velocity profiles. If
successful, MITE would have a number of applications in the physical
oceanographic studies of the world's oceans.
