This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will assist the
Department of Chemistry at University of California at San Diego to acquire a
400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas involving projects in synthetic organic
chemistry, organometallic chemistry, inorganic and organic chemistry, molecular
recognition, natural-products chemistry, peptide chemistry, supramolecular
chemistry, environmental chemistry, and prebiotic chemistry. Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for
the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
