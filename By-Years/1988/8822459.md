Since its initial development four decades ago, input-output analysis has been
a powerful and adaptive tool for studying the structure and dynamics of
economies at a variety of geographic scales. Recent research projects have
expanded the ways in which input-output analyses have been conceptualized and
used, and new algorithms have been developed. This project will continue the
development of new uses for input-output analysis by pursuing four related lines
of inquiry. First, alternative techniques for identifying the fundamental
economic structure of economies will be developed. These techniques will be
empirically tested, and an initial classification of economies based on this
concept will be undertaken. Second, the impacts of changes in economic
structures will be examined by analyzing and empirically testing "fields of
influence" of coefficients within input-output models. Third, alternative forms
of decomposing economic structures will be empirically studied in order to more
effectively analyze the nature and transmission of change throughout economic
systems. Fourth, new understandings of fundamental economic structure, fields of
influence of input-output coefficients, and economic decompositions will be
synthesized to examine the simulated impacts of technological development and
the diffusion of new innovations. These analyses will be undertaken by
collaborating investigators from the U.S., Australia, Israel, and Korea. This
research will increase both theoretical and empirical knowledge. The related
enhancement of techniques to further understandings of fundamental economic
structure, fields of influence of coefficients, and economic decompositions will
enable input-output analyses to be used to examine a broader range of problems,
especially issues related to changes in economic activities and to the
functional settings in which economic systems operate. Because these new
techniques will be tested with data from the U.S., Canada, Europe, and
Australia, new insights on economic structure and relationships in those locales
will likely result from this work, but even more important from an empirical
standpoint will be refinement of methods that will enable their use with data
from other regions.
