Vazquez 9308030 This applicant will extend experimentally his earlier
descriptive work of avian wing evolution which led to the hypothesis that fore-
limb coordination in flying birds is automatic. The complex and coordinated
pattern of extension and flexion necessary in the wing during powered flight may
occur involuntarily as a result of the structure of the forelimb joints and
musculature. Such a mechanized wing offers an elegant explanation of how a
fledging successfully flies in its first attempt, and the unfailing coordination
of the avian wing during flight. It would represent a key adaptation in the
evolution of powered flight. This work will be conducted in the laboratory of
Dr. G. E. Goslow, Jr., at Brown University. *** = 8=9=:=;=<===>=?=@=A=B=C=D=E=F=
