Branson 9320882 This award supports a geometry research conference to be held in
April 1994 at the University of Iowa. The conference is designed to enhance
communication, cooperation, and collaborative research among differential
geometers in the Midwest, to disseminate important recent research developments,
and to introduce advanced graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to
important topics in geometry research. Topics to be presented include Einstein
metrics and their moduli spaces, existence and geometric properties of certain
Riemannian functionals arising in scalar curvature, the relationship between
symplectic geometry to spectral asymptotics, and applications of geometric
methods to mathematics physics. ***
