This research is concerned with the structure of classical groups including
orthogonal, symplectic and unitary groups over rings with involutions. The
principal investigator will study normal and subnormal subgroups, automorphisms
and isomorphisms. Waring's problem and related problems for commutative and
matrix rings will also be considered. This research is in the general area of
algebraic K-theory. Algebraic K-theory has become an important area of
mathematics since it has led to the solution of some interesting problems in
mathematics. This project is concerned with a wide variety of qualitative and
quantitative problems related to subgroups of algebraic groups. The anticipated
outcome of this research will be significant for the mathematical community.
