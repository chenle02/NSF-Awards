The Proteaceae are a diverse group of plants dating back to the Cretaceous
Period, now dispersed among the southern continents by the break-up of the
Mesozoic continent Gondwana. New data on modern and fossil pollen will be
gathered using light and electron microscopy. For the first time, the ancestor-
descendant relationships within the family will be assessed by combining pollen
data with information on the morphology, anatomy, and cytology of the whole
plants. The proposed research will expand our understanding of the evolution and
geographic history of the family during continental drift, and will clarify its
relationships with other families of plants. The use of multiple datasets in
assessing relationships will also illuminate the process of character evolution.
