This project is a continuation of an earlier study of transport properties of
supercritical mixtures of primarily co2 with various hydrocarbons using
spectroscopic methods. The experiments comprise: diffusion coefficient
measurements using Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) and time-averaged
intensity measurements; viscosity measurements using probe particles and PCS;
and composition measurements using near-IR spectroscopy. The goal of this
project is to determine temperature, pressure and composition dependence of
diffusion coefficients in supercritical fluid mixtures and provide correlations
that take into account solute solvent size and polarity. Since many theories
relate viscosity and diffusion coefficients, the simultaneous measurements are
particularly valuable.
