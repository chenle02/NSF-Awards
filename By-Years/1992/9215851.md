The Marine Physical Laboratory at Scripps Institution of Oceanography will
upgrade a suite of general purpose oceanographic instruments that are used in
long-term deployments on the sea floor. These versatile electronic instruments
are used to record seafloor seismic and other signals for intervals of many
months at high data rates. They were designed for low power consumption and
adaptability in order that a variety of oceanographic sensors could be
accommodated. The upgrades will allow for six-month or longer duration
deployments with seismic, geodetic, electromagnetic, or other sensors. The
recording medium will be increased to at least 1.2 Gbytes using one of more data
recorders. A data compression scheme will be developed and ten instruments will
receive new, precision timing devices. Low power, temperature controlled quartz
oscillators will be installed in these instruments. Once upgraded, this suite of
instruments will be capable of long-term deployments required of experiments
such as those proposed in the Global Change RIDGE program and other individual
research projects.
