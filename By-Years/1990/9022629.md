This award funds continuing studies of one of the worlds leading groups of
theoretical cosmologists. Wroking at the interfaces of particle physics, nuclear
physics, and astrophysics, these investigations will refine our understanding of
light element evolution, big bang nucleosynthesis, supernova neutrino physics
and the interplay of early and late stage particle physics phase transitions
with galaxy and structure formation and the dark matter problem.
