This proposal is for support of the planning and proposal development
activities of the Department of Systems and Computer Science (CSC), Howard
University. The objective of the Department is to develop, within one year a
comprehensive plan for the enhancement and development of the graduate and
undergraduate programs of the Department. In particular, the Department will
develop a new PhD level computer science program and upgrade our present
offerings in the areas of computer science and systems engineering. The
resulting comprehensive plan will provide the basis of a new proposal to be
submitted, approximately one year from now, to the Computer and Information
Science and Engineering (CISE) Directorate Institutional Infrastructure Minority
Institutions (II-MI) Program of the National Science Foundation.
