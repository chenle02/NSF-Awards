This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Molecular studies of microbial
coevolution and endosymbiosis in a complex assemblage of hosts." Chewing lice
that infect birds harbor endosymbiotic bacteria (putatively Rickettsia) in
specialized cells. Lice probably require these bacteria for digestion of the
feathers on which they live. Selected nucleic acids are being sequenced to
correctly place these bacteria in a phylogeny. Rates of evolution are being
compared and cophylogeny with their hosts is being tested. Finally, the effect
of endosymbiosis on nucleotide sequence evolution is being evaluated.
