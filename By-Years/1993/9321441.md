ABSTRACT 9321441 Antonucci This research will involve studies of the nature of
active galactic nuclei, quasars, and primeval galaxies. A new technique of
spectropolarimetry will be used to obtain multidirectional views of active
nuclei, and to capitalize on the results with certain observations at other
wavelengths. There will be studies of radio-quiet quasars. Optical broadband and
near-IR narrow-and broadband imaging will be used to test whether certain
specially-selected very faint radio sources, unidentified on deep optical CCD
images, could be at ultra-high redshifts (6{SYMBOL 163 \f "Symbol"} Z {SYMBOL
