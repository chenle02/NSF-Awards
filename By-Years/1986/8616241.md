This effort pertains to the question of light emission from impurties in
silicon. Should it be possible to obtain coherent light emission, a great impact
would be felt in the optical and electronics field. This is particularly true
with the recent effort directed toward the utilization of light to send signals
from one part of a silicon chip to another.
