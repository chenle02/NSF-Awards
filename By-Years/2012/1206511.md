Technical Description: This computational and experimental research project aims
to answer several fundamental questions in the Au-catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid
growth of Ge and Si nanowires. In particular, what mechanisms control kinking of
nanowires and how does metastable hexagonal-close packed Au form when growth
terminates? A three-dimensional continuum phase field model connects atomistic
simulations and experimental observations, which use both ex-situ and in-situ
characterization methods, and a rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition system.
The project also investigates methods of controlling growth to avoid defects and
to facilitate synthesis of abrupt doped junctions and axial Si-Ge
heterostructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: This project
has a broader impact on a wide range of materials research problems in which a
close connection between atomistic modeling and experiments is desirable.
Results of this project provide lecture materials on atomistic simulations,
thermodynamics and kinetic processes in materials synthesis. The project engages
undergraduates through summer research. The science education outreach activity
introduces San Jose-area high-school students to crystal growth concepts through
interactive Android Apps based on a two-dimensional phase field model.
