The Carnegie Mellon University Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
Robotics Institute Site will advance knowledge by training students in the key
technological areas of robotics and preparing them for graduate study and
technical leadership. The sciences that make up the discipline of robotics
provide a unique opportunity to immerse students in research with real-world
applications. Robotics-related technologies are becoming ubiquitous and they are
dominating national headlines and discussions on such innovations as driverless
cars, big data and data mining, and medical robotics. Research topics include
areas such as, intelligent transportation aerial robots, mobile robots, multi-
robot systems, assistive robotics and as multi-sensor fusion and data mining.
Students will be involved in an immersive learning environment with mentors
meeting weekly with REU participants to facilitate their research experience and
positive learning outcomes. Research results will be shared via the web and
through a public poster session, research presentations, and the web publication
of a peer-reviewed working papers journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site
provides high-quality guided research experiences coupled with robust
professional development for undergraduate students with leading faculty in
computer vision, field and space robotics, artificial intelligence,
manipulation, and machine learning. Additional mentors, including researchers
and graduate students, will provide unique perspectives and insights into
science and engineering education careers. The strategic goal of this site is to
provide research experiences and mentorship to U.S. citizens and permanent
residents from under-represented groups and those from higher education
institutions with fewer research opportunities. The leadership team and
participating faculty share this commitment and bring expertise in mentoring
students from diverse backgrounds to communicate their research results to
coming generations of students, middle school and high school teachers, and the
general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
