The production of oxygen and nitrogen is an established commercial industry. The
separation of air to recover these gases is accomplished by cryogenic
distillation, an energy-intensive process. The high cost for the current method
imposes economic limits on the applications of for the products. Research
focuses on developing a gel membrane system to achieve the separation of air by
a much cheaper and simplier system than now in use. The successful separation of
certain other gases from mixtures has already been achieved.
