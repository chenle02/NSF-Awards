The PI has discovered a unique protein that appears to be essential to the
biologic clock which determines daily rythms controlled by the brain. The
discovery of the protein came out of work she did at Harvard on the molecular
biology of the "period" gene in the Drosophila and its influence on biological
rhythms. From this lowly fly brain an exciting generalization has come because
the proteins which the Drosophila genes express in neurons are also expressed in
the hypothalamus of vertebrate animals. This indicates the vital importance of
the gene to brain function as it has been conserved for millions of years. Dr.
Siwicki will study the neurons in the brain by applying an antibody she has
produced to the protein produced by the gene and study the electrophysiology of
the identified neurons to test the biological consequence of neurons containing
the protein. This should clarify if cells that produce the product are rythm
generators which keep the brain "on time" to coordinate brain function.
