This three week Oceanography Short Course for Instructors of Undergraduate
Marine Sciences is offered by the University of San Diego and Grossmont-Cuyamaca
Community College. It updates instructors from 2- and 4-year institutions in the
technologically impacted ocean sciences. Course objectives are to provide state-
of-the-art information in marine research and applications; hands- on
experiences in oceanographic sample collecting and data analysis; and new
instructional materials and techniques. The forty participants earn three
graduate semester units in Marine Studies by participating in a variety of
activities at the University, and at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (UCSD),
Grossmont Community College, the coastal nuclear power station at San Onofre,
commercial aquiculture facilities, and Sea World/Hubbs Research Institute. Field
excursions include data and sample collecting aboard the 125' R/V Gordon Sproul,
site visits to classic exposures of sedimentary marine facies, and a voyage past
the Los Coronados Islands to Ensenada, Mexico, to the University Autonomia de
Baja California Marine Studies facilities. The program presents a broad spectrum
of ocean-related information for undergraduate classrooms: cutting edge
scientific information, instructional materials and software, and data on
current marine studies programs and employment possibilities.
