The principal investigator will analyze interrelated problems concerning
hyperbolic dynamical systems and compact Riemannian manifolds of negative
curvature. Specifically, he will investigate the classification,
differentiability, and regularity of stable and unstable foliations. Other
directions of research include investigations of rigidity and regularity of
global invariants with respect to external parameters. This project involves
three areas of mathematical research. Dynamical systems is the study of where
points go after many repeated iterations of a continuous function. Ergodic
theorists ask where most, but not all, points go under many such iterations. And
Riemannian geometry is concerned with the curvature and other aspects of the
base space from which these points are taken. The principal investigator will
analyze several problems which stem from attempts to apply theories from all
three of these areas at once.
