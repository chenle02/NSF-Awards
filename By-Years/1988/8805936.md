The Cold Spring Harbor Symposia have been held each summer since 1933, with the
exception of the years of World War II. Each year a subject is chosen that seems
to be at the stage where a general scrutiny and review is needed. The topic for
each Symposium is arrived at by discussion with a large number of people. The
1988 annual Symposium, entitled "The Molecular Biology of Signal Transduction",
will be held at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory from May 25-June 1, l988. It
is expected that 350-400 scientists will attend. The meeting will follow the
traditional Cold Spring Harbor Symposium format and will consist of 12 formal
sessions over seven days. All of the speakers are encouraged to present their
latest results. The proceedings of each meeting are published by the Laboratory.
Since 1933 the annual Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology have
brought together scientists from all over the world to present and discuss both
formally and informally, exciting areas in the forefront of biology. This year's
symposium on "The Molecular Biology of Signal Transduction" promises to be
another excellent contribution to the consolidation of new knowledge and
dissemination of the latest new research results in this fast moving and
extremely important field.
