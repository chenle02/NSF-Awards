This project involves mathematical modeling of electromagnetic and elastic
materials. These materials are characterized by equilibrium configurations
exhibiting multiple phases. Examples include elastic ferromagnets and rigid
superconductors. The basic modeling tools will be the use of spatially nonlocal
energy terms to penalize oscillations in classical states and the variance of
Young-measure states. Also included are existence results for short time
dynamics of materials satisfying a generalized strong ellipticity hypothesis on
electromagnetic and elastic properties and existence of equilibrium solutions
for elastic bodies with perfect diamagnetism (elastic superconductors.) These
studies will lead to a better understanding of the mechanical properties of
elastic and electromagnetic materials and composites and will have an impact on
the development and synthesis of materials with optimal properties.
