9442825 Cheng This REU supplemental award No. CCR-9111563 enables two
undergraduate students to participate in the research on the formal analysis,
verification, synthesis, and execution of realtime rule-based expert systems.
The projects to be performed by these students include the design and
implementation of several modules for the analysis of rule- based systems
written in different expert system shells and the synthesis of real-time rule-
based systems with bounded response time. The students also gain hands-on
experience in the development of an efficient and fault-tolerant execution
environment for real-time rule-based systems. Students under this program have
access to state-of-theart computing facilities and to industrial real-time rule-
based systems. This award recognizes the importance of hands-on experience in
active research for attracting and training undergraduates, in particular, women
and minorities, for careers in mathematics, science and engineering, and that
too few such experiences are now available at large, urban, public universities.
