The objective of this project is to upgrade the environmental monitoring
laboratories with the addition of computer controlled data acquisition and
statistical analysis. This upgrade will result in laboratory experiences for the
student which are more in agreement with current practice in industry and the
regulatory agencies. Two laboratories will be upgraded-the Air Pollution
Laboratory and the Water Chemistry Laboratory. Extensive instrumentation already
exists, and the added computer equipment will facilitate the introduction of
statistical analysis to the laboratory exercises and supplement a recently added
course in mathematical statistics.
