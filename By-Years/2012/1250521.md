Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technologies are emerging as a promising mitigator
against spectrum congestion resulting from the explosive growth in commercial
and government wireless systems and services. One remaining challenge is the
ability to establish reliable access to sufficient spectrum while avoiding
harmful interference to other users when operating with imperfect situational
awareness (SA). This research effort is developing the technical underpinnings
and system concepts for reliable DSA operations with incomplete and inaccurate
SA in programmable wireless networks (PWN). A multi-disciplinary approach is
pursued, combining elements of communication theory, multiattribute decision
theory, distributed systems theory, and behavioral economics theory. It
specifically develops a decision-theoretic core that operates over imperfect SA
information, determining what spectrum access opportunities to pursue as well as
what information to gather for increased awareness. Information acquisition
algorithms encompass access to dynamic and static data sources as well as
distributed sensing and fusion approaches for combining data from multiple
collaborative PWNs. Representation and reasoning of uncertainty is accomplished
by Bayesian decision networks and probabilistic inference technologies. System
performance is evaluated and validated via newly-generated spectrum scenarios
and existing data collected in previous efforts. The technological developments
enable PWN behavior and performance evaluation with respect to technical,
regulatory, and economic domains. The research outcome can accelerate DSA
fielding and broaden DSA operations to improve public safety and wireless
broadband access. Research results will be disseminated through technical
publications, conferences, and PWN community collaboration. They will also be
integrated into regular classroom, workshop, and short course teaching.
