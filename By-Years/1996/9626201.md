Durrett will continue to apply the theory of stochastic spatial models to
problems in biology, specifically studying: (a) abundance distributions
generated by the voter model with mutation that are an alternative to the
traditional lognormal, (b) hybrid zones and their scaling limits -- motion by
mean curvature, (c) a generalization of the biased voter model used by
Silvertown to model the competition of grass species, and (d) a nonlinear
predator prey model that displays oscillatory behavior. In an interacting
particle system, space is represented as a grid of sites each one of which can
be in one of a finite set of states and changes its state at a rate that depends
on the states of finitely many neighbors. These models have a structure that is
well suited to many problems in biology and have recently seen many applications
there. Durrett's investigations will continue previous work seeking to
understand when the spatial distribution of individuals has an important effect
on the outcome of competition and when it can be ignored. Earlier work has
already identified a number of situations in which non-spatial approaches give
incorrect answers to questions about the persistence or coexistence of competing
species.
