This project focuses on the development of an undergraduate course designed to
familiarize students, including both science majors and general education
students interested in science and the information professions, with the rapidly
accumulating body of recorded scientific knowledge, with an emphasis on its
infrastructure, processes for introducing new knowledge, methods of access, and
evaluation. The first phase of the project will involve consultation with both
research and teaching faculty at the Univerisity of Illinois in a variety of
disciplines, in order to gather data on the sources of information used by
specific research communities and to establish the range of educational needs in
the science and general education curricula. The syllabus development stage of
the project will include the preparation of a volume of case materials, creation
of laboratory exercises in information retrieval, and a survey of the relevant
literature. This course is designed to dispel traditional stereotypes of
information storage, enhance student's appreciation for the creation and
application of scientific knowledge, increase sensitivity to issues of policy
and ethics, and provide practical experience in locating and accessing a wide
variety of information sources.
