The Science Museum of Minnesota will produce a 38- minute IMAX/OMNIMAX film on
the topic of tropical rainforests. The objectives of the film include: To
illustrate the key scientific concepts relating to rainforest ecology including
biological diversity, biological change and human impact; To expose a wider
audience to ecological thinking than might normally be exposed through
traditional means of science education or science media; To communicate the
complexity of conservation issues related to the rainforests. In addition, the
film will portray science as an attractive career, particularly for minorities
and women. The museum will create an integrated program of science enrichment
materials that will accompany the film and will be used for both school groups
and general audiences. Linking an education program to an IMAX/OMNIMAX film is a
first for the industry and will extend the learning potential of the project.
Tropical Rainforest will be distributed to IMAX/OMNIMAX theaters located in
museums and science technology centers; it has the potential to be seen by more
than 14 million people in its first four years of distribution.
