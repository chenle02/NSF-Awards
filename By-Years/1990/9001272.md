The following is an award to engage in research aimed at understanding and
exploring experimentally the ultra high speed potential of quantum well lasers.
The recent advances in quantum layer understanding and growth now make the
prospects of subpicosecond pulses at rates greater than 100 GHz a distinct
possibility. It is proposed to pursue this goal using our combined crystal
growth (MBE, LPE), microwave, picosecond pulse, and simulation capabilities.
