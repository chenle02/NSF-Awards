The Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL) at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in collaboration with Michigan State
University and Pennsylvania State University, is creating an interdisciplinary
program to prepare graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and current
faculty to meet the challenges of STEM higher education. This Higher Education
Center for Learning and Teaching is based on a teaching-as-research concept that
enables future and current STEM faculty to engage in teaching in the same way
they engage in their research. The project integrates teaching-as-research and
interdisciplinary learning communities in a professional development program
that addresses the educational responsibilities of current and future faculty.
The professional development program includes a curriculum that provides a
foundation for teaching-as-research and improved classroom practice,
experiential learning in informal education and instructional materials
development, internships in a variety of learning environments, and preparation
for teaching and learning with diverse student populations. The focus of the
research component is on promoting best practices in post-secondary STEM
teaching and learning, fostering change in STEM graduate-through-faculty
cultures, and transferring successful strategies between departments and across
universities. Through national implementation of the professional development
program, CIRTL is expected to serve approximately 2,000 STEM graduate students
and post-doctoral researchers annually while establishing learning communities
for graduates-through-faculty at 10 research universities representing 10% of
the major U.S. graduate institutions. This project is jointly funded by the
Division of Undergraduate Education in the Directorate for Education and Human
Resources and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for
Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
