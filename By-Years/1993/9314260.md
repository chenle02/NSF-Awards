Iron plays a critical role in the maintenance of cell metabolism as
phytoplankton appear to regulate intracellular iron concentrations. However, at
present no one has conducted molecular studies on the effects of iron
deprivation on the genes that encode proteins of photosystem II, Calvin cycle
enzyme, and light harvesting chlorophyll. This project will determine how
chloroplast gene expression is regulated by iron (Fe++) in the eukaryotic marine
alga, Olisthodiscus luteus. This alga, which is ecologically significant in
toxic algal blooms yet essentially unstudied at the molecular level, will serve
as a model system to address critical physiological and ecological questions in
other marine algae. The work will provide critical information on how specific
genes regulate these proteins at the transcription or post-transcription level
in response to iron as an environmental cue. If successful, future work will
focus on factors that impose transcription control or those that influence RNA
stability and/or selective utilization of specific RNA species.
