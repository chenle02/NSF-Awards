9409932 Walton Purdue Univ. Dr. Richard A. Walton, Chemistry Department, Purdue
University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for an investigation of the redox
reactivity of rhenium polyhydrides and compounds containing rhenium-rhenium
triple bonds. The mechanism of reductive coupling reactions induced by the Re-Re
triple bond and the reactivity of complexes containing the 3-metallafuran ring
will be examined. The reactions of rhenium-heptahydrides with various organic
acids will be explored as routes to stereochemically rigid 8-coordinate
molecules. The unusual isomerization of internal to terminal alkynes which
occurs in some of the hydride systems will be utilized to prepare rhenium-
alkylidyne complexes. A portion of this project is aimed at developing the
ability of compounds which contain two directly bonded rhenium atoms to supply
electrons to small molecules such as carbon monoxide. The addition of these
electrons will cause the small molecules to bond to one another, or to other
nearby molecules, thereby forming more exended structures. Such behavior is
important in both industrial and laboratory processes. In the second part of the
research, rhenium compounds surrounded by 8 other groups will be prepared. These
very crowded molecules are expected to be capable of inducing a number of new
reactions in molecules with which they interact.
