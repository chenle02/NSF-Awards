This in-depth three year study examines Inupiat Eskimo childrearing in Northwest
Alaska. The investigation fills a 30 year gap in information about childrearing
beliefs and practices in village Alaska within the context of rapidly changing
social and cultural norms. A particular focus will be on the divergence of
attitudes and how they impact children. Following a pilot study of extended
families in Kotzebue, intergenerational families in remote villages (Noorvik,
Kiana) will be examined. This triangulated approach to data collection includes
traditional anthropological fieldwork and participant observation, combined with
life-history interviews of family members by trained local villagers. The study
is intended to advance the science of cross-cultural family theory and child
development, as well as to provide information on contemporary parenting for the
Northwest Arctic Borough.
