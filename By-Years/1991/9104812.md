In areas of continental rifting, the flanks of the actively extending areas are
commonly topographically elevated. Flexural rebound of the lithosphere in
response to tectonic unloading during extension has been proposed to be the
dominant process by which rift flank topography is generated, although other
explanations are possible. This project will attempt to rigorously test this
hypothesis by using gravity data coverage of several large lake systems in the
East Africa rift. Gravity data on land around the lakes is adequate to model the
profiles, but data from the lakes are sparse, yet the lakes mark the greatest
depressions of the system. In cooperation with the Ugandan Department of
Geological Survey and Mines and the Zairian University of Lubumbashi, gravity
surveys of Lakes Albert, George and Edward will be performed and resulting data
used in detailed three-dimensional models of this area. Results are expected to
determine the role of tectonic unloading in rift-flank topography development.
