9419703 Turgeon Phloem loading is the transport process in which carbohydrate,
synthesized by mesophyll cells, is transferred to the vascular tissue (phloem)
of leaves in preparation for long-distance translocation to other organs. A new
model of phloem loading has been put forward by Dr. Turgeion for those species
that translocate stachyose in addition to sucrose. Possibly one-third of all
dicotyledonous species are in this group. According to this model, sucrose
diffuses from the mesophyll cells into a specialized type of companion cell (the
intermediary cell) in the minor veins and is converted there into stachyose.
Diffusion occurs through numerous branched plasmodesmata linking bundle sheath
cells to intermediary cells. The stachyose accumulates in the intermediary cells
and sieve elements because it is too large to diffuse back into the mesophyll.
This award supports experimental studies into the dynamics of intermediary cell
phlasmodesmata ultrastructure. These plasmodesmata are especially narrow on the
intermediary cell side and this constriction is the possible site of
discrimination between transport of sucrose in one direction and stachyose in
the other. Cryofixation will be used to preserve plasmodesmata structure, which
will be studied in mature leaves before and after a reduction in carbohydrate
content. Confocal microscope investigations with membrane- specific dyes will
determine whether the small vacuoles in intermediary cells, which may be
involved in transport of sugar through the cell, originate from the vacuolar
system or the endoplasmic reticulum. These studies will concentrate on Cucumis
melo and Cucurbita pepo but other stachyose-translocation species may also be
employed.
