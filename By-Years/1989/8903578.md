This research is analyzing the light-mediated control of expression of the
RuBPCase large subunit (LSU) gene at the post-transcriptional level. The primary
emphasis involves molecular and biochemical analyses of chlorplast protein
synthesis in cell-free extracts. The chloroplast transcriptioanl repressionof
elongation which occurs in plants shifted into darkness is being studied both in
vivo, to determine how ribosomal transit times vary, and in vitro, to
characterize factor(s) responsible for the altered elongation rates in dark-
shifted versus light-grown plants. Initial efforts involve the continued
development of a chloroplast-derived, protein synthesizing extract that is
programable with exogenously added mRNA. The chimeric LSU- CAT reporter gene
will be employed in developing this assay. TAhe regulation of expression of
genes coded by chloroplast DNA is a fundamental problem associated with
understanding growth and development in higher plants. The research in this
proposal is looking at the mechanisms of regulation of chloroplast gene
expression through the development of a cell-free system that responds to the
same factors found in the intact chloroplast. The development of such an assay
will markedly enhance the ability of workers in this field to address issues
related to the control of chloroplast protein synthesis.***//
