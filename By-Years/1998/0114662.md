0114662&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a three-year cooperative
project between Dr. Haimin Wang, the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), and the
Solar Radio Array of Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVSA), New Jersey Institute
of Technology ( NJIT) and Professor Guoxiang Ai, the Beijing National
Observatory (BNO) in solar physics research. This study will use high-resolution
vector magnetograph data from BBSO and BNO to monitor the magnetic structure of
solar active region continuously and use newly developed fast camera systems to
obtain images of solar flares. This is an important project, which can provide
important continuous observations of the solar flares. A successful study can
advance our discovery and understanding of solar activity. This proposal
addresses an important scientific question and meets the NSF objective of human
resource development. The National Science Foundation of China and the NSF
jointly support this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
