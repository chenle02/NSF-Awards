Under a NSF Archaeology Program `High Risk Exploratory Grant` Drs. Ezra Zubrow
and Milton Nunez and their collaborators will survey a 500 meter wide strip on
the Finnish side of the Finnish - Russian border. For security purposes both
countries cleared similar areas on each side of the border and only now, with
the easing of international tensions is the Finnish portion available for
scientific research. Since much of this region in central Finland is heavily
vegetated and dense forest will regenerate quickly a unique opportunity with a
narrow time window has presented itself. The team will conduct a systematic
surface survey to locate as many sites as possible. These will carefully
recorded with a global positioning system and particular attention will be paid
to clusters of occurrences. A magnetometer will be employed to search for
underground features and surface materials will be recorded. On the basis of
these remains it should be possible to date the sites to a general time interval
and to determine basic subsistence mode. This region of Finland was colonized
ca. 8,000 BC after the retreat of the terminal Pleistocene glaciers. The
earliest inhabitants were Mesolithic hunter gatherers. Later peoples practiced
both reindeer herding and subsistence agriculture. The long term goal of the
project is to study human ecology and subsistence adaptation in this
environmentally marginal area. The investigators wish to understand how these
three distinct subsistence lifestyles interacted: whether they followed each
other in a linear fashion or co-existed and alternated in a more complex way.
They also want to determine the relationship of these adaptations to the
different environmental zones located within the survey area. This research is
important because it will provide basic archaeological information on a
geographic region which is almost archaeologically unknown. It addresses a
significant question in human ecology and hopefully will lay the groundwork for
a larger scale research effort.
