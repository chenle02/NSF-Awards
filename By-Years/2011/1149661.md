Future systems based on nanoscale transistors will offer significant boosts in
information gathering and processing capabilities. However, the reliability and
scalability challenges mandate a transformation in the system-level approaches.
A number of fundamental assumptions will change with nanoscale transistors: the
fabrication processes will be highly defective due to the random nature of
nanoscale self-assembly; system reliability cannot be guaranteed in the field
because nanoscale transistors are extremely susceptible to intermittent faults;
system scalability demands the interconnection between components to be strictly
localized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims at forming a new paradigm to
construct reliable and scalable nanosystems, which will open up new application
domains currently held back by the size and power limit. This research focuses
on three life-span stages of future nanosystems: (1) defects discovered during
manufacturing are treated through chip reconfiguration; (2) dynamic faults are
treated in the field with built-in redundant elements under the strict
constraint of local interconnections. The approaches and analysis for these two
stages will provide guidance for the (3) system design stage.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project includes a strong educational
component for undergraduate students to participate in a number of competition
projects to gain research experiences. These projects are also joined by
graduate students to learn to convey research outcome to a general audience.
Such an integrated research and educational effort aims at bridging the gaps
between state-of-the-art research and the teaching of engineering approaches,
many distinct knowledge bodies of EE, CE, and CS, and between systems research
and device research in the academic community.
