The Workshop on Geometry for Molecular Visualization and Characterization will
bring together software developers and biochemists to discuss the questions,
"What computer-generated geometric representations of molecular structures might
be useful for future work by the biochemical community?" and "What software
tools might facilitate the specification of these new geometric representations
by the biochemist?" The workshop will consist of presentations by participants
of work- in-progress and proposed future work. In addition, round-table
discussions to assess the state-of-the-art in this area and future directions
will be held.
