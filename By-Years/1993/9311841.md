The Engineering Faculty Internship provides the Principal Investigator an
opportunity to study a high-volume robotic automation system and interact with
the designers and users of such a system. This system is the printer assembly
system designed to assemble on the order of 100,000 printers per month. One of
the key problems in high volume (hundreds of thousands of units per month)
mechanical assembly is the lead time required to design and implement automation
systems and the additional time required to ramp automated production to full
volume for a new or redesigned product. The research is concerned with
understanding the factors contributing to these long lead times and lack of
flexibility for automated assembly systems. On the basis of the collaboration of
the university and industrial in conjunction with study of the system at hand,
the major factors contributing to long lead times and lack of flexibility will
be determined, alternative designs proposed, and proof-of-concept experiments
conducted.
