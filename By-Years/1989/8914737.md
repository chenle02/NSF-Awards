This is a US-China cooperative project to conduct research on the hysteretic
behavior of steel box columns subjected to combined bi-axil bending and
compression. The cyclic shear resistance of concrete encased steel plate panels
and seismic requirement of steel frames designed for wind resistance are also
investigated. The objective is to develop hysteretic models for structural
elements for incorporation into an inelastic dynamic analysis program. The
research will involve active participation of faculty members and students of
both Lehigh and Tongji universities and is a part of "US-PRC Earthquake
Protocol, Annex III" program.
