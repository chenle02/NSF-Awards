This award supports a project to develop and refine analytical techniques to
characterize and date volcanic ash, or tephra, that is often found in ice cores
from large ice sheets. Tephras layers in ice sheets are particularly valuable
because, if they are from large eruptions, they form unique time-stratigraphic
markers. The chemistry of the tephra can be used to determine the provenance, or
origin, of the material and 40Ar/39Ar dating has potential to provide an
absolute age of the layer. However, because the amount of material in tephra
layers is very small, both in total mass and in terms of particle size, it is
important to develop appropriate analytical techniques that can successfully
characterize and date small samples. Refinement of the laser fusion technique
for argon extraction prior to isotopic analysis of is a significant challenge.
However, if successful, this work would be a substantial benefit to studies of
ice cores as an independent dating tool. Furthermore, characterization and
dating of tephra from ice cores will provide important information to climate
models.
