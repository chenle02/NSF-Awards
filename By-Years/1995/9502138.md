9502138 Michielssen Research The objective functions that arise in the context
of electromagnetic optimization and component design are often highly non-
linear, stiff, multi-external, sometimes non-differentiable, and almost always
computationally expensive to evaluate. the effectiveness of Genetic Algorithms
(Gas) is investigated within the context of electromagnetic component design by
developing global GA- based optimizers for a number of electromagnetic systems,
e.g., reflect arrays, frequency scanned grating antennas, waveguide components,
and broadband antennas systems. It is conjectured that the proposed research
will engender novel solution techniques for a variety of electromagnetic
optimization problems and bring about a number of powerful, highly efficient and
systematic design techniques for a aforementioned electromagnetic components.
This study will also permit the formulation of guidelines regarding the
suitability of Gas for other electromagnetic optimization problems in terms of
number and the character of those parameter that require optimization the
computational complexity of the forward analysis problem, and the available
computing platform. Education Teaching excellence is an important component of
all first-class undergraduate and graduate programs. This young faculty member
in electromagnetic will be committed to significantly revise a number of
electromagnetics courses during the next for years in order to maintain and
improve the quality of the undergraduate and graduate electromagnetic curricula
at the University of Illinois at Urbans-Champaign (UIUC). The recently
established College of Engineering's interdisciplinary program in Computational
Science and Engineering (CSE) will instrumental in achieving the goal.
Furthermore, he will foster discussions regarding the establishment and the
promotion of an exchange program for undergraduate and graduate students between
the Colleges of Engineering at the UIUC and Belgian universities.
