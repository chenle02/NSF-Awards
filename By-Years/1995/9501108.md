9501108 Wybourne The phase memory of electrons is maintained in samples with
dimensions less than the electron-electron and electron-phonon interaction
lengths. In this situation there is no dissipation in the sample, and parts of
the sdample outside the classical current path influence transport phenomena
associated with the electron's phase. In the proposed research, a related
transport regime in which the sample dimensions are greater than the electron-
electron interaction length, but less than the electron-phonon relaxation
length, will be studied. In this case phase memory is lost, yet dissipation
within the sample remains unlikely. To study the relationship between
dissipation and sample geometry, electron transport measurements will be made on
metal microstructures of different shapes under conditions far from equilibrium.
Fluctuations in the electron energy loss are anticipated when the electron-
phonon relaxation length approaches the sample dimensions. Dissipation in the
sample is expected to be dependent on the acoustic mode confinement in the
structure, especially when the confined acoustic mode energy spacing is greater
than the internal energy of the electron gas. %%% Many experiments have been
reported on phase coherence and ballistic electron transport for which energy
dissipation occurs mainly in the circuit contacts. Little experimental work has
been directed towards the onset of dissipation in microstructures (as in
computer chips) that occurs when the characteristic length associated with
energy loss becomes comparable to the sample dimensions. In the proposed
research, electron transport measurements will be made under conditions far from
equilibrium in order to study the relationship between energy dissipation and
the geometry of a microstructure. The connection between dissipation and the
acoustic properties of the microstructures will also be inve stigated. ***
