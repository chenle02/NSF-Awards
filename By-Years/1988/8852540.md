This award provides funds to the Biology Department at Bryn Mawr College to
purchase a Porter-Blum MT-2C ultramicrotome, two Diatom diamond knives and an
air isolation table. These instruments will be used to establish an
ultramicrotomy facility that will be dedicated to use by undergraduate students
conducting faculty supervised research projects and by students enrolled in
course offerings of Cell Biology and Nervous System Structure and Function. The
significance of the project rests in the importance that the undergraduates will
be exposed to the broadest range of techniques available for the study of
cellular structure and function. Transmission electron microscopy offers insight
into these areas of cellular research that are not available through
conventional light microscopical techniques. The grantee institution is matching
this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.
