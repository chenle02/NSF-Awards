The use of statistical overlap theory for the deconvolution of complex
chromatographic data is extended to applications including two-dimensional (2-D)
separations. In the approach employed by Professor Davis and his students at
Southern Illinois University, the extent of overlap of co-eluting components can
be predicted as well as computation of the required peak capacity to reduce the
degree of overlap to manageable levels. A key component to this program is the
distribution of the generated mathematic codes via the internet so that
practitioners can have direct access to the deconvolution methodologies.
Chromatographic separations are a vital component in many chemical analyses.
Analytical separations remove some of the ambiguities present in many detection
methods, and thus the ability to identify the presence of co-eluting species is
of utmost importance. The wide variety of separation media and underlying
phenomena make the development of universal computational methods to deconvolve
overlapping peaks very difficult. The continued development of the statistical
overlap theory and placement of the computational capabilities on the internet
by Professor Davis and his students may serve to address the needs of a wide
range of chromatography applications.
