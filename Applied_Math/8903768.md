8903768 Keyfitz This project is concerned with the mathematical properties and
applications of systems of conservation laws that are not of classical, strictly
hyperbolic type. Models with these unusual features may be used to describe a
variety of complex flows in continuum mechanics, including visco-elastic and
visco-plastic fluids, flow in mixtures undergoing phase transitions in fluids
and in solid elasticity, and porous-medium flows; similar equations appear in
models for granular flows. In recent research, the principal investigator has
identified some mathematical properties distinguishing different models; these
include degree of separation of the wave speeds, behavior of the speeds where
the type changes, and other qualitative properties of the wave curves. She plans
to examine how these properties affect well-posedness, and to study stability of
solutions under higher-order perturbations. Studies will also be made of models
that appear in specific applications, and the conclusions, including algorithms
for numerical computation, will be applied to multidimensional conservation
laws.
