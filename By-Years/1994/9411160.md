This project will compile an extensive dictionary of Musey, a Chadic language of
northern Cameroon and southwestern Chad. The dictionary will provide the first
comprehensive lexical study of the language and of any language within the Masa
group of Chadic languages. The Musey-English dictionary will have at least 7500
main entries with lexical and grammatical information as well as illustrative
sentences for each entry. An accompanying grammar sketch will provide additional
information on this under studied language. The main section of the dictionary
will be supplemented by English-Musey and French-Musey indices. The dictionary
will be a valuable resource to general linguists, general Africanists, and
scholars engaged in linguistic and other types of research in the Lake Chad
Basin.
