9412209 Murty Description: This project is to support collaboration by Dr. Anil
K. Jain of the Department of Computer Science at Michigan State University, and
Dr. M. Narasimha Murty of the Department of Computer Science and Automation at
the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, India. The two scientists will
work jointly in the area of knowledge-based clustering. The main focus of the
research will be the following topics: incorporate domain knowledge to obtain
more meaningful clusters; investigate grouping of labelled objects for efficient
representation and rule generation; and develop tools to assist a potential user
in selecting an appropriate clustering algorithm for a given problem. Scope:
Cluster analysis attempts to assess the interaction among patterns by organizing
the patterns into groups or clusters such that patterns within a cluster are
more similar to each other than patterns belonging to different clusters. The
results can be used to initiate hypotheses about the data. The method is popular
in pattern recognition, computer vision, machine learning, biology, psychiatry,
psychology, marketing, and information retrieval. The collaboration by these two
highly competent scientists should advance the techniques used and lead to
better utilization of the method. ***
