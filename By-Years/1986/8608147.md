International travel by the investigator will be supported to permit his
participation as a speaker in two international conferences: one is on chemicals
in the environment and the other one is on water pollution from contaminants
derived from highways. The investigator will present results of his research on
decontamination of stormwater that runs off from paved surfaces such as
roadways, carrying with it contaminants derived from the operation of motor
vehicles. The research on which he will report was supported by the Florida
Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration.
