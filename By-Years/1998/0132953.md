AST- 0132953&lt;br/&gt;Uros Seljak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Seljak of Princeton
University will develop a comprehensive theoretical framework to analyze,
understand, and connect the many facets of weak gravitational lensing and its
significance to cosmology. The phenomenon of weak gravitational lensing occurs
when matter along the line of sight, which might otherwise be unobservable,
magnifies and distorts the images of background galaxies. Dr. Seljak will make
progress in this area of research by comparing his theoretical predictions to
actual observations. He will make use of several observational surveys,
including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Deep Lens Survey. He will use
these data to put constraints on the masses of neutrinos, the nature of the
newly discovered dark energy, the presence of dark matter in clusters of
galaxies, the effect of dark matter on the formation of galaxies, and the
relationship between the clustering of dark matter and that of
galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of his educational mission, Dr. Seljak
will work on developing an undergraduate course in computational physics at
Princeton, using his research as examples. He will also integrate undergraduate
students from all levels into his research group. Dr. Seljak will also
participate in a local outreach program through which he will partner with a
local teacher and participate in regular class visits.&lt;br/&gt;
