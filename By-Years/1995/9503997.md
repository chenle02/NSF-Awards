9503997 Weare The purpose of this proposal is to develop adaptive numerical
methods and the accompanying software infrastructure for the solution of the LDA
equations in materials science. Current solution methods, based on Fast Fourier
Transform techniques, cannot accurately resolve the short length scales present
in many materials of technological importance. Our adaptive numerical methods
will integrate adaptive mesh refinement techniques with advanced multilevel
numerical eigenvalue algorithms. The implementation of adaptive numerical
methods on high performance parallel platforms is difficult because the
programmer must manage irregularly distributed, dynamically changing data. The
use of adaptive numerical techniques will enable theoretical material scientists
to model complex materials which cannot be treated using existing methods.
Furthermore, because adaptive methods can be applied to a number of scientific
and engineering disciplines, this research will impact other fields, including
computational fluid dynamics, semiconductor modeling, and geophysical modeling.
