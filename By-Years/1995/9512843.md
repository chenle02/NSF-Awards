This grant provides partial support for Dr. Edou-Minko, a geologist with the
University of Science and Technology of Masuku, in Gabon, West Africa, to
collaborate with Erik Brown, Assistant Professor of Geochemistry at the Large
Lakes Observatory with the University of Minnesota, on the use in-situ produced
cosmogenic nuclides to determine long-term weathering rates at various watershed
sites in the Mississippi Valley. Dr. Edou-Minko is a specialist in the
geochemistry of laterites and lateritic gold deposits, and has had extensive
field experience in tropical and equatorial West Africa. The multiple approaches
to examination of weathering dynamics offered by Professor Brown and Dr. Edou-
Minko will provide insights into the effects of the differing geological
settings. The importance of attempting to quantify weathering rates is
fundamental to an overall understanding of all surficial processes of the Earth.
Furthermore, through time the overall chemistry of the ocean is influenced by
differences in weathering rates caused by variations in rock type and climate.
The researchers expect to be able to make a comparison of quantitative
weathering rates within different latitudes, which could lead to a better
understanding of weathering processes in different climatic regimes.
