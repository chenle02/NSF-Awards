This award will provide funds to physicists from the Bartol Research Institute,
who are performing calculations and analyses of data from cosmic ray
experiments. The principal aim of the research is to expand and strengthen the
phenomenological basis of non-accelerator experiments that depend on particle
cascading and to study the cosmic ray composition in a broad energy range and
help the understanding of ultra high energy gamma-ray signals.
