This is a two-year program of work to simulate the global distributions of
222Rn and 210Pb in the troposphere, using a three-dimensional model. Radon-222
(half-life 3.8 days) is released to the atmosphere by soils; it decays to 210Pb
(half- life 22.3 years), which is rapidly incorporated into aerosol particles
and is removed by deposition. The 222Rn/210Pb system is an excellent tracer of
vertical mixing, advection of continental air over oceans and polar regions, and
long-rang transport of aerosols. Long-term time series of measured
concentrations are available from a large number of sites around the world.
Successful interpretation of the observations with a 3-d model will advance
significantly our understanding of long-rang transport of pollutants in the
troposphere. The 3-d model to be used in this study has been shown previously to
provide excellent simulations of the distributions of long-lined tracers(CFC's
8.5Kr). The first effort will be to model 222Rn distributions over North
America. Model results will be evaluated by comparison with observed time series
of 222Rn concentrations in the United States. Transport of pollutants from the
boundary layer to the free troposphere will be investigated. Global simulations
of 222Rn will be used to study long-range transport in the southern hemisphere,
on the basis of extensive time series of concentrations measured at subantarctic
and antarctic sites. The latter part of the project will involve global
simulations of 210Pb, with emphasis on interpreting observations over North
America, the Pacific Ocean, the Arctic, and the Antarctic Results from the 210Pb
study will support an investigation of long-range transport of continental
aerosol over oceans and polar regions.
