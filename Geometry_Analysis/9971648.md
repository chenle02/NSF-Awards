9971648 Grove The project will deal with global problems in differential
geometry and related areas. Special emphasis will be devoted to the roles of
symmetry and of singular spaces in the geometry and topology of Riemannian
manifolds. In particular, one of the guiding principles behind the project is:
``Classify manifolds with positive or non-negative curvature and large isometry
groups.'' This naturally includes the study of manifolds with ``rotational
symmetry,'' i.e., manifolds with one- dimensional orbit spaces. This
investigation is also aimed at producing new examples of manifolds with positive
or non-negative curvature, a problem of notorious difficulty. Orbit spaces in
general provide important examples of the type of singular spaces that arise in
the study of manifolds with lower curvature bounds. The investigator's efforts
related to singular spaces are focussed on stability and inverse stability
problems. Answers to such problems will be instrumental in the deeper
understanding of the structure of Riemannian manifolds in general. Riemannian
manifolds are an abstraction of curved spaces possessing a distance function.
Unlike curves and surfaces in 3-space, these manifolds do not necessarily sit
inside an ambient space, hence they are abstract spaces. The research here aims
to understand various global aspects of these manifolds. In particular, the
investigator is interested in ways in which the positive or non-negative
curvature of such manifolds affects their global properties, sometimes in subtle
and unexpected ways. Prominent among these are various symmetry properties,
which will be an important focus of the research of the investigator and his
student. ***
