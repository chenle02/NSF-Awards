Three investigators will study problems involving the structure of non-
negatively curved manifolds, geodesics, minimal real Kaehler submanifolds,
collapse with bounded curvature, adiabatic limits and small eigenvalues of the
Laplacian, and rigidity properties of Riemannian manifolds and semisimple
groups. These investigators will analyze various aspects of the problem of
understanding all curved manifolds. This general problem has been the central
theme of differential geometry since its conception over one hundered years ago.
Specifically, these investigators will study the behavior of geodesics along
curved manifolds. On the surface of a sphere, great circles are the only
geodesics. But on other more complex surfaces, geodesics can take on many
surprising properties. The study of geodesics has particular application to
cosmology since according to Einstein's theories, each of us moves through four-
dimensional space-time along a geodesic.
