This grant provides funds to develop mathematical techniques and algorithms
that integrate the specification of continuous spatial movement with spatial
mechanism synthesis theory. Local coordinate frame independence is obtained by
interpolation of four dimensional rotations yielding a framework for geometric
synthesis methodologies. Virtual Reality techniques will provide the design
interface to control the task specification and guide the synthesis process. If
successful, this research will provide new capabilities for designers to
mechanize general spatial movement using devices of less complexity and cost
compared to existing robotic systems. Applications include compact and efficient
deployment/stowage devices for the wheelchair bound as well as novel automation
systems for manufacturing, office and the home.
