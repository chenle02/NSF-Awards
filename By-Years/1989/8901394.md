Dr. Holmgren is studying the process of pattern formation within segments of
Drosophila, and is particularly interested in the function of two gene clusters,
gooseberry (gsb) and cubitus interruptus Dominant-Cell (ciD-Ce). He hopes to
determine the role of the gsb, ciD and Ce genes in segmental pattern formation
by studying their molecular function and their relationship to other
segmentation genes. In his experiments,he will characterize the organization and
pattern of expression of the ciD and Ce genes; make antibodies to the gsb, ciD
and Ce gene products; determine the hierarchy of gene expression that leads to
the formation of posterior structures within segments; and study the promoter
regions of the gsb, ciD and Ce genes. By completing these experiments, he should
understand how cells in the posterior part of the segment are distinguished from
anterior cells. %%% Many animals are segmented. There is increasing evidence
that some of the insect and vertebrate genes which control segmentation share
homologies. The study of these genes in Drosophila is enhanced and facilitated
by the extensive knowledge of genetics in this organism. The knowledge gained
will most likely have more general relevance. %%%//
