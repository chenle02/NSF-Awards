This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to study the
properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast
Water (NEW) Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order to gain
an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope processes. This element of the
NEW program will evaluate the role of heterotrophic microorganisms on organic
materials produced within the polynya. It will test the hypothesis that low
temperatures severely restrict the degradative functions of microorganisms
associated with organic particulates produced within the polynya and available
for export beyond its boundaries. It will also assay for temporal shifts in
microbial community size, structure and complexity.
