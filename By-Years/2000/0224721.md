0224721&lt;br/&gt;Strand&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides support for a workshop on
the subject of creating transgenic plants for use in phytoremediation. While
much progress has been made in recent years on genetic modifications of plants
for remediation, the problems of heavy metal uptake and accumulation in levels
useful for phytoremediaton remain. For organic phytoremediaton to be useful, a
wide variety of trees must be transformed and activities optimized. This
workshop will provide an opportunity for scientists working in this area to
present their most recent findings and to discuss how this potentially powerful
technology might best be advanced. The workshop is planned for September 2002 in
Seattle, Washington.
