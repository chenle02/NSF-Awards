The principal investigator will continue his studies of various problems in
statistical mechanics. In particular, he will study the Heisenberg model for
ferromagnetism, in order to show that at low temperature the free energy of this
model approximates the free energy of a perfect Bose gas. He will also work on
models of high density classical gases with short-range interaction and on
ground state energies of many-body Coulomb systems. The basic aim of statistical
mechanics is to obtain the large scale thermodynamic behavior of a many-particle
system from a knowledge of the microscopic interactions between the particles.
The principal investigator will validate several approximate theories concerning
gases that have applicability to phenomena involving superfluidity and
superconductivity.
