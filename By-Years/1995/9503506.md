9503506 Connelly This award supports a 24-month Science and Technology Agency of
Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. J. Christopher Connelly of the Department
of Computer Science at Duke University. During his fellowship, Dr. Connelly will
be resident at the Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL) of the Agency of Industrial
Science and Technology (AIST) within the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) in Tsukuba, Japan. Dr. Connelly will work with Drs. Satoshi
Hirano and Michiharu Tsukamoto of the Distributed Systems Group at the
Electrotechnical Laboratory implementing and evaluating various resource and
locality management techniques under both simulated and real environments. As a
postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Connelly will have the opportunity to become familiar
with research techniques and equipment at the ETL while contributing to the
overall research effort. ETL has a large number of research machines available
for systems work. The Distributed Systems Group also collaborates with Dr.
Yuetsu Kodama's computer architecture group and has access to the experimental
dataflow machines under development. The availability of these machines will
provide Dr. Connelly an opportunity to study implementation issues and gain
experience working on real systems. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the
objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge
through an international collaboration. ***
