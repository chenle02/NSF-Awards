9704099 Day This is a theoretical research grant to Professor Day at Marquette
and Professor Thorpe at Michigan State. The work involves using a spectral
function approach to calculate the effective conductivity of composites. The
spectral function is essentially a density of the singularities of the effective
conductivity of a two-component composite and contains all of the information
about the geometry of the composite. Consequently, knowing the spectral function
for a wide range of geometries, and seeing how it varies with a change in
geometry, will provide a powerful new tool for understanding the relationship
between microstructure and material properties. %%% This theoretical research
will be done at both Marquette University and Michigan State University. The
work involves a new way of determining the properties of materials comprised of
two components, i.e., composite materials. These materials are used quite
commonly and the results of this research should aid in the design of these
useful materials. On a more fundamental basis, this research will aid in
relating microstructure of materials to their macroscopic properties. ***
