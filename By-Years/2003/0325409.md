A new trust model will be developed for grid metacomputing over multiple
administrative domains. The GridSec enhances grid operations with seamless
security, assured privacy, data integrity, confidentiality, and optimized
resource allocations. Distributed micro firewalls and intrusion repelling
libraries for protecting grid resources will be generated as a part of this
project. The new security system will be designed to adjust itself dynamically
with changing threat patterns and network conditions. Fine-grain resource-access
control at the file, device, and storage levels will be designed to enhanced the
trusted aspect of the system. &lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will
benefits all grid applications and offers protection of &lt;br/&gt;shared grid
resources. The eventual construction of a production grid platform dedicated for
global emergency response and crisis management is one of the project's goals.
This work integrates advanced security research with higher education. The
project enhances Internet and grid security, reduces the vulnerability of our
society, and protects the global economy as a whole. The broader impacts are far
reaching in science, education, business, and governments. &lt;br/&gt;
