Information processing (IP) is at the heart of the modern economy. The cutting
edge of IP is a new paradigm -- "quantum information processing," (QIP) -- where
bits are encoded in microscopic states of light and matter. The nonintuitive
properties of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement allow for
computations, communications, and measurements beyond the power and any existing
IP device. This grant studies the implementation of QIP with atomic gasses
cooled to ultralow temperatures. Laser beams act as a quantum databus to
entangle atoms with one another, and as a mechanism for reading out the
information. The control of atoms is studied to create new quantum states that
have the unique properties necessary for QIP. This work is theoretical, carried
out in close collaboration with laboratory experiments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research contributes to the knowledge base of quantum
information science, and to the training of future scientists in this highly
interdisciplinary field. Students will be involved in all aspects of the
project, including education, research, and the dissemination of results. The
project is an integral part of the NSF-funded Center for Quantum Information and
Control (CQuIC). We use video conferencing to allow participation of CQuIC
partners in the regular activities of CQuIC, including weekly group meetings and
research seminars, and strengthen the connections between junior and senior
members through an annual research retreat. All students and senior personnel
actively participate in the Southwest Quantum Information Technology (SQuInT)
network, including the annual workshop. During its 15-year history SQuInT has
provided a vibrant avenue for exchange of ideas and results in QIS, with
particular emphasis given to PhD students, postdocs, and new researchers in the
field.
