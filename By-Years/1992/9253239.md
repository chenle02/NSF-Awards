This three year project, sponsored by the University of Alabama at Birmingham,
provides a program to teach 30 outstanding high school chemistry teachers
laboratory techniques. Participants will learn all phase of chemistry laboratory
operations with emphasis on laboratory management and safety. At the end of the
program these teachers will be certified as Laboratory Management Specialists
and will carry out in-service training for other teachers. The project has a
follow-up component which supports the teachers as they conduct in-service work.
The matching funds from the University and participating schools constitute an
amount equal to 27% of the NSF grant.
