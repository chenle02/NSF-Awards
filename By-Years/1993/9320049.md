9320049 Partridge The cosmic microwave background radiation (CBR) reaches us
from a time near the Big Bang origin of the Universe. As a consequence, it
encodes unique information about the physical properties of the early Universe
and about the early evolution of structure within the Universe. A recent
satellite detection of angular variations in the CBR has provided important
clues to the origin and evolution of very large-scale structure in the cosmos.
The research to be conducted in this award is a study of the CBR on smaller
scales, better matched to the size of structures we see in the Universe today,
such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies. The Principal Investigator will make
a deep radio map of a region of the sky at microwave frequencies. This will be
the most sensitive radio "portrait" of the sky ever made. He will study the same
area using the Hubble Space Telescope and other instruments to provide
complementary information. In particular, it is hoped this research will provide
a much clearer picture of when and how galaxies formed. In addition this work
will enable studies of the properties of foreground sources, including radio
galaxies. These sources are of interest in their own right. In addition, their
emission interferes with attempts to study the CBR itself. The observations will
help astronomers characterize and minimize this interference. Undergraduate
students will be fully involved in all the observations and analysis. The
Principal Investigator is regarded as a leader in this research area. ***
