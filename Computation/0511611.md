The aim of this proposal is to develop, analyze and implement a class of
optimization algorithms that integrate multilevel iterative solvers and so-
called `all-at-once' optimization methods. Multilevel techniques provide
efficient partial differential equation (PDE) solvers with regard to algorithmic
complexity. Optimization methods based on the all-at-once approach, such as
sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods and primal-dual Newton interior-
point methods, incorporate the PDEs as constraints into the optimization routine
and hold the promise to save a considerable amount of computational work
compared to methods that view the PDE solution as an implicit function of the
control/design variables. This research integrates multilevel techniques and
optimization algorithms to extract an adequate amount of structural information
from the originally infinite dimensional optimization problem which can not be
achieved when only relying on a single grid. In addition to general PDE
constrained optimization algorithm development, this proposal will also
contribute to the development of solution methods for two challenging real-life
applications: the shape optimization of electrorheological devices and the
identification of different phases in atmospheric aerosol modeling. Both
applications are governed by complex systems of PDEs with nonlinearities due to,
e.g., the constitutive equations or the intricate coupling conditions for the
PDEs. Moreover, both optimization problems involve additional equality and
inequality constraints due to design specifications or problem chemistry.

This research provides new algorithmic tools for optimization problems with
constraints given by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). The
solution of such problems is an important task in an increasing number real-life
applications such as the shape optimization of technological devices and the
identification of physical quantities in atmospheric and geophysical processes.
Despite recent progress, the reliable numerical solution of these optimization
problems still represents a challenging task. Challenges arise, e.g., from the
complexity of the underlying PDEs, from the large scale of the optimization
problems and from the interactions of the structure of the underlying
application, the numerical solution of PDEs and the numerical optimization. In
addition to general algorithm development, this research also tackles two
important and challenging real-life PDE constrained optimization applications:
the shape optimization of electrorheological devices, such as shock absorbers,
and the identification of different phases in atmospheric aerosol modeling, a
crucial component in environmental research.
