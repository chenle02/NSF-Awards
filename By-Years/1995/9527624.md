9527624 Ebrahimi This project addresses two emerging scientific interests: the
extraordinary strength of composites with interphase spacing in the submicron to
nanoscale range and near-net- shape manufacturing of metal composites by
electroforming. The objective is to utilize electrodeposition as a technique to
produce ultra-fine laminated composites of copper-nickel and copper-silver, and
to develop a mechanistic understanding of microstructure and mechanical property
relationships in these materials. The study aims at understanding the effects of
fineness of microstructure measured by laminate spacing OsO to grain size OdO,
texture, and interfacial structure on yielding, strain hardening, and fracture
behavior. The choice of the Cu-Ni and Cu-Ag systems allows investigation of the
effects of lattice mismatch and stacking fault energy on the interfacial
structure and mechanical properties of nanostructured multilayers. Results of
extensive microstructural and mechanical characterization will be analyzed and
used to develop mechanistic models for deformation and fracture of ultra-fine
multilayered composites. %%% This study extends understanding of deformation and
fracture mechanisms in ultra-fine, laminated composites. ***
