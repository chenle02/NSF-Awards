This Engineering Research Equipment proposal is for funds for a specific
experimental set-up for obtaining material data and for conducting experiments
to understand the biaxial yield and flow behavior of high strength steels and
aluminum. Material data and the understanding emerging from the experiments
using this equipment are necessary to investigate sheet metal wrinkling during
stamping operations and to provide technical guidelines for avoiding such
defects when forming high strength materials. This equipment will be also used
for fundamental studies on anisotropic yielding behavior of textured metals and
on deformation mechanisms in metal matrix composites. In addition to these
research uses, the equipment will be employed for student laboratory projects
and demonstrations.
