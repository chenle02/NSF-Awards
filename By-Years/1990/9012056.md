This award supports the Fifth International Workshop on Natural Language
Generation. The Fifth Workshop is designed to foster interaction between basic
researchers in computational linguistics and natural language generation and
researchers in areas that wish to make use of the results of state of the art
research in these areas, in particular, researchers in machine translation,
intelligent tutoring systems, user interfaces, and expert system explanation.
Using generation in these areas places new demands on natural language
generation and it is increasingly important that "basic researchers" and "users"
interact in forums such as this. In addition, the workshop is intended to be a
vehicle for wider distribution of the newly available tools.
