9508628 Berner Organisms generate heat by the breakdown of fuels during cellular
metabolism. In endotherms, metabolic heat can be produced fast enough to raise
body temperature significantly above that of the surroundings. In ectotherms,
rates of metabolic heat production are so low that body temperature is
determined primarily by the surrounding environment. The aim of this research is
to determine the mechanisms that permit endotherms to produce heat at a greater
rate than can ectotherms. High rates of metabolic heat production are usually
linked to high rates of oxygen consumption and production of usable chemical
potential energy. These last two processes occur in subcellular organelles, the
mitochondria. This research will contrast the rate of oxygen consumption and
chemical potential energy (ATP) production by the mitochondria of endotherms and
ectotherms under a variety of conditions. Experimental treatments will include
varying the temperature at which the mitochondria work and varying the fuels
provided to the mitochondria as they perform their metabolic functions. The
research will improve understanding of the mechanisms responsible for metabolic
differences between endotherms and ectotherms and of how these differences
evolved.
