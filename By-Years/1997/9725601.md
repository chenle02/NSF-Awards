9725601 Abers This research will test hypotheses regarding the fate of
subducting slabs, by means of seismic methods to globally characterize subducted
crust. At intermediate depths of 70- 300 km, subducting plates undergo a series
of transformations in both compositional and mechanical properties. The
transformations play a critical role in earthquake genesis, arc magmatism, plate
densification, and material recycling in the mantle. Frequency-dependent
behavior, or dispersion, of regional seismic body waves is generated in slabs as
they interact with subducted crust and other interfaces, and so is a highly
sensitive indicator of the composition of subducted crust and surrounding
mantle. Previous observations show strong discrepancies in the mode of
dispersion of waves through the Tonga slab compared to Japan and Alaska,
suggesting remarkably different velocity structures - high frequencies arrive
early in Tonga, and late in Japan and Alaska. This research will characterize
that dispersion and how it varies globally between slabs. ***
