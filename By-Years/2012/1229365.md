The ultracentrifuge that is requested with this proposal is an essential piece
of equipment for research characterizing and bioengineering light sensitive
proteins from cyanobacteria. It is necessary to separate proteins from the
E.coli expression system that are used for bioengineering proteins. The focus of
The Spiller Lab is to engineer a small, bright red fluorescent protein tag for
in vivo microscopy. Undergraduate, post baccalaureate and glide-year students at
Mills College are engaged in the laboratory work. They gain research experience
and expertise, while participating in leading edge research. Another goal of
Spiller Lab is to encourage young women to pursue scientific careers. Spiller
Lab was awarded a NSF-CBET-0967965 grant in April 2010 to fund this research. An
ultracentrifuge is one of the critical pieces of equipment for this project. The
Spiller Lab is currently working on a leading-edge research project in
collaboration with Center for Biophotonics Science and Technology (CBST),
University of California, Davis. They are using PCR, and E.coli expression
system, to capture, characterize and purify GAF domains from the five (5) class
II (blue/green) cyanobacteriochromes.
