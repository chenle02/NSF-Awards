Professor Venakides intends to study mathematical problems of oscillation and
wave propagation. He wants to determine the nature of oscillations in waveforms
which are governed by a nonlinear partial differential equation of Schrodinger
type. The interesting part of this work consists of studying the passage to the
limit when the dispersive term becomes very small. Problems of this type were
studied for the Korteweg-DeVries equation by Peter Lax, Henry McKean and Eugene
Trubowitz of Courant Institute and by Herman Flaschka and others from the
University of Arizona. Venakides brings new techniques to his study and wants to
derive an integral equation which would characterize the solution in the limit
case. He also wants to perform a similar study for a system of nonlinear
ordinary differential equations known as Toda Lattice. Other projects described
by him include an inverse problem for a Schrodinger equation, study of equations
of granular flow and the work on the understanding of certain procedure for
stochastic equations with a nonlinear operator. This research falls into the
general area of studies in nonlinear partial differential equations which
describe wave propagation phenomena such as solitary waves, acoustic waves,
shocks and wavefronts, optical communications and laser technology. This
particular research is intended to add to the knowledge base underlying such
physical phenomena. The nonlinear partial differential equations of the type
investigated in this project are important mathematical tools for engineering
problems encountered in wave propogation.
