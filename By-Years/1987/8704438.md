A multiwire area detector system will be acquired to serve as a rapid method for
recording X-ray diffraction data from single crystals of proteins and nucleic
acids. The system includes a multiwire area detector chamber, a full-circle
goniometer, graphite monochromator, mounting modifications for a rotating- anode
X-ray generator and a 400 megabyte disk drive for a VAX II Station for data
acquisition and processing. The equipment will be used for crystallographic
analysis of macromolecular structures as part of current biological research
problems relevant to plant science, molecular biology, cell biology
biotechnology. The projects include: (1) protein elongation factor complexes and
related G proteins, (2) nucleic acid-binding proteins and protein-nucleic acid
complexes, (3) mono- and polysaccharide processing proteins, (4) glycoproteins,
(5) serum transport proteins and (6) agriculturally-related proteins. The area
detector will allow fragile crystals to be examined as well as facilitate more
rapid data collection, and permit a molecular level of understanding for
significant biological questions.
