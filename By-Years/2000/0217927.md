This grant concerns the development of a statistical procedure for testing the
quality of a feasible candidate solution for an important class of stochastic
programs. Quality is defined via the so-called optimality gap and the output of
the procedure is a confidence interval on this gap. Monte Carlo simulation-based
tools will be employed to make the procedure efficient and to tighten the width
of the resulting confidence interval. The method is not tied to specific
solution algorithms. Hence, success will result in an approach that can be
widely adopted for solving real-world stochastic
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic programming is a powerful tool for
making decisions in complex systems that contain significant uncertainties.
Stochastic programming problems arise in many areas of application including
financial planning, production capacity planning, managing natural resources,
communications networks, and national security. Success with the proposed work
will enable analysts to efficiently assess the quality of candidate solutions to
such problems. &lt;br/&gt;
