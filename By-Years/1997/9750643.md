This project is developing an undergraduate physiology or neurosciences program.
Undergraduates are being provided with training in the neurosciences and
physiology that is has previously been unavailable due to lack of appropriate
instrumentation. Productive research in neurosciences (and animal physiology)
requires extensive technical skills and background. Many undergraduates lack the
training to even be considered for undergraduate research or participation in
summer research and training programs in the neurosciences. Therefore, the
project is building three neurosciences workstations and incorporating four
neurophysiological exercises into a junior-level course in animal physiology.
This plan compliments and improves the course emphasis on neurosciences while
enhancing the student skills necessary for advanced study and research. The new
instrumentation is stimulating undergraduate research in the neurosciences and
physiology. In addition, the project prepares students for productive summer
enrichment programs in the neurosciences and increases interest in graduate
careers in the neurosciences and animal physiology.
