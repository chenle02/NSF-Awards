Westchester Community College (WCC) proposes to initiate a three-year project
toincrease the numbers of students entering the mathematics, science, and
engineering fieldsthrough the use of mathematical modeling. The more students
who enter these fields, themore apt is the country likely to regain its economic
leadership.The college will provide an early exposure to mathematical modeling--
the first time at acommunity college--in order to make mathematics more
interesting, exciting, and relevant.A manual on mathematical modeling will be
developed, refined, and disseminated widely. It will be used as the basis for
establishing an elective course in mathematical modelingat WCC. It will also be
used to coach teams of students who will participate in the annualmathematical
modeling competition.A national conference will be conducted to provide wide
exposure to mathematicalmodeling at community colleges. The Principal
Investigator will assist other colleges toinitiate course in mathematical
modeling and to establish student teams for entry into thecompetitions.
