This award will support a three year exchange program between U.S. and French
researchers in the field of stochastic control. The U.S. group will be under the
leadership of Dr. Ionnis Karatzas, Rutgers University. The French group will
involve Dr. Alain Bensoussain and Dr. Etienne Pardoux, French National Institute
for Information Science and Automation (INRIA) and Dr. Pierre-Louis Lions,
University of Paris IX - Dauphine. Both the US and French participants have made
outstanding contributions in the area of stochastic control. This project will
provide the opportunity for their continued collaboration in such fields as
stochastic optimization, stochastic algorithms in large-scale optimization
problems, probabilitistic models in financial economics, singular control and
its applications to discrete-event systems, applications to manufacturing and
data networks and perturbation and analytical methods.
