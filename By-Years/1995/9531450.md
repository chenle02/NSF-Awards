A technique for direct, in-situ measurement of the stress tensor in deep
glacier ice will be developed by adapting methods presently in use in rock
mechanics for the measurement of in-situ stress in visco-elastic/plastic
materials. Direct stress and deformation measurements will be combined. This
will provide two critical properties near the bed of a glacier experiencing
fairly complex sliding behavior. For the first time, independent observations of
the full stress tensor and the full strain rate tensor in glacier ice will be
obtained. The determination of the spatial and temporal character of coupling
between glacier ice and the glacier bed is necessary for understanding the
dynamics of virtually all ice masses of current interest. Variations in basal
and marginal tractions are critical controlling factors in polar ice streams,
calving and surging glaciers. The behavior of ice sheets, as well as the
stratigraphic interpretation of cores taken from ice sheets, depend on an
understanding of the patterns of coupling at the bed and the velocity fields
that arise in the ice as a consequence.
