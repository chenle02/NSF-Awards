An international workshop entitled "QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) Hard Hadronic
Processes" will be held at St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands on October 8-13,
1987. This workshop is part of NATO's (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)
program to support Advanced Research Workshops. NATO is providing 990,000
Belgian Francs (approximately $22,000) in support of the workshop. The purpose
of the workshop is to review the state of knowledge of processes involving
energetic collisions between elementary particle physics in the frame work of
the current theory of the strong interaction, QCD.
