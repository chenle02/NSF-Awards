This award supports one aspect of the second Greenland Ice Sheet Project
(GISPII). The goal of GISP II is the retrieval and paleoclimatic interpretation
of a deep core to be drilled near Summit, Greenland. These studies will
characterize the core and verify its stratigraphic continuity (or identify
discontinuities), prerequisites to any paleoclimatic analyses. These studies
also will lead to a better understanding of the deformation of ice and its
dependence on fabric, impurity concentrations, grain size, andother factors.
Data to be collected include: visual stratification, density, texture (size,
shape and arrangement of grains and pores) and fabric (c-axis orientations).
