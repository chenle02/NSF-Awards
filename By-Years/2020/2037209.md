This workshop will bring together experts working to define new research topics
of particular relevance to Native American social scientists. Language is a
critical component of human societies, and so it has an important place in the
social sciences. For Native Americans, this emphasis on language has led to an
upsurge in revitalization programs. Language Learning in Native American
Revitalization Programs (LLiNARP) addresses the current low percentage of
underrepresented minorities in social science research. The many language
revitalization programs developed by Native American communities have opened a
new area of research in language acquisition and linguistic theory. These
programs are of high relevance to Native Americans, and this workshop will help
promote the work of active Native American social scientists and bring new
researchers into collaborations and projects that have yet to materialize.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aims of the workshop are to define new research topics
within linguistics that will involve Native American researchers, to explore the
ways in which language acquisition in revitalization programs differs from other
situations, and to engage federal and private funders in a discussion of how
these new topics will fulfill their missions. The broader impacts will include
enhanced tools and theories for documenting and reviving languages;
revitalization often depends heavily on previous documentation, and its use is
more effective when its assumptions and implications are better understood.
Revitalization programs have positive health benefits for the communities
involved, and better guidelines for creating successful programs should lead to
further benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
