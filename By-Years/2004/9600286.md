Dissertation Enhancement Award for Mr. Paul Gross at the Central Research
Laboratory, Hitachi, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan. Mr. Gross will work with Dr. Ikuo
Saitoh, senior research scientist at CRL, on a research project entitled, "A
Software Implementation of an Algorithm to Make Cuts for Magnetic Scalar
Potentials Without Implicit Heuristic Assumptions About Homotopy Groups". The
proposed research will develop practical and computationally efficient solutions
to problems related to 3- D magnetoquasistatic electromagnetic field
computation. The key problem to be addressed involves using a computer to "cut"
the finite element mesh of a 3-dimensional, multiply- connected region so as to
permit the computation of a magnetic scalar potential in the nonconducting
region of the problem space. The specific focus of the proposed research will be
on the creation of software algorithms so as to increase the finite computations
needed for the analysis, the practical outcome being the development of a
methodology that reduces the design cycle time and costs of magnetic devices.
