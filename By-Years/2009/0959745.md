This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation-
Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award funds the acquisition of a 120 kV
electron microscopy system and supporting sample preparation equipment at the
University of Arkansas Medical Sciences Campus(UAMS). The equipment is tailored
to the needs of a group of basic scientists in the Departments of Physiology and
Biophysics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Neurobiology and
Developmental Sciences at UAMS. The new microscope is also accessible to
investigators at other regional institutions. This acquisition is a major step
toward establishing the only such biological electron microscope facility in the
state of Arkansas. Research utilizing the new system includes studies to
understand elements of virology, golgi apparatus function, neuronal physiology,
endocrine secretion, and many more topics. Both undergraduate and graduate
students will benefit from the acquisition of this instrumentation as
investigators are engaged in the training of Ph.D. students in research, and
each summer there is significant participation of undergraduates in the
collaborating laboratories. Results from the studies enabled by the new
instrumentation will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, and through
students and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings.
