This Presidential Young Investigator award to Dr. Susan Golden provides general
research support for her studies of photosynthetic bacteria. She is studying the
genes for the oxygen-evolving photochemical pathways of cyanobacteria and
prochlorophytes (which more closely resemble chloroplasts of higher plants than
do the cyanobacteria). Gene structure, organization, and transcription in these
organisms, compared to genes in chloroplasts, should help define essential
elements of the coordinated synthesis and assembly of the photosynthetic
membrane.
