It is proposed that a system of U.S. National Geotechnical Experimentation sites
be established. Two NSF funded workshops have been held to discuss the required
features of such sites and the organization of a management system. Five sites
have been identified for immediate development. These sites, and others that
might be chosen in the future, would be open to all geotechnical researchers,
where fundamental soil characteristics have already been well defined and are
readily available. Such sites exist in other countries and have contributed
greatly to advancing their research base and technical capabilities.
