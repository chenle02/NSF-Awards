The proposed Taxonomy of Virtual Worlds for Education workshop will bring
together a group of practitioners (especially teachers and students),
researchers, and technology providers to brainstorm the ideal virtual world
software system(s) for STEM learning. The goal is to ensure that the evolution
of the medium is informed from the beginning by the user community. From
experience, educators have found that each system has both attractive and
detracting features when considered for use in educational settings. This
workshop is intended specifically to flesh out the landscape of educational
virtual world applications: What would the ideal system for educational
applications look like? In particular, what are the best ways to manage tasks
specific to education? This workshop will center on (but not be restricted to)
primarily K-12 education both from the points of view of teachers and students
in classroom and informal settings and from the perspective of teacher
professional development and support professionals. This workshop will build a
taxonomy of features/affordances/capabilities derived from across the spectrum
of systems available and then create a matrix (multidimensional and/or suite of
matrices) that can be used by STEM educators as they search for appropriate
software solutions.
