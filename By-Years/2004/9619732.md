9619732 Vaughan ABSTRACT This program provides an opportunity for ten advanced
undergraduate students to conduct independent research during a ten-week summer
period under the guidance of faculty in the Biological Systems Engineering
Department at Virginia Tech. The student participants will be involved in
research in Land and Water Engineering and Biological Engineering. The program
is structured to create an environment for guided independent discovery and
maturation of self-expression by the students. The students will work in teams
including faculty, graduate students and staff conducting research on current
problems being investigated in biological systems engineering using state of-
the-art facilities, equipment and instrumentation. The goal of the program is to
provide an active, rich, comprehensive research experience which will excite and
motivate the students toward a research career in engineering for biological
systems. Students will practice the scientific method, enhance their thinking
and reasoning abilities, sharpen their communication skills, gain further
appreciation of the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of problems. They
will also gain hands-on experience in laboratory and field research methods, and
learn how to be an active team member a focused and motivated group of
individuals with diverse backgrounds. Student participants will be involved in
two overlapping research programs in Biological Systems Engineering - Land and
Water Engineering and Biological Engineering. Diverse research problem areas
include a) environmental activities focused on determining the effects of land
use and best management practices in water quality, and b) bioprocessing
problems aimed at the development and production of industrial products from
biological feedstocks. Both areas of research seek to provide more sustainable
crop and animal production and processing systems while protecting our soil,
water, air and other natural resources. ***
