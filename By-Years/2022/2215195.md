This project investigates the relationship between coastal flooding and human
migration. The study uses custom sensors to detect floods at high spatial
resolution, integrating the data on flood frequency with measures of individual
intentions, capacity, and actions regarding relocation. Community partners will
identify flood-prone areas for the sensor network and guide the development of a
user-friendly real-time website for flood information. The goal is to provide
new insight on the impacts of floods on coastal communities and how migration
may unfold in the future as sea levels rise. This information can be used to
develop strategies that support resilient, sustainable coastal communities as
the climate changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While sea level rise is projected to
dramatically reshape coastlines around the world, many questions remain about
how individuals and communities will respond to more frequent minor flooding,
punctuated by extreme storms. Smaller floods, such as those caused by
particularly high tides, are difficult to detect, limiting our understanding of
how people experience and respond to such events. This project deploys a novel
sensor network to detect floods of all sizes. The sensor data will be used to
assess the effects of flooding on migration intentions and behavior. Household
surveys provide information on migration intentions, capacity, and the social,
psychological, and financial context in which migration decisions are being
made. Migration behavior is measured using administrative records. Overall, this
project expands knowledge about the effects of sea level rise on coastal
residents and the role of migration as a response
measure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
