This award supports a 1.5-day workshop at the University of Maryland that brings
together engineers and scientists from academia and industry with expertise in
speech processing, natural language processing and robotics to focus on the
critical role that speech science should play in developing future embodied
robotic technologies that can communicate effectively with humans of any
demographics and in any environment. The result of the workshop will be a report
containing well-motivated interdisciplinary research opportunities to promote
the development of social robot applications that are beneficial to society.
Solving the problem of spoken language processing for human to robot interaction
will help in allowing a broad application of social robots including working
with and alongside people in homes, schools, hospitals and
workplaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first day of the workshop will include
several parallel breakout groups that look at a variety of topics including the
applications for social robots, what lessons we can learn from conversational
agents, improving the spoken language communication of robots, shared resources
and tasks across researchers, training of students, and collaboration between
researchers in academia and those in industry. The second day will include all
participants in a discussion of the results from the breakout sessions and the
documentation of opportunities to move the field forward during the next 5 to 10
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
