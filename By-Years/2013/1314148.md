This grant supports research to complete the determination of the weak charge of
the proton and investigate new aspects of the Standard Model of fundamental
matter and interactions. The Standard Model describes three of the four forces
of nature in an elegant manner; those three forces are the electromagnetic
interaction, the weak interaction, and the strong interaction. The weak charge
of the proton is a basic property, like its electric charge and mass, which
determines the proton's response to the weak interaction. It is also related to
how the weak and electromagnetic interactions mix with each other. Because the
Standard Model predicts how that mixing varies with the amount of momentum that
is exchanged in an interaction, a precise measurement of the proton's weak
charge at a low value of momentum transfer is a rigorous test of the Standard
Model. Additionally, it is sensitive to physics not yet included in the Standard
Model. The research program of this award also includes measurements of semi-
inclusive deep inelastic scattering that is sensitive to charge symmetry
breaking at the quark level and further extends our understanding
of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research group
supported by this grant will re-commission the Mott polarimeter at Jefferson
Lab. That polarimeter will measure the alignment of electron spins in the
electron beam of Jefferson Lab; knowing that alignment is crucial to providing
polarized electron beams to the four experimental halls of the Lab. Both
hardware and software issues will be addressed in this project so the student
and postdoctoral researchers will gain a wide range of valuable skills. These
broader impacts on the polarized program of Jefferson Lab and the training of
young scientists are interwoven into the research program.
