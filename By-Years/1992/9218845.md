The principal focus of this ongoing research involves structural and crystal
chemical characterization of earth materials believed to occur in the Earth's
upper mantle and transition zone. Information on Fe/Mg ordering in mantle
silicates and its effect on mantle mineral equations of state and on the extent
of polyhedral distortion in silicates above 10 GPa will be obtained at high
temperatures and pressures using diamond anvil pressure cells. This research has
application in understanding earth processes as the dynamic history and present
state of the Earth's deep interior result from properties of its constituent
materials. The research will conducted at the Geophysical Laboratory (Carnegie
Institute of Washington), which supports the only American facility engaged
primarily in high-pressure, single-crystal, x-ray diffraction studies of
minerals and their analogues. The crystallographic laboratory will also continue
to serve the American materials research community.
