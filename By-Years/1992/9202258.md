Interspecific hybridization is common in plants and can have important
evolutionary consequences. Because of its evolutionary significance,
hybridization in plants has been the subject of considerable empirical study at
the macroenolutionary level, particularly in systematics and phylogeny
reconstruction. Although hybridization is the result of microevolutionary
processes, previous studies have not measured the microevolutionary dynamics of
the hybridization process in situ. The primary goal of this research is to
conduct a such a study, measuring the genetic, spatial, and gender parameters
that determine the rate of interspecific hybridization and bi-species gene flow
in a natural hybrid swarm of Salvia in Southern California. The Principal
Investigator will obtain these data by using polymorphic genetic markers for
paternity analysis, and identifying pollen parents of seeds set by all
individuals in the swarm. The resultant data will shed light on the
microevolutionary dynamics of this important evolutionary force.
