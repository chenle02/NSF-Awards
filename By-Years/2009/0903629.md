This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award
supports a new graduate training program in open data sharing and data reuse in
e-science at the University of Michigan. The purpose of this program is to
generate new policies, practices, and technologies for data sharing that will
accelerate the pace of scientific discovery and the transfer of scientific
knowledge into useful products and technologies. It will build on computer
science and information science research that identifies basic principles for
acquiring, managing, sharing, and archiving data and for developing new tools
and technologies to put these principles into practice in bioinformatics and
materials research. The program will train a cohort of doctoral students in a
new way of thinking about open data. These students will be capable of
contributing high quality data to repositories and effectively leveraging large
volumes of data in scientific research. Students from Michigan's doctoral
programs in Bioinformatics, Materials Science, Chemical Engineering, Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science, and Information will be selected as IGERT
trainees. The trainees will participate in a new graduate course in data
curation, a multi-disciplinary public seminar series with expert speakers, and
short workshops. Program faculty will also develop a supplemental summer program
for undergraduates to attract diverse students and strengthen the program's
impact in other scientific fields. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet
the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the
interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the
technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of
the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate
education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and
training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends
traditional disciplinary boundaries.
