Support is requested for an instrumentation upgrade to enhance the research
facilities provided by the Microscopy Center at the University of Massachusetts
at Amherst. The Center and its staff provide a complete range of research and
training services in light and electron microscopy, with emphasis on biological
applications. Replacement of the laser and light sensing system of an existing
confocal microscope will provide the sensitivity needed for projects on living
cells, and an inverted microscope configuration will facilitate microinjection
experiments. For image acquisition, display and processing, replacement of an
outdated Micro Vax computer with an Indigo graphics workstation capable of
handling the three dimensional reconstruction and rendering of large confocal
data sets is requested. Acquisition of a rapid freezing device and freeze-
substitution unit w ill enable users to take advantage of the improved
structural preservation and antigen retention provided by cryotechniques. As
examples of the work that will be made possible by these upgrades, the research
projects of seven major users and eleven minor users of the Microscopy Center,
covering a wide range of topics are described. The projects, all of which are
externally funded, are focused on important problems in cell biology,
neurobiology, and biogenesis. Strong institutional support for the Microscopy
Center is provided by contributions from four Administrative units, which
currently exceeds $120,000 per year. Users are charged fees based on the cost of
consumable supplies, and microscope time. This combined income covers the
salaries of two professional microscopists, maintenance contracts on the
electron microscopes and modest repair and replacement costs.
