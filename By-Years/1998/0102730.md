A conference on the "Chemistry of Supramolecules and Assemblies" will be held at
the end of July 2001 at Connecticut College as part of the Gordon Research
Conference series. This conference will focus on the chemistry, properties and
reactions of supramolecules and supramolecular assemblies; topics of current
interest as they relate to such issues as (i) building blocks of extended 2D and
3D colloidal crystals, (ii) nanostructured and layered materials, (iii)
surfactants and DNA, (iv) assembly of molecules and polymers into thin films,
(v) functional dendrimers, (vi) vesicles, emulsions, mono- and bi-layers, micro-
emulsions and liquid crystals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate
students invited to participate at this conference will gain a valuable
experience through informal interactions with more seasoned investigators, given
the nature and practice of these conferences.
