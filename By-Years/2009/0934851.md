The Math for America Boston: Teacher Scholars Program represents a partnership
among Boston University, seven high needs school districts in the Boston area
(Arlington, Boston, Cambridge, Chelsea, Lawrence, Waltham, and Watertown), and
the non-profit Math for America. The partners are working together to recruit
twelve STEM professionals and prepare them to teach mathematics in middle or
high schools. The partners are also recruiting five Master Teaching Fellows who
serve as mentors and leaders in their districts. The Teaching Fellows are
enrolling in a Master of Arts in Teaching degree program with licensure in
secondary mathematics. The Master Teaching Fellows have the option of enrolling
in a Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study program or in a second master's
degree program. Fellows are participating in a math immersion program designed
to let them experience what it is like to struggle to learn difficult concepts
so that they can better help their students. The courses in the programs are
being designed to integrate content and method through close and ongoing
collaboration of educators, mathematicians, and master teachers. Teaching
Fellows are also being prepared for work in urban school settings with an
emphasis on effective strategies to assist diverse populations. Master Teaching
Fellows are mentoring pre-service teachers as well as Teaching Fellows and are
preparing to lead professional development activities in their districts. The
project is being rigorously assessed to determine its impact on recruitment,
quality, and continued support of Fellows, and ultimately its impact on teaching
effectiveness and teacher retention.
