This HBCU-RISE proposal seeks support to implement a new Neuroscience PhD
program and to build and develop our state-wide neuroscience network at Delaware
State University. The project will support student stipends and research
supplies, start up and release time for new faculty with neuroscience-related
research and support for a weekly neuroscience seminar that will rotate among
consortium institutions and be live streamed to all of them. The RISE project
will provide resources for new educational opportunities for minority students
and increase their opportunities to be involved in cutting edge research in an
area with growing career opportunities and scientific importance. This project
integrates research and education by supporting graduate students, supporting
new faculty members to establish independent research programs at an HBCU and
fostering scientific collaborations among faculty at DSU and partner
institutions. The strengthened research and research-training infrastructure at
DSU will increase the number of minority students successfully pursuing PhD
degrees in the Life Sciences and increase faculty productivity. The neuroscience
network will serve as a national model for successful partnership between HBCUs,
majority institutions, research institutes, and industry.
