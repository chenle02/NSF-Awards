AST-0434277&lt;br/&gt;Petters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an interdisciplinary
research program involving synergistic interactions between mathematics
(probability theory, statistics, singularity theory) and astronomy
(gravitational lensing of quasars, dark matter on galactic scales). This
research addresses two pressing scientific issues: the flux ratio anomaly
problem in gravitational lensing, and difficulties with the cold dark matter
picture. It will open up new mathematical directions, including a generalization
of Morse theory to a stochastic setting, and a study of the statistical geometry
of random magnification excursions sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from the
research will be incorporated into an undergraduate seminar on the mathematics
of gravitational lensing and a graduate course on general relativity, and
presented at major international scientific conferences. This study also creates
scientific partnerships among several US institutions and Potsdam, Germany.
