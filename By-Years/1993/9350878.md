The computer is revolutionizing the teaching of physics, both in the laboratory
and in the classroom. A computer-integrated approach in the classroom allows
students to study in detail situations where analytic solutions are impossible.
It also frees them from tedious hand calculations, thus allowing more time for
consideration of the essential aspects of the problem.The computer revolution
has been under way for some time in the Furman Physics Department, where we have
begun to use computer simulations as classroom demonstrations, to give course
assignments involving computer-aided computation and graphing, to use computer-
interfaced laboratory equipment for the collection and analysis of data, and to
work with students on individual computer-related projects. This award is
providing the computer hardware and software needed to expand our current usage
of the computer to involve all students taking courses in three target areas:
classical physics, quantum mechanics, and computational physics. Specifically,
the award has provided an eight station networked computer facility with a file
server, compute server host, along with general-purpose and applications
software.
