This project is applying advances in digital library (DL) technologies to the
emerging domain of bioinformatics, and developing interaction tools that support
learning based on identifying and visualizing associations among key dimensions
of bioinformatics resources. The project is making these current resources,
which are mainly utilized by expert biologists, available to bioinformatics
students. The project addresses issues regarding: the use of a wide variety of
formats and representations to store bioinformatics information; the application
of DL technologies particularly in the realm of data description and exchange;
mapping of metadata associated with bioinformatics information to data
description standards compatible with DL technologies; and building clients that
take advantage of data dissemination protocols such as the Open Archives
Initiative in order to support novel browse, search, and analysis functions
based on visualizations. The project team is also integrating DL and Grid
computing technologies, and utilizes bioinformatics resources of Indiana
University such as the Drosophila Genome Flybase, the IUBio Archive that
contains euGenes eukaryote genes data, and the Bionet news archive and related
software.
