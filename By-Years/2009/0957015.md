This engineering education research award to Purdue University in collaboration
with Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University will develop a
comprehensive knowledge management system and visualization methods for the
rapidly growing field of engineering education research. Using data mining and
social networking techniques, this project will identify emerging research
topics and improve theoretical understanding of collaborative networks. This
effort will make a significant impact on the engineering education research
community by discovering how to develop a novel knowledge management system that
can aid both researchers and faculty who wish to apply research results in the
classroom. This could accelerate both the pace of engineering education research
and also the rate at which research results are put into practice. Results of
this work will benefit other emerging multidisciplinary areas in engineering and
contribute to better preparation of engineers to fill engineering jobs.
