&lt;br/&gt;The Mesoamerican corridor has a series of mountain ranges that have
rarely been explored by biologists. Mountain ecosystems are threatened by global
warming, which can elevate climate zones and cause extinction by literally
driving species off the top of the mountain. The lack of exploration of
Mesoamerican mountains has left a glaring hole in our understanding of the
planet's biodiversity and what we might lose in response to global warming.
Insects make up the bulk of biodiversity and form the fine-scale fabric of
ecosystems, yet among the larger forms of life they are the least known. This
project will sample insect diversity on mountains from Nicaragua to southern
Mexico. Collaborative teams of students from U.S. and host country institutions
will carry out a sampling program in the field, followed by laboratory work to
describe the new species and analyze the quantitative data on species richness
and distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will (1) add to our store of
species knowledge, which directly benefits humans through agricultural and
natural products applications, (2) reveal species that might be in danger of
loss through climate change, (3) provide quantitative base-line data on
diversity, allowing future assessment of response to climate change, and (4)
allow evaluation of fundamental ecological theories of species abundance and
distribution. The reliance on multinational teams of undergraduate and graduate
students will stimulate training in the sciences and foster greater scientific
exchange among U.S. and Latin American scientific communities. &lt;br/&gt;
