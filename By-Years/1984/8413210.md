In spite of the wide application of fluidization techniques in many industrial
processes, the design and scale-up of a commercial size fluidized bed reactor is
still based on past experience and information obtained from building a sequence
of prototype reactors. This procedure is not only costly and time-consuming but
has led to overdesigning and delaying of the development of many processes. One
of the many problems encountered is the stability of operation. It is in this
area that analytical and experimental research will be performed focusing on
stabilization against bubbles, electromechanical coupling, and wave propagation
and reflection in fluidized beds of dielectric or magnetic particles using
electric or magnetic fields.
