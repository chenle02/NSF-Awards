This award supports participation in two three-day conferences in the area of
Discrete Geometry and Algebraic Combinatorics, held May 4-6, 2016 and in May
2017 in South Padre Island, TX. The conferences, eighth and ninth in a series,
are devoted to a wide range of classical and modern problems in these active
areas of mathematical research. The conferences bring together students and
researchers in the region centered on the University of Texas - Rio Grande
Valley. Due to the diverse composition of the student body, conference
organizers expect to be able to attract a sizable fraction of attendees from
among groups traditionally underrepresented in U.S. mathematics studies. The
grant provides travel support for graduate students and early-career
researchers, as well as non-local participants without other sources of support.

The two events represent the continuation of a successful series of conferences,
the last of which was held in April 2015. The conference topics include:
polytopes; packings, coverings, and tilings; rigidity and flexibility; geometric
graph theory; topological combinatorics; incidence structures; lattices and
discrete groups; geometric set partitioning and transversals; optimal
configurations; spherical and Euclidean designs; distance sets; semidefinite
programming in coding theory and discrete geometry; and strongly regular graphs.
The conferences include an introduction of the research area through problems
related to the topical areas and presentations of recent results by the leading
experts in the field. More information is available at the conference web site:
