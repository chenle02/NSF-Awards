Several technologies have been developed to remediate or enhance the natural
remediation of soil and groundwater. Yet, any remediation technology should
consider the complex interactions among several mechanisms involved in
remediation such as airflow, contaminant flow, seepage, microbial activities,
environmental side effects, and cost. It is important to note that most of these
existing methods are destructive, costly, or have environmental side effects.
For example, using direct and alternating electric currents (DC/AC) need
destructive and costly electrode installation. In addition, the soil's electric
resistivity increases over time in response to DC/AC, leading to electrode
corrosion, efficiency loss, undesirable heating with temperatures over 100oC,
and, in the case of DC usage, pH alteration, all of which can compromise the
health of soil microbial communities responsible for bioremediation. This team
has developed an alternative that leverages electromagnetic (EM) waves to
remotely remediate or remove contaminants.

The proposed technology can help industrial fields that deal with multiphase
flow, e.g., soil/groundwater remediation, hydrogeology, geophysics, oil
recovery, and even earthquake engineering. The technology can benefit owners of
contaminated sites ? from private land owners to state / federal agencies and
regulatory bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency. Development of
such nondestructive, environmentally safe, versatile, and cost effective
remediation technology can have various societal impacts such as human-health
improvement, economic benefits, and environmental restoration. This technology
can be very cost-effective and nondestructive due to its versatility, because EM
waves can be launched using phased-array antennae from above ground; EM
radiation patterns can be tailored to contain or move contaminants to extraction
wells, enhance airflow and enhance the oxygen delivery to aerobic microbes
responsible for bioremediation, and improve contaminants? desorption from the
soil matrix.
