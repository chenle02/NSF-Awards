This is a study of the intellectual and social structure of three sciences:
sociology, economics, and political science. It will analyze membership
statistics and similar data from the professional organizations of these fields.
First, this study will chart the structures of these disciplines, using social
network analysis, multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis. Then it will
compare structures across disciplines. Finally, it will attempt to explain the
patterns in terms of the factors that generate and reproduce them. This study
will help social scientists in the three disciplines understand the intellectual
structures of their own fields. The data will be a valuable resource for
educators, guiding college curriculum design and providing a useful framework
for long-range planning in academic institutions. The study will also contribute
insights for the sociology of science, through the conceptual maps it generates
of sociology, economics, and political science.
