The purpose of the work is to develop thermogravimetric- fourier transform
infrared analysis (TG-FTIR) as a thermal maturation indicator suitable for
examining recent hydrothermal sedimentary and metal sulfide deposits and their
relation to ancient metal ore deposits. Recent hydrothermal vent samples whose
maximum geothermal exposure is thought to be farily well constrained will be
analyzed by TG-FTIR. The rates of laboratory thermal evolution of various gases,
including CO2, CO, SO2, COS, ammonia, methane, ethylene paraffins (all obtained
in a single 90 minute analysis) will be compared to other indicators of thermal
maturity and metamorphism. Data are also automatically obtained during the same
analyses for quantitative determination of various forms of C, S. O, and N in
minerals associated with vent deposits. The method will then be applied to some
ancient metal ore deposits proposed to have a hydrothermal origin. A natural
outgrowth of the proposed work will be evaluation of TG-FTIR as a tool for metal
ore exploration.
