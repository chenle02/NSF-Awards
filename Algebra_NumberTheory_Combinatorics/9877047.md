The investigator studies the topology and combinatorics of simplicial complexes.
This includes work on the spectra of discrete Laplace operators analogous to
Laplace operators on Riemannian manifolds, questions relating the topology of
the complexes to commutative algebra, and the topology of certain partially
ordered sets of subdivisions of convex polytopes.

The investigator studies mathematical objects called simplicial complexes.
These objects arise when one wants to take everyday objects or shapes, such as
automobile parts or biological molecules, and represent them in a computer. Many
important problems revolve around understanding or tailoring the shape of such
objects, and the simplicial complexes give a concrete way to do this. Part of
the investigator's work may be thought of as placing constraints on the shapes
of these objects, if we know how many pieces are used to build them.
