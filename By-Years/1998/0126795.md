The goal of this EPSCoR Centers Development Initiative (CDI) project is to
increase the participation and competitiveness of EPSCoR researchers in multi-
investigator Centers grant programs funded by the National Science Foundation.
This project will provide direct consultation and assistance to the EPSCoR
community using the following two complementary strategies:&lt;br/&gt;Centers
Initiation: enhance proposals being developed by EPSCoR
institutions/jurisdictions for submission to major NSF Center
programs.&lt;br/&gt;Centers Infusion: match research groups in EPSCoR
institutions/jurisdictions with NSF funded Centers and link and support
partnerships with funded NSF Centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds
on the success of a previous pilot project that provided direct consultation and
assistance to researchers with promising EPSCoR Initiation Centers projects.
This project expands the successful Initiation approach and adds the second
approach of Centers Infusion to increase collaboration between EPSCoR
jurisdictions and Centers in EPSCoR and non-EPSCoR jurisdictions. The Centers
Initiation and Infusion strategies stimulate competitive, collaborative large-
scale research through the following activities: opportunities identification,
consultation and assistance, outreach, partnerships, project development and
dissemination. This project is a joint undertaking of the University of South
Dakota, the EPSCoR Foundation and the EPSCoR &lt;br/&gt;
