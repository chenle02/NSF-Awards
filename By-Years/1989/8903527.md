This is an interdisciplinary research effort involving faculty from Department
of Chemical Engineering, Materials Science, Physics and Chemistry. The research
focuses on the fundamental science of nucleation and growth mechanisms of
diamond (and related diamond-like) materials produced via simple chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) techniques. Growth of diamond films via CVD is one of the most
significant new materials technologies to emerge in recent decades. The
potential economic impact of diamond film technology is very great. The basic
research of this MRG includes (1) experimental studies of diamond nucleation and
growth processes, (2) fundamental physical and transport property measurements
on diamond-like materials, and (3) theoretical studies of structure of diamond
surfaces, diamond nuclei, diamond-like materials and dynamics of nucleation and
growth processes.
