Professor Farrar is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation studies to
determine bond distances, chemical shift tensors, and quadrupole coupling
tensors of molecules in solution. The molecular structure and dynamics of
molecular systems with three-fold axis symmetry or higher will be studied as a
function of pH, solvent, concentration, and temperature. These experimental
results will be compared with ab initio calculations of chemical shift tensors
and electric field gradient tensors at the nuclei. X-ray and neutron diffraction
experiments as well as solid state NMR experiments will complement the solution
studies. %%% Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of molecules in solution will
allow the determination of properties such as bond lengths, and the tensor
quantities which are related to the electron distribution in the immediate
vicinity of the nucleus. The comparison of these properties with solid state and
theoretical calculations will provide a measure of the effects of intermolecular
interactions on these properties in solution.
