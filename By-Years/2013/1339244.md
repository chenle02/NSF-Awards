The Museum of Science in Boston will investigate different museum exhibit design
strategies for building computational thinking capacity among diverse middle and
high school learners. The goal of this project is to identify how novice
learners can be supported to make sense of and interact with computational
thinking tools, problem solving strategies, and technical solutions. Exhibits
designed in this project will support visitors to engage with the steps of
algorithmic problem solving and to evaluate the efficiency and correctness of
algorithms. Each of the exhibits involved in this project will undergo initial
design and development, including formative prototyping and evaluation to ensure
they are easily usable and meet intended educational goals. This traveling
museum exhibition has the potential not only to stimulate awareness and practice
of computational thinking skills, but also to stimulate capacity, interest, and
self-efficacy for computing and computing careers among diverse learners who may
not otherwise have exposure to computational thinking.
