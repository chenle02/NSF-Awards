The Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Alaska will acquire
several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared
use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with
the R/V ALPHA HELIX, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the
University. A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1989 is
in support of NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also
increase the capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research
and engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -A SUN work station
and other peripheral computer equipment for accessing and managing large data
sets at sea and at the shore-based laboratory, -Microcomputer and associated
equipment for increasing shared-use, sea-going computing and communications
capabilities, -X-Y Plotter for display of seafloor profiles and other data,
-Niskin bottles for collecting discrete seawater samples at various depths in
the water column, and -several precision, deep-sea reversing thermometers. The
instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the organization
to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
