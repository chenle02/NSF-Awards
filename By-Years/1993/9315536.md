9315536 Schowalter This award of $190,000 is for curriculum development in
computational science and engineering. The focus is on to develop new
computational science and engineering courses and to transform prototype
applications into instructional tools. The curriculum to be developed as a part
of this effort includes both an application- independent course and a set of
application-specific courses. The new application-independent course will
contain material that is common to the use of computational methods in science
and engineering which includes architectures of high-performance computers,
programming paradigm, and interactive visualization. For application-specific
course will include characterization of the application, numerical and symbolic
methods, and performance measurement for application code.
