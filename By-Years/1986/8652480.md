"Improving the Science Education of Prospective Alaska Native Teachers", is
part of a cross-cultural, field-based teacher preparation program for native
Alaskan students. The project will develop, test, and disseminate two laboratory
science courses, one in chemistry and one in physics that are especially
appropriate for Native Alaskan students who are prospective elementary school
teachers. For the most part, the courses will be offered at field sites and will
incorporate appropriate and locally relevant laboratory / practical activities.
A team of university science faculty, educational consultants, rural science
teachers, native students and others will develop and produce science course
prototypes that accomodate and incorporate the students' culture and
environment. The third year of the project includes final development of course
materials, evaluation, and dissemination. Despite many attempts to improve the
success in science of Native Alaskan children, a vicious cycle of low interest
and low achievement continues. This reality results in failure not only at
elementary and secondary levels of schooling but also at the university level as
well. Thus, the number of Native Alaskan students selecting science oriented
majors or careers is miniscule, and prospective Native teachers have very poor
science preparation perpetuating the problem. This project will respond to the
problem by preparing Native Alaskan elementary school teachers who have been
successful in science and who will serve as scientifically literate role models
for their students and communities.
