This research extends query language and user-interface technology to include
context-based queries for image data. A context is a domain dependent body of
knowledge which encodes the translation between, on one hand, user-level
semantics and object classes and, on the other hand, database syntax and
entities. A prototype image information system provides a testbed for the
investigation of issues in image indexing, similarity measures, and knowledge-
guided incremental querying. A set of image processing and feature extraction
routines supplies the base for image indexing; this base is augmented with a
data model that accounts for objects, their images, the image features, and
events in the world involving the objects. A knowledge-base and associated user-
interface support navigation within the data model to guide query formation and
refinement. This research will develop new concepts in data modeling, image
indexing, and user- interfaces, which will enable users to access the image data
in such applications as global monitoring and scientific imaging, based on
concepts, context, similarity, and image features.
