9529321 Cotton In this project, the principal investigator and colleagues will
examine some of the proposed mechanisms by which anthropogenic cloud
condensation nuclei (CCN) may alter the microstructure, macrostructure, and
radiative properties of marine stratocumulus clouds. The research should provide
important insights necessary for the development of improved parameterization of
aerosol/cloud microphysics/ cloud dynamics interactions that can be used in
large-scale atmospheric models. The research involves the application of a
sophisticated large eddy simulation (LES) model with explicit, bin-resolving
microphysics (EM). The approach will be to perform cloud-resolving simulations
of cases observed during the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment
(ASTEX) and to evaluate the credibility of those simulations by comparing the
simulated data with observed cloud features. The PI will also perform
sensitivity experiment in which the concentrations and vertical profiles of CCN
are varied. From these simulations, he hopes to determine if modest increases in
concentrations of CCN directly alter cloud albedo significantly, or alter cloud
coverage, or alter entrainment in the cloud boundary layer, or whether the
marine boundary layer may be bistable with respect to the production rates of
CCN. This project is being supported as a contribution to NSF's Role of Clouds,
Energy, and Water in Global Climate Change (ROCEW) Program. ***
