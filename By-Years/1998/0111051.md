The Analytical and Surface Chemistry program supports the project by Professor
Mark Lonergan of the University of Oregon on fundamental studies with current-
sensing atomic force microscopy of nanostructured semiconductor/polymer
interfaces. Well-defined nanostructures will be fabricated using e-beam
lithography to imbed an array of gold metal dots into an n-InP | polypyrrole
interface. Electron transfer barrier heights and transmission coefficients will
be measured in and around the nanostructures with probe microscopy. The goals of
this work include: (1) to understand charge depletion and charge transport at
laterally nanostructured interfaces, (2) to evaluate the efficacy of barrier
inhomogeneity models in explaining classic anomalies, and (3) to develop
current-sensing atomic force microscopy as a characterization tool for buried
semiconductor interfaces.

The project addresses a long-standing problem in the understanding of metal-
semiconductor contacts, namely, the failure of models to adequately describe
electron transfer, a key feature of an electronic device, semiconductor
electrochemistry, and semiconductor/metal contacts. Model failure may be due to
surface heterogeneity. Experiments are proposed to create well-defined
nanostructures at a semiconductor interface, and then to measure the electron
transfer rate and its temperature dependence across the nanostructure. The
results will be used to assess and correct models of the semiconductor
interface, accounting for nanoscopic features at the interface.
