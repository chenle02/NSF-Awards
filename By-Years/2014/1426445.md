This Rapid Response Grant (RAPID) project is to collect perishable damage, wave,
storm surge, debris, and wind data from Super Typhoon Haiyan that made landfall
in Philippines. Super Typhoon Haiyan may have been the strongest land falling
tropical cyclone in recorded history. The data on wave, surge, and debris are
characteristics of the storm and not highly dependent on the structures. Wind
damage in the town of Tacloban and island of Samar sustained catastrophic wind
and wave/surge damage. The Principal investigator will work in conjunction with
representatives of Japan and Philippines Engineering Societies in collection of
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because Super Typhoon Haiyan was (probably) the
strongest recorded land falling storm in history, it represents one end of the
envelope for design purposes. For this reason, ascertaining both the hazard and
damage levels will give a good estimate of the types and quantities of damage,
and failure mechanisms that might occur in the United States. Very strong low
frequency wave/surge motions were noted during this storm with resulting
catastrophic damage. Since these loadings do not exist in present standards, an
improved understanding of the generation mechanisms, hazard levels, and
structural damage will help to improve predictions of loading climate, and can
be used to validate damage models. Documentation of damage of commercial
buildings may permit assessment of wind speed intensity through reverse
engineering.
