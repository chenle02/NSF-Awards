To provide students in a required junior level genetics course with a more
meaningful exposure to genetic analysis and techniques modern molecular
technology was introduced in the laboratory component of this course.
Micropipettors, microcentrifuges, power supplies, agarose gel apparatuses,
superspeed centrifuges and computers capable of sophisticated data analysis
acquired through the award, are used to introduce students to the use of enzymes
in molecular biology and the creation of recombinant DNA molecules; to agarose
gel electrophoresis as an analytical tool; and to the power of the computer
analysis of both classical and molecular genetic data. The skills acquired by
the students in general genetics laboratory are utilized again in a senior level
cell biology course.
