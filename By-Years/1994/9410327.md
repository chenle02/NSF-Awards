Marschall This project examines the spatial and temporal structure of nectar
distribution in flowers in the field. Spatial structure of resource distribution
has usually been ignored in models of pollinator foraging behavior and decision
making. In this study the PI's measure the spatial organization of resource
variability, and how the pattern changes with time of day. These data will be
incorporated into a series of foraging models. This research has potential broad
applicability to insect foraging behavior and behavioral ecology. The results
may help us better understand how decision-making rules that deal with complex
situations are developed in honey bees, bumble bees, and other insects, and
generally improve our understanding of animal cognitive psychology.
