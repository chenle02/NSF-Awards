The problem of feedback control in the framework of linear systems has been
extensively investigated over the years. Although the theories developed settled
a number of important issues, they generally failed to address the problem of
the complexity (i.e., MacMillan degree) of the resulting controllers. The aim of
this research is to investigate problems related to low complexity controllers,
using the partial realization approach. In particular, the work will encompass
aspects of the partial realization problem as applied to the H-infinity
optimization problem and the problem of pole placement by dynamic output
feedback. The motivation for the work is that in the first problem, no provision
for controller complexity exists in the current theories and in the second
problem, the existing results are only partial. The significance of the proposed
research lies in the fact that the complexity of the controller is an important
design parameter in feedback control. Consequently, the design methods should
give the engineer the freedom of choosing it so as to meet design
specifications.
