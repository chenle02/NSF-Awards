The University of Montana is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000
bits per second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level network. The connection
enhances collaborations of campus researchers with colleagues in several fields
such as biology, physics, computer science, geology and forestry, and enables
on-line access to remote bibliography databases and supercomputers. This award
funds part of the costs for one year.
