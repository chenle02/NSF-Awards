The University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology will work
over three years to design, develop and fabricate "Survivor, the Place of Humans
in the Natural World," a 3,000 sq. ft. traveling exhibition for audiences ages
nine and older which explores the process and consequences of human evolution in
the context of its implications for our daily lives. Using hands-on interactive
devices, flexible exhibit designs with multimedia capabilities, and interactive
"Web-chats" with an open community of scholars, UPM will engage visitors with
the discovery of the place of humans on the planet Earth. The exhibition, along
with ancillary educational materials and programs, is scheduled to open in 2006,
then subsequently travel for three years to nine widely distributed
institutions, ultimately serving a national audience of several million viewers.
