This project is concerned with problems in cohomology and the representation
theory of finite groups. The principal investigator will study Mackey functors,
with particular applications to modular representation theory of finite groups
and topology; perfect isometries of blocks and derived equivalences; and group
actions on complexes. The cohomology of groups, with emphasis on compact Lie
groups and groups of finite virtual cohomological dimension, will also be
examined. The research supported concerns the representation of finite groups.
The structure of the groups is realized through the action of the groups as
transformations on spaces. This is currently a very active area of pure algebra.
