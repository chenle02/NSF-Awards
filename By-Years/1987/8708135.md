Granites are found at shallow to deep levels of exposure throughout the Earth's
crust whereas migmatites are found usually at middle to deep levels. It has been
postulated that migmatites are the site of granite melt generation and that
subsequent magma separation from host rocks and buoyant ascent results in the
familiar cross-cutting plutons of shallow crustal levels. It is proposed to test
alternative models for the origin of migmatites and granites. Preliminary work
suggests there is a spatial transition from migmatites to granites in southern
Connecticut and that both rock types are contemporaneous. Integrated studies of
field, structural, petrological, and geochemical characteristics will be
conducted to determine 1) the relative age of rock units; 2) the thermal history
of the region; and 3) the degree of chemical consanguinity of spatially related
rock types. Techniques to be used include electron microprobe and inductively
coupled plasma analysis. The relative importance of tectonic thickening vs.
magmatic advection in heating the region will be determined. The role of crustal
reworking in granite formation will be assessed.
