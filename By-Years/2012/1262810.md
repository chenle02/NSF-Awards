This award funds the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
site at the University of Toledo. The site will support ten students/year
selected from across the US in the ten week summer research program. The
department provides a great diversity of cutting-edge research opportunities
(both experimental and theoretical) for undergraduate students in: Astrophysics;
Atomic/Molecular/Optical Physics; Biological/Health/Medical Physics; and
Condensed Matter/Materials Science Physics (with specialization in thin films
and photovoltaics). Opportunities exist for some of the research projects to be
conducted with their faculty mentors at national facilities (NREL, DCT, NTF, or
similar). The research projects are chosen such that the student projects will
lead to eventual publication in the appropriate professional research journals.
REU students have coauthored over 50 refereed publications (16 in the past five
years alone). The REU students are also encouraged to present their research at
professional meetings. The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in
partnership with the NSF REU program.
