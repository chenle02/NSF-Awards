In the United States the university evolved from a teaching to a research
institution in the late nineteenth century, and into a teaching, research and
economic development enterprise in the late twentieth century. Acute controversy
accompanied and continues to accompany these transitions. This study examines
issues of conflict of interest and conflict of commitment arising from academic-
industry relations. There are two models which describe the approaches
universities use to resolve or regulate these conflicts: separating academic and
business activities, or integrating research and business activities under the
rubric of a broader institutional mission. The degree to which one or the other
model dominates indicates the degree to which an academic institution has
assimilated and legitimated economic development as part of its mission. With
partial support from this research award, this investigator will complete case
study research at six U.S. universities. The cases provide detailed information
about the range of institutional responses to these controversies, in historical
and sociological context. The research will identify and elucidate the origins
of the controversies, and the different positions and resolutions that
institutions assume and arrive at. It will assess the implications of these new
policies and developments for issues of industrial and academic policy,
nationally and internationally, and for regional development. Results of the
study will be published in articles and a book which will interest universities,
companies and government officials and agencies concerned with the changing
mission of the university to assist economic and social development.
