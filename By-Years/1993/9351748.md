9351748 Miller A petrographic microscope with a CCD camera and video display,
and computerized image analysis capability, is being integrated into the
research-based, field-oriented curriculum for geology majors. The microscope is
being used by students throughout upper level courses in the major, and a
revised curriculum culminates in senior research projects that integrate
microscope use. The students are being trained to use the microscope in Optical
Mineralogy, where it is first being used as a demonstration tool. By the end of
this course, students are competent in hands-on use of the microscope. As they
become proficient with petrographic techniques, students are continuing to use
the microscope in other upper level courses, including petrography classes.
Seniors are designing petrographic research problems during their winter field
course, and collecting appropriate sample suites in the field. Upon their return
to campus, they are gathering data to answer the problems they are posing in the
field. The results are being included in their Senior Research Reports, oral
presentations to the department, and talks at professional meetings.
