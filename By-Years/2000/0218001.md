The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a
site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance and
environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying watershed
ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. The objective for
the proposed 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific understanding of the
spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of land use and land-use
change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the last 200 years, and
forecast patterns into the future 30 years. This will be accomplished by
addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of land-use change while
continuing long-term studies of environmental gradients and natural disturbance
regimes. The result will be a more complete understanding of ecological dynamics
in the southern Appalachian Mountains that makes possible the development of
reasonable forecasts of its future ecological state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity,
and extent of land use represents human decision-making in response to
socioeconomic and biogeophysical conditions with consequences that cascade
through ecosystems. The research activities are organized into three
initiatives: (1) characterization of the "socio-natural template," (2) ecosystem
responses to the socio-natural template, and (3) forecasting ecosystem responses
to changes in the socio-natural template. The integrated scientific research
will provide both a description as well as an explanation of the underlying
causes of land use and the consequences of land-use change for southern
Appalachian ecosystems and society. It thus recognizes the complexity of land
use as a process and the research and outreach needs as defined in the LTER
Program and the broader scientific and public communities. &lt;br/&gt;
