This research is an experimental and modeling study of two and three-phase
turbulent flows in branching pipelines. Local phase concentrations and
interfacial areas per unit volume will be measured as well as the overall split
of phases for various branching geometries and flow regimes. Modeling will
employ a tau-epsilon approach and population dynamics for coalescening and
breaking drops to relate the interfacial area to hydrodynamic conditions. The
research might improve our capability to model multiphase flows such as occur in
liquid-liquid or liquid-gas chemical processing, thermal hydraulics such as
occur in nuclear reactor applications, and flow phenomena associated with
accidental release of two-phase fluids.
