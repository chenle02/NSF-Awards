This Research Initiation Award will support Dr. Chelberg's application of sensor
modeling, Bayesian inference, utility theory, and real-time planning to problems
of recognizing objects in range imagery. This approach to active computer vision
is particularly appropriate for manufacturing, where object models can be
derived automatically from design-database information. Possible applications
include sensor selection (or design), part recognition, orientation
determination, and bin picking.
