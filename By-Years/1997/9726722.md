This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research in
atom optics. The project involves the collaboration between Mara Prentiss and
her group at Harvard University and William Phillips' group at NIST-
Gaithersburg, and Alain Aspect's Atom Optics Group at the Institute for
Theoretical and Applied Optics in Orsay, France. Atom optics manipulate atoms in
a manner analogous to that in which conventional optics manipulate photons. The
investigators propose projects in atom optical device development and in atom
lithography. The US groups bring expertise in atom lithography and in the
development of atom optical devices. This is complemented by the Orsay group's
theoretical and experimental expertise in testing the quality of atomic optics.
In addition, the Harvard-NIST group will have access to a cold, intense source
of metastable Helium, which is available in Orsay.
