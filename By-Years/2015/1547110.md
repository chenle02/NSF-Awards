Abstract - Hedengren, 1547110&lt;br/&gt;Current process control and optimization
strategies are typically divided into three major sections: base layer controls,
advanced controls, and planning and scheduling. Each of these levels works at a
different time scale, ranging from milliseconds to seconds for base controls, up
to months or years at the planning and scheduling level. To simplify models and
decrease computation time, each of these layers receives a minimal amount of
information to fulfill its objective. This lack of information creates lost
opportunities. For example, the scheduling program may pass a set of unreachable
set points to the advanced controls, or the base controls could reach a set
point through a suboptimal path due to its lack of knowledge regarding process
nonlinearities that the advanced controls had
incorporated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this EAGER project is to
develop a unified architecture for control and planning/scheduling applications.
This is now possible because of large cloud computing infrastructure, mobile
devices with wireless communication, smart sensors that build an internet of
interacting devices, and recent break-through algorithms in solver and
algorithmic performance. The project is about consolidation of disparate
algorithms and research areas into a unifying architecture for scheduling and
control through the development of a computational and visualization tool or
APP. Although tested on local and limited multi-core resources, the project
framework is proposed for a new paradigm of computing including cloud-based
resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will participate on the
project for course credit. Students from underrepresented groups will be
recruited directly and by connecting to an existing college program that targets
such students (WE @ BYU). From an educational standpoint, students will (i) gain
experience in the design and implementation process for utilization of renewable
resources (ii) demonstrate an appreciation for working within engineering
constraints to develop a sustainable process, (iii) demonstrate effective
teamwork and leadership skills as they work together on teams, and (iv)
recognize the extent to which renewable resources can be applied to multiple
process platforms.
