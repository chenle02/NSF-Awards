Long-term (27-year) data sets on patterns of primary and secondary productivity
and nutrient cycling dynamics for Castle Lake and Lake Tahoe, California, will
be analyzed to determine the relative importance of biotic recycling of
nutrients and the supply of "new" nutrients in controlling lake productivity. In
addition, a limited set of measurements at the two lakes will be made to
continue the long-term data sets. The major product of this new research will be
a conceptual model of factors that control primary and secondary production in
the two California lakes. This model will be useful for designing further
scientific research. As important, the model will be useful for developing
future management strategies for large lake systems that are located in
watersheds undergoing land use changes such as resort development. Dr. Goldman
and his colleagues have long records of doing high quality science and using
this science to help solve societal problems. The institutional support for the
research is excellent. The Ecosystem Studies Program recommends award of this
grant.
