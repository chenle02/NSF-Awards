How organisms adapt to changing environments is a question that pervades all
biological disciplines and is especially relevant given the pace of global
climate change. Hormone concentrations are highly sensitive to environmental
variation. In mammalian species, early exposure to hormones can have profound
implications on offspring physiology, growth rates, and behavior. The goal of
this project is to examine how the hormonal responses of wild red squirrels to
environmental variation can adaptively modify offspring due to variable hormone
exposure before birth. Red squirrels are an ideal study system to determine the
importance of the endocrine system in adapting to changing environments because
the survival and future reproduction of offspring can be
monitored.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will integrate ecology, physiology,
and evolution to understand the mechanisms by which animals can adapt to
changing environments. Broader impacts include furthering our understanding
about how organisms living at northern latitudes can respond to global climate
change, training undergraduate students in field data collection as well as
allowing them to participate in their own independent research projects, and
continuing outreach activities with local aboriginal and underrepresented groups
in the Yukon, Canada.
