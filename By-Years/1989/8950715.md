An advanced light microscope with phase contrast optics and darkfield
illumination and a photomicrographic system will be used in three laboratory
courses. It will be used to study cytoplasmic organelles in living and fresh-
stained cells and tissues, which is an integral part of the laboratory work
carried out by students enrolled in such courses as Histology, Invertebrate
Zoology, and Plant Kingdom. In addition, the faculty will be able to produce
quality photomicrographs for use as instructional aids in other courses. The
college will provide 50% matching funds.
