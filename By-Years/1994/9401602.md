9401602 Yasbin This award supported is requested for the 38th annual meeting of
the Wind River conference on Procaryotic Genetics, to be held at the Wind River
Ranch, Estes Park, Colorado, June 4-8, 1994. This conference is primarily
concerned with the biology of genetic exchange systems and the genetics of a
variety of procaryotic and eukaryotic systems, and is the major annually
occurring meeting devoted to this subject area. One significant feature of these
meetings is their accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral students,
whose travel funds frequently are limited. Specifically to address this problem,
funds are provided for travel and support scholarships to facilitate the
attendance of graduate students and post-doctoral students working in various
areas that comprise prokaryotic genetics. %%% This is the major meeting where
the genetics of variety of bacteria are discussed. ***
