0244436 Vallas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a three-year Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Virginia (UVA) to
provide opportunities for ten students each year to engage in research in the
area of nanoscale materials design. The REU site is designed as a ten-week
summer experience. Student participants will develop basic scientific research
skills, examine important research questions in the area of nanoscale surface
patterning, and consider challenging political and ethical issues associated
with scientific research. The program will provide students an opportunity to be
involved with nanoscience research projects associated with the National Science
Foundation Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) established
in 2001. This REU site aims to encourage students to pursue advanced degrees and
to consider careers in nanotechnology. Students will be recruited nationally,
with a special focus on attracting students from nearby institutions such as
Hampton University, Longwood University, and community colleges within Virginia.
This REU Site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the
NSF REU Program.&lt;br/&gt;
