This project is funded by a Presidential Young Investigator award, and will
focus on the development of manufacturable low temperature chemical vapor
deposition processes for the growth of device quality metals and compound
semiconductors for use in advanced microelectronics devices and circuitry.
Matching funds from industry, when secured by the principal investigator. will
be used to enhance the research efforts by direct project support and through
in-depth interactions between university and industrial researchers. The overall
project effort is expected to contribute to the scientific and technology base
for improved performance and reduced cost of components for telecommunications,
computing and information processing.
