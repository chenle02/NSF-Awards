The proposed research deals with the problem of model reduction procedures that
preserve structure. In dealing with this problem time-scale separation
techniques are to be explored that produce accurate stability relations to the
full scale model. The research should lead to fast computational techniques for
the slow modes and methods for direct inter-area stability computations using
the slow system energy.
