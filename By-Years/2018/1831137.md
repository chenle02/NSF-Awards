The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a significant reduction in the cost and time
to remove hazardous contaminants from the soils and groundwater impacting
communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Properties observed from thousands of
contaminated sites serve as inputs to a computerized mathematical model of the
site, forecasting the most likely shape and depth of a contaminant plume. This
machine learning model gives remediation planners access to a fast delineation
of volume to be remediated as well as the uncertainty of the modeled estimate.
This saves time and money searching for these contaminants that are deep
underground and in groundwater. This Phase II project will expand on the Phase I
prototype, creating an operational product capable of reaching the needs of
environmental engineers and scientists around the globe, providing the stimulus
to cut remediation time and cost in half.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
