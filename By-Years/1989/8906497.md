The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the research of Dr. Keith S. Kyler
of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Miami. This research will
lead to the harnessing of biochemical reactions as new tools in the synthesis of
complex molecules by mild and possibly nonpolluting processes. It has
considerable potential to produce the new chemicals needed in modern agriculture
and medicine. The development of new enzymatic methods for the preparative-scale
asymmetric synthesis will be undertaken for biologically important organic
compounds. New applications of an enzymatic method for the synthesis of steroids
will be undertaken using the sterol cyclase from microbial sources, and
demonstrate the use of this enzymic method for preparing valuable lanosterol,
cholesterol, and cycloartenol steroids. Additionally, new enzymatic technologies
will be developed for: (1) the chiral oxidation of pentadienyl glutarates using
soybean lipoxygenase as a method for the asymmetric hydroxylation of unsaturated
alcohols; and (2) the enzymatic reduction of imino esters using dehydrogenases
as a new approach to asymmetric syntheses of alkaloids. Lastly, a study will be
made into the use of synthetic peptide duplexes to function as synthetic pseudo-
enzymes (SPEs) displaying molecular recognition properties of natural enzymes.
