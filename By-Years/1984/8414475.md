This project will identify important lessons growing out of the experience the
community of Oroville, California had following a damaging earthquake. On August
1, 1975, a moderate earthquake struck Oroville causing extensive damage to the
older, unreinforced, masonry structures in the downtown area. Damage was severe
enough to warrant condemnation of some buildings. The issue of abating the
hazards arising from not only the damaged masonry buildings but also from all
buildings of this class became a local policy issue. Eventually, proposals to do
something about this problem failed. This study will focus on the policy history
of hazardous-structures abatement in Oroville and will provide data for testing
a model for identifying and explaining the key variables affecting local
decision making regarding hazardous buildings.
