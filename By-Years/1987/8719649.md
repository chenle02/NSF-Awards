This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Jacob Leventhal of
the University of Missouri at St. Louis and Dr. Maria Allegrini of the Istituto
di Fisica Atomica e Molecolare (CNR) in Pisa together with Prof. Ennio Arimondo
of the University of Pisa, Italy. The researchers' previous collaborative work
has focused on experimental studies of the properties of Rydberg atoms. The next
phase is directed towards the study of photoionization of Rydberg atoms, first
by blackbody radiation and later, after reducing the ambient temperature to
approximately 15 K, by far infrared radiation from an alcohol laser. The
importance of highly excited (Rydberg) atoms in a variety of physical phenomena
has been recognized since 1934. Recent interest in applications such as isotope
separation, thermonuclear fusion and astrophysical plasmas, coupled with the
availability of tunable lasers to produce state selected Rydberg atoms has led
to much activity in this area. The proposed work of the researchers, building on
previous successful collaboration, is designed to take advantage of experimental
techniques developed both at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and in Pisa.
The group at St. Louis has considerable experience with visible lasers and the
production of highly excited atoms, whereas the group in Pisa has extensive
experience with the long wavelength lasers necessary to study photoionization of
Rydberg atoms. Consequently, their complementary expertise should prove mutually
beneficial and help to advance our knowledge in this area.
