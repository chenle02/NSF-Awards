96-14179 Miller The PI proposes an experimental and theoretical program to
determine the equations of state of silicate liquids at high pressure to
quantitatively understand the formation of deep mantle-derived magmas. Shock
wave experiments are proposed for liquids that will lead to equations of state
for the partial molar volumes of the important silicate melt constituents SiO2,
MgO, CaO, Al2O3 and FeO. Complimentary molecular dynamics studies will be
conducted to estimate the shock temperatures, and to approximate thermodynamic
properties of the high pressure shocked melts. ***
