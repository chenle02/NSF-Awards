Funds are provided for the PIs to study the Upper Cretaceous to Lower Paleogene
and Quaternary unconformities and stratal patterns on the New York and New
Jersey margins. Two separate but fundamental questions to stratigraphy of the
margins are to be addresed: how sequence boundaries and stratigraphic
discontinuities formed during times of reduced sealevel fluctuations, and why
the Quaternary section does not have unconformities associated with each
sealevel cycle. The PIs plan to acquire side-scan sonar images, Chirp images
(for subseafloor shallow features), MCS images and vinracores from this area.
They will also use ODP site 1073 for chronology. These data will provide a high-
resolution physical stratigraphy and precise chronology leading to understanding
of eustatic vs. other factors in building sequences.&lt;br/&gt;
