The International Conference on Computational Harmonic Analysis will be held in
conjunction with the 29th Shanks Lecture Series, from May 19 to May 23, 2014, at
Vanderbilt University, in Nashville Tennessee. This conference will play a
crucial role in the development of science and technology based on computational
harmonic analysis, identifying new trends, and providing an important common
link to other science and engineering disciplines at large. It is intended to
highlight computational mathematics and its connections with interdisciplinary
research areas, and to bring researchers and graduate students together for in-
depth discussions on all aspects of computational harmonic analysis.

This award supports the participation of junior researchers and invited speakers
in the meeting. The emphasis of the conference will be on state-of-the-art
developments in topics such as compressed sensing, random matrix theory, multi-
fractals, time-frequency analysis, sampling and sensing networks, high-
dimensional data geometry, frame theory, learning theory, mathematics of
imaging, applications to signal/image processing, information technology,
natural and life sciences, and engineering.
