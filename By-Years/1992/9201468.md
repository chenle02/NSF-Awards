This research is concerned with problems in commutative algebra, algebraic
geometry and computational issues in those fields. In commutative algebra, the
principal investigator will study linear resolutions and Huneke's question on
the structure of free resolutions. In algebraic geometry, he will consider a
generalized Castelnuovo conjecture, the family of compactified Jacobians by
projective stability, degeneracy of secant and tangent varieties by methods from
differential geometry, as well as ribbons, K3 carpets and supermanifolds. The
computational parts of this project are concerned with criteria for systems of
parameters and development of the computer algebra system, Macaulay. This is
research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern
mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter-century. In its origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays, the field makes
use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields, as well as, in theoretical
computer science and robotics.
