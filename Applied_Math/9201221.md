Three distinct but loosely related research projects are planned: (a) A study
of the Lavrentiev phenomenon for isoperimetrically constrained problems and its
relationship with cavitation effects in nonlinear elasticity, (b) A study of
materials with layered microstructure and materials with negative capillarity,
and (c) Stochastic hyperbolic equations and stochastic control in nematic liquid
crystals. Each part represents a further development of the mathematical tools
developed in the investigator's previous work, as well as the introduction of
new research topics. The three projects are motivated by problems from continuum
mechanics. The objective is to understand the physics of an assortment of novel
materials and to develop mathematics which will help to explain, predict, and
control their mechanical behavior.
