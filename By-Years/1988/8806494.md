A differential scanning calorimeter with accessories is acquired. This will be
used to measure heats of reduction and of reoxidation of metal-oxide catalysts.
The initial systems to be studied will be based on vanadia or molybdena. The
data from these studies, together with spectroscopic data from other studies,
will be used to establish the energies of surface-oxygen bonds. This
information, in turn, can be used to predict surface reactivity and catalytic
behavior.
