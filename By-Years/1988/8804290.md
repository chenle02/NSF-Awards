This project will assess the type and extent of individual and family
preparedness prior to the October 1, 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the
measures which have been taken since the event to prepare for future earthquakes
and how people responded during and immediately following the earthquake. Also
examined will be the impact of the news media as a source of information,
warnings and instructions and the experiences of residents with response and
recovery organizations.
