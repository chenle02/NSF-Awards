Garcia, G. MCB 97-20139 1. Technical The biosynthesis of tRNA is a surprisingly
complicated process. One, much neglected aspect of this process is the
incorporation of modified bases. The physiological roles of modified bases are
largely unknown, however, there is evidence that they are involved in
differentiation, proliferation, and ribosomal frameshifting. A key enzyme in the
biosynthetic pathway in E. coli of the modified nucleoside queuine is tRNA-
guanine transglycosylase (TGT). Experiments designed for this study have three
specific aims, the first of which is to extend previous studies of the
recognition of tRNA by TGT. A collaboration has been established with Dr. Ralf
Ficner (University of Marburg, Germany) to determine the structure of a tRNA TGT
complex as well as structures of mutant enzymes and interesting tRNA analogues.
Concurrently, the generation and evaluation of tRNA chimeras and a biochemical
investigation of ribose phosphate backbone recognition by TGT is carried out.
The second specific aim involves a combination of analogue design/synthesis and
site-directed mutagenesis to study heterocyclic substrate recognition by TGT.
The third specific aim is to use the mutant TGTs with altered tRNA and
heterocyclic substrate recognition developed in specific aims 1 and 2 to probe
the role of the queuine modification. 2. Nontechnical The biosynthesis of tRNA
is a surprisingly complicated process. One, much neglected aspect of this
process involves the incorporation and physiological role(s) of modified bases.
This project is undertaken to advance previous studies of the key enzyme
involved in the modification of tRNA with queuine, tRNA-guanine transglycosylase
(TGT). The specific aims of the project are to elucidate how proteins recognize
nucleic acids (tRNA) and small molecules, and to understand the physiological
role of the queuine modification.
