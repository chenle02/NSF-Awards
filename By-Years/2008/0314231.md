ABSTRACT: EIA 0314231, ACM, L. Israel, PI DRAFT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
September 2003 the standard high school computer science curriculum, including
the AP exam, will shift from C++ to Java. This project, "Bridging the Gap",
provides funds to support a pilot effort with workshops and distance learning
activities for high school computer science teachers to assist and enhance their
learning of Java. This is part of ACM's Jett Project-Java Engagement for Teacher
Training and is specifically directed at the pilot efforts involving Tufts
University and Columbia University. The project includes two one-day training
workshops and incorporates a distance-learning course including video-taped
lectures, on-line exercises, on-line help via email and a resource web site for
teachers where they can interact with a community of other teachers and share
course and learning materials.&lt;br/&gt;
