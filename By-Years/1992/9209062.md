The award will support "The Second International Conference on Bioinformatics,
Supercomputing and Complex Genome Analysis", to be held in St. Petersburg Beach,
Florida, from June 4-7, 1992. The aim of this conference is to proved a forum in
which experts from both the academic and industrial sectors, including new
researchers and students, can gather to interact. This will afford them an
opportunity to gain first hand knowledge of the scope, direction, and future
prospects of informatics and computing in complex genome analysis. The
interdisciplinary nature of the conference is designed to foster an exchange of
ideas and information among disciplines and to lead to a transfer of
technologies, especially from the academic sector to industry. The focus of the
conference will be on the computational and experimental aspects of complex
biological molecular analysis. The subject areas cover databases and languages,
computer techniques for analysis of data (e.g. neural-net, pattern recognition),
computer modeling and graphics visualization, and experimental approaches such
as mapping and cloning.
