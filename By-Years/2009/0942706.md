Engineering-Mechanical (56) This project develops learning materials and
strategies that help engineering undergraduate students learn an "expert
approach" in simulation. The project formalizes an expert approach for two
simulation technologies: finite-element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid
dynamics (CFD). The expert approach will be integrated into simulation exercises
in three Mechanical Engineering courses at Cornell University, using the
industry-standard software packages of ANSYS for FEA and FLUENT for CFD. The
simulations follow a case study approach by applying the selected software to
solve canonical problems in order to make explicit connections between
fundamental concepts and the hands-on visual environment in the software. This
enables a modular approach where individual modules can be inserted into courses
as deemed appropriate by the instructor. In addition, the project includes
developing tutorials and learning modules that will be available for free on the
SimCafe wiki for other instructors to use or to customize.
