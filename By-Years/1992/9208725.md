A conference entitled "Symposium on Interactions of the Auditory and Mauthner
Cell Systems" held in Montreal, Canada in August, l992 is sponsored in
conjunction with the annual meeting of the International Society of
Neuroethology. This conference brings together, for the first time, an
internationally recognized group of neuroscientists who work on the neurobiology
of Mauthner neurons which trigger the acoustic escape reflex in fish and experts
on the auditory system. The conference enhances understanding of how these two
major systems interact and control sensorimotor coordination by the brainstem.
Proceedings of the conference will be published as a special issue of the major
scientific journal, BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION.
