Each participant in the symposium on patterns of speciation and biogeography of
the Hawaiian biota will apply phylogenetic methods to their data, generating
hypotheses of relationships and biogeography. Using a consistent methodology
will allow patterns of radiation for the different groups to be directly
contrasted. Detected patterns can be used to explore adaptive radiation and
ecology of that group. A broad spectrum of organisms (insects, spiders, birds,
dicot flowering plants) will be used to test ideas of island speciation and
biogeography. These will be the first detailed biogeographical analyses for
Hawaiian organisms (other than the well known Hawaiian Drosophila). Finally,
this effort represents the first attempt to test the idea that independent
lineages of Hawaiian organisms exhibit similar patters of colonization and
differentiation directly related to the unique geological of this archipelago.
