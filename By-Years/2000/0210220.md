ABSTRACT

Proposal No. CTS-0210220 Title NER: Biotemplate Directed Assembly of Nanocrystal
Arrays Principal Investigator: Yu, Michael, Johns Hopkins U

The assembly of well defined 2D nanocrystal arrays of semiconducting and
metallic materials using biologically assembled nanoscale template is the major
goal in the proposed project. The PI will explore the purple membrane, a
naturally occurring membrane protein crystal patch from halobacteria as a
precisely structured nanoscale template. The key is to develop genetically
engineered purple membranes that display unique functional groups on the
membrane surfaces with well defined nanoscale symmetry. These reactive
functional groups are used as specific anchoring sites for nanocrystals
immobilization.
