This is a Renewal Award with reference to work that was conducted under NSF
Grant No. 88-13714. In research conducted under that award, the investigators
performed supercritical extraction of model synthetic mixtures of organic
pollutants in water solutions and concluded that a process based upon this
concept is feasible for removal of contaminants from water solution. The
objective of work under this Renewal Award is to obtain a better understanding
than now exists of the properties of the process such as its thermodynamic
characteristics and rate at which it functions as a steps toward evaluating its
engineering relevance and significance. Knowledge obtained in this research will
then be applied to improvement of models that may be used in engineering design
of the process and systems utilizing it. The supercritical extraction process
being studied in this research is potentially especially applicable to treatment
of wastewaters that are contaminated with substances that are resistant to
biological degradation. Results of this research are expected to be applied to
the engineering design of processes and systems based on use of supercritical
extraction for decontamination of aqueous wastes.
