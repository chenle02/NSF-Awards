This is a 12 month Research Planning Grant award under the Research Planning
Grants and Career Advancement Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers Program.
The goal of this planning grant is to perform preliminary investigations and
experiments into the integration of multiple autonomous agents in solving
resource-constrained project scheduling problems, with the aim of developing a
competitive NSF proposal. The core problem is how to effectively build a
schedule for a project comprising a number of activities that are linked by
precedence relations and multiple resource restrictions. When cash flows exist
in the form of initiation expenses and progress payments, the development of
schedules that maximize the net present value of the project is of considerable
practical importance. This research explores the potential for integrating a
probabilistic combination model and a meta-heuristic search control strategy in
solving the practical problem of project scheduling with cash flows. It also
investigates the potential for researching how multiple intelligent agents
interact in a decision support environment for combinatorially difficult
problems.
