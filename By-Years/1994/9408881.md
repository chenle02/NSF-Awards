9408881 Taylor Efficient computational algorithms will be developed to compute
device characteristics of layered heterostructure devices (GaAs, GaAlAs) for
resonance tunneling diodes, quantum dots, etc. The scattering algorithms will be
adapted from computational chemistry ton nano-device applications including the
effects of external magnetic fields. The PI will collaborate with the National
Center for Computational Electronics at University of Illinois to obtain the
materials parameters as well as the important physics to be resolve in the
computational experiments. *** v s t racteristics of layered heterostructu $ $ (
