This MRI award is for the development of a state-of-the-art high-field, low-
temperature (HBLT) magnet that provides a high magnetic field at low
temperature. This magnet infrastructure will allow a number of important of
fundamental measurements of unprecedented accuracy:&lt;br/&gt;1. the magnetic
moment of the electron (often called its g value)&lt;br/&gt;2. the fine
structure constant alpha&lt;br/&gt;3. the ratio of positron and electron g
values, the best test of CPT invariance with baryons&lt;br/&gt;4. the ratio of
proton and electron masses&lt;br/&gt;5. the magnetic moment of the
antiproton&lt;br/&gt;These measurements test the most basic and fundamental laws
of physics at the deepest level. The large number of fundamental measurements,
the incredible accuracy, the elegance of the one particle techniques, and the
technological spinoffs, compensate for the difficulty and time consuming nature
of the experiments. Scores of undergraduates and dozens of graduate students
have been involved in using similar research infrastructure in the past and this
will continue. Experiments will be carried out as part of the advanced training
of many graduate students and postdocs, and many participating undergraduates
will get hands on experience with cutting edge science. &lt;br/&gt;
