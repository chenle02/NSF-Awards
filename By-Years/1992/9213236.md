This grant will fund research through the Small Grants for Exploratory Research
program to investigate the physical conditions in an earthquake hypocentral zone
through the decay rate of aftershocks. Although the decay rate of aftershocks
has been studied in the past, it has not been satisfactorily explained with a
physical basis. Temperature is one of the candidates for a major controlling
factor but establishing a relationship with aftershock decay rate is complicated
by lack of data and the potential for other controlling factors. This work will
attempt to isolate the temperature controlling factor by means of Japanese heat
flow data in regions of active seismicity. If successful, the results will
provide useful constraints on earthquake nucleation models. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
