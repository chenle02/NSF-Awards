Einstein's equations originated in the general theory of relativity, where they
govern the gravitational field by constraining the geometry of 4-dimensional
space-time. The research funded by this grant will attempt to deepen our
understanding of the "Riemannian" version of these equations, a context in which
there is no difference between space and time directions. One central problem is
to understand whether two solutions of these equations on a closed 4-dimensional
space can always be continuously deformed into one another. Another key problem
is to completely understand which 4-dimensional spaces carry solutions of these
equations. Answers to these and related questions would be of fundamental
interest not only in pure mathematics, but also in theoretical physics, where
such problems arise in connection with theories of quantum gravity.

The principal investigator will study a family of related problems in
4-dimensional global Riemannian geometry, focusing on existence, moduli, and
detailed structure of Einstein metrics and other Bach-flat metrics on smooth
compact 4-manifolds. The primary goal of this research program is to discover
and elucidate fundamental links between the curvature of a Riemannian 4-manifold
and the differential topology of the underlying space. The interplay between
geometry and topology that occurs in dimension four is qualitatively different
from what occurs other dimensions, and a deeper understanding of this phenomenon
could have significant repercussions in differential topology. Related problems
in higher-dimensional geometry will therefore also be considered when it becomes
helpful to frame key issues in a broader context.
