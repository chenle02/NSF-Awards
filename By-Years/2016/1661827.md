The increasing size and political relevancy of the Muslim population in the U.S.
stands in stark contrast to the trivial amount of quality data describing their
political attitudes and behavior. As a first step in planning and conducting a
large-N, in-depth, multilingual survey of this understudied community, a full
day workshop will bring together a diverse set of participants including
faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates. Workshop participants will
summarize and discuss the current state of knowledge about Muslims Americans and
coordinate next steps. Participants will include faculty and graduate students
who currently study Muslim Americans or who are interested in doing so.
Gathering researchers together to promote collaboration and discuss recent
research will 1) encourage scholars to work in this area, 2) ensure that future
efforts to better understand Muslim Americans are inclusive of a broad range of
research questions and hypotheses, and 3) facilitate cooperation and
coordination among scholars (including graduate students). The networking of
scholars, including the mentoring of junior scholars and students by senior
faculty, will strengthen the diversity and quality of future scholarship and the
profession.

The Workshop will address several important topics in the studying of members of
ethnic and/or religious groups. These include issues of identity, effects of
discrimination and media coverage, political behavior, and political attitude.
In addition, it will help to develop a research agenda for scholars studying
these groups include a national survey. Finally, the workshop will increase
synergies between faculty and graduate students of diverse backgrounds, which
will in turn develop networks and collaborations.
