This program will develop three telescopes with low-noise, high-speed detectors
that can be deployed to observe occultations around the world. Occultation
events can provide the highest spatial resolution of solar system objects in
lieu of a close spacecraft encounter. In the next few years there are excellent
opportunities to study the rapidly evolving atmospheres of Pluto and Triton. The
predicted state of Pluto's atmosphere is of paramount importance to the Pluto-
Kuiper Belt mission's sequencing planning for its encounter in 2014-2016. There
are opportunities to study centaur objects with unprecedented spatial and
temporal resolution. Finally, recent improvements to stellar position catalogs
and Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) orbit determinations will allow the first accurate
measurements of KBO sizes via occultations. Collaborators at the University of
Colorado and Wellesley College will use these systems to train the next
generation of observational astronomers. The observations and results will be
made available for public use.
