9307217 Matyjaszewski The aim of this research project is to continue synthesis
and basic characterization of polysilanes with functional groups, based on the
dearylation reaction discovered for oligosilanes in our laboratories. This
technique was extended to polysilanes with phenyl groups to form partially
triflated poly(methylphenylsilylene). The backbone with electrophilic sites is
used for the attachment of various functional groups as well as to perform
grafting. In order to enhance stability of polysilanes with side functional
groups, a new technique based on the connection of the electrophilic reactive
site (alkyl triflate) via a trimethylene spacer will be used. This method will
increase stability of new polymers although it will limit electronic effects due
to the insulating character of the alkane chain separating electronically active
groups from the delocalized polysilane backbone. Additionally, ring-opening
polymerization of strained cyclotetrasilanes with functional groups will be
explored. This method can provide control of configuration of substituents and
also affect electronic properties. Thus, the project focuses on preparation and
characterization (NMR, GPC, viscometry, light scattering, UV, fluorescence, DSC,
TGA, X-ray, electron microscopy, electron diffraction) of polysilanes with new
functional groups as well as corresponding block and graft copolymers.
Polysilanes are new advanced materials with interesting properties which lead to
applications in electronics, optics, and ceramics. Additional applications are
possible when materials with more diversified structure will be available.
Nearly all known polysilanes contain only alkyl and aryl substituents, but this
research aims to prepare new types of these materials. ***
