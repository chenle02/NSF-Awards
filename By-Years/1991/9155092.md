The University of Missouri @ Rolla will initiate a four-week, residential Young
Scholars project in Engineering and Earth Science for 20 students entering grade
12. Approximately 120 high school seniors will attend a one-week program (40
students/week for three consecutive weeks in June) designed to present science
and engineering careers relating to minerals, materials, energy and the
environment. Twenty participants from this group will be selected to return for
an additional three-week research experience; the particular discipline of the
research will be selected to match student interest.
