An ongoing evolution in the design of mobile applications (apps) and services,
called "app-as-a-platform", is posing fundamental challenges to mobile security
and privacy, exposing consumers, enterprises, and governments to new threats.
Existing security technologies were not designed to address apps' emerging role
as micro-platforms and are, therefore, incapable of providing sufficient
protections. This research project is developing security foundations in three
dimensions of app-as-a-platform architectures: (1) In-app Dimension, where
modules within the same app can adversely affect or manipulate one another, (2)
App-cloud Dimension, where apps may spy on or abuse integrated cloud services,
and vice versa, and (3) App-IoT Dimension, where unauthorized apps can
manipulate IoT (Internet-of-Things)-connected devices.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is investigating approaches to
safeguard mobile apps' integration with third-party modules, cloud services, and
IoT devices that are organized by app-as-a-platform architectures. The project
is developing security foundations for these architectures by retrofitting
mobile middleware and operating systems (OS) with new isolation, mediation, and
attestation primitives and mechanisms. To establish a principled defense against
threats to app-as-a-platform systems, the researchers are designing new OS
abstractions for in-process memory isolation, language constructs for module-
level security enforcement, trustworthy web integration mechanisms, remote
attestation of mobile agents, and an IoT authorization and interoperation
framework. The project also provides unique education and training opportunities
for both graduate and undergraduate students.
