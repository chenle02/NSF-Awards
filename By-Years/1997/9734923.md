Utilitarian reasoning has been an area of emerging interest in multi-agent
systems. The research supported by this award is in this area, though it will
make use of more classical concepts of symbolic reasoning as well. This project
will investigate how non-cooperative game-theoretic tools and methods can be
usefully applied to model the interactions of artificial computer-based agents.
Since such agents must be programmed, the research must provide explicit models
of how agents reason to a solution, a task which has never been addressed in
traditional game theory. Game theory must be supplemented with representations
in which actions, references, and rationality for agents can be defined, as well
as with mechanical procedures that allow agents to compute solutions to their
decision problems. This project aims to view agents as simple inferential
machines that can derive a solution from a set of axioms and inference rules.
Since agents may repeatedly interact, and thus may have a chance to learn from
their environments, we need to provide them with belief revision tools and embed
such tools into viable computational procedures. The results of this research
will form basis for studying how cooperation and coordination can be attained in
multi-agent systems.
