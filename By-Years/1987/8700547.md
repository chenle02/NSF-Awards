The osteology of the Mesozoic flying reptile Pteranodon will be studied using
American and European museum collections as well as stratigraphic investigations
in Kansas. This will lead to quantitative study of the pterosaur's growth and
function, and to a revision of its taxonomy. Ancestor-descendant relationships
will be interpreted using specimens from China, North America and Europe.
Pterosaurs are commonly cited as examples of convergent evolution, and they have
been modelled and studied extensively in functional terms. A revised systematic
and phylogenetic framework would make past and future work on this group more
valuable from an evolutionary perspective.
