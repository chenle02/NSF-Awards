There are two main topics of research in this proposal, first, the large time
behaviour and scattering theory of nonlinear Schrodinger waves off a potential
term which supports many bound states. This leads to the analysis of
multichannel nonlinear scattering and metastability of hamiltonian dispersive
equations. The second topic involves the study of radiation damping for
metastable mutltibreather solutions of the wave equation. The large time
behaviour of the linearized wave equation around multibreather solutions is
analyzed; a theory to estimate the lifetimes of perturbed multibreather
solutions is developed and applications to nonlinear optics, in particular
optical guides with non-uniform diffraction profiles.

The use of optical devices and fibers in today's communication systems motivates
some of the problems studied in this proposal. In particular we concentrate on
the problem of effects of defects and other irregularities in optical fibers on
their transport properties. We also analyze some novel optical devices made by
modifying the medium in a way to achieve better filtering of noise and
interchannel interference.
