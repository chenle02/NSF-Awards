9354432 Lamba The goal of this project is to revitalize the undergraduate
chemistry curriculum by adopting laboratory-driven instruction using the
discovery (inquiry) approach. With this approach, new topics would be introduced
first in the laboratory and then discussed more fully during the lecture. The
central objective is to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate a
comprehensive set of instructional modules that will address the concerns of
chemistry educators and satisfy the needs of introductory chemistry curricula.
The modules will include student handouts, a teacher's guide, and suggestions
for their implementation. The modules will be appropriate not only for science
majors but also for non-science majors. Initial development has initiated in the
students a positive response and attitude towards chemistry. Five colleges and
universities involved are collaborating in testing the discovery exercises and
the instructional modules. Dissemination will be through this broad outreach and
materials development. Evaluation will be carried out during the project and
with students after their graduation. ***y
