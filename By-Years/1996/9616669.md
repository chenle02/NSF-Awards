9616669 Barnett Recent advances in fire science and computer modeling of fires
allow scientists to predict fire growth and spread through buildings and other
structures. To date, little work has been done to develop the scientific basis
for the methodologies and techniques necessary to allow the use of this
technology for manual building-fire suppression. The objective of this study is
to develop a prototype system consisting of a building-specific fire simulation
database and real-time sensor queries to aid fire fighting efforts in building
fires. The database will be constructed by using building fire field models
based on computational fluid dynamics theory and zone models as appropriate. The
result of this work will be a system whereby manual fire suppression activities
will be optimized by an interaction with a building's thermal sensing system
through the use of computer database and visualization technology. The results
of this research will have wide-ranging applications and will form the basis for
the development of new fire models and expert systems for building manual fire
suppression activities. ***
