This project is for the development of new nonlinear methodologies for high
performance control of Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS). The work is
organized in two phases: the first deals with the development and general
structure of the algorithm for the application to the FACTS. The second phase
consists of a demonstration of a multimachine model including on-line nonlinear
system characterization, identification, fault detection, stability analysis,
adaptive control and solid state compensator design. The work is being jointly
funded by the Electric Power Research Institute and the Bonneville Power
Administration.
