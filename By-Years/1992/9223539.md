This doctoral dissertation research project uses survey research and
multivariate data analysis to investigate how Protestantism affects the
propensity of Guatemalan and Costa Rican citizens to engage in various forms of
political action, including voting, campaign activity, contacting public
officials, and community activism. The study focuses on the direct effects (of
religious affiliation and beliefs), the indirect effects (via the effects of
Protestantism on literacy, gender roles, and economic status), and interactive
effects (between Protestantism and variant political and social environments) of
Protestantism. The significance of this research is that it will lead to a) a
description of the multiple forms of Protestantism that are currently diffusing
throughout Latin America, and b) analysis of the multiplicity of effects that
any given kind of Protestantism may have in different social and political
contexts in Latin America. The study will address both traditional concerns with
religion as a predictor of political attitudes and actions and questions of how
religion may be viewed by politicians and parties as a vehicle for mobilizing or
demobilizing various populations. This research will also have implications for
the study of religion and politics in other regions where variant forms of
religion interact within a larger social context to produce regognizable
patterns of political action.
