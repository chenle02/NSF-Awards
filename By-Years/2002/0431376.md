&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a SGER to support
the PI's proposal to explore the possibility of collaborating with the residents
of Holman, NT, Canada on emerging research on economic security and aging. The
project will provide learning opportunities to the Inuit who are an
underrepresented group in the sciences. In addition, the project exemplifies the
OPP/NSF "Principles for the Conduct of Research in the Arctic," which guides
researchers toward collaborating with communities in research design and
implementation. &lt;br/&gt;
