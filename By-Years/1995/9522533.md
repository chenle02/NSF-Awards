EEC-9525533 Jones This award provides funding for a joint Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center in Coating Research at the Eastern Michigan
University, Michigan Molecular Institute, and the North Dakota State University.
The Centers' two-fold mission is to be a leading academic organization that
develops relevant scientific knowledge for understanding and expanding the
technology of paints and coatings for the benefit of its members and to enlarge
the cadre of scientists and technologists capable of working effectively with
coatings. The thrust areas of the Center's research activities are defined by
critical problems facing the coating industry and coating users. These areas
include: a.) reduction, ultimately, elimination of air pollution; b.) cost-
effective improvement of product quality; c.) improved corrosion protection.
There are 17 company members currently involved in Center's research activities.
These research activities will be coordinated through the Eastern Michigan
University under the guidance of the Industry Advisory Board. The Center will
perform research in seven areas of science and engineering that are directly
relevant to these thrust areas, often combining resources of the institutions to
focus on a thrust area. Projects will be implemented primarily by faculty,
staff, and the students of the three institutions. Additional funding is
provided in this award to support two women undergraduate students who will work
as research assistants during the 1995-96 fall and winter semesters. One student
will work on a project entitled "Rheology of low and Solventless Water Reducible
Coatings." The other student will work on the project "Improved Methods for VOC
Analysis."
