VLSI chip testing tools, produced in research projects at the Virginia
Polytechnic University, are being developed and enhanced. The tools are intended
to support teaching and research in academia. These tools include, a
combinational circuit automatic test pattern generator (ATPG), a sequential
fault simulator, a sequential ATPG for both synchronous and asynchronous
sequential circuits, and two parsers for analyzing circuit designs in the
languages VHDL and EDIF. A benchmark collection of industrial type circuits is
being developed. The tools are being developed so that they: 1. are easy to
install and use, and are maintenance free; 2. provide a variety of options to
support many research and teaching activities; and 3. the source code is easy to
read, modify and extend. The tools and their source code are being distributed
freely to universities for research and teaching.
