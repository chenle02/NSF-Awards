The research objectives of this study are to obtain an understanding of the
annual cycles of bacterial biomass and production in the open sea. Such studies
have previously been identified by the JGOFS program as necessary core
measurements, which are considered essential for a better understanding of
carbon and nitrogen fluxes through planktonic systems. The studies will be
conducted at the Bermuda Biological Station for Research (BBSR) in the Bermuda
Atlantic Time Series (BATS). In order to make high precision estimates of
bacterial production initial studies will examine a number of radioactively
labeled compounds such as thymidine, adenine, and leucine by conducting a series
of calibration experiments for an empirical determination of conversion factors
to be used for the different compounds. In the second year, regular sampling of
the annual cycle of bacterial biomass and production at stations off Bermuda
will begin in conjunction with the ongoing BBSR/JGOFS cruises. In addition, more
detailed and intense studies will focus on two critical periods, the spring
phytoplankton bloom and the conspicuous summer subsurface bacterial abundance
maximum which has been identified in previous work conducted at Bermuda.
Finally, work on modelling ecosystem structure at Bermuda will be continued and
extended which will provide data for model validation, and developing new models
of plankton dynamics.
