Dr. Rytas Vilgalys of Duke University will use modern methods of DNA analysis
to obtain nucleotide sequence data and restriction-site mapping information on
fungi of three related tribes of the basidiomycete family Tricholomataceae. The
genomic data will be used to improve recognition of generic groups of these
fungi and to determine the phylogenetic affinities among the genera and tribes.
The fungi will be surveyed for phylogenetically useful restriction site and
sequence variation at loci coding for ribosomal RNA. In addition, Dr. Vilgalys
has adapted laboratory procedures for filamentous fungi which allow rapid,
direct sequencing of RNA from isolates from crude cellular lysates. Further
genetic analyses will provide information about the rate and direction of
evolution within ribosomal genes of fungi.
