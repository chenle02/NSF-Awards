1462294 - Linne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biennial Laser Diagnostics in
Combustion Gordon Research Conference (GRC) has served since 1981 as the off-
the-record, rigorously academic forum for students and scientists from around
the world interested in using lasers to understand combustion problems. This
year in coordination with the GRC, the second Laser Diagnostics in Combustion
Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) is organized, which is a forum for graduate
students and post-docs to present and exchange new data and cutting edge ideas
immediately preceding the GRC. The GRC itself brings together approximately 170
scientists for a week of intense interaction and scientific discussion. This is
not a conference for reviewing previous research, but rather to concentrate on
novel and often controversial advances for the near- and longer-terms.
