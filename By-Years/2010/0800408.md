The research objective of this award is to develop a design methodology for
optimal synthetic fibrillar adhesives inspired by gecko foot-hairs, to improve
our detailed nanomechanical understanding of biologically inspired fiber array
adhesion, and to fabricate and demonstrate hierarchical synthetic fibrillar
adhesives similar to their biological counterparts. The research breakthrough
proposed in this work is the development of a design methodology for the
fabrication of hierarchical and high performance biologically inspired fibrillar
adhesives using continuum theoretical nanomechanical models. These improved
theoretical fibrillar nanomechanical models and fabricated synthetic multi-level
fibrillar adhesives will advance research of biologically inspired adhesives and
nanofiber adhesion, contact, and fracture mechanics and will produce new self-
cleaning and repeatable adhesive commercial products in the near
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will
provide an opportunity to create new repeatable adhesive products in textile,
biomedical, space, sports, entertainment, product design, robotics, and
packaging industry. Interdisciplinary research work in this proposal will be
transferred to many educational activities in mechanical engineering, biomedical
engineering, and materials science. Micro/Nano-Robotics course developed by the
principle investigator will use the biologically inspired adhesive and material
concepts, models, and fabrication facilities in this project to design and
implement new biologically inspired nanomaterials in student semester-long
projects. The research results of this project will be disseminated to children,
K-12 students and teachers, and college students through public lectures and
summer internships. This project will train underrepresented graduate and
undergraduate students in biologically inspired inspired nanomaterials and
nanomechanics fields.
