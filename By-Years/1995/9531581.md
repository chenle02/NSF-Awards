This award will provide opportunities for undergraduate students to participate
in summer research projects in microbiology, molecular biology and related
fields at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Students will be provided with
hands-on experience and become familiar with research techniques of
microbiology, biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology using modern
equipment and facilities in the Department of Bacteriology. Students will attend
professional seminars and make written and oral presentations of their own
research findings. The program has an established record of attracting motivated
students and stimulating them to pursue careers in research. This award will
foster the continued education and training of our next generation of basic
researchers in the Biological Sciences. Students trained in the specific areas
of this program will acquire experience that can lead to research careers or
possibly to technical work in health related research.
