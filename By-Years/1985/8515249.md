In this research, the variability analysis methods are developed to evaluate the
effects of variation in the soil constitutive properties on theseismic ground
motions and hence on the response of soil-(embedded) structure systems. The
covariance matrices for the stresses, strains, and displacements in the soil and
structure regions are analyzed in detail according to first- and second-order
approximations. These results are verified against Monte Carlo simulations using
a super computer. The algebraic complexities of the formulate depicting the
higher-order statistical approximations will be handled by symbolic manipulation
languages germain to artificial intelligence procedures. Automated sequential
refinements of the final results of the statistical correlations are explored.
Further, a set of nonlinear constitutive equations for the soil which are
amenable both to finite element analysis and stochastic equivalent linearization
are developed.
