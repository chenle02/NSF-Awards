This proposal is a request for funds to upgrade the electronics and the data
processing capability of an existing nine- year-old Bruker WM-400 MHz nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The five chemistry research groups that
will be the principal users of this instrument require NMR as an aid in their
organic and inorganic synthetic programs to identify products and to determine
product structures. The proposed work requires a modern multinuclear NMR
spectrometer with variable temperature and sophisticated pulse control for
current and future 2D FTNMR experiments. The current instrument, which is the
only research grade NMR on the campus at Kansas State University, is nearly
maximally booked, has a limited, obsolete data processing and data storage
system, and is encountering increasing difficultes in providing decoupled
spectra or in performing DEPT, NOESY, and COSY experiments upon demand. Two of
the four principal users are currently supported by awards from the National
Science Foundation. Other faculty in the departments of Chemistry, Biochemistry,
Foods and Nutrition and Grain Science will also benefit from this upgrade and
they are listed as "other" users. %%% This proposal will assist in the purchase
of a modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This instrument is an
essential tool for faculty members at Kansas State University engaged in
chemical research. The instrument provides important information which in most
cases can be used to determine the geometric and/or molecular structure of newly
synthesized molecules.
