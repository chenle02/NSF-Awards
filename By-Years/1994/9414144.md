9414144 Rickett Drs. Rickett and Coles will study the scattering of
radiowavelength radiation as it passes through the interstellar plasma. The
motivation for the research is twofold: first to understand the scattering and
so predict the distorting effects of interstellar wave propagation for radio
astronomers; second to record the distortions and scattering and to interpret
them as a way of studying the distant ionized interstellar medium. In the first
case the scattering causes a galactic seeing problem for radio astronomers; in
the second case the details of the scattering provide a signal which can be used
to remotely probe the characteristics of the very diffuse interstellar plasma.
