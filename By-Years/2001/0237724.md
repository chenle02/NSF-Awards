The research goals of this project are to develop new analytical, statistical,
and numerical methods for stochastic partial differential equations. There are
three directions in the proposed research: Wiener Chaos decomposition for linear
and nonlinear equation, analysis of stochastic partial differential equations in
domains, and statistical inference for stochastic partial differential
equations. Wiener Chaos decomposition is a stochastic analog of the classical
Fourier method and is a powerful tool in the study of stochastic equations, from
both analytical and numerical points of view. In particular, Wiener Chaos
decomposition is the key component of several new numerical algorithms for
nonlinear filtering and of an efficient computational procedure for statistical
moments of the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation. Analysis of stochastic partial
differential equations in domains is necessary for development of a complete
theory, similar to the one for deterministic partial differential equations. In
addition to purely theoretical results about existence and uniqueness of
solutions, this analysis leads to new numerical methods for such equations.
Methods of statistical inference make it possible to relate an abstract equation
to a concrete problem from applications. Unlike finite-dimensional systems, a
consistent estimation in a stochastic partial differential equation is possible
even when both the observation time and the amplitude of noise are
fixed.&lt;br/&gt; Stochastic partial differential equations are both an
interesting mathematical object and an effective modeling tool in various
branches of applied science, such as ecology, finance, meteorology, and
navigation. Equations studied in this project can describe, for example, the
term structure of interest rates, the propagation of an oil spill in the ocean,
and the motion of the target on the radar screen. The research objectives of the
project are to study mathematical properties of stochastic partial differential
equations and to develop effective computational and statistical methods for
relating an equation to a model. The educational objective of the project is to
increase understanding of stochastic partial differential equations among the
students and researchers both inside and outside of the mathematical community.
This educational objective will be achieved by developing several basic and
special topics courses and by organizing a research seminar on applications of
stochastic partial differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;
