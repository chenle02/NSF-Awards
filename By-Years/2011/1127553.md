This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use resins,
additives, and process aids shown by PlastiPure to be free of estrogenic and
anti-estrogenic activity (EA**) to create innovative and novel flexible plastic
films and products for the preparation and storage of food and beverages that
leach no chemicals having EA**. These films and products should remain free of
EA** when extracted by common solvents and food simulants, and remain EA**-free
after the stresses of manufacturing and exposure to common-use stresses
(microwaving, thermal cycling, and UV light). PlastiPure also proposes to
produce prototype products which would be specifically targeted for pregnant
women, infants, and young children, whom are particularly vulnerable to the
potentially adverse health effects of EA**. These highly desirable end products
are already being sought by PlastiPure licensees and interested retailers.

The broader impacts of this research are development and commercialization of
food and beverage packaging that are significantly safer, especially for
pregnant women, infants, and young children. Fetal or juvenile mammals,
including humans, are especially sensitive to effects of chemicals having EA**
at very low dosages and hence should not indiscriminately ingest such chemicals.
EA** has been strongly linked to higher rates of certain cancers, birth and
learning disorders, obesity, and reproductive issues. PlastiPure's data show
that the vast majority of plastic food packaging leaches chemicals with EA**,
including those advertised as BPA-free. This NSF SBIR grant should facilitate a
comprehensive reduction of risks to public health and reduced environmental
impact from chemicals having EA.
