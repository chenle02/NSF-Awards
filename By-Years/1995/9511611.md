Privatization, Regional Development, and Democratization in Bulgaria The
research investigates the relationships among privatization of economic
activities, local and regional networks of organizations, and the development of
new economic and political structures in post-communist Bulgaria. The research
draws on theoretical debates about the relationship between economic and
political change in post-communist countries, and about the importance of
networks and quasi-private institutions in regional economic development. The
Veliko Tarnovo region in north-central Bulgaria was chosen as the focus region,
because it has a strong historical identity as a region, is distant enough from
Sofia to have a distinct economy and institutions, and has avoided the
acrimonious political discord of the capital. Thus, the investigators expect the
region to be among Bulgaria's prime candidates to develop indigenous
institutions to promote competitive private enterprise. Data are to be drawn
from archival sources and structured interviews, making use of the
investigators' prior work in Bulgaria and fluency in Bulgarian. The project will
test the much-discussed contributions of sub-national, regional networking and
cooperation to economic development, in a very different political and
institutional context than most of the published literature.
