The Virginia Urban Corridor Teacher Preparation Collaborative is a joint effort
of the liberal arts and science and education faculties of universities and
colleges (Longwood College, Mary Washington College, Norfolk State University,
and Virginia Commonwealth University) who train the large majority of
prospective teachers within Virginia's urban corridor, the region's Community
Colleges (Germana, J. Sargeant Reynolds, Tidewater), the Virginia Mathematics
and Science Coalition, and the regional school systems. The goal of the
Collaborative is to implement programs that will prepare K-8 teachers who have
strong science and mathematics backgrounds, who enjoy science and mathematics,
who understand what is known about the types of teaching that enable students to
learn, and whose teaching will reflect their scientific and pedagogical
knowledge. The Collaborative will put in place policies that require and
encourage prospective teachers to study more, and more appropriate, science and
mathematics. All science and mathematics courses taken by prospective K-8
teachers will be renewed and reformed by adapting the "best practices" being
developed nationwide. Course revision teams will include faculty from science
disciplines, education departments, and master teachers from the school systems.
A cadre of Clinical Faculty will work to improve all aspects of the teacher
preparation program, including the in-school experiences of prospective and new
teachers. Recruitment and retention efforts will enlist students in a teacher
preparation program to work with the faculty as Teaching Associates. The
Collaborative will include three cross-fertilization/dissemination activities:
an annual week-long Science and Mathematics colloquium; an annual four-week long
Institute featuring courses which are being developed by Collaborative
institutions, and a published journal devoted to the preparation of prospective
K-8 teachers in science and mathematics. This Collaborativ e will impact
policies required for preparation of K-8 teachers; improve the nature and
quality of instruction in mathematics and the sciences; improve in-school
experiences of prospective teachers; enhance recruitment of qualified teachers
of science and mathematics, particularly for underrepresented groups; and
promote the dissemination of materials and approaches within the Collaborative
and beyond.
