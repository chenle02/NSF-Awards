Funds are requested to move a 50-MHz spaced antenna/imaging Doppler
interferometer system to a location near the Flatland radar in Illinois and to
operate it there for a period of three years. The goal is to establish a
mesoscale network near Urbana consisting of three radars in a triangular array
with an average separation of approximately 20 km. The addition of the new
facility to the two radars already operating near Urbana will allow measurements
of a number of parameters important in the evolution of mesoscale and microscale
meteorological systems, including horizontal and vertical velocities, vorticity,
divergence, shears, deformation, and the vorticity equation tilting terms. The
special capabilities of the spaced antenna/IDI system will also allow a study of
the scattering mechanisms responsible for the echoes, the tilts of isentropic
surfaces, and possibly the small-scale vorticity, divergence, and vorticity
tilting terms on a spatial scale of 30-50 m, i.e., the scale characteristic of
the separation of the antennas in the spaced antenna system. The addition of a
third radar to the network increases the information that can be derived and the
number of studies that can be carried out by more than a factor of ten over what
can be achieved with either a single radar or dual radar.
