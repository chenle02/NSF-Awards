This proposal, submitted through the ROW Planning Grant initiative, is designed
to assist the PI in preparing a competitive research proposal for the National
Science Foundation. The topical area of research is the persistence of gender
differences in representation in mathematics, science, and technical fields
despite women's progress in educational attainment. The PI will explore whether
the positive effects on college attendance and completion of Catholic high
school attendance by girls extend to positive effects on their study of science
and mathematics. The data base to be used is High School and Beyond. The
questions to be addressed are: (1) What gender differences exist in mathematical
and scientific educational experiences, as well as in attitudes towards these
fields, among seniors in 1982? (2) Do such gender differences vary by high
school type (public or Catholic) when individual social background is controlled
for? (3) What are the mechanisms through which Catholic high schools confer
possible advantages or disadvantages to their students? (4) Do different types
of Catholic high schools, such as single-sex or co-educational schools, have
differental effects upon the achievements and enrollment patterns of women and
men in mathematics and science? The PI will use the ROW planning grant to
establish contact with senior advisors well-versed in this type of research so
that she can improve her statistical and methodological skills, to complete a
more thorough review of the literature, and to prepare her data for the study
that she would then propose for NSF funding.
