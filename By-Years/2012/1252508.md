The aim of the PHoTOnICs project, led by researchers at the University of
California, Davis, is two-fold: First, the researchers will design technology-
based learning activities that seize on emerging digital devices as resources
for extending best practices in physics instruction. Second, they will conduct
research into the nature of student learning and collaborative interaction
supported by those curricular designs and technologies, particularly tablet and
mobile PCs of the kind that are quickly becoming widespread on college campuses
and in many K-12 school settings. The research will take place in an
introductory series of college physics courses at UC Davis and in the West
Sacramento Early College Prep Charter School, a diverse, urban school that has a
focus on bridging formal and informal learning experiences by utilizing mobile
technology. As part of this project, the investigators will develop assessments
of student learning of specific physics content as well as their developing
reasoning and problem solving abilities in physics.

The project will capitalize on digital technologies and their prominence in many
students' informal activity by integrating them into designs for learning
activities in formal science education settings. Mobile devices offer
distinctive potential for bridging informal and formal learning environments
because of their ready portability across settings and their utility in
supporting a broad range of activities. A central focus of the proposed project
will be to develop and study the use of technology in education by supporting
student collaboration both inside and outside the classroom.
