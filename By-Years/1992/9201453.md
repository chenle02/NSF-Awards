This award supports the research of Professor B. Sturmfels to work on the
interplay between combinatorics and algebraic geometry. He will study fiber
polytopes, sparse elimination theory, intrinsic Grobner basis, the hard
Lefschetz theorem, generalized hypergeometric functions and algorithms in
geometric invariant theory. This research is on the boundary between the fields
of algebraic geometry and combinatorics. These are among the oldest parts of
modern mathematics. Algebraic Geometry originally treated figures defined in the
plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Combinatorics attempts
to find efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects can be
organized. The combination of these two fields has proved itself extremely
useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science,
cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
