This proposal is a renewal of a previously funded three-year project in which
groups of six high school chemisty teachers attend eight-week sessions at the
University of Maryland. Each group returns for two additional, sequential eight-
week summer sessions. Teachers join research groups and become active
participants in state-of-the-art research projects in functioning laboratories
where they learn new techniques and background material while being introduced
to the basic research experience. Teachers learn how chemical knowledge is
discovered in a low pressure environment. In addition to the research
experience, teachers are exposed to advanced coursework and seminars on current
topics in chemistry including teaching methods. Participants are required to
write a report and present a seminar on their research in the final week of the
program. This program enables 18 teachers to complete their three-year cycle of
research. The University of Maryland is contributing the salaries of the PI, the
research mentors and those parts of the teacher stipends which could not be
subsidized by their school districts. This cost share is 59% of the NSF funding
request.
