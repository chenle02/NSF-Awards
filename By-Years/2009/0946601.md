&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the synthesis of
computations and signal processing operations in a novel context: protein-
protein biochemistry where the inputs and outputs are quantities of different
types of proteins. The project will demonstrate that biochemistry can implement
simple and powerful digital signal processing (DSP) operations. Constructs like
and decision feedback equalizers will be implemented: given input quantities of
proteins, the system performs a decision to deliver a drug or not, adaptively
and autonomously. Also band-pass filtering will be implemented: the quantity of
output protein is a highly-tuned function of the frequency of the changes in the
quantities of input proteins. Other DSP functions such as FFTs will be
implemented. The design of such DSP functions will be investigated in an
abstract framework, as a proof of concept. (At this time, the research will not
attempt to address the experimental application of these ideas in vitro or in
vivo). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Techniques for analyzing the dynamics of
biological systems are well established. However, synthesizing computation with
such mechanisms requires new techniques ? and an entirely new mindset. Success
in this endeavor will open numerous opportunities in fields such as biochemical
sensing and drug delivery. An important goal of the project is to communicate
the goals and the impetus for interdisciplinary research to a wide audience. A
new graduate-level course will be developed, titled "Circuits, Computation, and
Biology" offered jointly through the ECE Department and the new Biomedical
Informatics and Computational Biology Program at the University of Minnesota.
