The purpose of this work is to create a comprehensive and easily accessible data
base for flood loss information, for selected sites in the U.S. and for the last
thirty years. This documentation effort together with existing hydrologic data
will provide the fundamental information needed for the research on and
validation of mathematical models and techniques for risk/cost/benefit analysis
for alternative flood mitigation procedures. The data will be available in a
consistent format, it will be categorized and computerized.
