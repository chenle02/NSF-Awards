Mt. Holyoke College is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
For the summer of 1988, the program will support 8 students recruited from Mt.
Holyoke and other institutions. Research activities will include studies in the
following areas: o Stopped-flow spectroscopy to study rapid conformational
changes in polyacrylic acids and phospholipid membranes after a rapid pH-jump o
Spectroscopic studies of protein-nucleic acid interaction o Tertiary structures
of isolated enzymes in solution using photoaffinity reagents o Organic synthesis
using organosilicon and organophosphorus reagents o Molecular electronic
spectroscopy o Study of the collagen to gelatin transition o Xenon NMR as a
structure probe
