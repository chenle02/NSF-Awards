The PI proposes to investigate three areas of theoretical and experimental high-
frequency (HF) heater-induced plasma turbulence in the ionosphere. First, he
will study the evolution of the electron velocity distribution following heater
turn-on. Next, he will observe the relationship of short-scale, field-aligned
density striations, or ducts, to the HF-induced turbulence. Last, he will study
the generation of ionospheric Langmuir turbulence by the excitation of the two-
plasmon decay (TPD) instability and by stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), which
occur near one quarter of the reflection density.***
