education leadership, in collaboration with six major leadership organizations.
The Academy program will enhance the knowledge, skills, and strategies of
current leaders of science education reform with positions in NSF-funded and
other federally-funded projects and systemic initiatives, in school districts,
state departments of education, professional associations, and other
organizations. Each year of the four-year project, 30 leaders will began an
intensive two years of collaborative study, professional development, and
networking. Program content will include change management, science content,
organizational and professional development, and facilitation skills. Follow-up
activities will include mentor programs, study groups and other ways to keep
Fellows connected to reform networks and each other.
