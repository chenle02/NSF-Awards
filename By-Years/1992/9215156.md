This support will allow initiation of the data verification phase of the
project to computerize of the Museum of Zoology bird collection. The collection
(190,000 specimens) was captured into a database (MUSE for birds) under a
previous award. Data verification will involve comparing the database records
directly to the specimens and detection/correction of errors. %%% This award
will support the second and final phase of the project to database the bird
collection of 190,000 specimens at the University of Michigan, one of the most
important in the nation to research education on the biology of birds. The
computerized database will be checked against the actual specimens and specimen
tags to correct errors. The completed database will be a powerful research and
educational tool at the University and on electronic networks, such as Internet.
