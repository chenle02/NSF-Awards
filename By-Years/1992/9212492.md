The status of the social sciences as sciences has always been precarious.
However, the central role played by statistical methods in the modern social
sciences has seemed to provide at least several of them with a badge of
scientific status, inasmuch as a recurrent theme in the use of statistics in
social inquiry has been the idea that statistical methods should be capable of
revealing distinctive laws and causal relations upon which the social world is
ordered. Yet today, the major methodological issue confronting the social
sciences is the emergence of a crisis over the most widely used statistical
methods, generally known as "causal modeling" techniques. This conference, being
held at Notre Dame University in October, 1993, is bringing together for the
first time the major protagonists in the current debate about whether
statistical methods can generate causal knowledge. Also participating are
sophisticated critics from philosophy and social sciences who are exploring
alternative interpretations of the crisis at the broadest philosophical level.
The significance of the present situation is considerable, for the "natural
science" model of social scientific knowledge has had a substantial impact on
many areas of thought. Its apparent dissolution from within is an event
requiring philosophical interpretation. This conference promises to assist in
bringing these controversies out of the narrowly technical literature and into
the consciousness of the larger intellectual community.
