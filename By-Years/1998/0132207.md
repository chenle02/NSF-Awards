0132207&lt;br/&gt;Cheadle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial
support for the acquisition of a detector and software to add electron
backscattering diffraction (EBSD) capabilities to an existing modern scanning
electron microscope (SEM) in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the
University of Wyoming. EBSD systems are a relatively new technology that allow
for the rapid characterization of crystallographic preferred orientations (CPO)
of thin sections materials at sub-micron resolutions. The technology makes it
possible to statistically characterize paleodeformation mechanisms in rocks with
very small grain sizes that are impossible or very difficult to analyze using
alternative techniques combining traditional optical microscopy and x-ray
diffraction. Detailed crystallographic information can also be very useful for
studies of mineral surface processes and for characterizing the structure of
organic molecules. Research at Wyoming that will immediately benefit from this
system includes studies of the deformation processes responsible for creating
ultramafic mylonites collected from oceanic fracture zones, studies of mantle
peridotites to elucidate the factors responsible for igneous cumulates and to
aid in the interpretation of magma chamber dynamics, and studies of the
interaction of pharmaceuticals with malaria pigment to aid in the design of more
effective antimaliaral drugs.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
