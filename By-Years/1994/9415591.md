This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in cell
biology between Howard J. Worman of Columbia University and Jean-Claude
Courvalin of the Institut Jacques Monod, University of Paris VI. The objective
of their research is to study the mechanism of nuclear envelope or membrane
reassembly that takes place at the end of cell division. They will focus on two
nuclear- specific membrane proteins that have been identified in nuclear
envelope reassembly. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration
expertise in molecular biology. The engineering of the cDNA clones for the
expression of the protein will be performed in his laboratory. This is
complemented by the French investigator's expertise in cell biology. Most of the
biochemical and morphological experiments on the nuclear envelope reassembly
will be carried out in his laboratory. This joint effort will advance
fundamental understanding of the cell nucleus and the role of these proteins in
nuclear envelope reassembly.
