9627668 Bayliss The Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics
and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Northwestern
University propose to purchase a Hewlett Packard computational server which will
be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The
equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular:
1) Numerical study of filtration combustion with application to materials
systhesis. 2) Numerical study of pattern formation and nonlinear dynamics in
gaseous combustion. 3) Numerical study of pulse propagation in optical storage
rings employing parametric amplifiers. 4) Laminar flamelets in turbulent
combustion. 5) Flame propagation in tubes. 6) Flame spread over liquid fuels. 6)
Flow in unsaturated porous media. 7) Stability of foam flow in porous media. The
principal investigator is A. Bayliss. Co-principal investigators are W. L. Kath,
M. Matalon, B. J. Matkowsky, and M. J. Miksis. Northwestern University has
agreed to contribute 50% of the cost of the equipment.
