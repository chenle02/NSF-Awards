This award provides funds to subsidize the travel and housing expenses of
students selected to participate in the Twentieth International Conference on
Machine Learning (ICML), which will be held on August 21-24, 2003, in
Washington, DC.

At the conference, students will present results of their research in poster
sessions as part of the normal conference schedule. Members of the Program
Committee will be required to visit at least three posters to provide feedback
to the students. This provides the students with invaluable exposure to outside
perspectives on their work, at a critical time in their research, and also
enables them to explore their career objectives. This workshop contributes to
the professional development of young scientists who will lead this growing
field in the coming decades.
