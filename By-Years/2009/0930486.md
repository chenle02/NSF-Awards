This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project is to demonstrate a new
Coupled Quantum Dot (CQD) multifunctional material. Electron-tunneling and
inter-quantum dot coupling effects will be analyzed. The tunable energy bands of
the new CQD material will be simulated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successfully
performing the proposed research will provide an enabling multifunctional CQD
material platform that allows the monolithic integratation of lasers, electro-
optic (EO) modulators, and photodetectors on a single chip. Such monolithic
integration will not only minimize the size and weight of photonic system, but
also substantially reduce the optical alignment cost and enhance the system
reliability.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;
