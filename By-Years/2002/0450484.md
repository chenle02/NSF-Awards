This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project
proposes to develop a new treatment for cancer based upon the thermal activation
of gold-coated nanoparticles. This therapeutic technique involves (a) the
manufacture of new class of bio-compatible nanoparticles, optically-tunable
nanoshells, designed to absorb in near-infrared wavelengths ; (b) the
intravenous administration of nanoshells, which accumulate in the tumor as a
result of the leaky vasculature associated with tumors ; (c) exposure of the
tumor and potential routes of metastatic spread to an external laser source at
near-infrared wavelengths, which are minimally absorbed by human tissue but
preferentially absorbed by nanoshells, resulting in the generation of localized
areas of heat by the nanoshells sufficient to result in tumor
regression.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The commercial application of this project
will be in the area of cancer therapy. There are approximately 216,000 diagnosed
cases of breast cancer in the U.S. each year. Treatment for breast cancer
generally involves surgical excision, radiation, hormonal therapy and
chemotherapy. The proposed treatment, offering a safer, minimally invasive and
cheaper alternative, is expected to achieve a complete response in identified
solid tumors, to treat otherwise inoperable tumors and to eliminate regional
metastatic disease before it is clinically diagnosed.
