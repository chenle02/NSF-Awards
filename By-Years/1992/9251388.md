This project aims to improve technology transfer from academics to industry by
better preparing students to understand the research process and to assess the
capabilities and limitations of emerging technologies. In many cases, current
undergraduate computer science curriculums do not prepare the student to analyze
research in the field. By immersing students in a research environment at
school, it is believed that they will be able to extrapolate future trends
encountered in the workplace. The ability to make informed decisions is
necessary to rapidly move research to production. Graduates with this experience
are expected to be able to provide thoughtful analysis for or against new
technologies, giving their employers the confidence to push new technologies to
the forefront.The funds provided by the ILI project will enable the institution
to launch a research oriented curriculum. The machines, terminals and CASE
software provided will provide students with the same facilities used by faculty
researchers. Students will be guided through a curriculum designed to teach them
to perform research support for faculty members and/or to perform independent
research. First, students will be introduced to large scale coding and
documentation techniques in a software engineering course. This will be followed
by an introduction to one or more research areas providing some in- depth
knowledge. The experience will be completed with a senior research seminar
course in which the student is allowed to do independent research or become
involved in a faculty member's research by implementing theoretical results.
