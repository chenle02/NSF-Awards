This award, made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, deals with transition metal complexes of carbon dioxide and offers the
prospect of CO2 reduction to methanol or formaldehyde. Heterobimetallic
carboxylates will be prepared either by reaction of nucleophilic metal
carboxylates with metallo-Lewis acids or by CO2 insertion into metal-metal
bonds. In either case, the metals chosen will have a "push-pull" effect which
will stabilize the bound CO2. The metal pairs selected will generally be an
electron rich transition metal (Fe, Ru) and an oxophilic early-metal (Zr,Hf,W).
Supporting ligands on the metal pairs will be selected to optimize CO2 insertion
and stabilize the bridged heterobimetallic complexes. Structures and
reactivities of the CO2 complexes and their intermediates will be determined
along the synthetic route. Reduction of bound CO2 will be effected by means of
zirconium or silicon hydrides. %%% Transition metal-CO2 chemistry is an
important research area which is relevant to fundamental processes such as
photosynthesis. It also serves as a model for important, commercial,
heterogeneously-catalyzed processes such as methanol and formaldehyde synthesis.
