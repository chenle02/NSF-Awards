Abstract

The Department of Mathematics of the University of Alabama at Birmingham
proposes to host the Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference (STDC),
March 25-27, 2004. The STDC encompasses most of the areas of topology and of
topological approaches to dynamical systems. We expect the conference to attract
over 200 participants, nationally and internationally. The intellectual merit of
the proposed activity lies in the broad and deep interaction among the
participants. To ensure strong and balanced representation in each of the areas
central to the conference, we propose to have four special sessions running in
parallel: Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, General and Set-Theoretic
Topology, and Geometric Topology. To promote unity and interaction, there will
be 12 invited talks of 25-minutes in two parallel sessions, and 7 plenary talks
of 50 minutes. Ample opportunities for formal and informal interaction among
participants will be provided. This will include a session devoted to the state
of the arts in the conference areas, current fruitful directions, and new
opportunities.

The STDC conference brings together mathematicians and mathematics students
working in two core areas of mathematics: topology and dynamical systems. The
broader impact of the proposed activity lies in the advancement of knowledge,
including education of students, through communication of recent results in
these two core areas. We expect that many of the invited talks will emphasize
interaction of the research agendas of the central conference areas. Successful
conferences in core areas are an important part of mathematical infrastructure,
supporting research, training new mathematicians, and developing a foundation
for applications in related fields of mathematics and science. Every effort will
be made to provide for the substantial participation of under-represented
groups, graduate students, and active researchers in these areas.
