The objective of this project is to obtain reliable estimates of precision
(reproducibility and repeatibilty) of selected laboratory properties of rock,
working primarily with published standards of American Society for Rock
Mechanics. Based on the results of this investigation, modifications will be
proposed to fine tune existing standard test methods. The analyses and the
interpretation of the data with regard to both test methods and test materials
will be disseminated via publications, technical meetings and training sessions.
