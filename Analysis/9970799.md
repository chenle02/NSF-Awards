Abstract Loring

The abstract properties of curves in a unit cube defined by polynomials are well
understood. In particular, points that approximately are zeros of the
polynomials are close to exact zeros. The same set of polynomials can become
"unstable" when applied to matrices (and even more so when applied to operator
algebra variables). That is, there can be contractive matrices that, when
substituted into the polynomials give results near zero, and yet there is no
actual matrix-root close to the approximate solution. We call such approximate
solutions phantom solutions. These phantom approximate solutions can be
misleading in the context of computer models. There is a notion of stability for
a relation that does not require the relation to be polynomial. Much of this
project will study relations that remain stable when applied to operator algebra
variables. These are rare, but tend to be related to interesting invariants of
operator algebras. Stability results limited to the realm of matrices will also
be explored, with the hope of finding some applications to numerical analysis.

Polynomial relations have stability properties that we rely on every day. Take
the example of a laser cutting some flat material, where the cut-points are
determined as the zero-set of a set of equations. If the x and y coordinates of
the laser come close to satisfying these equations, we go ahead and fire the
laser, for we are sure that close to this approximate solution there is an exact
solution, and thus we are cutting close to where we should. In computer
modeling, one's model is often based on more that just numerical variables. In
particular, much of numerical analysis involves matrix-valued computations. It
turns out that equations that are stable for ordinary values become unstable for
matrix values. That is, there can be approximate solutions to equations that are
not close to any true solutions. We call such things phantom approximate
solutions. This project will study these phantom approximate solutions and ways
to detect and avoid them.
