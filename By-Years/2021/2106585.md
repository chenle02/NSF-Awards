This research work aims at providing a better fundamental understanding of the
interaction of matter or the quantum vacuum with laser pulses or other strong
external fields. The work focuses on new phenomena that are predicted to occur
if laser fields are sufficiently intense to trigger the creation of electron-
positron pairs. The interdisciplinary character of the new era of laser-
controlled matter creation processes to which the work will contribute could
provide new connections between atomic, plasma and laser physics. Due to the
fundamental nature of the processes examined in these projects, progress could
also accelerate advancements in other areas. For example, a better understanding
of the electron-positron dynamics could benefit the related development of
bright light sources, providing new ways to control atomic, chemical and
biological processes on very short time scales. An important mission for the
program is also to give undergraduate students the opportunity to gain personal
research experience and provide them with important skills, including working as
a team and gaining the endurance and intellectual flexibility to tackle serious
research problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The understanding of the relativistic
quantum dynamics will be advanced primarily with the aid of computer simulations
to allow for spatial and temporal resolution that has been developed by the PIs
to solve the quantum field theoretical Dirac equation. It will also be supported
by modern machine learning techniques, such as symbolic regression based on
evolutionary algorithms as well as on neural networks. The goal is to develop
novel theoretical approaches that can lead to a first insight into the internal
dynamics inside the laser field with complete spatial
resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
