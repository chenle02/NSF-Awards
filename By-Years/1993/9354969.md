Signal transduction is emerging as an important principle underlying much of
plant development and adaptation to the environment. Signaling often involves
multiple levels of response, from organ, tissue and cell interactions to events
at the level of membranes, cytoplasm and gene expression. In our view, the most
informative analyses of signal transduction involve multidisciplinary approaches
where the signal is characterized through its multiple levels and forms of
expression (genetic, biochemical, physical, physiological, etc.) We propose to
establish a graduate training program with innovations in our instructional
approach and research guidance with faculty from six (6) departments to pursue
collaborative research across multiple levels of signal transduction. Toward
this goal, we will develop a problem-based learning course to explore multiple
facets of plant signal transduction. Graduate students will engage in
multidisciplinary research by attacking research problems at the interface of
two (or more) research efforts. An annual Distinguished Investigator
seminar/workshop series and concluding international symposium will provide
additional opportunity for student development. Our program will enrich the
background and "tool-kit" available to the next generation, as well as the
current generation, of researchers to investigate the mechanisms by which plants
develop and react to their environment.
