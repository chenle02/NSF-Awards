The equations which describe stimulated Raman scattering in the transient limit
are nonlinear and integrable. However, the physical behavior of this system
after propagating, long distances is quite different from other integrable
systems such as light pulses in optical fibers. In optical fibers, the light
pulses break up into a number of solitons and a dispersive wave contribution,
while in the transient regime of stimulated Raman scattering, the solutions tend
toward a similarity solution which depends on (distance) x (time). This last
result, while inferrable from previous numerical results, was only recently
proved, and many of its consequences remain to be elucidated. The first issue of
concern is the limitation which second Stokes generation and finite T2 impose on
possible experimental observation of the self- similar solution. We will
investigate this phenomenon. We will also explore the impact of the transient
Raman effect on limiting the conversion efficiency of Raman frequency
downshifters which are used in conjunction with Ti:Sapphire lasers. We will also
explore the extent to which similar techniques can be applied to fiber gratings,
two-level systems, photorefractive materials, and other systems which have
either already been shown to exhibit self- similarity or are promising
candidates because they have long-term memory. Finally, on the mathematical
front, we will collaborate with Tom Seidman in studying the stability of these
solutions and with other mathematicians in obtaining asymptotic formulae for the
self-similar case when the frequencies are detuned.
