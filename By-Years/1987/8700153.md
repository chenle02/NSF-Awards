This research investigates the mobilization of glycogen for anaerobic energy
production by swimming fish. A wide diversity of freshwater and marine fish
species will be examined to determine if glycogen mobilization is an important
determinant of the mode of swimming among fish (periodic or burst) and,
therefore, their mode of foraging (searching or sit-and-wait). Of specific
interest will be steady-state levels of glycogen, rate of mobilization, and rate
of glycogen replenishment. Correlations will be sought among physiological
parameters, body morphology, and proportion of red muscle possessed by a
species. The influence of locomotor and foraging specialization on the relative
contribution of anaerobic energy to total energy production will also be
explored. Dr. Edward M. Goolish will perform these studies at the University of
Michigan during a two- year postdoctoral fellowship tenure.
