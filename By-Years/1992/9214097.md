The primary objective of this research is to clarify a number of aspects of the
peopling of the New World. It has been known for decades that Native Americans
are derived from an Asian ancestor. However, many questions remain, including a
number relating to the population size and structure of the first Americans. The
investigators propose to gather a sizable body of data on variation in nuclear
genes in samples of Native Americans representative of both North and South
American Amerindians. These data will be used to assess hypotheses based upon
alternative population histories. Similar reconstructions have been analyzed
based upon mitochondrial DNA data. As mtDNA is inherited in a very different
manner than nuclear DNA, comparisons between the two data sets will be
instructive.
