This RIA award will develop a cure monitor technique which can be integrated
into automated control schemes for economical manufacturing of composite
structures. It will be based on the methodology of the ultrasonic cure monitor
(UCM) technique for use in the processing of laminated graphite/epoxy composite
materials as well as the necessary analytical tools to relate ultrasonic wave
speed and attenuation to the cure state of the composite. From this, a
comprehensive process model will be developed for use in cure cycle optimization
and control.
