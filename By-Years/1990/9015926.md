This project will develop numerical methods for the solution of ill-posed
integral and operator equations. The methods are based on a new general approach
to sampling theorems for functions in reproducing kernel subspaces of a Sobolev
space. Various types of errors (truncation, aliasing, jitter, and amplitude)
will be studied. Sampling theory for regular Mikusinski operators as well as
wavelet sampling of ill- posed problems will be initiated. This project is
motivated by several applications arising in subjects ranging from radar
technology to oil recovery. These studies are part of the foundation of software
development in applications such as scanning and tomography
