The intent of this proposal is to promote the continuation and strengthening of
the regional workshop series `Lie groups, Lie algebras, and their
representations'. Funds will be used for travel support of graduate students and
some unfunded post-doctoral students to meet, confer and collaborate with
established experts, and to participate in quarterly workshops in Lie theory
held at various locations in the Western US.
