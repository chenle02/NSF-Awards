This grant permits Dr. Larsen and his collaborators to analyze a series of human
skeletons recovered from the site of Mission Santa Maria on Amelia Island,
Florida. These remains date from the period 1684 . 1702 and were discovered
during the process of land clearing for property development. Emergency
excavation yielded a series of aproximately 175 individuals. These remains will
be analyzed to provide demographic and health data. Sex and age.at.death will be
determined. Postcranial, dental and cranial elements will be measured to provide
information on growth. Pathological conditions which reflect disease will also
be noted. The goal of this project is to gain insight into human response to
stress. Through comparison of a series of skeletal populations which date to
different times, Dr. Larsen has obtained baseline information for Southeast U.S.
Indian groups immediately prior to European colonization. Through study of later
groups it is possible to determine what happened during the contact period as
the social situation changed, as their diet was also altered and as they were
exposed to European diseases. The Mission Santa Maria population is especially
important since these Indians are the direct descendents of a St. Catherines
Island group and were moved to Amelia Island by the Spaniards after St.
Catherines was abandoned. Dr. Larsen has already analyzed comparable St.
Catherines material. This research is important because it shows how human
populations adapt biologically to stresses imposed by changing diet, disease and
social situation. In the Southeast U.S. it is possible to gain some control of
these independent variables through historical records and archaeological
excavation and this provides an excellent context for the skeletal analysis.
Because these skeletons will be reburied it is important to conduct the research
now.
