9803574 Li The objectives of this research are to study the properties of
stochastic processes together with the topological and geometrical properties of
the underlying spaces, and applications of the theory of diffusion processes.
Both finite and infinite dimensional manifolds are to be considered (in
particular path and loop spaces of Riemannian manifolds). Investigations will
concentrate on the following problems: the existence of a (smooth) solution flow
to stochastic differential equations, asymptotics of stochastic dynamical
systems (including moment estimates, almost sure estimates,
recurrence/transience, and stable manifold theory) and integration by parts
formulae in various situations. Special attention will be paid to the dynamics
and geometry of Hamiltonian systems perturbed by white noise. The study of
backward stochastic differential equations and stochastic differential equations
driven by space-time martingales will also be included. The investigator shall
continue her research in stochastic dynamical systems and related topics. The
asymptotics, analytical properties and geometrical properties of solutions of
stochastic differential equations are to be studied together with the geometry
and topology of the underlying spaces. Particular examples of stochastic
differential equations including Hamiltonian systems perturbed by white noise
shall be investigated.
