Exploitation of the century-old Zincke ring-opening reaction of pyridines for
the development of new methods for natural product synthesis is the focus of the
research supported by this grant. Specifically, the proposed research involves
the further development of methods for converting pyridines into other
heterocycles and for generating stereodefined dienes and polycyclic lactams from
the pyridine-ring-opened products, called Zincke aldehydes. Each of these
reaction types is applicable to problems in natural product
synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this CAREER award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor
Christopher Vanderwal of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
California, Irvine. Professor Vanderwal's research focuses on natural product
synthesis and new reaction discovery for applications in the pharmaceutical
field. Professor Vanderwal is also seeking to improve informal and formal
communication skills for graduate students in chemistry. Key aspects of this
program include the introduction of a graduate student hosted seminar series and
graduate-level seminar courses, wherein the students present the lecture
materials to each other.
