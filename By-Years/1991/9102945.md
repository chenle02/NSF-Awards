A new method has been developed to search for an electric-dipole moment of the
electron using atomic cesium, and a factor of twenty improvement has been
realized. With increased cesium density a further order of magnitude is
anticipated, and another order of magnitude will be pursued by use of additional
and improved cesium cells. If successful the project should generate the most
stringent experimental limits on theoretical models that attempt to understand
violations of time-reversal invariance.
