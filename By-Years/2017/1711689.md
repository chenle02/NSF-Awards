Network information theory in the last decade has made strides in characterizing
or approximating the fundamental limits of communication in networks. At the
same time, in the physical layer, developments such as coordinated multipoint
(CoMP) or Cloud Radio Networks (Cloud-RAN) demonstrate an evolution toward
multi-node building blocks. Even so, tools and techniques of information theory
have yet to be fully and gainfully translated to practical coding and modulation
techniques for many multi-node scenarios. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
informed in part by recent developments in information theory indicating that a
multi-level approximation to the physical channel has a capacity that is within
a small SNR-independent gap to the capacity of the physical channel. Supported
by preliminary results, this research is based on the hypothesis that a similar
multi-level decomposition is a sound and fruitful approach for the design of
high-performance coded modulations for multi-terminal networks. Research tasks
investigate the proposed methodology to produce efficient coded modulation
architectures for a variety of multi-terminal networks.
