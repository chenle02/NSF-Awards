Systematic work will be initiated in the diagnostics of swirling liquid spray
flames. To date, the measurement of swirling flows has been performed mostly
with gaseous fuels. Measurement of liquid sprays has been restricted to simple
atomizers spraying liquids into quiescent environments. Detailed data of drop
size, drop velocity, particle number density, and size-velocity correlations
have never been measured in swirling isothermal or combusting liquid sprays. The
objectives are to determine the effect of swirl on the turbulent mixing of
liquid spray particles and their response to the swirling flow, and to determine
the effect of swirl on the formation of the toroidal vortex core and its effect
on the spray. Advanced laser-based diagnostic techniques will be developed
specifically aimed at investigating the properties of liquid sprays in
combusting swirling flows. The dynamics properties of the liquid sprays will be
determined; these are key to flame stabilization and pollutant formation and
will lead to optimization of overall combustion efficiency, with applications to
internal combustion engines, gas turbine, and furnace design.
