9725525 Lee This research investigates ways to promote scientific inquiry with
elementary students from three ethnolinguistic backgrounds. The research centers
on two issues which are investigated with teachers from different linguistic
backgrounds: (1) alternative instructional approaches for student centered,
open-ended exploratory approach in which teachers encourage students to generate
their own questions about natural phenomena and find answers on their own and
(2) teacher-directed approach in which teachers provide students with
instruction to develop skills and concepts as building blocks for further
learning. The study focuses on professional development of teachers through
meetings, extended interventions, and collaborative efforts of teachers. Through
this process, teachers will become instructional leaders. The research will be a
comparative study of 4 intervention conditions. The analysis will include
statistical and qualitative approaches using observation and interviews. -
