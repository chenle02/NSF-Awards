A set of seven proposals and two supplement requests was submitted for
participation in an international marine atmospheric chemistry experiment. The
Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition in the eastern North Atlantic during June
1992, is a multinational effort designed to improve our capability for studying
cloud-chemistry interactions and the air/sea fluxes that affect them. The
specific goals of the MAGE atmospheric chemistry experiment in ASTEX include: 1)
develop and test a Lagrangian strategy for studying chemical and meteorological
evolution in a tagged airmass, using ships, balloons, and aircraft; 2) develop
and test new techniques for estimating trace-gas and aerosol fluxes across the
air/sea interface by comparison with traditional approaches; 3) evaluate the
impact of marine and continental aerosols and the formation and dissipation of
stratocumulus clouds; 4) compare the impacts of natural and anthropogenic
sulfur, halogens, and hydrocarbons on marine aerosol chemistry; and 5) use a
multinational, multi-agency field experiment as a means for addressing
tropospheric chemistry issues. In this MAGE proposal, the PIs plan to conduct
measurements of SO2 and DMS and measurements of DMS fluxes from the ocean
surface to the atmosphere, and to investigate the sources of cloud condensation
nuclei in the cloud-topped marine boundary layer and cloud condensation nucleus
production associated with marine clouds. The proposed measurements will be
obtained from the University of Washington Convair C-131 research aircraft, and
the proposed studies will be closely coordinated with simultaneous studies
(involving shipboard, ground-based, and airborne measurements) of ocean-
atmosphere interactions to be carried out as part of the multi-agency ASTEX
program.
