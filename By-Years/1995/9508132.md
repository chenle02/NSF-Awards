9508132 Bai The PI will perform an experimental study of the mechanical
properties of Mn2GeO4 to determine the contrast in strength between the olivine
and spinel phases of this material, with application to mantle convection. He
will also investigate the influence of water on the rheology of both phases, to
determine potential strength contrasts across the phase transition. Ultimately
he will determine the applicability of his results on analogues to the Earth by
a comparison with samples of natural olivine-spinel deformed in the multi-anvil
cell. ****
