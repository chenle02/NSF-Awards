The PI proposes to collaborate with three field teams to study and create
paintings focused on biodiversity&#8232;in the McMurdo Dry Valleys and Ross Sea.
She proposes to create a series of mural-size paintings based on organisms
native to the Southern Ocean?s sea floor and the soil of the Dry Valleys. The
paintings will explore uniquely adapted Antarctic invertebrates and their
habitats

The PI proposes to explore the benthic communities in the Ross Sea, either
first-hand or through the observations of specimens gathered by scientifc
divers. She proposes, if possible, ?to study, draw, and paint the organisms
while they are still ?alive, flush with natural pigment, and illuminated by the
unique&#8232;blue glow of sunlight filtered through the ice covering the ocean?s
surface.?

Painting en plain air, she also proposes to subsequently work with field teams
to investigate and capture on canvas the complex soil ecosystems of Taylor
Valley. She will observe and paint nematodes, tardigrades, and rotifers
extracted from the soil in and around the Valleys? network of
water&#8232;tracks.
