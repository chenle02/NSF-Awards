The University of Minnesota Duluth particle physics group of Gran and Habig is
participating in Fermilab experiments MINOS+, MINERvA and NOvA, that are
addressing questions of the neutrino mass hierarchy, improved measurements of
the neutrino mass-squared difference and mixing parameters, improved
measurements of neutrino cross sections and studying astrophysical neutrino
sources. The University, an RUI institution, is strategically located close to
the NOvA and MINOS detectors which are located in northern Minnesota. This
affords UMD students an excellent opportunity to participate effectively in the
research program. The broader impacts aspects of the program are extensive, as
the group provides leadership for the education and outreach program of the
Soudan Underground Laboratory in which the MINOS detector is located. This
program engages teachers, students and the public in the northern Minnesota
region in the excitement of forefront research.
