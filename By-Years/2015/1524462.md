Today more people are enjoying streaming services on their mobile devices from
anywhere at anytime. However, receiving streaming services on mobile devices is
fundamentally constrained by the limited battery power supply on a mobile
device. In a streaming session, a large amount of battery power is consumed
continuously for receiving the streaming data via the wireless network card,
decoding the received data with the CPU, and displaying the decoded data on the
screen. Although significant efforts have been made to save the battery power
consumption, the existing streaming practice brings many new complexities due to
the heterogeneity of device hardware, operating systems, and application
algorithms, etc. These complexities lead to degraded energy efficiency.

This project aims to investigate new schemes to facilitate energy-efficient
Internet mobile streaming services at different phases, ranging from the data
receiving to the image displaying. The project addresses the challenges by
mainly looking into the data transmission schedule on mobile devices, studying
codec-aware dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, and devising dynamic content-
adaptive displaying schemes for mobile devices in streaming sessions. The newly
designed schemes can directly help mobile devices significantly improve the
energy efficiency in streaming services. They also have great potentials to save
battery power consumption in other power-hungry mobile applications. The
research outcomes will be integrated into curriculum development and the
participating undergraduate and graduate students will be trained with computer
system research experience as the next generation computer scientists and
engineers.
