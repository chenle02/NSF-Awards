This research addresses several basic features of integer and combinatorial
programming, a theory and methodology with actual and potential applications to
a great variety of real world situations. Polyhedral methods, aimed at
convexifying various nonconvex combinatorial structures have proved themselves
as a successful and promising approach. This research addresses several basic
open questions in polyhedral combinatorics, like: when is a packing or covering
problem solvable by linear programming, which linear inequalities are essential
to the definition of a packing or covering polyhedron, or to that of the
traveling salesman polytope; as well as more immediately practical questions,
like: what is the best formulation of a precedence-constrained traveling
salesman problem or a capacitated vehicle routing problem, which clique problems
are polynomially solvable, what are the most efficient approximation methods for
solving set covering, job shop scheduling, and vehicle routing problems. The
expected results of this project are new, useful insights into the structure of
the problems investigated and more efficient methods for their solution.
