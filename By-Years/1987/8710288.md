Abstract Narrative Phonological theory is an abstract theory of the sound
systems of natural languages. There has been a continuing debate among linguists
for some two decades now as to whether the entities and rules postulated by
phonological theory in order to account for purely linguistic data have any
psychological reality in the mind of the speaker. Since psychological reality
itself is not accessible to direct observation, this is a complicated issue to
test empirically. The project proposed here is a particularly clever and well
thought out series of experiments designed to test empirical predictions of some
specific aspects of phonological theory, based on the elicitation of speech
errors in controlled conditions. Pilot work has suggested the existence of a
surprising asymmetry of error types which, if it holds up under further
investigation, yields strong support to some fundamental assumptions of
phonological theory. The proposed experiments will investigate this phenomenon
in detail. The Principal Investigator is a young scientist whose record is
already one of remarkable productivity. He can be expected to carry out this
interesting project successfully.
