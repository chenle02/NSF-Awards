This project aims to investigate the mathematical foundations of four important
methods in imaging and optics: X-ray crystallography, Cryogenic electron
microscopy (Cryo-EM), ptychography, and ultra-short pulse detection. Although
X-ray crystallography is the prevalent method for determining the 3-dimensional
atomic structure of molecules, the mathematical foundations of this theory are
not fully developed. Cryo-EM is a recent technique in biological imaging where a
sample (typically a protein) is flash-frozen in a liquid solution and then
directed with a low-intensity electron beam. Ptychography is a method of
obtaining a high-resolution image by scanning across a sample with a moving
mask. It can be applied in a number of contexts, including the imaging of live
cells. Ultra-short pulse detection is a key ingredient in time-resolved
ultrafast phenomena such as chemical reactions. This research will create a
unified set of mathematical techniques to understand these methods. The
development of these techniques will have the potential for a myriad of
applications in areas as diverse as biochemistry, medicine, and engineering.
This research will also provide a training opportunity for graduate students.
This research will exploit techniques from invariant theory and algebraic
geometry to build a mathematical framework for four methods in imaging and
optics. X-ray crystallography corresponds to recovering a signal from its power
spectrum. This is arguably the most challenging phase-retrieval problem. The
first project aims to develop rigorous mathematical criteria to determine when a
discrete periodic signal can be recovered from its power spectrum. Because cryo-
EM measurements have a very high noise level, constructing a high-resolution
image requires massive data. The second project will use techniques from
invariant theory to estimate the sample complexity of cryo-EM and related
experiments. Ptychographic measurements can be modeled using the short-time
Fourier transform (STFT). The third project will obtain information-theoretic
bounds on the number of STFT measurements needed for signal recovery. The last
project will focus on the mathematical foundations of a novel technique for
pulse characterization using multi-mode fibers.
