This project is mathematical research in the representation theory of reductive
groups over local fields. Although these groups are totally disconnected, their
study is related to that of Lie groups, the smooth groups of symmetries studied
by many analysts. There is a substantial interface with algebra and number
theory as well. More specifically, the program of Professor Morris is to
investigate the relationship between the harmonic analysis of such a group and
the representations of the Galois group of the algebraic closure of the
underlying field. A major part of this endeavor is to understand the conjectured
correspondence for the supercuspidal representations, and to parametrize them.
