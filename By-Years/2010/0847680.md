The goal of this project is to provide support for query processing in a mobile
P2P database by using a paradigm of data-item store-and-forward. It achieves
this goal by 1) developing a ranking function for data-items that incorporates
factors such as the supply of a data item in the mobile P2P system, its demand
in the system, the size of the data-item, and its reliability; 2) enabling the
query processing system to take advantage of a cellular infrastructure when such
is available; and 3) developing an incentive mechanism that will motivate users
to participate in the query processing system even when they do not have a
personal query to process. The research results will enable discovery of local,
and possibly temporary, resources in many application domains, including social
networks, transportation, mobile electronic commerce, emergency response, and
homeland security. This project supports a Ph.D. student to pursue research in
the area of mobile P2P databases. Publications, technical reports, software, and
experimental data from this research will be disseminated via the project web
site(http://www.cs.uic.edu/~boxu/mobidik).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
