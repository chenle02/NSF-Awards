The principal investigators (PI) will develop a performance methodology for the
access and transport levels of broadband networks. They will consider
Synchronous Transfer Mode (STM) and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks.
STM is multirate circuit switching over high-speed links. The PIs will develop
mathematical tools that parallel and improve on the performance methodology for
classical single-rate circuit switching. In particular, they will explore
algorithms to determine exact and approximate blocking probabilities. In an ATM
network, all information streams are packetized and integrated over common
transmission links and switches. The researchers will consider performance
issues related to resource management, admission control, and routing.
