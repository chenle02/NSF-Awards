ABSTRACT: 9314360, PI-Purdy: This is a technical proposal to replace the
existing 400 Mbyte capacity recording system in the thirty ONR ocean bottom
seismometer instruments with new systems with a capacity in excess of 2
gigabytes. The ONR instruments are operated by Scripps Institution of
Oceanography and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as a facility for the US
academic community. Thus this improved recording capacity can potentially
benefit a wide range of marine seismic experiments.
