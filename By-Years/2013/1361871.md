The research at UTA site of CICI will focus upon soil-structure interaction with
an emphasis on minimizing scour issues using composites and fiber reinforcements
to enhance the tensile strengths of the soils to mitigate shrinkage cracking.
The site will investigate geocomposites in reinforced wall systems in expansive
soil environment. Both mechanical and long term durability issues related to
composite materials will also be explored. Special emphasis will be given to
life-cycle cost analysis and sustainability studies for better understanding of
the benefits of using novel composites, as applied to civil infrastructure
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site at UTA will make effort to involve
underrepresented students of various ethnicity and backgrounds. They will
develop trained workforce in areas related to geosynthetics and geocomposites,
thereby enhancing the global competitiveness of US industry. Research will be
disseminated to the academia, research community and industry through
publications and presentations. The site will develop strategies for evaluating
sustainability and reduction of carbon emissions in air due to the usage of
specific composite materials. Short courses on the applications of composites
and sustainable practices will be offered to educate and train practicing
engineers, construction engineers and agencies. K-12 students will be involved
in the program through summer camps.
