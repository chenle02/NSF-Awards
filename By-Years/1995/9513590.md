9513590 Quail This proposal is focused on the previously cloned transcription
factor, GT-2. The specific objectives are: (a) to perform further detailed
analyses of the functional activities of GT-2, including transcriptional
activation analysis using a transfection assay to define domains of GT-2
involved in transactivation, and a series of biochemical assays to assess
capacity for, and map any domains involved in, multimerization; (b) to undertake
a structural analysis of the previously defined twin minimal DNA-binding domains
of GT-2 using high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for the
purpose of beginning to understand the molecular basis of sequence-specific DNA
recognition by this novel class of transciption factor; and (c) to screen cDNA
libraries for other protein factors that interact with GT-2 using in vitro
interaction cloning and the yeast two hybrid system for the purpose of
approaching the question of the mechanism by which GT-2 enhances transcriptional
activity. %%% Plants respond to light by activating certain genes that govern
growth and differentiation. The mechanism involves a light-activated receptor in
the cell that sends a chemical signal to certain genes that are specifically
light activated including the receptor itself. A protein that binds close to the
DNA that contains the code for the receptor has been discovered. This protein is
unique to plants and has DNA binding regions at both ends. This protein
accelerates the production of the receptor by binding to the DNA and by binding
to other proteins that help produce the message. The research will determine
what parts of the protein are responsible for its ability to accelerate the
production of the message. Also, the structure of the protein will be analyzed
to determine how each segment of the molecule is arranged into a molecular
blueprint. ***
