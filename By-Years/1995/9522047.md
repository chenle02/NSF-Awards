The project focuses on the following crucial areas of large-scale computing and
communication, all of which revolve around issues of Input/Output (I/O)
communication and locality: (a) External memory and I/O performance: The
relative bottleneck in many large scale applications is the I/O communication
between main memory, and external memory and/or other levels of memory. The goal
is to develop an understanding of the limits of I/O systems and to construct
external-memory algorithms that are simultaneously optimal in terms of internal
computation and I/O. (b) TPIE: a Transparent Parallel I/O programming
Environment: A system called TPIE is proposed, consisting of an easy-to-use
object-oriented interface linked to powerful disk and memory management
primitives, to facilitate implementation and evaluation of external- memory
algorithms. (c) Prediction and applications to caching: By contrast, the problem
of cache replacement involves designing an utility (which can be part of an
operating system) to manage the cache memory so that the data requested during
the application algorithm are most often local in the cache, thus avoiding
costly page fetches. ***
