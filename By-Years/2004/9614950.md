In this RUI project funded by Experimental Physical Chemistry in the Chemistry
Division, Prof. Berberian (St. Joseph's College) will study molecular relaxation
in simple glass-forming polar liquids and mixtures using both dielectric and
heat capacity measurements. The two techniques complement each other and will
help understand the interactions involved between components of mixtures of
organic liquids, particularly the relaxation processes. Results of these data
will contribute to explaining the behavior of more complex systems. The work is
to be carried out with the aid of undergraduate assistants, who will benefit by
exposure to modern research equipment and methodology. %%% Some molecules
possess tiny electric dipole moments. By dissolving such molecules in mixtures
of electrically inert species of similar size and shape, and making the solution
part of an electric circuit, it is possible to use variations in current to
study how the surroundings of a molecule influence its rotational motion. This
is important because at low temperatures where the motion becomes extremely
sluggish, detailed understanding of the intermolecular forces is absent. Prof.
Beberian's project in this area will lead to an improved undertanding of this
`glassy` state of matter.
