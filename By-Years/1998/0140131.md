The exciton resonance in semiconductors is often used to demonstrate resonant
phenomena first observed with atoms, such as photon echoes, quantum beats,
vacuum Rabi splitting, and coherent-field Rabi flopping. Nonresonant optical
excitation into the free-carrier continuum produces an entirely different
initial condition, much closer to that of a gas plasma whose electrons and ions
eventually recombine into atoms that emit photons to return to their ground
state. In a semiconductor, the initial plasma consists of free carriers,
electrons and holes, whose kinetic energies depend upon how much the excitation
energy exceeds the band gap. Exciton formation from the free carriers has been
studied for more than four decades, yet little is known. With few exceptions
data have been analyzed assuming that each photon emitted with the energy of the
1s electron/heavy-hole transition must have come from an exciton recombining. A
recent theoretical breakthrough showed that the plasma emission is also peaked
at the 1s resonance. This important finding calls for the reevaluation of all
previous conclusions. &lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to study the dynamics of exciton
formation in a quantum well and to learn how to control the population of the 1s
ground state. The goal of the project is to understand the fundamental
transition from an initially purely fermionic system (free-carrier plasma
generated by optical absorption) to a bosonic system (exciton population). If
the bosonic nature of low-density excitons dominates over the fermionic nature
of its components, as is the case for atoms, then Bose-Einstein condensation
could be achieved in semiconductors at much higher temperatures than those of
atomic systems.&lt;br/&gt;
