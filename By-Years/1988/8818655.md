The New Jersey Marine Sciences Consortium, in conjunction with the New York/New
Jersey Port Authority, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and
the U.S.- Japan Foundation proposes to design, coordinate, execute, and control
an International Symposium on Coastal Ocean Space Utilization. This Conference
will bring together leading ocean experts from science, technology, industry,
and government to consider questions of how to effectively use ocean space. The
Conference will be composed of panels to examine the social and technical
aspects of living and working on and in the ocean. Speakers will be recruited
from at least eight nations. It will be a closed conference limited to about 200
persons brought together for the purpose of interacting and developing new
ideas. Experts will be drawn from science, technology, industry, and government.
Special emphasis will be on the multi-use aspects of the coastal oceans,
avoidance of user conflicts and future technological needs. This symposium will
furnish an International Forum in which consideration of major technical issues
and problems will highlight the most promising research opportunities in the
ocean. Thus, one of the most important products of the Conference will be its
identification and guidance of the most promising ocean engineering research
possibilities.
