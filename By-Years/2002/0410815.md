The investigators will conduct analytical and high-resolution computational
studies of thin current sheets which are formed during the growth phase of
magnetospheric substorms. These current sheets are observed in the magnetotail
and may play an important role in substorm onset. Previous calculations are in
good quantitative accord with multi-satellite observations of the spatial and
temporal characteristics of thin current sheets in the slow growth and impulsive
pre-onset phases of substorms, and have led to the identification of the
pressure-driven ballooning instability as a potential mechanism for substorm
trigger. This investigation will use the theoretical framework of Hall
magnetohydrodynamics, including a generalized Ohm's law with Hall current and
electron pressure gradient terms. Tasks include the development of a more
complete theory of reconnection, thin current sheet and magnetotail substorm
dynamics, and dynamical coupling between pressure-driven ballooning
instabilities with and without velocity shears.
