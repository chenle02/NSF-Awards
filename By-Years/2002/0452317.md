From early childhood throughout early adulthood, individuals are under the
supervision of parents, caregivers, teachers, advisors, and other experts.
Typically, supervisors can influence, at least to some extent, the learning
activities of young people. A basic trade-off emerges in the learning
environments, such that a supervisor may wish to prevent the learner from making
costly mistakes, but in doing so hinder the learning process. This research
project develops a family of formal theoretical models of supervised learning,
and analyzes their predictions. Within these models, key features of successful
adult supervision identified in the child development literature may be
understood as the result of the parent's optimizing behavior. Similarly, the
analysis can shed light on the widely documented variability in parenting
practices across different human societies, as well as across animal species.

Understanding the role of adults as experts supporting children's learning
activities is a long-standing objective in developmental psychology, and the
focus of a sizable experimental and empirical literature. The theoretical
approach pursued in this project complements the mainly experimental and
empirical approaches adopted in the child development literature.
