9419723 TYLER The Acoelomorpha is a group of worms of comparatively simple
structure, and, accordingly, some biologists consider them to represent the most
basic form of all multicellular animals. Acoelomorphs digest their food with a
multinucleate mass of tissue instead of in the lumen or cavity of a gut, and
their nervous system is only loosely organized into concentrations that could be
compared to the brain and nerve cords of other animals. Taxonomists divide the
group into 17 families, largely on the basis of the structure of the
reproductive organs, but have fallen short of explaining how these families
relate to each other or to other animal groups, including other flatworms. To
better understand how these basic animal forms fit into the system of lower
animals, members of the Acoelomorpha and other invertebrates believed to be
related with electron and fluorescence microscopy, specifically looking at the
musculature of the body wall and reproductive organs and the fine structure of
the complexes of glands and sensory organs in the head. The characters discerned
through this examination will then be applied to reconstructing relationships
among acoelomorph families and relationships of acoelomorphs to other lower
invertebrate groups. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand the
causes of the diversity of these lower worms. %%% This study will contribute to
our understanding of the relationships of a very "primitive" or simple group of
animals and will help clarify or explain radiations of many groups in the animal
diversity of the earth. ***
