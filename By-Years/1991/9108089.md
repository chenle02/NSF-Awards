The proposed conference is the second of a planned series on snow engineering
that began in 1988. These meetings provide a forum for engineers, architects,
and scientists to discuss investigative and design methods to mitigate natural
hazards imposed by snow on buildings and other structures. The nature,
distribution, and statistics of snow loads must be better understood to improve
building design criteria and mitigate damage. The conference will attract people
from a wide diversity of backgrounds and provide a unique setting for
interchanging ideas, opinions, and working knowledge of snow engineering. Using
series of plenary sessions, workshops, poster sessions, and panel discussions
participants will discuss field measurements, wind tunnel studies, artificial
environments, analytical methods, snow mechanics, as well as design problems and
building standards/codes. The conference proceedings will contain papers by
invited speakers, workshop position papers, short poster papers, and transcripts
of panel discussions.
