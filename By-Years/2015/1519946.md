The broader commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project is for the early detection of aspergillosis, a severe
fungal infection that most frequently involves the lungs in immune compromised
individuals, typically as a result of cancer chemotherapy or transplantation.
The disease is often misdiagnosed resulting in poor patient outcomes and death.
Early detection is important to initiate therapy and save lives.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project has two objectives: 1. To reconfigure
a non-competitive immunoassay lateral flow device and 2. To develop novel
antibodies that will result in feasibility studies of a point of care device for
the detection of Asgergillus in urine. Successful completion of this project
will result in a Phase II project toward commercialization.
