The four senior investigators coordinate the work of a larger group, currently
nineteen, representing at least a dozen colleges and universities. During the
first year of the project (1991-92), these nineteen met at a workshop at Colgate
to present modules for teaching parallel computing concepts in various courses
in the undergraduate computer science curriculum. These modules are being
revised and edited, and will be distributed for testing in courses in the winter
and spring of 1992. This award will continue this project from 1992 to 1994.
Early in the summer of 1992, a second workshop to discuss teaching experiences
and work on revising modules will be held. The senior investigators will
complete revision and editing of the modules based on the testing experiences.
At the same time, plans for an appropriate channel for distribution will be
formulated. During 1992-93 and in the summer of 1993, the senior investigators
will complete the extension of modules to cover different languages and
hardware, and fill in gaps of coverage revealed by teaching experiences. The
project will be completed with the publication of the modules in 1994.
