Integrating heterogeneous data is a major challenge that manifests itself across
a wide spectrum, from government and business to science and health care. A
critical task underlying this challenge is deriving the relationship between
different database schemas. During the past decade, schema mappings have emerged
as the right tool for this task. Schema mappings are high-level, declarative
specifications of the relationships between two database schemas that provide
the appropriate level of abstraction and, at the same time, can be compiled into
executable code.

The first main aim of this project is to develop a framework and tools for
designing schema mappings. This framework is based on the systematic use of data
examples. The project investigates fundamental algorithmic tasks in using data
examples as a device to illustrate and understand the behavior of already
derived schema mappings, and also as inputs to a schema-mapping design system
that will derive a suitable schema mapping based on the given data examples. The
second main aim is to investigate the uses of schema mappings in integrating and
exchanging inconsistent data that arise when bringing together data from
heterogeneous sources. Since the current framework of data exchange does not
handle inconsistencies well, this project re-examines data exchange and extends
it to gracefully handle inconsistencies.

This project will advance the state of the art in designing schema mappings and
managing inconsistent databases. Furthermore, it will contribute to the
development of human resources in science and engineering through the teaching
and research training of graduate students.
