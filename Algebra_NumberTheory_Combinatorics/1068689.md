The investigator will pursue several lines of research in algebraic geometry
involving the application of combinatorial and nonarchimedean methods to study
algebraic curves and their moduli, plus intersection theory. In particular, this
proposal deals with nonarchimedean approaches to the Gieseker-Petri Theorem and
Maximal Rank Conjectures, the weight filtration on cohomology of moduli of
curves, metric properties of tropicalizations and analytifications, and the
development of a functorial tropicalization of intersection theory.

Algebraic geometry studies solution sets of systems of polynomial equations.
Over a nonarchimedean field, one can split the problem of understanding such a
solution set into two parts. What are the possible valuations of solutions? And
what are the solutions with a given valuation? The set of valuations of
solutions has a rich combinatorial and polyhedral structure, and is the primary
object of study in tropical geometry. Recent developments in this field make it
possible to resolve subtle questions about the geometry of the actual solution
set using the geometry of these sets of valuations. The current proposal aims to
refine these new methods and explore deeper applications to open problems in
algebraic geometry.
