Flanagan High-quality sound pick up in enclosures, such as meeting rooms and
auditoria, is central to effective teleconferencing by large groups separated by
distance. The basic goal of this research is the exploration of the potential of
using sensors in 3D configurations to achieve spatial volume selectivity, and
hence, high quality sound pick up comparable to that enjoyed when the speakers
are face-to-face in the same room. Both beamforming and matched field processing
are being examined, with detailed computer studies preceding measurements, and
experiments in real rooms.
