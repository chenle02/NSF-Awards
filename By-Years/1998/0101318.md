This individual investigator research project includes two research thrusts
related to the properties of unusual ferromagnetic materials in which the
magnetic and electronic properties are strongly coupled. The first research
thrust will be an investigation of phenomena related to phase separation in the
"colossal magnetoresistance" perovskite manganites. Recent experimental and
theoretical work has indicated that intrinsic magnetoelectronic phase separation
is an important element of the physics of these materials, and the research will
investigate resultant novel phenomena. The second research thrust will be an
investigation of the transport and magnetic properties of thin films of
ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As and MnAs. The basic physics of these materials (which
are semiconducting and metallic, respectively) will be probed through magnetic
and magnetotransport studies of the pure materials and heterostructures
incorporating these ferromagnets with other magnetic and non-magnetic materials.
The educational component of the project will involve the dissertation work of
at least one graduate student and the active participation of undergraduates in
the laboratory. These students will acquire knowledge and skills that will be
use in future careers whether in academia, industrial, or government
laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator project
centers on two different research thrusts related to the properties of unusual
magnetic materials which are ferromagnetic, i.e. displaying a macroscopic
magnetic moment. The specific materials studied are of particular interest
because their magnetism is strongly connected to their electronic properties,
and advances in the fundamental understanding of this coupling could potentially
contribute to "spintronic" technological applications which exploit a
combination of magnetic and electronic properties. The first research thrust
will be an investigation of phenomena related to the coexistence of two
different types of magnetic and electronic phases within a class of compounds
known as the "colossal magnetoresistance" perovskite manganites. The second
research thrust will be an investigation of the transport and magnetic
properties of thin films of ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As and MnAs which both can be
grown epitaxially on the commonly used semiconductor GaAs and thus may have more
immediate technological importance. The educational component of the proposed
research will involve the dissertation work of at least one graduate student and
the active participation of undergraduates in the laboratory. The training that
these students obtain will be valuable for future careers in industry,
government, or academia.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
