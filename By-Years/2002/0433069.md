The aim of this project is to integrate satellite and ground-based data with
numerical weather prediction models, hydrological models and neural network
models of precipitation and flooding, in order to develop techniques for
forecasting heavy precipitation and flooding that are tailored to local regions.
The focus regions will be river basins in Appalachia, Nepal, Mozambique and
Brazil where there are significant orographic influences on precipitation. The
project is a collaboration between a hydrologist and a meteorologist and
involves support personnel with expertise in information technology. The work
combines scientific computing and machine learning techniques with meteorology
and hydrology. The forecasting of heavy floods in areas adjacent to mountainous
regions is an important problem in many places around the world. If successful,
the research would develop an approach that could then be adapted to operational
use for such forecasting.
