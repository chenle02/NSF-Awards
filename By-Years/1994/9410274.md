9410274 Odum SGER: Retrospective Analysis of Long Term Ecological Studies: A
Search for Common Denominators in Ecological Theory %%% Using the informational
base of The Institute of Ecology at the University of Georgia, the PI will
examine the monitoring aspects of long term studies and the use of these studies
in discovering and testing ecological principles and developing new models and
theories. The study will address such questions as research productivity, area
oriented versus problem oriented studies, applications to real world problems,
the role of graduate and post graduate students in long term studies, etc. The
study will use four approaches: (1) a survey of published papers; (2) a survey
of knowledgeable scientists in the field; (3) citation analysis; and (4) a
review of positions held and accomplishments of former students associated with
long term projects.%%% %%% The analysis of the role of long term ecological
research in the development of new ecological theory is important to the
historical and scientific development of ecology. This synthetic and integrative
approach will offer new insights into the current status of ecological theory.
