Narrative: This proposal for computer service time deals with a novel
fundamental theory of aerosol collection by porous granular filters. The theory
outlines an explicit and systematic procedure for calculating the filtration
efficiency. This theory is free of any ad hoc assumptions, as well as of the
artificial concept of single-element efficiency implicit in existing theory.
Theoretical calculations of the three global aerosol transport coefficients are
proposed, which are based upon a rigorous application of Taylor-Aris convective-
dispersion theory to a lattice model of a porous filter. These calculations
permit rigorous and systematic study of the dependence of the filtration
efficiency upon the various filtration operating parameters and aerosol
properties. The importance of the proposed theoretical research can be related
to: (i) establishing the limitations of existing filtration theory; (ii)
interpreting experimental data; and (iii) optimal filter design.
