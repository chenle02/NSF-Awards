New materials are being produced which could have an impact on the construction
industry. One such material is a composite of fiber glass and structural
polymers. This project will investigate the strength and structural properties
of a configuration which has possible uses as a bridge deck and other structural
uses. The results of this investigation will have a great impact on structural
applications of the concept.
