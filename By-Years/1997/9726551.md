9726551 Maron In this collaborative research project the investigators address
a central question in ecology, to what extent do consumers control plant
population dynamics? Their field study is directed at determining the conditions
under which insect and mice consumers alter population dynamics of a shrub. The
project will include three separate manipulative field experiments in grasslands
and sand dunes. First, the density of insect herbivores and rodent granivores
will be manipulated in separate plots planted with the target plant. The second
experiment will include plots with different numbers of lupine seeds to
determine how seed bank size affects recruitment of the target plant. The third
experiment will manipulate plant density and below ground insect herbivory to
determine whether competition affects plant tolerance or resistance to
herbivory.
