This is an 18-month planning project to continue the work that has begun on the
ND-CoMSTeP project. The goals of the planning project are to improve the
original ND-CoMSTep project through increased involvement of scientists and
mathematicians in preservice teacher preparation. A two-day summer conference
will be held for North Dakota scientists and mathematicians. Those wishing to
take a more active roll in teacher preparation will be given time at the
conference to develop plans for their own institution. Two other trial
initiatives will be a part of this planning grant. The first of these is the
establishment of three teams, each consisting of a preservice mathematics
teacher and a university mathematician. They will work together to teach a
university calculus class at a local high school. The second initiative involves
undergraduate science majors working for approximately ten hours per week as
teachers' assistants to master teachers at a local junior, or senior, high
school. Each science major will meet with his/her academic science advisor, and
science educator, once every two weeks. These meetings will be an opportunity to
talk about teaching, its rewards, its challenges, and the possibility of
preparing for dual careers in science and science teaching.
