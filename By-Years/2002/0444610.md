0444610&lt;br/&gt;Engel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of
a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS) to conduct multi-element
analyses of geological and biological materials at the University of Oklahoma
(UO). A state-of-the-art SIRMS will replace an eighteen-year-old Finnigan Delta
E that is limited to isotopic analysis of carbon and oxygen in samples prepared
manually, off-line. The new instrument will include a dual inlet and continuous
flow interfaces, high temperature pyrolysis system, H/D collector, and an
automated sample preparation module. The new facility will allow for rapid, high
volume analysis of isotopes of C, O, N, H and S in both organic and inorganic
materials. The SIRMS facility will support faculty and student research on the
Phanerozoic sulfur isotopic history of the oceans, studies of the migratory
pattern and evolution of North American bird taxa from Pleistocene to Recent,
and studies of the evolutionary dynamics of North American vegetative
ecosystems. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
