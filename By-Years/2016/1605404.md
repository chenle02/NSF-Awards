PI: Zaki, Tamer Proposal Number: 1605404

This is a GOALI project that is focused on the computational investigation of
the fundamental interactions between free turbulence and the turbulent boundary
layer. The proposal will employ high fidelity direct numerical simulations and
conditional sampling techniques. The industrial collaborator is at GE, and this
collaboration can lead to a project that will be concerned with flow conditions
that are relevant to practical applications.

The proposed work aims to fill a gap in current understanding and practice of
designing engines with low emission goals. Currently, the design process is
based on correlations that are extracted from studies of flows without
accounting for background disturbances. Often efficiency is sacrificed in favor
of reliability and safety. However, background disturbances can cause
distortions that are not predictable. This GOALI proposal address this gap by
providing the missing fundamental research that will enable more efficient and
reliable designs and, in turn, better engine performance and cleaner operation.
There is also a strong outreach plan that will leverage existing activities at
Johns Hopkins, including activities for K-12 students. The graduate student
involved in this project will benefit from the mentoring of the industrial co-PI
and will spend time at GE.
