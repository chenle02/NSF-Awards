Many phenomena in sciences, specially in mathematics and physics, can be
described by noncommuting variables, that is, the product XY of two variables X
and Y may not equal to the product YX in the opposite order. A noncommutative
algebra is a mathematical concept that encodes such a phenomenon, and the
subject of noncommutative algebra naturally has many applications in quantum
mechanics, quantum field theory, string theory, and so on. The study of
noncommutativity has become more and more common in modern science and
technology. For example, a quantum group is equivalent to a Hopf algebra whose
underlying algebraic structure is noncommutative and/or whose underlying
coalgebraic structure is noncocommutative. The study of noncommutative algebras
is both important and challenging. In many cases, noncommutative algebras arise
as noncommutative analogues and generalizations of classical objects coming from
other fields such as commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and Lie theory. To
understand the structure of noncommutative algebras, the PI will investigate
invariants that are defined by homological means. These invariants capture
hidden structures and symmetries of noncommutative algebras. This research
project combines ideas and methodology from several areas of mathematics such as
algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, linear algebra, homological algebra,
and combinatorics. The proposed research activities will make contributions to
teaching, undergraduate and graduate student training, and outreach. A major
part of the project concerns homological invariants such as Castelnuovo-Mumford
regularity, Tor-regularity, and Artin-Schelter regularity for connected graded
algebras. A weighted version of homological regularities with an extra parameter
will also be introduced that incorporates different classical homological
concepts. This is a new research direction in noncommutative algebra with
connections to representation theory, noncommutative algebraic geometry, and
noncommutative invariant theory. The PI will investigate and prove homological
identities involving these invariants for connected graded algebras and their
associated categories, and thus expand the foundations for this theory. One
particular sub-project is the classification of non-Artin-Schelter regular
algebras that are close to being Artin-Schelter regular. In addition this
project concerns other active research topics in noncommutative algebra: the
automorphism problem, the cancellation problem, operad theory, and
noncommutative discriminants.
