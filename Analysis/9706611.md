Iwaniec ABSTRACT Iwaniec will pursue questions about quasiregular mappings which
arise as generalizations of geometric aspects of analytic functions of one
complex variable. The mappings in question solve important first order systems
of PDEs analogous in many respects to the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The
solutions of these systems can be viewed as "absolute" minimizers of certain
energy functionals. It is striking how tight the connection is between
quasiregular mappings and the recent development of the nonlinear elasticity
theory whose mathematical principles were already formulated by S.S. Antman and
J. Ball in 1976-77. Roughly speaking, the theory of elasticity studies mappings,
referred to as deformations of elastic bodies, which minimize the so-called
stored energy functionals. These functionals are not always convex and the
deformations need not be quasiconformal but the governing PDEs are much the
same. The Jacobian determinant, in particular, has been subjected to a great
deal of investigation. Ths project accounts for this study together with some
generalizations concerning wedge products of closed differential forms.
Quasiconformal mappings generalize to higher dimensions the concept of analytic
functions that is so fruitful for science and engineering in two space
dimensions. Trying to extend this theory to three or more space dimensions
proved quite difficult and the mathematics of such extension is being developed
now. Iwaniec will work on how to extend familiar concepts in the plane, like
degree, to similar concepts in space. The theory of non linear elasticity, among
others, will benefit from this developments.
