This project builds on an established state-of-the-art in electromagnetic
geotomography used for imaging buried geo- structures in mining, exploration,
geotechnology, security, and environmental waste management applications. The
study focuses on specific multidimensional signal-processing issues in the
reconstruction of images from through-rock electromagnetic transmission
measurements, and covers image fidelity quantification, tomography algorithms
for combined attenuation- phase-frequency measurement data, and space sampling
strategies in site surveying and in image construction.
