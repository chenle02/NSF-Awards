9603310 Foster This award supports a three-year collaborative research project
between Professor Douglas Foster, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and
Professor Kei-ichiro Maeda, Nagoya University in Japan. The researchers will
undertake studies of the metabolic control of the reproductive system by the
brain: signals, sensors and pathways. The goal of the project is to unravel how
metabolic signals reflecting energy state are sensed centrally or peripherally
and routed through neural pathways in the brain to regulate the specialized
neurons which secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone, the neuropeptide that
controls the entire reproductive system. This collaborative research is being
driven by fundamental questions relating to nutrition, growth, and reproductive
activity. The research may lead to determination of the sensors and pathways by
which glucose and Leptin regulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion
during development and adulthood. Through the exchange of ideas and technology,
this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international
understanding and cooperation. ***
