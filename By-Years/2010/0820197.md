Numerical information is ubiquitous in decisions, both big and small (how many
minutes to drive to the grocery, mortgages, credit-card debt, medical
treatments, environmental risks). High quality data (e.g., complex data
concerning natural hazards, health treatments, and financial options) are
increasingly available to experts and the public. To a degree never before
possible, individuals are in a position to understand risks, and, in the
process, increase control over their lives. Policy makers and others generally
assume that, if provided appropriate numbers, people will understand and use
them, but having access to information is only the first step to making good
decisions. Individuals may lack the skills, knowledge, or motivation to access
credible sources, process information, and make informed choices. As a result,
the same data may not be understood or used in the same way by all users.
Previous research, in fact, has shown that individuals low and high in numeracy
(abilities with mathematical and probabilistic concepts) rely on different
sources of information in decision making, and that those lower in numeracy
comprehend less and may make poorer decisions when numbers are involved. Numbers
are used (and not used) in some surprising ways in decision making. Using
behavioral methods (including reaction time, judgment, and choice) modified from
previous literatures, this project involves conduct of experiments to test the
relations between numeracy and intuitive representations of numbers and to test
their separable influences in a variety of decision contexts.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research may add substantially to our understanding
of the psychological mechanisms underlying decisions that involve numeric
information. It will also add to the growing body of knowledge concerning how
intuitive and deliberative ways of thinking interact and influence how numeric
information is processed in decision making.
