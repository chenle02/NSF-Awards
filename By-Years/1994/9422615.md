9422615 Thompson The phloem tissue plays a central role in the long-distance
transport of carbohydrates, hormones, amino acids, and other organic compounds
that are essential for plant growth. A further understanding of the molecular
basis for the structural and physiological changes that occur during phloem
differentiation will provide a basis for the development of innovative methods
to improve plant growth and productivity. P-proteins are an intergral component
of sieve elements in most plants, however the significance of these proteins in
phloem development and function has not been experimentally tested. The ultimate
goal of this proposed project is to determine the role(s) of two P- proteins,
PP1 and PP2, in phloem physiology. Dr. Thompson will test the hypotheqis that
P-protein filaments plug wounded sieve elements maintaining turgor within the
sieve tube to preserve the functional integrity of the phloem. The proposed
experiments are also designed to evaluate physiological roles for P-proteins
during phloem differentiation in unwounded plants.
