This project integrates and summarizes research that has compared men and women
who are leaders or managers. Using quantitative methods known as meta-analysis,
these reviews represent each study's findings numerically (by means of a
statistic called an effect size). Statistical analyses are then performed on
these numbers. This project thus uses statistically correct methods for drawing
conclusions from research rather than the informal rules-of-thumb that reviewers
traditionally used. One meta-analysis examines studies that compared women's and
men's effectiveness as leaders. The second meta-analysis examines studies in
which the sex of leaders was varied while constraining their behavior to be
equivalent. These studies address the issue of whether male and female leaders
are perceived differently even when their behavior is the same. These reviews
complement two other meta-analyses being carried out by the principal
investigator. One of these other meta- analyses examines sex differences in
leadership style and the other examines sex differences in the tendency to
emerge as a leader in initially leaderless groups. These four meta-analyses
provide an exhaustive survey of leadership research that has compared the sexes.
This project will summarize the findings of hundreds of leadership studies and
provide empirically-grounded generalizations about male and female leadership
behavior and its effects. The project also has general implications for
understanding sex differences in social behavior. These implications stem from
the fact that leadership research provides the only major body of studies in
which female and male behavior has been compared in organizational settings as
well as laboratory experimental settings. A better understanding of sex
differences in leadership is essential in light of recent and continuing
demographic trends in organizational leadership.
