0124494 Snyder

This award will support Michael Snyder and colleagues at the American
Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to travel to Seoul, Korea for
a feasibility study aimed at developing plans for the pilot program of an
international science and engineering youth summer camp in South Korea. AAAS
will work with the Korea Science Foundation and the Korea-US Science Cooperation
Center in developing their plans. The primary objective of the study is to
explore the possibilities of giving American youth with demonstrated interest in
science and technology a hands-on research and educational experience in an
international context.
