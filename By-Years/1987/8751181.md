This project consists of two interrelated parts. Four teleconferences on
problem solving in mathematics appropriate for secondary teachers will be
produced. These will be coordinated with a set of four problem solving modules.
The effect of this technological mode of delivery on the mathematics problem
solving ability and awareness of preservice mathematics teachers in Oklahoma
will be evaluated. Comparisons will be made among teachers who participate in
the teleconferences and use the modules, teachers who use the modules only, and
teachers have access to neither the teleconferences nor the modules. Because the
preservice teachers in Oklahoma spend one full year as first year teachers in
schools before they are certified, results of the research study can be
generalized to novice teachers in other geographic areas. This project focuses
on two very important facets of teacher education. An area of great concern in
mathematics education is the teaching of problem solving at every level in the
curriculum. The products from this project will be four video cassettes from the
teleconferences that can be used for both preservice and inservice instruction
on problem solving. These video cassettes will capture on film, techniques for
teaching problem solving, as well as making available to a large audience of
prospective teachers and teachers, experts' views on this subject. This in
itself might have been a sufficient reason for funding in the Teacher
Preparation Program. However, in addition, this project will provide information
about the use of teleconferencing as a delivery system for preservice and
inservice instruction on a complex topic for which there is great need. Because
it is impossible to provide quality inservice instruction for all teachers in
the country in workshop settings, especially in geographic areas where the
population is sparce, the teleconference may be an appropriate manner of
updating teachers' backgrounds. This project will provide evidence for the
desirability of the use of teleconferences in working with teachers. If it is
found to be appropriate, it could reform the mode of delivery of mathematics
education inservice instruction throughout the country.
