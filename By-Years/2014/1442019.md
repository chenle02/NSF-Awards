This award provides partial support for graduate students, post-doctoral
researchers, and junior faculty to attend the 2014 Gordon Research Conference on
Research at High Pressure to be held June 22 ? 27, 2014. This conference has
been held for more than 50 years and owes it continued success to the active and
diverse nature of scientific research that employs high pressures. This
conference attracts leading researchers in physics, chemistry, materials and
geo-sciences, as well as biology, who use and develop methods for the study of
matter at extreme conditions. Invited talks at this year's conference will cover
all of these topics and include the very latest advances in methods for
predicting structures and properties of materials at very high pressures to
practical chemistry applications at very moderate pressures. The conference
places a special emphasis on providing an environment for interactions of young
researchers with the leading experts in high pressure research.
