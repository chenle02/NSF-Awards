Four six-day workshops for 20 undergraduate general chemistry teachers each,
will introduce participants to the LIMSport program, a cost-effective
implementation of computer data acquisition and reduction in the laboratory.
LIMSport allows direct data acquisition into a spreadsheet. Since standard
hardware and software (Lotus 1-2-3) are used, both the program and the
individual student experiments are easily shared. Faculty will have hands-on
experience with interfacing and an opportunity to adapt laboratory experiments
to the LIMSport format.
