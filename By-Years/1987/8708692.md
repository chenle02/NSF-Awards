This proposal seeks to provide a solution to a major obstacle in commercial
scale operations of mammalian cell bioreactors, i.e. shear stress-induced cell
detachment. Specific objectives of the proposal are to: - Determine the role of
an adhesive glycoprotein (von Willebrand factor(vWF)) in the resistance to shear
stress-induced detachment of anchorage-dependent mammalian cells. - Determine if
and how shear stress itself may enhance such resistance to detachment. By using
a previously developed flow apparatus for subjecting cells to shear, the PI
proposes to determine the critical shear stress for cell detachment. To test the
hypothesis that secretion of vWF increases resistance to detachment, the PI will
compare the critical shear stress for detachment of genetically engineered
Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells that express vWF to wild-type CHO cells which
do not express vWF. To address the second objective, the PI proposes to
investigate if shear stress stimulates the synthesis of vWF and another
glycoprotein, fibronectrin. The production and secretion of these glycoproteins
is to be measured using quantitative immunofluorescence. The PI is considered to
be well qualified to carry out the proposed research and I recommend funding of
this proposal.
