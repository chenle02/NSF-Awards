This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to improve data
mining technologies for location analytics. This project will focus on the
analysis of semi-continuous GPS and/or WiFi-based location data generated by
consumer mobile devices. The anticipated improvements would allow consumer
insights professionals and advertising effectiveness researchers to better
detect emergent patterns and to draw stronger inferences about consumer
behaviors, preferences, and lifestyle attributes. The enhanced data mining
system would utilize state-of-the-art pattern recognition and machine learning
techniques to dynamically process and interpret location and other types of
data. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in location
analytics.

This research has the potential to meet the need of consumer insights
professionals to better understand how consumers behave, without the use of
lengthy surveys. In a broader sense, this research aims to accelerate progress
in the emerging field of location analytics. This research can lead to the
creation of a location analytics dashboard, similar to existing dashboards for
web analytics. Most web analytics dashboards measure metrics such as site
visits, page views and time spent for given online properties; analogously, the
location analytics dashboard would measure visits by real consumers to physical
locations. Such a location analytics dashboard could be offered on a
subscription basis to companies that depend on consumer behaviors in the
physical world ? including retailers, hotel/resort chains, restaurants, and
travel companies. Such a dashboard would address a broad range of market
research opportunities, from shopper loyalty research to store sitting to
marketing effectiveness measurement. Additional future impacts of the proposed
effort include the ability to integrate location analytics data into Geographic
Information Systems for improved public safety, municipal planning and transit
systems design.
