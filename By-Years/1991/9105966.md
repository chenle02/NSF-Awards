This award provides partial funding for a technical position in the Department
of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Wisconsin. The funds will be used
to support a technician who will assist in the operation of the Department's
Radiogenic Isotope Laboratory. The Radiogenic Isotope Laboratory at Wisconsin
provides isotope analysis for a group of active researchers in the Department of
Geology and Geophysics as well as off-campus collaborators. The laboratory's
capabilities include strontium, neodymium, hafnium and lead isotopes, all
important systems in the interpretation of geologic processes.
