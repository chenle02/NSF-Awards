Electric machines consume nearly 2/3 of global electrical energy, and produce
nearly 100% of electricity. Innovations in this field have a fundamental impact
on global economies and energy consumption, and are essential in the transition
to sustainability. IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference
(IEMDC) is the leading conference in this field and will take place during May
12-15, 2013 at the Westin O'Hare (Rosemont) hotel in the Chicago area. Four IEEE
Societies are co-sponsors of this conference: Power Electronics Society (PELS);
Power and Energy Society (PES); Industry Application Society (IAS); Industrial
Electronics Society (IES). Travel support for electrical engineering students,
with first priority given to third year undergraduates is planned.
