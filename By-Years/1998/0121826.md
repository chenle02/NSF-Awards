ABSTRACT

Tapestry of Times Past A Paleontological Portal for North America

David Lindberg EAR-0102826

The University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) will host a meeting
of representatives of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, the
Paleontological Society, and the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) in order
to plan the development of a paleontology portal for North America based upon
the color-coded geologic map developed by the USGS. Using web-based technology
and relational databases, the map and its associated stratigraphic column can be
made interactive, allowing access to information about particular geographic
regions, geologic time periods and environmental depositions - the flora and
fauna, major events, fossil evidence, etc. This portal will be enhanced by links
developed by individual museums and institutions, specific to particular
geographic regions and/or time periods. Because it is dynamic, the map becomes a
scalable portal for all current exhibits (both real and virtual) as well as
those yet to be developed.

Such a paleontology portal will provide personalized access to researchers,
teachers, and to the inquisitive learner. Consider the following scenarios: A
researcher clicks on a section of the Permian in Texas to learn about current
research efforts related to Permian exposures in that state. A middle school
class in Florida uses the maps to construct and test hypotheses as to why most
dinosaur fossils are found in the Midwest rather than Florida. A user clicks on
the map and finds himself in the Devonian of New York. Besides the generalized
information of the time period, the local site link is to the Geologic History
of the State of New York, a project of the Paleontological Research Institute.

This project provides a unique opportunity for paleontological societies to come
together for a unified purpose-the sharing of their research with the public.
The portal becomes a single entry point into the paleontological history of the
United States - the flora and fauna, the events, the processes at work. It will
facilitate and integrate an exploration through geologic time and geographic
location.
