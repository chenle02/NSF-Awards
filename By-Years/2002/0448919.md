0448919&lt;br/&gt;Shvartsman &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work aims to
examine the fundamental mechanisms of cell communication and tissue development
using the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a model network and
Drosophila as the model organism. Using mathematical modeling, genetic
experiments, and genomic analyses, the Principal Investigator will quantify the
spatial gradient of EGFR activation in vivo, characterize the genome-wide
transcriptional response to this gradient, and analyze how it is modulated by
feedback loops. Such work generally aims at elucidating how biological systems
construct ordered structures using chemical and physical signals. The work is
applicable to embryo development and tissue regeneration. An innovative
undergraduate course entitled "Patterns of Biological Design" will be developed.
This course will cover how key engineering concepts (e.g., feedback, redundancy,
robustness) manifest in biological and more traditional chemical and electrical
systems. An exchange program with the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez will
also be established.&lt;br/&gt;
