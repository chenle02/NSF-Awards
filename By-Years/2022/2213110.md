The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a voice-based telehealth interface deployed
on mobile devices for symptom monitoring and screening for respiratory diseases.
This technology may improve the quality of respiratory care and could prevent
costly hospitalizations by delivering monitoring and exacerbation warnings to
healthcare providers and patients. Chronic and acute respiratory diseases affect
over 70 million Americans and 1 billion people globally. This technology may
help improve patient outcomes and save on patient care costs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will further develop the existing
Chronic Obstructive Respiratory Disease (COPD) Early Exacerbation warning system
to measure the earliest deterioration in a patientâ€™s respiratory system through
voice and breath data captured through mobile phones. The research objectives
include (1) productizing lung function measurement by improving algorithms for
measuring lung function in varied real-world environments and on datasets
reflective of the target population of patients with respiratory conditions in
the US; (2) productizing exacerbation prediction by further training the proof-
of-concept algorithm with true respiratory exacerbations resulting in
hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and prescription of new or
increased medication and treatments; (3) developing and launching a direct-to-
patient product with the goals of learning how to most effectively engage the
patient to drive usage, communicating effectively with the patient, and bridging
the gap between patient and provider to provide timely and effective
interventions; and (4) exploring additional use cases by testing products with
patients who suffer from varied lung diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
