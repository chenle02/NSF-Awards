9414936 Many problems in science and engineering involve the determination of
the properties inside an object from indirect measurements. Examples include
finding cracks of defects inside solid metal objects and medical imaging.
Mathematically, these problems are often formulated as inverse problems for
partial differential equations. In such a problem, one determines an unknown
coefficient in an equation from (partial)knowledge of the solutions. The
proposers will hold a week long conference devoted to the mathematical theory of
inverse problems for partial differential equations. The conference will take
place at the University of Kentucky. The main activity of this conference will
be a series of ten lectures given by Gunther Uhlmann of the University of
Washington. These lectures will serve to introduce mathematicians to current
research in this field.
