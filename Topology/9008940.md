The funds awarded to this proposal will partially defray the travel and living
expenses for some of the American mathematicians who will attend the
International Symposium on Algebraic Topology. The Symposium will be held at
Manchester University in Manchester, England from July 1 through July 15, 1990.
It is assumed that the Symposium will be attended by the vast majority of the
top algebraic topologists from around the world. The topics of the Symposium are
stable homotopy theory, applications of homological algebra to homotopy theory,
the homotopy theory of classifying spaces, and equivariant homotopy theory. Some
of the funds will be used to help send new Ph.D.'s in algebraic topology to the
Symposium.
