Abstract 0811628

Cheyney University of Pennsylvania is implementing Inquiry-Discovery based
instruction throughout the chemistry and biology curricula. Most importantly,
the incorporation of research equipment ?- an Atomic Absorption Spectrometer
(AAS), a High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC), a Gas Chromatograph-Mass
Spectrometer (GC-MS) and a microwave-assisted synthesis device (the Discover Lab
Mate) -- completes our inventory of equipment needed to fulfill the requirements
by the American Chemical Society (ACS) for an approved and accredited chemistry
program. A strong Inquiry-Discovery based curricula in chemistry and biology,
coupled with an ACS approved chemistry program, provides a good recruitment tool
for the Science and Allied Health department, while helping to train current
students in the use of modern instrumentation needed for a competitive edge in
the workforce and in graduate school. Further, faculty research capabilities are
enhanced, leading to more valuable contributions by the faculty with its
collaborative partners, both local and regional industries, as well as other
academic departments located throughout Pennsylvania.
