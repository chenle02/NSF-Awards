The project will focus on understanding and predicting the qualitative behavior
of large systems of interacting particles or waves. This is a problem of
fundamental importance in mathematical physics, with a wide range of
applications: from gas and galactic dynamics to social networks, and from solid
state physics and plasma theory to water waves and oceanography. With the size
of the systems of interacting particles or waves being large, a deterministic
description of their behavior is not feasible, and it is necessary to resort,
via a branch of mathematics called kinetic theory, to an averaging description.
In this context, the investigator aims to develop analytical and computational
tools to describe the properties of such systems by means of averaging
quantities and provide a statistically accurate prediction of their evolution in
time. The project will offer training and mentoring opportunities for
undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The idea behind
kinetic theory is to identify macroscopic properties of a large system and to
study their asymptotic behavior as the size of the system tends to infinity,
with the intent of finding limiting effective equations, which in turn will
reveal properties observed in a system of large but finite size. In the case of
interacting particles, this is achieved by the Boltzmann equation, in wave
turbulence theory by the wave kinetic equation. This project will expand this
program to include: the derivation and analysis of kinetic equations for
phenomena not covered by Boltzmann equation, for instance multiple particle
interactions in non-ideal gases or mixture of gases, the derivation of wave
kinetic equations in the inhomogeneous setting, as well addressing the question
of local and global well-posedness in wave turbulence
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
