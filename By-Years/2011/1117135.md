Every aspect of parallel software development is more complicated than for
serial programs. This research focuses on one of the primary sources of
complexity: intra-application communication. Currently it is a programmer's
responsibility to find an efficient mapping of their application's communication
patterns onto the communication infrastructure of the target system. This
research flips that responsibility by developing a flexible communication
architecture and associated tools and algorithms that allow the target platform
to be specialized for a particular application, rather than vice versa. In
addition to reducing the programmer's burden, specialization has the potential
to improve communication efficiency while the automated techniques can increase
portability.

This research poses questions whose answers have consequences at several levels
of the traditional system stack: Can programmers be freed from hardware-specific
optimization of communication without degrading performance? What abstractions
are needed to allow hardware to adapt to the programmer, rather than the other
way around? Can communication efficiency be improved when running on an
application-specific communication platform? The project answers these questions
by exploring abstractions and algorithms to profile a parallel program's
communication, synthesize a custom network design, and implement it in a
configurable network architecture substrate. The research methods center around
the X10 language, and include compiler instrumentation passes, offline
communication profile analyses, development of a portable network intermediate
representation, and network place and route software algorithms.
