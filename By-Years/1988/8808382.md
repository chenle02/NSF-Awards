This is a three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in modern
mathematical analysis between Naza Tanovic-Miller of the University of Sarajevo
and Martin Buntinas of the Loyola University of Chicago. The investigators will
study the connections between problems in Fourier analysis, summability theory
and the theory of topological sequence spaces. These areas contribute to the
interpretation, mathematical formulation and understanding of physical
phenomena. This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on
Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a joint fund
consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The
U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds
are involved. The grants are composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to
the principal Yugoslav institute. Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to
Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists' living
expenses in the U.S.
