One of the biggest scientific problems of the past 50 years is how a protein
folds into a stable 3-dimensional conformation critical for its function in the
cell. While the process should be predictable from just the sequence of amino
acids, one is still unable to make such a prediction. The most successful models
of protein folding have been simple two- or three-state models. However, recent
results from the PI's lab as well as others have shown these simple models to
fail when examining fast folding kinetics in a variety of systems. The objective
of this project is to further these preliminary studies by investigating
different aspects of complexity in folding proteins using a variety of
spectroscopic probes and state-of-the-art ultrarapid mixers. The experimental
results will be compared with simulation results from various computational
biology labs. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a theory which
can predict the process solely from the amino acid sequence. By coupling theory
and experiment on the microsecond timescale and considering the impact of
complexity, this project will significantly advance the field of protein folding
towards the long-term goal.

Broader Impacts: This project encompasses aspects of structural biology,
computation biology, optical spectroscopy and polymer physics. Therefore the
students involved in this work will require cross-disciplinary training to
accomplish the scientific goals. As part of a new graduate program in
Quantitative Biology at MSU, the PI has designed new lecture and laboratory
courses to introduce physical science students to biology and biology students
to quantitative methods. These courses continue to evolve and the PI will also
develop a course aimed at undergraduates in the life sciences to take a more
quantitative approach to biology.
