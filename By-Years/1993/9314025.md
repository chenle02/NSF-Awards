9314025 Halperin Technical Abstract: The project employs nuclear magnetic
resonance to investigate the superfluid phases of 3He. The research involves
high precision measurements of the magnetic moment of the helium in the A and B
phases, as well as determination of the contribution of the dipole-dipole
coupling energies to the superfluid free energy. The novel dilute mixtures of
4He in 4He, found only in constrained geometries of aerogels will also be
investigated to characterize the miscibility gap in these systems and to
investigate diffusion and relaxation phenomena in these new materials. The NMR
studies of molecular organic solids will focus on fundamental questions
concerning the origin of the metallic state in these quasi-one- dimensional
solids. The experiments will involve ultralow temperatures and high magnetic
fields. Non-technical abstract: The research project employs low temperature
nuclear magnetic resonance to study the behavior of superfluid phases of 3He.
These systems display unusual quantum effects at very low temperatures. The
information obtained in these superfluid systems is of fundamental interest, and
also is of interest in connection with other Fermi liquid systems, such as the
high temperature superconductors. Another part of the project involves studies
of thin films of dilute 4He in 3He constrained in the diaphanous, ultrahigh
surface area aerogel materials. The research will provide information about
surface interactions in these materials, as well as providing fundamental
information about phase behavior such as miscibility of the two isotopes of
helium. Finally, the project includes NMR studies of high purity molecular
organic solids which display metallic character with the conductivity having a
quasi-one-dimensional anisotropy. Here the focus is on fundamental aspects of
the phase transition from an insulating to conducting state. ***
