The Department of Mathematics at Vanderbilt University will purchase a graphics
workstation, which will be dedicated to support research in the mathematical
sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in
particular: A) Modelling of Pressure Preset Ventilation (Philip Crooke), B)
Applications of Fractal Interpolation Surfaces to Computer Graphics and Image
Processing (Douglas Hardin), C) Applications of Splines to Surface Fitting and
Image Compression (Larry L. Schumaker). D) Numerical Studies of Invariant
Manifolds and Solutions for Monotone Dynamical Systems (Peter Takac), and E)
Mathematical Models of Cell Population Dynamics (Glenn Webb).
