The object of this proposal is to explore the feasibility of controlling various
modes of a structure under seismic loading through the installation of various
groups of tuned mass dampers with the frequency range of each group distributed
around a different modal frequency. The proposed scheme is called multiple
distributed tuned mass damper (MDTMD). A MDTMD could combine the robustness and
efficiency already demonstrated for single mode distributed TMD (in general
referred to as multiple TMD, or MTMD), with the efficacy of highly damped and
high mass devices proposed for some single TMD.&lt;br/&gt;The exploratory study
will proceed in stages. First, some analytical studies reported in the
literature will be simulated experimentally, on a shake table. The aim is to
better understand why different studies yielded inconclusive results. Second,
one optimization criteria already developed in the literature for single TMD
will be extended to the case of a single distributed TMD (controlling one mode),
and then to the case of a MDTMD controlling several modes. One benchmark case
study, available to the seismic engineering research community, will be
retrofitted with the MDTMD. Simple analytical and laboratory tests will be
carried out on the reduced scale model to verify the potential effectiveness of
the dampers. The aim is to explore the feasibility of the MDTMD for controlling
multi-modal response for earthquake excitation.&lt;br/&gt;Significance and
impact of the project. This exploratory work should advance the understanding of
an important passive control device, and indicate whether or not TMD have the
potential to be used for multi-modal control. If the answer in the exploratory
study is positive, a more in depth research effort will be proposed. The
expected outcome of the research will be a versatile, robust, and efficient
methodology for vibration control of structures. The research will also provide
much needed experimental data regarding the behavior of TMD subjected to ground
excitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
