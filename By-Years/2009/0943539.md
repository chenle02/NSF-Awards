This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Roger Revelle, a 273? general purpose Global vessel; the R/V Melville, a
279?general purpose Global vessel; the R/V New Horizon, a 170?, general purpose,
Intermediate vessel and the R/V Sproul, a 125? general purpose Regional vessel.
All four vessels are operated by Scripps Institute of Oceanography as part of
the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.
The request includes four items listed by priority:

1) Vector M5 ROV 2) RDI 75 kHz Ocean Surveyor 3) GeoEel Tow Leader 4) EM120 to
EM122 Upgrade

Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
