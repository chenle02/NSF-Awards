9311608 Walser The study of the magnitude and relaxation time of the optical
nonlinear response of organic materials is essential for two reasons: to
determine the suitability of the optical nonlinearities for potential
applications, and to provide basic knowledge concerning the mechanisms of the
nonlinear optical response. Conjugated organic systems with large and fast
nonlinear coefficients have recently attracted to interest of the electrical
engineering community because of their potential applications in
optoelectronics, phase conjugation, dynamic holography and optical computing.
