Certain Fourier integral operators which are not associated with local
canonical graphs arise naturally in harmonic analysis, integral geometry and
partial differential equations. This project will formulate classes of canonical
relations and find composition calculi and sharp estimates for Fourier integral
operators associated with these classes. The simplest example arises when one
seeks to determine whether the composition of operators is again a Fourier
integral operator without the transverse intersection hypothesis of Hormander or
the clean intersection calculus developed by Duistermaat and Guillemin. In
particular work will be done on the case of degenerate operators. Emphasis will
be placed on those modelled on oscillatory integrals with cubic degeneracies in
the phase with the goal of obtaining estimates and composition properties.
Applications include estimates and nonlocal inversion formulae for restricted
two-plane (and, possibly, k-plane) transforms. In connection with classes of
generalized Fourier integral distributions associated with singular Lagrangians,
the backscattering by a singular conformal metric on real n-dimensional space
will be analyzed. The underlying objectives of this research are to understand
complex differential and integral operators through fundamental techniques of
inversion plus decomposition. The work combines powerful abstract methods in
analysis and geometry to develop underlying structures within which properties
of the operator scan be established.
