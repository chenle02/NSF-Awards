This year-long project will provide an ethnographic alternative to understanding
human rights through the dominant universalist/cultural relativist paradigm. Set
in Thailand, it will build on six months of preliminary fieldwork and language
training in Bangkok in 2002 and 2003, and take the National Human Rights
Commission, the Health System Reform Organization, and the Community Development
Department, Ministry of the Interior, as its primary sites. It will employ
interviews to collect professional biographies of NGO leaders in order to study
the intersection of personal biographies and institutional histories in new
social movements, participant observation to learn about the everyday
functioning and institutional protocols of the NHRC and HSRO, and archival
research to track the development and crafting of specific human rights cases.
