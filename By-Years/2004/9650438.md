The interest and focus of this project is in developing and teaching a
3-credit-hour, 1-semester, molecular modeling computational chemistry course for
senior undergraduate chemistry majors. The new modeling course replaces an
existing undergraduate course that emphasized chemical calculations using
FORTRAN. The availability of excellent, inexpensive, and interactive
computational and modeling software, along with the need to modernize the
undergraduate course offerings, alleviates the need for this particular FORTRAN-
based course. Now there is no outstanding reason to exclude undergraduates in
the chemistry program from this type of pedagogy which emphasizes training in
computational, electronic, and vibrational structure, calculations ranging from
molecular mechanics to semi-empirical to ab-initio methods. Such a modeling
course has never been taught.
