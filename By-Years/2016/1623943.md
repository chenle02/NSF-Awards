CBET - 1623943&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jaeger, Heinrich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
will support participation of scientists and engineers at the American Institute
of Chemical Engineers Particle Technology Forum, which will be held April 11-13,
2016 in Houston, TX. The goal of the forum is to enhance progress in
understanding particle attrition, which refers to the wear and breakdown of
particles in granular materials. The forum will focus on ways to mitigate
particle attrition in bench-scale and commercial processes and on potential
applications of attrition. The forum will have a balance of speakers from
academia and industry and will be organized to promote connections between
academic investigators and their industrial counterparts. Support will be
provided to emerging scientists, including students, post-docs, and junior
faculty, especially those from underrepresented groups, to help increase their
participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Session topics will focus at the interface
of research and industrial practice and will include particle attrition in
industrial processes, improving models of particle attrition, breakages of
agglomerates, attrition in pharmaceutical manufacturing, fundamentals of
particle breakage mechanisms, and scale-up and industrial best practices.
Results of the forum will help improve understanding of particle attrition,
which will lead to greater process efficiencies, reduced costs, and to potential
new applications of attrition. Encouraging the engagement of young investigators
will fill a national need to continue to train the future work force in the
science of particle technology and expose the next generation of researchers to
the problems and questions that arise in this area.
