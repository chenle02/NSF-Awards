This is a project in syntactic theory, the branch of linguistics which studies
the properties of grammatical systems, and aims to construct a forrnal model of
grammar which is common to and accurate for all natural languages. The focus of
this particular project is on a class of constraints on syntactic rules, a set
of conditions which limit the contexts in which certain rules may apply. On the
basis of the relevant literature and their own prior research, the investigators
have developed a hypothesis which relates a constraint on the applicability of
certain "extraction" rules, i.e. grammatical rules which move a constituent from
one part of a sentence structure to another, to patterns of constituent
structure in the locus from which the constituent is to be extracted. The
structures which block an extraction are called "selective islands". The
blockage is illustrated by pairs of example sentences like: Who was Bill sorry
they hired? *Who was Bill sorry hired them? The first sentence is ordinary; the
second one clearly has something wrong with it (which is indicated by the
asterisk preceding it). These principles apply across a wide variety of
grammatical constructions, which indicates that they have a role in the basic
theory of grammar. The project will explore and elucidate that role. Preliminary
investigations suggest that the principles to be studied may have an impact on
some major issues in syntactic theory. At the conclusion of the project, the
investigators will prepare a monograph describing their findings.
