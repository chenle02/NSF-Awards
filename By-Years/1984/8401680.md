Afundamental study in interfacial rheology, involving both experimental and
theoretical work, is being conducted with applications to foam and emulsion
stability, enhanced oil recovery by surfactant flooding, and thin liquid film
processes. The longitudinal wave technique, combined with a transversecapillary
wave method, is being developed to detect surface tension changes and to
determine the dynamic surface properties of surfactant solutions (films) at both
liquid-gas and liquid-liquid interfaces. The improved surface wavetechnique,
together with the microinterferometric apparatus, are used tocharacterize the
dynamic behavior of thin liquid surfactant films associated with foam and
emulsion systems. Finally, the role of surface viscosity and elasticity in the
stabilizing of these films is investigated.
