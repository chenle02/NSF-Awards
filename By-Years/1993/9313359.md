Chin The Wilmore Laboratory, constructed in 1947, houses the research programs
of Chemical, Civil, Materials, and Mechanical Engineering on the campus of
Auburn University. The majority of laboratory space is utilized for research and
research training in Chemical and Materials Engineering. In addition, the
building houses two university service facilities, electron microscopy and
chemical analysis laboratories, which support activities of faculty members
engaged in engineering and physical science research. Approximately 300
scientific personnel use the facility to conduct research activities. However
due to the age and the deteriorating condition of the Laboratory, the quality of
research and research training performed in the facility has been severely
restricted. This award will provide funding for the renovation of engineering
research space. Specifically the renovations will include: improving the
electrical, HVAC and plumbing systems, modernizing fire safety systems,
providing handicapped accessibility in the building and replacing the roof.
Installation of clean rooms, new chemical fume hoods and fume extraction systems
will allow faculty to participate in new avenues of research such as the
development and fabrication of intrinsically adaptive materials. Certain
activities that were curtailed due to safety considerations will resume once
renovations are completed. Because the College of Engineering is the largest in
the state of Alabama and minority groups are strongly represented in the state,
this infrastructure project will significantly improve Auburn's efforts in
recruiting minorities in engineering.
