Coordinate eukaryotic gene regulation may be induced by interactions of specific
regulatory factors with DNA and protein components of the basal gene promoters.
Detachment of the flagella of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii rapidly induces
transcription of tubulin and other flagellar genes nearly 10-fold above basal
levels of expression, making this an ideal system with which to study such
regulatory interactions. To determine DNA sequences required for deflagellation-
induced expression tubulin and other non-tubulin flagellar protein genes will be
modified for identification, deleted to retain varying lengths of 5' and 3'
flanking regions and intervening sequences, and introduced into Chlamydomonas by
transformation. Expression of the modified genes will be analyzed in control and
deflagellated cells. Regulatory elements will be located by correlating loss of
inducibility with specific deletions. Independent confirmation that the
regulatory sequences identified in gene sequences identified in gene transfer
studies confer inducibility will be obtained by analyzing the interaction of
protein factors will these in vivo and in vitro. These studies will provide the
basis for analyses of the signalling and regulatory mechanisms coordinating
expression of this large, diverse set of flagellar genes in response of
deflagellation.
