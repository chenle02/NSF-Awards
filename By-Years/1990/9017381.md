Professor Cukier is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform research in statistical mechanics directed toward
theoretical understanding of electron transfer and vibrational energy transfer.
This research will provide fundamental theoretical insight into important
chemical and biological processes which involve electron and vibrational energy
transfer. Long distance electron transfer implies a crucial role for the
intervening material between donor and acceptor in that there is a strong
component of electron transport through the material. By a combination of
analytic and simulation methods, Professor Cukier will explore the equilibrium
and transport properties of an electron in various materials. The aims of the
vibrational energy transfer studies are to predict these rates as a function of
solvent density, from gas to liquid. In dissociation-recombination reactions,
the role of solvent in driving electronic-curve crossing will be explored.
