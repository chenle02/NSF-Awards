A NATO-approved Advanced Study Institute will be held in Portugal, June 29 to
July l2, l986, on "Computer-Aided Optimal Design: Structural and Mechanical
Systems" and will focus on design of structures and mechanical systems,
considering vibration, buckling, transient dynamics, and related performance
considerations. Emerging analytical and computational techniques that support
both fields will be presented, including variational formulation of governing
equations, design sensitivity analysis, numerical optimization methods, multi-
purpose design formulations and methods, structural and mechanical system
control, shape optimal design, and related methods of computer aided design and
optimization. Fifteen leading authorities in the field will present lectures. In
addition to the lectures, approximately sixty post-doctoral level specialists in
the field are expected to participate in the Institute.
