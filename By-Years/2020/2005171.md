Many goals motivate scientific interest in human memory. The brain's ability to
create, store, and access memories helps enable vision, speech, learning,
thought, and identity; understanding memory elucidates both the functions of
remembering and the functions that rely on them. Injury and illness can suppress
or overstimulate memory function, with extreme cases causing ailments like
Alzheimer's disease and dementia on the one hand and PTSD and addiction on the
other; a theory explaining how biological mechanisms create memory phenomena may
help pinpoint the mechanistic changes responsible for memory failures. This
project outlines a path to a fundamentally new theory for how the microscopic
behavior of individual neurons generates the macroscopic phenomena of memory
performance. The potential outcomes of this project can shed greater light on
the understanding of human memory and the processes that influence
it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to create models for brain behavior
and memory phenomena and applies mathematical tools to investigate whether the
brain model can generate those memory phenomena. Brain behavior is structured
here as a Markov process derived from models of individual neurons, their
connectivity, and stimuli. Markov processes, which capture the assumption that
the past affects the future only through its effects on the present, exhibit a
characteristic behavior called stochastic convergence, where the Markov process
trends toward a predictable steady-state behavior over time. The memory model
seeks to capture memory retrieval, formation, and storage as phenomena where the
brain state converges to desired outcomes under corresponding stimuli, creates
new convergence relationships through neuronal plasticity, and protects old
convergence relationships from damage caused by that same
plasticity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
