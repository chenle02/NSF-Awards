9353926 Little A two-week workshop is being run for two- and four- year college
teachers of introductory astronomy whose formal training is in fields other than
astronomy. The workshop will offer laboratory work, both indoors and with sky
observations, as well as offering practical examples of uses of astronomical
materials in the classroom. The lab work will include astrophotography and the
use of small CCD cameras. The workshop will also offer selected topics in
current research in astronomy. ***
