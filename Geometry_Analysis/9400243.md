9400243 YANG Three main projects are proposed. The first project is a study of
the cosmic string solutions of the coupled Einstein and Yang--Mills--Higgs
equations. Problems such as the structure of coupling in view of physical
constants and gauge groups, existence and nonexistence of regular stationary
solutions will be investigated. Solutions of this type have applications in
early universe physics and the theory of galaxy formation. The second project is
a study of a variational problem arising from a field-theoretical framework of
nuclear interactions. The main problem is to minimize an energy functional among
all configuration maps in various homotopy classes. The homotopy class plays the
role of a topological constraint which takes an integral form. Existence,
regularity, and behavior of the minimizers will be investigated. The third
project is a study of the energy gap equation in the Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer
microscopic theory of superconductivity. Problems such as the determination of
the critical transition temperature, the uniqueness of a full space solution,
and numerical approximations of superconducting states will be investigated. The
proposed research considers nonlinear problems arising from several important
areas of theoretical physics, including superconductivity, cosmology, and
nuclear systems. The mathematical analysis and solutions will help better
understand these problems, open new areas of mathematical research, and enhance
the interactions of modern mathematics with physics. The methods developed will
also be useful and stimulating to other related fields of applied, numerical,
and pure mathematics.
