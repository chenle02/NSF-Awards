Dynamic free boundary problems deal with solving partial differential equations
in domain whose evolution is not known a priori. One example is the problem of
water freezing into ice, where the interface of ice and water is determined by
the solution of the heat equation in the water region (the distribution of
temperature). This project is focused on problems whose solutions have very
little regularity. For instance, when water freezes into ice, the resulting ice
crystal is expected to form a fractal-like structure on its boundary. Another
example is tumor growth, where the boundary of the tumor develops irregularity
due to the search for regions of high nutrients. The project is aimed at
providing a better understanding of the properties of the solutions to such
problems and provide a framework for developing accurate numerical simulations.
The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.

The presence of lower-dimensional structures is ubiquitous in the physical
literature, either as a boundary of a domain or a singular part of an evolution.
Many problems in nonlinear partial differential equations which are otherwise
well understood pose significant challenges when they are coupled with a moving
interface, even in seemingly simple settings. Besides the nonlinearity, the
difficulty of the problem lies in its nonlocality, in the sense that the
behavior of solutions depends on the global geometry of the free boundary.
Dynamic free boundary problems face an additional difficulty coming from the
lack of a priori regularity of the free boundaries. By studying the proposed
problems, the Principal Investigator (PI) aims to develop general methods to
deal with such difficulties. The work of the project uses geometric analysis as
well as variational and probabilistic arguments.
