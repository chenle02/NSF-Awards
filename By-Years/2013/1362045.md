The planned I/UCRC for Windstorm Hazard Mitigation intends to undertake
functions at the interface between basic and applied research and between
private and public interests. Working with its members, the Center will focus on
seeking solutions to real world problems encountered by industry members and
improve their performance and competitiveness; enhancing government agencies and
NGOs capabilities to prepare for and respond to future windstorms; transferring
findings from federally sponsored research to products and intellectual
properties that benefit researchers, university, and industry; and facilitating
collaboration between Center members by developing long-term strategies for
enhancing community resiliency to wind and other hazards.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned center aims to protect homeowners, businesses,
and communities through collaborative research in windstorm mitigation and the
implementation of innovations will enhance the Nation's resiliency to future
disasters. Integrated in the project are several initiatives aimed at increasing
diversity and collectively they contribute to the development of a more diverse
workforce and business environment. Meanwhile, the planning activities provide a
unique opportunity for students to interact with the industry, improve their
communication skills, and enhance their employment potentials. The project helps
develop students with strong problem solving, marketable capabilities. The
project also helps train Center faculty on how to work with the industry.
