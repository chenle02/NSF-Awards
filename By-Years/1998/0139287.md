The principal investigator, together with various collaborators,
studies&lt;br/&gt;the cohomology of arithmetic groups as modules over an algebra
of Hecke&lt;br/&gt;operators. He considers conjectures connecting (1) mod-p
cohomology&lt;br/&gt;classes of congruence groups which are eigenclasses for all
the Hecke&lt;br/&gt;operators with (2) mod-p representations of the Galois
(symmetry) group&lt;br/&gt;of the algebraic numbers. These conjectures amount to
saying there should&lt;br/&gt;exist reciprocity laws (usually non-abelian)
connecting the two types of&lt;br/&gt;objects. The conjectures are tested
computationally, which leads to&lt;br/&gt;further refinements of them. The
principal investigator outlines an&lt;br/&gt;approach for proving them in some
special cases. Another set of computer&lt;br/&gt;calculations probe for the
existence of automorphic representations of&lt;br/&gt;cohomological type which
are not lifted from smaller rank groups. These&lt;br/&gt;are conjecturally
connected with reciprocity laws of Langlands type.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the
investigator and a colleague develop a theory of p-adic&lt;br/&gt;families of
not necessarily p-ordinary cohomology classes for congruence&lt;br/&gt;groups.
They use this to study the question whether non-lifted&lt;br/&gt;automorphic
representations are "p-adically rigid".&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Algebraic number
theory studies the properties of polynomial&lt;br/&gt;functions and equations
whose coefficients are whole numbers. Ever since&lt;br/&gt;Descartes invented
analytic geometry in the early 1600's, the ability to&lt;br/&gt;solve algebraic
equations has been central to mathematics, science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering. In
the last 50 years a new set of applications of number&lt;br/&gt;theory has
opened up in the field of cryptography. The principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator
studies delicate questions involving the fine structure and&lt;br/&gt;properties
of solutions to certain systems of algebraic equations.&lt;br/&gt;Although one
can often obtain approximate solutions using computers, there&lt;br/&gt;are many
very subtle and difficult questions concerning the existence and&lt;br/&gt;form
of the exact solutions. There are a number of conjectures on the&lt;br/&gt;table
to explain what is going on, and the principal investigator
has&lt;br/&gt;contributed some of them. He and his colleagues study these
conjectures&lt;br/&gt;by verifying them in some cases by extensive computer
calculations, and by&lt;br/&gt;proving them in special cases. At the core of
this research is the&lt;br/&gt;surprising connection with geometric objects
("cohomology classes") that&lt;br/&gt;can be constructed in spaces of
n-dimensional crystal lattices. &lt;br/&gt;
