9311722 Tan This project deals with the dynamic response of coupled guide/chain
drive systems commonly employed for transmitting power to automobile
accessories, and the feasibility of active and passive vibration control of
chains operating at high speeds. A distributed transfer function approach is
used in the analysis for prediction of system response. The passive impedance of
the distributed guide is based upon an impact pair model. the coupled mechanical
system, consisting of the guide and the chain, is modeled as an assembly of
subsystems. An active control, strategy applied at the boundary of the guide
system is used to suppress the vibration generated during high speed motion. The
robustness of the active controller at different loading conditions is also
investigated. The results of this research provide useful guidelines for
optimization of high-speed axially moving mechanical systems in general, and
guided chain systems in particular. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
