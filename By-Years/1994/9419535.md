9419535 Suomi The objective of this research is the testing of a new in-situ
ocean hat flux instrument designed to measure the heat flux in the molecular
conduction layer near the water surface; thus,it measures the combined heat loss
owing to evaporation, sensible transport and radiation. The device can be
deployed on either drifting or tethered buoys. The proposed tests, in
cooperation with Professor Gabler, University of Miami, include comparisons
between the flux plate and eddy correlation devices installed in salt water near
Miami, These tests should establish the merit of the heat flux plate, its design
limitation, if any, and perhaps preferred ways to deploy the device at sea. ***
