With this renewal award, the Organic and Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program and the Galactic Astronomy Program supports the work of Professor Robert
J. McMahon of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin,
Madison, WI. The research will extend the PI's studies of the synthesis and
characterization of reactive organic molecules that may be present in the
interstellar medium (ISM). The PI will synthesize carbon chain species and
hydrogen deficient aromatics, characterize them by matrix isolation and ESR
spectroscopy combined with quantum chemical calculations, and study their
photochemistry. Since the diffuse interstellar bands, absorptions in the near-IR
to near-UV, are often hypothesized to arise from either carbon chain molecules
or aromatics in the diffuse ISM, these studies will aid in establishing the
identity of the specific molecules responsible for these bands.

These investigations of energetic molecules, which include strong partnerships
with laboratory astrophysicists, are expected provide important fundamental
information that will increase our understanding of interstellar molecules and
of the dynamics of such species as reactive intermediates.
