This targeted Math and Science Partnership includes the Duke University Pratt
School of Engineering, four school districts (Alamance/Burlington Schools,
Orange County Schools, Iredell/Statesville Schools, Harnett County Schools), the
North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, and the North Carolina Science,
Mathematics, and Technology Education Center. Focusing on K-8 science education,
Teachers and Scientists Collaborating (TASC) is providing curriculum units
selected from an array of inquiry-based curricula, inservice professional
development, and support from Duke University scientists. Objectives include
establishing a cadre of scientists who provide ongoing teacher assistance in
science content that is aligned with state/national standards, instituting a
professional development system to prepare teachers to use inquiry-based
instructional modules and to benefit from scientist resources, creating a fee-
based lending library of inquiry-based modules available to teachers, and
institutionalizing science education support. TASC seeks to narrow achievement
gaps, improve end-of grade science and mathematics scores, and to improve the
quality of science teaching in participating school systems by increasing
content knowledge, the use of inquiry-based teaching techniques, and the
engagement of scientists in assisting teachers in implementing science
standards. The project is expected to serve 7,560 teachers and 352,800 students.
