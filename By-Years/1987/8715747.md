This project will enable the conversion of a vintage 12" radius mass
spectrometer into a double collector spectrometer for the analysis of hafnium
isotopes. The instrument conversion will be carried out in the isotope
laboratory of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The hafnium isotopic data gathered from
analysis on the converted equipment of peridotite and basalt samples will be
used in a study of chemical heterogeneities in the Earth's mantle.
