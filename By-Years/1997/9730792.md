Schmidt, Gary AST 97-30792 Dr. Schmidt will carry out a program of research to
investigate the effects of magnetic fields on accretion processes in binary
systems and on compact stars. He will explore accretion processes in extremely
high magnetic fields by using both observational and theoretical approaches,
such as magnetohydrodynamics calculations of regions near the inner Lagrange
point to study the timescales for mass transfer episodes, Doppler tomography to
map the path of the accretion stream, and detailed models of the optical spectra
to evaluate magnetic field strength and morphology. He will also search for much
weaker fields on a sample of single white dwarfs to better understand the
incidence of magnetism on white dwarfs, and by extension also on main-sequence
stars of solar-mass range, as well as provide measurements of field strength for
reference in asteroseismological studies. Finally, he will perform high speed
photometry and spectrophotometry of cataclysmic variables for reverberation
mapping of the accretion disks and surrounding gas in compact neutron star and
black-hole X-ray binaries. These projects take advantage of polarimetric
equipment on the Steward Observatory 2.3-meter and the converted 6.5-meter
Multiple Mirror Telescope. ***
