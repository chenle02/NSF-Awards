Gravitational waves are a potential new window to view the universe. The
Michigan group will join the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave
Observatory) team designing, constructing, and using the LIGO facility. Their
initial effort would be to assist in the 40 Meter Interferometer (the LIGO
prototype-test bench) Research and Development Program. Gustafson would be
substantially resident at the 40 Meter, and become competent to run the
interferometer. The goal would be to support the R/D program, using the 40 Meter
as an operational device, working within the framework of the current R/D test,
addition, or upgrade program. They would keep the interferometer active, dealing
with the residual problems and exploring operational realities. Data collection,
would become a norm, and analysis attempted at the 10**-19 level in sensitivity,
with the spurious noise sources understood and eliminated. This activity would
contribute to the LIGO Detector and Facility effort, and to the `Advanced LIGO`
concept. All actions would be deferential to the R/D program, mostly in the mode
of `diagnose, discuss, fix as agreed`. This program is an example of an
operational working relationship between LIGO and the University user community.
