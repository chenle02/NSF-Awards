Reproduction requires successful interactions among the various participants,
including mothers, fathers, and offspring, at many different levels, from whole
organisms to molecules. However, the process of reproduction often involves
competition among individuals of the same sex as well as conflict between the
sexes or between offspring and parents. Competition and conflict are believed to
spark an evolutionary arms race between reproductive proteins of males and those
of females, but this hypothesis has yet to be definitively tested. The present
study will test this hypothesis by using next-generation sequencing to quantify
patterns of evolution in the genes that encode reproductive proteins in
pipefishes and seahorses. This group is a particularly interesting one in which
to examine patterns of reproductive protein evolution, because distinct species
differ with respect to levels of sexual competition and
conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is scientifically important because
it will contribute to a better understanding of the evolutionary processes that
have contributed to the molecular underpinnings of reproduction. Such knowledge
is necessary for a general understanding of the various ways in which proteins
from males, females, and offspring interact to result in successful reproduction
in humans and other animals. This project will also have a number of broader
impacts. For example, several undergraduate and graduate students will be
trained in cutting-edge approaches in molecular genetics and integrated into the
global research community through international collaboration. This research
will also be publicized through local and national outreach, including
publication in leading journals, on websites, and in the popular press.
