The goal of this research project is to fabricate a long lifetime ceramic Zr02
layer with special adhesion on orthopaedic femoral devices, particularly knees.
Implantable orthopaedic femoral knee components usually are metallic because of
the tensile forces present. Ceramic materials, such as A1203 or Zr02, generally
exhibit many desirable properties, including lower ion release,less cut wear,
and good biocompatibility. These latter materials, however, are poor in tension.
Coatings are undesirable because adhesion cannot be guaranteed. High energy ion
implantation is an accepted method that can provide the needed adhesion because
the atoms are injected well below the surface, rather than deposited onto it. A
technique for growing a thick surface layer of Zr02 on orthopaedic devices using
ion implantation will be developed. The layer will interface the substrate
through a blended transition region that spans a zone up to 0.1 micrometers in
thickness. Zr02 layers up to 3 micrometers thick are possible. This technique
should provide a long lifetime articulating surface to allow the implants to
have the desirable bulk properties of titanium with a ceramic articulating
surface.
