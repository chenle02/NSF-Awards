This grant is in support of the 1991 Gordon Research Conference on Nonlinear
Optics and Lasers to be held at Brewster Academy, Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, July
22-26, 1991. The purpose of this conference will be to provide an informal forum
for the presentation and discussion of new work on selected topics in nonlinear
optics, quantum electronics, and lasers, and their applications to physics and
chemistry. An informal atmosphere with a strong emphasis on discussion is
intended to encourage the exchange of ideas in a manner not possible at regular
meetings of processional societies. A total attendance of approximately 135
scientists from universities and industry is anticipated. The National Science
Foundation grant will be used to provide partial support for some invited
speakers and selected junior faculty and especially students who, because of
limitations of their own source of funding, require financial assistance to
attend the conference.
