This project will use a global 3-D stratospheric model to study the effect of
the tropical quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) on the extratropical wintertime
circulation and tracer transport, with Rossby wave propagation providing the
coupling mechanism. A tracer advection scheme will be used along with the 3-D
mechanistic model, to estimate the extratropical quasi-biennial variability in
ozone (or other quasi-conservative tracer) concentration associated with the
circulation modulation by the equatorial QBO. This research is important because
it provides the basis for inhanced theoretical understanding of how low-
frequency oscillations (the QBO) interact with other weather and climate
phenomena.
