Recently, a new threat model has been discovered which can be used to break
many existing cryptographic protocols. The threat is based on the fact that
certain hardware may be induced to perform miscalculations. This scenario is
applicable to tamper proof devices which can be made to miscalculate by
operating them in an extreme physical environment. The possibility of attacking
various cryptographic protocols using hardware faults raises many interesting
open problems. First, it now becomes desirable to construct efficient schemes
which are resistant to attacks using hardware faults. The project will develop
the theory necessary to prove the fault resistance of certain schemes. Other
cryptographic schemes will be analyzed to determine whether they are susceptible
to the new attack. The hardness of factoring integers is a standard
cryptographic assumption. Various mathematical implications of this assumption
will be studied. The previous results show that the hardness of factoring
implies that polynomials having many roots in low algebraic extensions of the
rationals are hard to evaluate. Generally speaking, criteria for when
polynomials are hard to evaluate are useful in many applications. Further
applications of the hardness of factoring will be studied. Specifically, the
goal is to construct new classes of polynomials which are hard to evaluate,
unless factoring is easy. There are several such candidates, for example,
certain polynomials which generate Galois extensions over the rationals.
Estimating the difficulty of evaluating certain polynomials based on the type of
number fields they generate is a promising area of research. Such results will
hopefully shed light on the complexity of evaluating polynomials.***
