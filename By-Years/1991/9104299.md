This project is aimed at providing a foundation for the algorithms that are
employed to approximate the eigenvalues of a real nonsymmetric matrix. Current
software in the EISPACK and LAPACK subroutine libraries rely on variations of
the shifted QR algorithm. The primary objective is to obtain an understanding of
the global convergence properties of these algorithms and determine whether they
succeed for a set of problems of full measure. Computation of eigenvalues is
required in the study of vibrations and other problems involving differential
equations. For many years the EISPACK subroutine library has been an effective
resource for approximation of eigenvalues. While experience has shown the
algorithms to be both reliable and fast, there is no theoretical basis for their
success. This project involves the application of techniques from dynamical
systems and complexity to analyze the established numerical software. The
principal goal is to either establish the validity of the current methods or to
identify areas in which they are inadequate and devise a more efficient
modification.
