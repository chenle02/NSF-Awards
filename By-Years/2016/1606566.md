Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.
Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions
and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can
be used to test fundamental physics. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC)
observatory, located on the slopes of the Sierra Negra in Mexico, is a ground-
based facility designed with unique capabilities to observe very high energy
gamma-rays. This award supports scientists at the University of Maryland College
Park in their leadership roles in the operation of the observatory and in the
scientific analysis of the HAWC data. The PI serves as U.S. Spokesperson for
HAWC and the Co-PI serves as HAWC Data Manager. They will continue developing
analysis algorithms and simulation tools for the observatory, and pursue
scientific research on transient gamma-ray sources and spatially extended
Galactic sources. This award will allow the group to continue and expand their
outreach efforts, which include outreach to the Hispanic-American community with
bi-lingual products related to HAWC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With its large
instantaneous field of view and continuous operations HAWC surveys two-thirds of
the sky every day. HAWC will perform a deep survey of the gamma-ray sky and
detect a large sample of gamma-ray sources with measurements of flux, spectra
and variability. HAWC's wide field and high sensitivity enable studies of
extended sources and diffuse emission from the Galactic plane. The University of
Maryland group will exploit HAWC's unique capabilities to study rare transients,
search for high-energy emission from gamma-ray bursts, and probe the spectra and
morphology of extended sources. In addition they will continue their leadership
roles in operating and improving the performance of the observatory.
