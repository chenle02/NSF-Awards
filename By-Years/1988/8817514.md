The Global Ocean Flux Study (GOFS) is planning an expedition to study the
phytoplankton bloom in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean in the spring of 1989.
This study will contribute to this effort by constraining the 02 balance at the
47o N process-oriented study station. The main experimental objective is to
determine net and gross rates of 02 production in vitro during the spring bloom.
From this work, together with selected studies of the distribution and isotopic
composition of 02 in the upper water column, net, gross, and new production of
02 will determined. These results, together with those of other investigators,
will constrain the mass balance of 02 and carbon during the spring bloom. They
will also lead towards an understanding of the biological processes governing
gross and new production.
