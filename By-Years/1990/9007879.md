With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Drs.
Paul F. Hudrlik and Anne M. Hudrlik of the Department of Chemistry at Howard
University. The Hudrliks' program has the long term objective of determining the
reactivity of organic compounds containing silicon, with a view toward
developing new reactions and reaction sequences of potential utility in organic
synthesis. The current work focuses on the investigation of compounds having
silicon groups which are expected to be more reactive than trimethylsilyl. These
include silicon compounds with a protected internal nucleophile and
silacyclobutanes.
