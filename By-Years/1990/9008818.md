The objective of this research is to identify and study the involvement of
certain nervous system mechanisms in the ability of the organism to adapt to
changes in the environment. Of particular significance are those adaptations
that result from the learning of new information. The work will focus on the
fundamental unit of information processing in the nervous system - the single
nerve cell. This research will aid in elucidation of how certain chemically and
electrically based cellular processes are related to lasting modification of
nervous system function. This work, in turn, will be important for understanding
mechanisms that are related to the acquisition of learned behaviors.
