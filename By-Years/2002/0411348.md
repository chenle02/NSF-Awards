With National Science Foundation support, Dr. William Lewis will lead a team
conducting eighteen months of research on linguistic ontology development and
text mining. The project, with the help of Dr. Scott Farrar, will expand an
existing linguistic ontology through extensive text mining of linguistic data
structures that exist on the Web, focusing specifically on interlinear text
found mostly in scholarly articles. Central to the text mining task will be the
development of a set of programming tools for accessing and deploying the
ontology. The ontology will guide the text mining in interpreting the data found
on the Web, and the text mining will be used cyclically to develop the
ontology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As more and more linguistic data has been placed
on the Web, the need for locating, accessing, and comparing these data resources
has become essential to the discipline. Unfortunately, because the terminology
used by various researchers differs, access to resources can be limited or
difficult, and comparison across resources is generally not possible. A
linguistic ontology represents a way of encoding the knowledge space of the
field as a computational artifact that makes possible the automated comparison
of resources, irrespective of the terminology in which these resources are
encoded. Text mining of linguistic resources is an essential part of the
proposed research, because it can allow a comprehensive picture of linguistic
knowledge to develop, and when applied to ontology construction, can be used to
make the ontology more "data-aware." Further, the development of programming
tools to access the ontology will have the added benefit of making the ontology
more readily accessible to other researchers wishing to use it, laying the
foundations for a Semantic Web for linguistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
