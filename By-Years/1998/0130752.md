With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville
will acquire an Electrospray/Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization
Quadrupole - Time of Flight (MALDI Q-TOF) Hybrid Mass Spectrometer. This
instrument will be used for a) studies on the characterization of polymers and
amyloid fibrils; studies of multiply charged anions; and for the synthesis and
characterization of telechelic materials. In addition, investigators at
Knoxville will investigate aminoglycoside antibiotic modifying enzymes; light
regulation of plant development; and protein components of amyloid plaques.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass
spectrometry is the technique of choice for obtaining accurate molecular weights
on molecules up to and over 300,000 daltons, with extremely high sensitivity.
These studies utilizing the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer will have an impact in
chemistry, biochemistry and materials research.
