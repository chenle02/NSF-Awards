The objectives of this study are: (1) to investigate experimentally how
thiosulfate and polythionates form through sulfur-water interaction
(T&gt;100oC), (2) to determine experimentally the thermal stabilities of
thiosulfate and polythionates, (3) to determine experimentally the catalytic
effects of mineral surfaces (pyrite and quartz) and trace levels of Fe2+(aq) on
(1) and (2), and (4) to determine the sulfur speciation in several sulfur-rich
hot springs in Yellowstone National Park in situ. Objectives are achieved
through a combination of experimental work in the hydrothermal laboratory and
field work in collaboration with the U.S.G.S. Ion Chromatographic techniques
will be used for the in situ analysis of sulfur species, the PI will again
collaborate with Kirk Nordstrom, and use a mobile, U.S.G.S. laboratory equipped
with an IC identical to the one in the PI's lab. The results of these
experiments will be used to identify natural hydrothermal solutions that could
contain sulfur oxyanions in significant concentrations.
