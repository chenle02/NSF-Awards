The Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications is engaged in an effort to
bring together members of the community of mathematics curriculum developers and
experts in assessment, including representatives and stakeholders from the two
assessment consortia recently funded by the US Department of Education. The
primary goal of the meeting is to discuss issues and recommend actions regarding
assessment design and production that arise in an environment of Common Core
State Standards (CCSS). The format will allow information exchange and resource
sharing in the service of states and districts as they work to effectively
implement the CCSS. Participants will include representatives from the governing
states as well as from the leadership teams of the assessment consortia along
with experts in curriculum development, standards implementation and
assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is being carried out with the support
and cooperation of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the National
Council of Supervisors of Mathematics, the Association of Mathematics Teacher
Educators, and the Association of State Supervisors of Mathematics.
