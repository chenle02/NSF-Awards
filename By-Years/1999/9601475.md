9601475 Wirth This grant, made through the Academic Research Infrastructure
(ARI) Program, provides $110,000 as partial support of the costs of acquiring an
X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) for geochemical analyses of igneous and
metamorphic rocks, thin films and soils at Macalester College. A variety of
research will be conducted by faculty in several departments at Macalester and
by members of the Minnesota State Geological Survey and faculty at Lawrence
University. Specific projects that will utilize XRF analyses will include the
geochemical characterization of island arc and intraplate volcanics from Alaska
as indicators of the tectonic evolution of this area, petrogenesis of
Proterozoic dike swarms in the Midcontinental U.S., the geochemical evolution of
Galapagos hotspot magmas, characterization of silicon and germanium-based thin
films and trace metal geochemistry of soils. This grant provides this
undergraduate institution with a state-of-the-art piece of research
instrumentation which will have a significant impact on the training of and
fills a regional gap where the capabilities of an XRF were previously not easily
accessible. ***
