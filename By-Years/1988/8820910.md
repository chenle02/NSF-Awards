Protein crystallography is playing a central role in the advances made in
biochemical research today. This application proposes to set up a state-of-the-
art laboratory-based data collection facility, consisting of a rotating anode
source with a position- sensitive area detector. This facility would complement
the existing facility for macromolecular crystallography at the Biomedical
Technology Resource at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (MacCHESS).
The current interests and projects for which the new data collection facility
would be used cover diverse biochemical areas. These include structure studies
of physiologically important molecules such as calcium binding proteins and
hormones, enzymes, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase, which catalyze
reactions in the biosynthetic pathways of some unusual and interesting natural
products, FAD-containing redox enzymes, bacteriophage proteins which regulate
gene transcription, specifically mutated or chemically modified species of
RNAse, and in the future, systems involving membrane proteins currently under
study.
