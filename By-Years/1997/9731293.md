9731293 MacDonald The National Nanofabrication Users Network (NNUN) was
established by NSF in 1994 as a partnership of advanced user facilities
providing the national research and development community with access to state-
of-the-art micro- and nanofabrication facilities, instrumentation, processes,
and expertise. The Network is composed of a consortium of five universities:
Cornell University, Stanford University, University of California at Santa
Barbara, Howard University, and Pennsylvania State University. The NNUN is
supported by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG), Mathematical and Physical
Sciences (MPS), Biological Sciences (BIO), and Computer and Information Science
and Engineering (CISE).

The NNUN's mission is to provide opportunities for the nation's scientists,
engineers and educators to move innovative ideas in nano-scale science and
technology to the laboratory to develop prototype structures, devices and
systems. The network serves a broad and diverse engineering and scientific
community in academia, industry and government, and is committed to education,
training and technical outreach.

The experimental activities carried out at the NNUN facilities impact a wide
range of scientific and technical fields including biology, chemistry, physics,
electronics, magnetics, superconductivity, materials, MEMS, nanostructures, and
optics.

The NNUN facilities are hands-on user facilities where researchers, with minimal
training, can perform individual state-of-the-art projects with tools otherwise
inaccessible to them. Research activities undertaken at NNUN may range in
duration from a day or so, to an extended period of time. In some cases,
research projects can be undertaken remotely, with NNUN personnel assisting with
fabrication processes for network users.

Under new 5-year Cooperative Agreements, NNUN will continue to operate as five
university nodes and will enhance the capability and infrastructure to support
an increasing number of external users in traditional and in emerging new fields
that are impacted by micro- and nanofabrication. The NNUN will continue to
support and enhance its mission in the integration of research and education
through the training of students, outreach activities and topical workshops.
