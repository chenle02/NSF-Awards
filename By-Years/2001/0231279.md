0231279&lt;br/&gt;Podlaha&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports collaborative
research between Drs. Elizabeth Podlaha and Wanjun Wang of Louisiana State
University, Dr. Henrikas Cesiulis of Vilnius University in Lithuania, and Dr.
Jinhui Lan of Tsinghua University in China, in connection with Drs. Podlaha and
Wang's Nanoscale Science and Engineering NIRT grant (0210832) for development of
novel electrodeposited nanostructured multilayered alloys for
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The U.S. researchers will benefit from
Dr. Cesiulis' expertise in the area of electrodeposition and from Dr. Lan's
expertise in the area of sensor development. &lt;br/&gt;
