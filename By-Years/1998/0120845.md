Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tank&lt;br/&gt;0120845&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anadro
mous salmon are the life-blood of the Pacific Northwest, on which are based
considerable economic, social, and cultural values. Normally, a massive quantity
of organic material is transported from the ocean to streams annually via salmon
migration. Presently, salmon stocks have declined, and lawmakers, resource
managers, and the scientific community are beginning to ask what role salmon
carcasses play in stream ecosystems. The PIs will address this critical
knowledge gap by tracing the flow of the heavy isotope of nitrogen (15N) added
to an Alaskan stream before, during, and after a salmon carcass addition. This
will quantify how the pulse of marine derived nutrients (MDN) alters rates of
stream N cycling from both a food web and whole-stream perspective. This
research builds on the insight gained from an ongoing USDA-funded study by using
the 15N tracer technique in a novel way and will help to clarify the role MDN
plays in stream ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
