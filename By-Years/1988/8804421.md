Dr. Hille will continue his study of the molybdenum hydroxylase, xanthine
oxidase. He will fully characterize the enzyme from a physical stand point with
particular regard to features likely to be relevant to catalysis. For a variety
of reasons, xanthine oxidase has become the prototypical molybdenum hydroxylase,
a small but important class of metalloproteins. Physicochemical studies of the
enzyme lie at the forefront of understanding molybdenum enzymes and will provide
important insight into the general features of biological electron transfer
processes. Molybdenum hydroxylases are members of a small but extremely
important class of enzymes that are responsible for the incorporation of oxygen
into a variety of organic and inorganic compounds. They are not well understood
in comparison to other hydroxylating systems. This is due in large part to the
absence of experimental probes for molybdenum centers, which lack the convenient
spectrophotometric properties exhibited by other oxidation - reduction centers.
Nevertheless, the presently available information regarding the mechanism of
action of the molybdenum hydroxylase suggests several fascinating aspects of
these enzymes.
