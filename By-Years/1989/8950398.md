The Physics Department at Bates is employing techniques of laser spectroscopy
to enhance student understanding of fundamental physics concepts. One experiment
gives the student a clearer and more quantitative measure of the Zeeman effect
than is possible with a spectrograph. Others investigate longitudinal and
transverse laser modes and the fundamental forces exerted on atoms by light.
