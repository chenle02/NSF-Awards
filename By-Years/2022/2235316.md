This effort focuses on educating and training undergraduate students in
semiconductor-related research, starting from a co-located summer semester that
will continue through the following fall and spring semesters. This planning
grant focuses on building a research community enabling undergraduate students
to co-design in this research space with the mentorship of graduate students and
the principal Investigators (PIs.) The project includes the development of
training aspects during the previous spring semester to teach, train, and
empower students, as well as training graduate students on how to teach this
community. This teaming grant will facilitate coordination between the team
members and students to build a strong, cohesive core team among all the
investigators. The technical activities will enable each PI to learn other's
disciplines and identify compelling areas of future opportunity with
semiconductor research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort looks to co-design from
materials, to devices, to circuits, to initial systems using multiple three (or
more) terminal Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) devices with significant overlap in
expertise between the individuals to enable building community at the boundaries
of these fields as well as effective co-design in these areas. The effort will
train undergraduate students enabling a workforce capable of tackling future
questions in co-design, as well as enabling graduate students to mentor this
future workforce. This focuses initial research using Floating-Gate (FG) and
Electro-Chemical RAM (ECRAM) devices, two potential components that integrate
with standard Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and provide huge
physical computing opportunities as well as reducing or eliminating component
mismatch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
