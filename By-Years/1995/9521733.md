This proposal will study the morphology and temperature structure of the source
regions of solar wind, which are vital for understanding mechanisms that drive
this plasma flow. The PI will make images of the Sun in spectral lines during
the unique coronal observing conditions provided by total solar eclipse. Four
CCD cameras will simultaneously observe the solar corona; in addition, the PI
will observe white light from the continuum measurements in all four filters.
With this set of spectral lines, the PI will identify the spatial relationship
between the cool material forming the bulk of coronal holes, and the hot
material from the surrounding regions that often veil them. These observations
should also resolve spatial distribution of different temperature plasmas within
polar coronal holes. With the CCD cameras, the PI will provide the first
simultaneous photometric images of coronal holes in these spectral lines. This
research will ultimately establish a new tool for exploring the structure of
coronal holes.
