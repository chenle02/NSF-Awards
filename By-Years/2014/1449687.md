This award will fund the Association of Women in Science (AWIS) to conduct a
series of three annual workshops for grant awardees from the ADVANCE and
Research on Gender in Science and Engineering programs. This will be the first
time these two communities will be brought together. Their research has much in
common and the two groups will learn much from each other. Overlapping areas of
interest include: examination of the causes and strategies to alleviate under-
representation of girls and women in STEM, the use of theory-based intervention
models to redress under-representation, and the design and carrying out of
evaluation of the impact of their programs. The cross-fertilization between the
two communities will generate better ideas that can be tested, and mechanisms to
evaluate the resulting strategies to learn why they are effective and in what
context. This series of workshops is expected to have a broad impact on the
entire community of researchers interested in the field of broadening
participation, as presentations and poster sessions presented at the meeting
will be posted on the AWIS website. In addition, AWIS is planning to innovate
the use of social media to more broadly disseminate workshop findings.
