This research concerns modeling of stochastic systems. For these systems, the
work will be directed towards the development of an infinite-dimensional
realization theory, the solution of problems in model order reduction, and the
development of a bilinear system theory. Current work on linear stochastic
infinite-dimensional realization theory requires certain restrictive assumptions
to find the minimal state space realization of any given stationary Gaussian
random process. Thus, the first objective is to relax these assumptions to
obtain a theory applicable to a wider range of processes. The work on model
reduction concerns the finding of a relatively low order model of a high order
system. This has important implications for on-line control where the control
action must be calculated in real time. The work on bilinear systems, a
relatively simple form of nonlinear stochastic model, will attempt to extend the
work on linear systems to this class of models. The approach to be used in this
research is based on certain aspects of functional analysis and the geometry of
random processes.
