This project supports research on a number of problems concerning the
arithmetic geometry of curves and surfaces, as well as possible higher-
dimensional generalizations. The research involves a detailed study of K3
surfaces with infinite automorphism group, centered around the canonical heights
defined on such surfaces. The project will study the variation of the p-adic
height on elliptic surfaces, extending recent results for the classical height,
with possible applications to L-series. The research will also involve the study
of various general position theorems in algebraic geometry, quantitative bounds
for the number of rational points on curves of genus at least two, and the
development of a new algorithm for computing canonical heights on elliptic
curves which does not require a complete factorization of the discriminant. This
project is in the general area of number theory and algebraic geometry. This is
an area of research that focuses on the solutions sets, which are curves or
surfaces in lower dimensions, of families of algebraic polynomials.
