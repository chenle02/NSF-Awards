9553153 Ozturk It has become clear that the future of the electronics industry
will be based upon a new level of semiconductor manufacturing commonly referred
to as nanoelectronics, which implies at least a factor of ten scaling in
dimensions is essential to increase the number of devices per chip, and to
provide faster, more power efficient chips. In addition, it is widely accepted
that future semiconductor manufacturing will be based upon single wafer
processing, as opposed to present day batch manufacturing. This transition is
driven by demands for cost-effectiveness, as well as meeting needs for real-time
wafer diagnostic incorporation essential in the manufacture of nanoscale devices
and circuits. The research and education activities to be undertaken as a result
of this award are focused upon state-of-the-art and advanced device processes
and tools enabling the manufacture of nanoscale integrated circuits using single
wafer processing models. New processes and devices will be investigated for use
in future factories, including atomic level engineering and selective
processing. New approaches to engineering education will include interaction
with industry.
