This project will develop a job scheduling and resource allocation system for
data-intensive high-performance computing (HPC) based on the congestion pricing
of a systems' heterogeneous resources. This extends the concept of resource
management beyond processing: it allocates memory, disk I/O, and the network
among jobs. The research will overcome the critical shortcomings of processor-
centric resource management, which wastes huge portions of cluster and
supercomputer resources for data-intensive workloads, e.g. I/O bandwidth governs
the performance of many modern HPC applications but, at present, it is neither
allocated nor managed. The research will develop techniques that (1)
recon&amp;#64257;gure the degree of parallelism of HPC jobs to avoid congestion
and wastage, (2) support lower-priority, allocation elastic jobs that can be
scheduled on arbitrary numbers of nodes to consume unallocated resource
fragments, and (3) co-schedule batch-processing workloads that use system
resources that are unoccupied due to asymmetric utilization and temporal shifts
in the foreground jobs. These techniques will be implemented and supported for
free public use as extensions to an open-source resource-management framework.
If used broadly, the software has the potential to provide much better
utilization of the national investment in HPC facilities.&lt;br/&gt;
