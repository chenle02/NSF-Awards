This research project is concerned problems associated with reasoning about
change. On the practical side, means of supporting changes in an Engineering
Information System (EIS), that is a repository of information about an
engineering artifact such as a VLSI circuit or software system will be
investigated. It is now widely recognized that information management is crucial
to the success of large scale design efforts. Near term projects in this area
include construction of a main memory based data manager for high level
synthesis of VLSI circuits; investigation of performance issues for updates in
EIS, particularly as different aspects of the same design are updated in
parallel by different engineers, leading to problems of data consistency and
task coordination that are critical in large engineering projects. From a more
theoretical perspective, there is interest in formal means of reasoning about
changes in logical theories. For example, when a new piece of information about
the world is discovered, how can one decide what old pieces of knowledge and
data to keep, and what to discard in the light of the new information? This work
is relevent to problems in databases (updating databases with incomplete
information), philosophy (belief revision, revision of scientific theories), and
artificial intelligence (planning, diagnosis, reasoning about the effects of
actions, etc.). The studies of theory revision will emphasize problems from AI,
such as reasoning about the location of objects in a room, as applications for
revison techniques. Recent studies of the relationship of theory revision to
circumscription and reasoning about action have proven particularly fruitful,
and these will be pursued further.
