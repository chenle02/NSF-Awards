In each of the next three years a conference will be held for developers of
comprehensive K-12 science, technology and mathematics curricula funded by the
National Science Foundation, as well as for developers of modules currently
funded. The goal of these conferences is to provide a forum for developers to
discuss common issues of materials development, evaluation, adoption, student
assessment and teacher professional development for reform-based curricula and
to develop research questions about them. The conferences will allow
participants to exchange information, interact with experts and to build on
relationships developed in previous meetings. A conference report and evaluation
will be published on the web, and each meeting will build upon the previous one.
