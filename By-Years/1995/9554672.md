This proposal is building on BMCC's successful NSF Undergraduate Faculty
Enhancement program. The project is providing summer workshops for mathematics
faculty which emphasize students working in groups and use of computer graphers
and computer algebra systems to create written honors projects and animated
calculus movies. The student population at BMCC is two-thirds women, and eighty-
five percent African-American and Latino. With support from NSF, DOE, and MSIP,
they have been highly successful in attracting and retaining increased numbers
of women and minority students into our Precalculus, Calculus, and Differential
Equations sequence. The new workshops are adding new techniques in technology
and collaborative learning to the workshops which includes science projects
developed through their NSF-CCD grant, CD-ROM technology, and two 1-day academic
year workshops each year. Physics and chemistry faculty are attending the
workshops as well as mathematics faculty. The project is sharing what is learned
and developed with other faculty in the region by instituting two regional
summer faculty workshops for each of two summers. One workshop is for faculty
inexperienced in technology on the preparation of collaborative computer
portfolios in Science and the Calculus sequence. The second workshop is for
faculty more experienced in technology. Two 1-day academic year workshops each
year are for follow-up activities.
