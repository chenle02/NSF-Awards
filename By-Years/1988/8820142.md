Sources of intense tunable vacuum ultraviolet radiation, obtained using non-
linear mixing of visible laser radiation, will be used for non-linear
excitations in atoms . One application will involve ultra-high resolution
studies of atomic helium for basic standards work and tests of quantum
electrodynamics in two electron atoms. A second application involves use of a
source of multiple pulses of transform-limited radiation to cool atomic
hydrogen, which will be used to study many-body processes. A third program
involves study of core excitations and multi- electrons excitations of atoms in
intense radiation fields.
