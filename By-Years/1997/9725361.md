9725361 Bursik Pyroclastic flows or nuees ardentes are perhaps the most
destructive, yet most poorly understood of volcanic phenomena. Because of their
destructiveness, they are virtually impossible to observe directly; yet they
leave deposits that have proven extremely difficult to interpret. The primary
objective of the proposed research is to determine in specific, well-constrained
situations the link between active flow conditions in pyroclastic flows and the
resulting deposits. Because we may be able to determine what is happening within
the flows, the results could have important ramifications for the simulation of
flows in hazards analysis, and for volcanic hazards assessment. The proposed
work will procede with experimental, theoretical and fieldwork phases. The work
will begin by carefully making deposits in the laboratory under well-constrained
flow conditions, using special facilities designed only for the purpose of these
studies. Theoretical modeling will extend the range of applicability of the
experiments by generalizing the observed flow mechanics. Laboratory and
theoretical results will be tested by careful sedimentological analysis of
certain diagnostic portions of pyroclastic flow deposits, especially modern
deposits for which there is some information on active flow conditions.
