The department is acquiring an environmentally and technologically advanced
refrigeration cycle training system for use in the marine refrigeration
laboratory. In addition to currently being an environmental requirement, the
added data acquisition monitoring capability of such a unit expands its use for
the courses offered in thermodynamics and the thermal/fluids laboratories. The
refrigeration laboratory has responded to the challenge of introducing new
refrigeration technology into its curriculum with the phase-out of
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerant K-12 and the introduction of refrigerant
recovery in laboratory exercises beginning in the Fall of 1992. Since this
initial change-out of refrigerant and the introduction of recovery, five new
self-contained 7,000-btu/hr Marine Air System digital control reverse cycle air
conditioners have been added to the laboratory. Through the proposed addition of
a refrigeration cycle training system, which includes an environmentally
acceptable refrigerant and data acquisition monitoring capability, the final
phase for the advancement of technology in the refrigeration laboratory would be
complete.
