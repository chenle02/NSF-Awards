The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) in the state
of Maine is conducted by the Maine Science and Technology Commission, with input
from the Research Excellence Partnership. Maine EPSCoR will enhance the research
competitiveness of over 20 investigators working in three research clusters: (1)
Marine Molecular Biology Research Cluster; and (2) Wood Sciences and Engineering
Research Center (3) Global Environmental Change Center. Collaborations are
proposed among scientists at the University of Maine; the Mount Desert Island
Biological Laboratory; the State Geological Survey; the Bigelow Laboratory for
Ocean Studies, and the Maine Department of Marine Resources. The three research
areas, which were selected on their scientific merits, are of importance to the
State of Maine in terms of research excellence, human resource development, and
opportunities for economic vitality. The objectives for the Maine Advanced
Development Program are: (1) to develop and implement a long range plan for
integrating S&amp;E research, education, and development into the state's
economic development strategy; (2) increase awareness and importance of science
and engineering; (3) build and retain technical expertise; and (4) expand state
support for research. Over the three-year award period the State of Maine will
contribute over $5 million to ensure the success of the EPSCoR effort.
