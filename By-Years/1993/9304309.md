9304309 Habicht The cytokines interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF),
and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are major immunoregulatory molecules, produced by
macrophages, that act as molecular orchestrators of host defense mechanisms
against a variety of environmental insults. The immunological effects of these
cytokines are many. Equally important are their effects as mediators of
nonspecific host defense mechanisms. The exquisite action of cytokines in fine
tuning and controlling the inflammatory/immune response led to the hypothesis
that these molecules have been highly conserved through evolution. It was
reasoned that IL-1 or a similar ancestral cytokine is likely to be present in
the invertebrates for several reasons. First, the molecular conservation of IL-1
and its host defense functions have been preserved in the vertebrates. Second,
macrophages which produce IL-1 are present throughout the animal kingdom.
Echinoderms and urochordates belong to the deuterostomes as do the vertebrates,
while all the other invertebrates are members of the protostomes. Results from
this laboratory have demonstrated the presence of cytokines in both major groups
of invertebrates. The goals of this research are to determine the amino acid and
DNA sequences of invertebrate IL-1 and TNF and compare them with those of the
vertebrates. The functions of these mediators in the invertebrates will be
characterized using starfish systems in vivo and in vitro. %%% The goal of this
research is to characterize, in certain key invertebrate animals, chemical
regulators (cytokines) of their immune-like defense mechanisms. Study of these
invertebrate immune-like defense mechanisms will contribute to understanding of
how a wide range of organisms respond to environmental challenges. In addition,
investigation of the cytokines of more primitive organisms may help us decipher
the complex cellular and humoral interactions of the immune systems of higher
animals. ***
