9312234 Sachs Photo-Electroforming is a new process for the fabrication of high-
precision micro-electro-mechanical devices directly from computer models. The
motivation of the proposed work is to provide to the Mirco-Electro-Mechanical
Systems community a fabrication method which is developed specifically for
Micro-Electro-Mechanical (MEM) applications. One goals is to provide sub-
millimeter components of materials with unique mechanical, electrical and
electromagnetic properties which will allow for the fabrication of new MEM
devices. A second goal is to provide MEM devices of almost arbitrary 3-D
geometry with minimal penalty for increased geometric complexity. ***
