This award supports Dr. Gretar Tryggvason and two graduate students from the
University of Michigan-Ann Arbor in a collaboration with Martin Sommerfeld of
the Department of Mechanical Process and Environmental Protection Engineering at
the Martin Luther University in Halle-Wittenberg. The collaboration brings
together the complementary capabilities of the German and U.S. groups to study
fundamental and applied aspects of multiphase flow. The investigation will
involve computational and experimental studies of bubbly flow and will lead to
improved engineering models for the average properties of flows in bubble
columns. The collaboration will have a direct impact on the modeling of
multiphase flows in engineering. Direct numerical simulations are an emerging
research tool that is providing both fundamental insight into bubbly flows and
direct quantitative data to be used for engineering models in industrial
systems.
