The energy consumed by the memory subsystem is increasing as a fraction of the
overall server energy consumption. It is anticipated that upcoming low-power,
byte-addressable, persistent-memory technologies, namely Phase-Change RAM (PC-
RAM) and Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM), are likely to play a major role in
conserving server energy. These technologies are far superior to Flash and, most
interestingly, may actually replace DRAM as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research will study hybrid memory subsystems by combining these technologies and
DRAM, as well as DRAM-free memory subsystems. The outcomes of this investigation
will be: (1) a body of knowledge about PC-RAM and STT-RAM and their potential
benefits and limitations; (2) a collection of memory controller and operating
system techniques for using these technologies to conserve energy, while
bounding performance degradation to user-defined limits; and (3) a simulation
and operating system infrastructure that can be used by others in their
investigations of memory and energy issues. This work can promote a new
direction in memory subsystem design and energ conservation, one that can have a
profound impact on the design of future servers.
