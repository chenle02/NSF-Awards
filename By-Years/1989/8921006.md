Patterns of dispersal in mammalian population have a profound impact on genetic
structure, population dynamics and social behavior. In the past the migratory
processs has been poorly understood, in large part becuase there have been few
attempts to follow migrating males from one troop to another. The goal of this
study is to conduct observations of male transfer and dispersal in a population
of yellow baboons in the Tana River Primate Reserve, eastern Keya. Observation
of subadult and adult male baboons in three known habituated groups, as well as
periodic censuses of three additional adjacent baboon groups, will provide data
on the patterns of male transfer and tactics used by individual males in
immigration. Moreover, through the analysis of polymorphism in single copy genes
in nuclear DNA coupled with DNA fingerprinting, paternity of infants will be
determined and a quantitative measure of the efficacy of male reproductive
tactics will be obtained. The role of females in influencing patterns of male
transfer will be assessed, along with measurement of the effects of seasonal
patterns of rainfall and the availability of food.
