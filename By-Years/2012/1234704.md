Intellectual Merit: Salt marshes are critical mediators of the flux of material
between the terrestrial and marine realms. The balance of material import,
export, and transformation affects both the marsh itself and the surrounding
estuary. Previous efforts to understand the role of marshes have concentrated
either on examining temporal changes (often at low resolution) of bulk exports,
or compositional changes in exported material with little regard for its
temporal variability. Researchers working at the Skidaway Institute of
Oceanography contend that both the quantity and quality of materials exchanged
between marsh and estuary in tidally-dominated systems along the southeastern US
coast vary significantly in response to semidiurnal, diurnal, tidal,
meteorological and seasonal forcing, and that this variability must be included
when considering the total contributions of marshes to carbon cycling along the
land-ocean boundary. This study will utilize a three-pronged strategy to assess
both the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulate
organic matter (POM) exported from Groves Creek, a well-characterized meso-tidal
salt marsh in coastal Georgia. In particular, by evaluating how marsh function
responds to a full spectrum of present environmental conditions, this project
will provide tangible insight into how carbon cycling in these critical regions
will respond to anticipated changes in those conditions.

Broader Impacts: The broader scientific significance of the study will be an
improved understanding of DOM and POM exchange and transformation in the salt
marsh-estuarine region. This study will also provide valuable opportunities to
undergraduate interns to experience interdisciplinary research. Results of this
work will be disseminated to scientific researchers, regional environmental
managers, and the public on the web, in print, and through Skidaway Institute's
programs of public outreach.
