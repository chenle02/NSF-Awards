This dissertation improvement proposal supports the collection and analysis of
data from scientists who participate in social movements. The research extends
and tests a theory of invol- vement which predicts that an individual's social
power and network ties to others are major determinants of participation.
Scientists are an appropriate group for such a study, because unlike
participants in many social movements, scientists enjoy a relatively privileged
and powerful position in society.
