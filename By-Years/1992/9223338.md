This research will examine the behavior of prices in economies in which
individuals have asymmetric information. Price formation will be carefully
modeled in static and overlapping generation economies where agents may acquire
information concerning the dividend process of risky assets. Preliminary
investigations indicate that asymmetries in information can lead prices to be
more volatile than the underlying dividend stream, and can result in returns
which are larger than those predicted by more standard symmetric information
models. Thus, asymmetric information offers an explanation for the excess
volatility and equity premium puzzles discussed in the literature. The research
will take a close look at how the behavior of prices depends on the particular
information structure as well as a number of other factors including: the
specification of trading rules, risk aversion, costs of obtaining information,
and the size of the economy.
