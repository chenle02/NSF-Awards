9451580 Danowski Over the past four years, the Union College Biology department
has hired three junior faculty members with expertise in modern cellular,
molecular and biochemical techniques. As part of our efforts to incorporate
methodologies and techniques not previously available to our students into our
laboratory curriculum, we propose to establish a dedicated Cellular and
Molecular Biochemistry Laboratory, which will be used for four upper level
undergraduate courses as well as for independent student projects. Specifically,
we want to (1) familiarize our students with modern techniques used in research
and medical laboratories, (2) extend their understanding of cellular and
molecular structure, function and engineering through the use of computer-aided
imaging, visualization and design programs, (3) Develop an integrated laboratory
experience demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of biochemistry, cell, and
molecular biology, and (4) allow students to develop an independence and
competence in the laboratory that can in turn be applied to the pursuit of
independent research projects. To accomplish these goals, we have begun by
establishing three new and one redesigned laboratory/lecture courses, which
incorporate basic molecular techniques and limited computer analysis. However,
to achieve our goals, we need additional laboratory and imaging equipment,
microscopes, computers and software. By designing a single laboratory facility
for these courses and for student research, we eliminate the need for duplicated
equipment and provide a dedicated workspace for our students to work outside of
class. Laboratory sections will be kept small (8-10 students), making it-
possible to undertake more complex experiments, provide more extensive
supervision, and a more realistic research lab environment.
