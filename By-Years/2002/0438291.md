ABSTRACT NSF-0438921

RZHETSKY, ANDREY

Analysis of complex subjects, such as human psychiatric disorders, is currently
fragmented into multiple scientific communities, which often have little or none
interactions. It is quite possible, even likely, that powerful cues to finding
remedies to numerous human maladies can be found right now provided that
disparate pieces of the knowledge puzzle are combined in one head. It would be
even more desirable to have the unordered collection of facts substituted with a
quantitative probabilistic model allowing for formal evaluations of model
predictions, analysis of discrepancies between data points, and hypothesis
testing. The long-term research plan would address many issues, such as
compiling the data, converting interactions into beliefs and amplifying the data
associated with each node. The test of the feasibility of this vision begins
with a well-known system, cell-cycle network in the baker.s yeast to reproduce
with belief network formalism the known phenotypic effects for yeast. The goals
in this analysis would be (1) define applicability boundaries of the belief
network methodology as applied to pathway data, (2) demonstrate feasibility of
the approach, and (3) use the resulting model as a proof-of-principle for a
larger study. The next step would include modeling with belief networks the
knowledge that has been compiled over a few years on autism in humans, with a
focus on automated conversion of molecular interaction data into belief
networks, computation of probabilities for individual interactions,
incorporation of expert inputs and experiments with reasoning over the network.
The PI and a graduate student will be engaged in this project.
