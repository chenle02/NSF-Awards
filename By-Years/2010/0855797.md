This collaborative grant to the Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Colorado
School of Mines is to fund a study on the feasibility of creating a research
center in the area of materials recovery and recyclability. The PIs plan to meet
with industry leaders to help determine the need and sustainability for a
government, industry, and academic partnership to work on research issues relate
to innovative recovery and recycling technologies that maximize the capture of
scrap while minimizing the quantity of scrap to be captured.

Strategies will be planned with industry input to develop and build systems that
optimize recovery and recycling technologies including: increased recyclability;
developing sensors to identify metals and separation technologies to sort the
waste stream; and establishing materials sensors, processes, and controls to
achieve greater tolerance of scrap metal input for downstream recycling
processes. Materials recovery and recycling research would be multi-disciplinary
involving physics, mathematics, computer science, economics, management
sciences, materials science, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering.
Generic science and technology developed by the center could have applicability
in metallic alloys while providing economic and societal benefits. Energy
savings and avoidance of pollution represent a compelling reason to establish
this center as well as interests from a broad societal need throughout the
supply chain involving scrap yards, disassembling companies, municipal waste
centers, shredding companies, smelters, foundries, and consumers.
