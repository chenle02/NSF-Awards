This award will support collaborative research in statistics and probability
between Dr. David Mason, University of Delaware and Professor Paul Deheuvels,
Laboratory for Theoretical and Applied Statistics, University of Paris VI,
France. The investigators will focus on the following areas: 1) increment
processes, which include functional laws of the iterated logarithm for the
increments of the empirical process, nonparametric function estimation and two
sample Bahaduir-Kiefer test statistics, and 2) tail processes, which among other
problems encompass statistical inference about the tails of a distribution and
testing for outliers. Inference about the upper tail of a distribution has a
large number of important applications, such as in insurance to estimate the
probability of a large claim or in engineering to determine a reasonable safe
height to construct a dam or oil platform. The two investigators are considered
leading researchers in this area of mathematics and the proposed project will
benefit from their complementary expertise and previous successful collaborative
efforts.
