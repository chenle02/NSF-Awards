9306493 Fleming An important function of estradiol(E2) is to regulate growth and
differentiation of endometrial cells by causing changes in their RNA
transcriptional program. Experiments are planned to allow detection of changing
mRNA levels in cultured human endometrial cells in response to physiological
concentrations of E2. The Ishikawa cell line has been shown to retain its
ability to respond to E2: proliferation can be stimulated and specific proteins
can be induced. Changing levels of mRNAs will be studied in a systematic way
during the first 24 hours following the addition of E2. Other mRNAs (secondary
responses) will not appear for many hours because their induction requires the
synthesis of a protein induced as part of the primary response. Experiments are
suggested to detect these two different classes of mRNA. Additional experiment
are planneed to look for other classes of mRNAs induced by E2 in these cells and
to study and compare characterstic responses of different classes of mRNA to
different inhibitors. ***
