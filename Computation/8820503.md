This project is concerned with the development of interactive computer graphics
to provide mathematicians with tools for investigating a wide range of global
phenomena in differential geometry and topology, especially singular phenomena
encountered in one-parameter deformations and in projections from higher
dimensional spaces. In addition, this project involves also an undergraduate
research group and an outreach effort which cooperates with secondary schools
programs to promote better public appreciation of mathematics.
