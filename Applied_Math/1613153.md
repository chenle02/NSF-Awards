This award supports the ongoing research program of the Principal Investigator
on the mathematical analysis of some problems arising in engineering and applied
science, in particular involving fluids in thin domains and thin elastic
structures. The Principal Investigator will combine techniques from several
areas of mathematics to study certain engineering design problems. These
problems are linked by their "singular limits" context and the fact that their
solutions are tuned to a variable geometry setting or to a-posteriori obtained
geometrical constraints. The topics that will be tackled fall into four
categories: (1) dimension reduction in fluid dynamics (e.g., determining
effective two-dimensional models for the behavior of a fluid in a thin domain),
(2) modeling and analysis of the shape of a growing body (as in various contexts
in biology), (3) rigidity and flexibility of elastic prestrained materials (as
caused, for example, by inhomogeneous growth or swelling or shrinkage), (4)
energy scaling regimes in elasto-plastic materials (for which deformations are
irreversible beyond a certain point).

The following analytical techniques will be investigated: (1) dimension
reduction and homogenization of compressible Navier-Stokes equations using
relative entropy and scaling of the Korn and the conformal Korn inequalities in
thin domains, (2) a novel "controlled growth" model, due to A. Bressan, that
couples the partial differential equation for the transport of morphogen-
producing cells (in cellular biology) with two constrained minimization problems
for the morphogen concentration and the growth velocity, (3) variational models
in prestrained elasticity in the presence of the Monge-Ampere constraint without
any a-priori assumption on the structure of its minimizers (such as convexity,
higher regularity, or boundary conditions) studied using convex integration, (4)
dimension reduction via Gamma-convergence in the context of elasto-plasticity.
