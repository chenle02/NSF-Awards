The project is an investigation into the representation theory and cohomology of
finite groups over fields of prime characteristic. The Principal Investigator is
particularly interested in the homological properties of representations which
underlie the basic module theory. He plans to consider a question open for more
than 20 years on the classification of a specific type of modules that play an
important role in the larger category theory of the modules, and also to look
the structure of the cohomology ring of the group which acts on the fundamental
homological constructions. Carlson and his collaborators have shown that many
facets of the module category are controlled by the group cohomology of
p-subgroups. The proposed work would build on this foundation. Other projects
involve investigations of the structure of module categories of finite groups
and the general theory of extensions of modules. Results from the project could
be of interest in the area of algebraic topology as well as in representation
theory. Professor Carlson plans to continue his development of computer algebra
systems for experimentation with modules and homomorphisms. He intends to expand
his collection of programs for the computation of group cohomology and other
aspects of the module theory. The programs are also being rewritten for more
general applications in the area of the representation theory of algebras.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In basic terms the Principal Investigator will look at
certain types of algebraic systems together with the actions of operators. Such
a system is called a module and it might have many dimensions in the sense of
depending on many variable. The operations may represent something like the
geometric rotation of points on a space. The project will concentrate on the
classification and properties of modules whose associated operators have a
preset collection of interactions. A significant part of the project is the
development of computational techniques and software for analyzing the structure
and properties of modules. Groups of transformations on modules and spaces are
basic objects in modern mathematics and arise in many applications of the
mathematics. Some of the methods of the study are closely related to geometric
techniques used in topology.
