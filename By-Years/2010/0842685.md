Communities of animals that grow on surfaces in the sea originate and maintain
themselves by the steady recruitment of minute larvae produced by animals. The
larvae of sponges, clams, snails, worms, etc., swim in the sea for various
periods of time and then must settle in the right places to survive, grow and
reproduce. In this way, both desired marine animals, such as those important to
marine farming (e.g., clams, oysters, shrimp and lobsters) and undesirable ones,
such as those that make up the fouling communities on boats, piers, and power
plant pipes (e.g., sponges, barnacles, mussels and tube worms) become
established and are maintained. This research will focus on members of the
fouling community and ask questions about how tiny larvae can recognize specific
surface requirements and settle onto them in the kinds of very active water
movement that characterize all marine habitats.
