This project investigates the biology of light receptors in plants, specifically
in the nightshades, a plant family which includes agriculturally important
crops, such as potato, tomato, pepper, and eggplant. Plant light receptors
enable a plant to assess and evaluate the conditions of its environmental
surroundings and allows it to make developmental decisions that ensure
reproductive success. Such decisions include, among others, the timing of
germination, leaf development, flower production and fruit set. Specifically,
this project aims to better understand the function of two light receptors in
tomato in the context of their role in determining the plantâ€™s architecture and
overall shape. The project is conducted at a liberal arts college and emphasizes
educational opportunities in research for undergraduates. One aspect of the
project is to develop a research-based laboratory for first-semester Biology
students investigating the genetic underpinnings of early fruit producing garden
tomatoes. Through collaboration with a college in rural central Washington
educational opportunities will also be made available to students in regions of
the state with a traditionally less developed scientific
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the contributions
of the light receptor phytochrome, specifically phytochromes E and F in tomato,
to photomorphogenesis and development. Like the model plant Arabidopsis
thaliana, tomato and other nightshades have five phytochrome genes. Gene
duplications of ancestral phytochrome genes occurred after the split of the
Solanaceae from the Brassicaceae. This has led to differentiation between these
two plant families in the functionality of each set of phytochrome genes. To
this date, loss of function mutations for PHYE and PHYF have not been available
in tomato. We have recently developed knock out mutants in these genes using
CRISPR technology. During this granting period higher order mutants will be
constructed and phenotypically evaluated. To determine the role that
phytochromes E and F play in light-regulated signal transduction, RNA-seq
coupled with co-expression network analysis will be conducted. Using information
from these gene networks will enable us to formulate new testable hypotheses
regarding the physiological functions of phytochromes in the
nightshades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
