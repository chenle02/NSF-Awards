The Arecibo observatory and the powerful HF source at Islote when supplemented
by portable HF and ULF receivers comprise a major natural laboratory for
studying the midlatitude ionosphere. This grant is to study the effects observed
when the ionosphere over Arecibo is irradiated with two strong HF signals. By
measuring simultaneously the amplitudes of these waves, the contribution of the
beat - frequency wave on sideband production will be assessed. Further studies
will be undertaken which will examine the propagation characteristics of the
launched ULF wave. The proposed experiments will aid in understanding the roles
of the relevant nonlinear processes. *** //
