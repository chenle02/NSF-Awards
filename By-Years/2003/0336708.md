The Doppler on Wheels (DOW) program at the University of Oklahoma (in close
collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric Research) has developed
single beam, mobile Doppler radars. These have enabled the collection of very
high resolution Doppler data on a variety of meteorological phenomena including
tornadoes and convective storms in mountains. These data have allowed major
advances to be made in the atmospheric sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the
NSF Major Research Instrumentation program, the Principal Investigator will
develop an advanced, five-beam mobile Doppler radar. This will allow researchers
to acquire rapid scan Doppler radar information at higher temporal resolution
than previously possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a compelling need for
three-dimensional Doppler radar observations on short time scales. Tornadoes,
small-scale boundary layer structures in hurricanes, microbursts and other
phenomena evolve on time scales that are unobservable using traditional radars.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An innovative design will permit rapid-scan observations
using a hybrid electronic/mechanical scanning system with multiple simultaneous
transmit and receive beams. This instrument will be used by researchers to open
up new avenues of research.&lt;br/&gt;
