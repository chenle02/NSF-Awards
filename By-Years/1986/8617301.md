This award is for an exploratory study of the feasibility of developing
synthetic seismograms which more realistically account for the energy
transferred from the ground into a structure, together with a more realistic
representation of the structural response. As presently used, synthetic
seismograms represent the dynamic structural response as a linear single degree
of freedom system. The PI will investigate synthetic seismograms which account
for the multi-modal non-linear response of the structure. In addition, these
seismograms will encompass the features of an ensemble of real earthquake
records which could conceivably be experienced at the site and during the design
life of a particular facility.
