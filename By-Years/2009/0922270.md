Funds from this grant support the collaborative development of software tools,
data management needs and community training support in an effort to establish
the foundations of a national facility (INTERFACE) to help geoscientists in
obtaining high resolution, high precision, 3-D surface data. The facility will
provide a one-stop shop for users at any experience level to obtain
instrumentation, software, and instruction in the collection of earth surface
data by Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR).
Existing TLS instruments will be made available for community use through
UNAVCO. Ancillary equipment and processing and visualization software would also
be made available through the UNAVCO facility. Development of software tools to
establish standard workflows for taking users through all steps of obtaining
high-quality surface data and visualizing results will be initiated. Community
education and outreach through the establishment of best practices for equipment
and software use, the conduct of numerous classroom and field instructional
sessions, and establishment of a data archive and retrieval portal will be
supported.
