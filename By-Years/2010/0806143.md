#0806143&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigators from the University of
Alaska Fairbanks, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and the University of
Washington have received funding to test a novel method for measuring the
magnitude and variability of subglacially discharged water. Understanding such
discharges is one of the greatest gaps in our knowledge of ice sheet and glacier
mass balance, but we currently lack a method of measuring the discharges. These
investigators will use acoustic signals from turbulent upwelling, bubble
formation, and sediment collisions to quantify the magnitude and variability of
subglacial freshwater discharge. The research will be documented by a filmmaker
from Montana State University?s Science and Natural History Filmmaking
program.&lt;br/&gt;
