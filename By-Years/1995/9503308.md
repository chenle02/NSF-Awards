9503308 Fouke This proposal supports part of a conference on Engineering in
Medicine and Biology, namely that part that deals with "Tissue Engineering".
This support will bring together leading researchers in this area, provide a
forum for discussion of developments and future work, and at the same time
provide an opportunity for interested parties to gain a wider knowledge of this
new and important sub-field in bioengineering. ***
