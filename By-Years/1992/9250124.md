A human-computer interaction laboratory at the Psychology Department of the
University of Illinois at Urbana is being enhanced for students from the fields
of Industrial Engineering, Human Factors, and Cognitive Science. The new
laboratory experiments provide a detailed account of human capabilities and
limitations affecting interface design in general, but giving particular
emphasis as it relates to computer products. The state-of-the-art
interdisciplinary laboratory is oriented to the design and evaluation of human-
computer interfaces. Students from Computer Science, Psychology, and Industrial
Engineering are learning the basic concepts, methodology, and skills necessary
to evaluate and design human-computer interfaces. The multi-disciplinary
perspectives that are necessary for the successful design of computer products
are fostered as part of the educational process when students from these
different disciplines are brought together.
