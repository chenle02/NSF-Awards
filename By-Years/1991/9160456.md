The proposal aims to determine the feasibility of a sophisticated system for
retrieving statistical data about risk and prognosis, as a means of aiding
decisions for physicians whose practice include breast-cancer patients. The
proposed research will use survey methodology---including surveys of physicians
and medical schools---to determine practicing physician's statistical
environment, including their training, their perceived need for and attitudes
about statistical data, and their use of computers and computerized databases. A
set of statistical training modules will also be used to assess physicians'
statistical experience. The data analysis will characterize the responding
population and will identify potential barriers to physicians' use of
computerized data retrieval and decision systems. These data will be used to
develop guidelines for the user interface of such systems, with particular
emphasis on compensating for the identified barriers. An on-line 'help' system,
providing reviews of basic concepts and targeting likely errors of
interpretation (for which the statistical modules will be a prototype) is viewed
as a potentially important component of the interface.
