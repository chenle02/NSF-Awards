ABSTRACT OPP-95-27788 LARSON This proposal is for initial support of an Alaska
Native Science Commission (ANSC). The concept was developed following a series
of planning meetings organized by the Alaska Federation of Natives in concert
with the University of Alaska Anchorage and other scientific and indigenous
groups. The mission of the ANSC is to facilitate the integration of indigenous
knowledge into science; influence priorities in research; mandate participation
of Alaska Natives at all levels of science; provide mechanisms for the feedback
of results; promote science to young people; encourage Native people to enter
science; and to ensure that Native people share in the economic benefits derived
from their intellectual property.
