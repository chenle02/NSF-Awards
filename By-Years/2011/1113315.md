This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
targeted delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to HER2 overexpressing tumor
cells using a unique Shiga-like toxin 1A (SLT1A) scaffold. Molecular Templates
has developed a SLT1A library of variants containing a unique 12 amino acid
insert, allowing each SLT1A variant unique binding characteristics. SLT1A toxin
intrinsically facilitates endocytosis and intracellular routing into the
cytosol. This proposed work will demonstrate targeted intracellular delivery of
siRNA to HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cells using proprietary HER2-specific
SLT1A variants. This work will enable the development of a platform technology
that can selectively bind to diseased cells, force cellular uptake of the siRNA-
toxin construct, and ensure proper intracellular routing of the siRNA into the
cytosol for maximal therapeutic benefit.

The broader/commercial impacts of this research will be to provide a novel drug
delivery technology that could lead to new therapeutics for a variety of human
diseases. As siRNA therapy is being pursued for various genetic, viral, and
cancerous diseases, technologies to selectively deliver siRNA to diseased tissue
are needed. Current innovations in siRNA delivery are focused on selective
binding to diseased cells using nanoparticles conjugated to antibodies,
aptamers, or peptides. However, these ligand-targeted approaches often poorly
facilitate endocytosis, endosomal escape, and/or cytosolic delivery of siRNA.
Thus, the intrinsic characteristics of our SLT1A variant library to accomplish
proper intracellular delivery of siRNA along with selective binding to diseased
cells of interest would help overcome a significant problem in delivery of siRNA
therapeutics.
