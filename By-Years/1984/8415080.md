This work deals with a major problem in thermal systems--the understanding of
the complex heterogeneous processes occurring within liquid-fueled chemical
combustors employing spray injection techniques and their effects on combustor
efficiency and exhaust purity. An experimental investigation will be conducted
on multicomponent, multidroplet combustion in a reactive fuel/oxidizer
environment simulating the spray interior, and a theoretical study on jet
ignition will be made.
