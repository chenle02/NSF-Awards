The project will lead to an understanding of the mass spectral fragmentation
patterns associated with metal ion binding to proteins. The work will
concentrate on gas-phase studies of cationic and anionic complexes between
peptides and alkaline earth and transition metal (II) ions. The mechanisms of
the fragmentation reactions will be studied so that information about the
location of the metal ion in the fragmenting complex can be obtained.
Fragmentations of complexes between the metal ions and particular amino acid
sequences that are known to be specific metal-ion binding sites will be
investigated. The fragmentation pattern of specially designed peptides will be
probed with a view to forming specific intramolecular chelates with metal ions.
The work promises to increase our fundamental understanding of the fragmentation
of large biomolecular ions and metal-peptide complexes. %%% The research, in the
general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses on the use of mass
spectrometry to study the gas-phase chemistry of ionic complexes between
peptides and metal ions. The project promises to increase our understanding of
how metal ions bind to peptides, which is key to the behavior of these important
components of living systems.
