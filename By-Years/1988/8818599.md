The program is devoted to the synthesis and characterization of novel conductive
and magnetic materials based on metal-organic (M(L)) complexes. Section I of
this proposal describes the study of quasi one-dimensional molecular metals that
are propared from metalloporphyrins and phthalocyanines. These show remarkable
properties without parallel in other classes of material, in particular a new
type of low-temperature condensation within an M(L) stack that exhibits a one-
dimensional spine of metal-ion local moments embedded within the "Fermi Sea" of
a conducting organic framework. Section II describes the synthesis of planar
surfur-encircled metallomacrocycles that can engage in highly three-dimensional
interactions. These compounds will also be used to prepare multi-metal porphyrin
complexes and well-defined, two-dimensional metal-linked polymers that will be
studied as films and fibers. Section III describes the preparation of new
materials based on tris-dichalcogenide complexes of transition-metal ions. These
complexes provide inherently three-dimensional building blocks for the synthesis
of molecular metals, superconductors and ferromagnets.
