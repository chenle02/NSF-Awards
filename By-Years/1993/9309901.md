9309901 Lawrence Digital, photometric images of line-of-sight solar magnetic and
velocity fields, obtained at high spatial resolution, will be analyzed using
modern fractal, wavelet transform and percolation methods. This study will
develop a quantitative, non- morphological, approach to the structural
properties of solar magnetic fields over a range of spatial scales. The results
of the analysis will be used to confront random dynamo models of the generation
of small-scale photospheric magentic fields, on the one hand, with the observed
field distributions, on the other. ***
