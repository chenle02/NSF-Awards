The primary goal of the project is to enhance secondary mathematics teacher
education for pre-service teachers by developing, implementing and disseminating
resources from a four-course curriculum that brings together the study of
mathematics content and pedagogy. Three of the courses are problem-based
technology enhanced (PBTE) courses in Algebra and Calculus, Geometry, and
Probability and Statistics. A fourth course is a capstone course in Teaching and
Learning Secondary School Mathematics. The courses are motivated by reform-based
ideas and will depend on research on learning, standards based curricula,
multiple forms of assessment and proven strategies for integrating technology
into mathematics education. Curriculum materials are being tested at several
pilot sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
