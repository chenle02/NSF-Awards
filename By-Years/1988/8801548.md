This is a research project in mathematical physics. The main focus is on
Schroedinger operators, which are basic to the modelling of physical systems at
the microscopic level. In particular, the spectrum of such an operator is
interpreted as the set of possible energy levels of the system. Professor
Howland will investigate spectral properties of various Schroedinger operators
in which the potential term is either random or time-periodic. The underlying
physical issues have some degree of contact with condensed matter theory, and
therefore with such things as superconductivity.
