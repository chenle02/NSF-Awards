9154382 Gregory Decision Science specialists at Decision Science Research
Institute together with teachers at the Eugene (oregon) 4-J School District are
developing ten to twelve modules focussing on teaching decision-making skills to
secondary school students. The project focuses on decision making in science
areas related to human health and to the environment. Students will learn to
represent decision opportunities in terms of expected consequences of different
choices and the perceived desirability of those choices. The material will
present the four themes of decision thinking, structuring, uncertainty and
tradeoffs and show that values are important and decision making is purposeful,
there are future events that cannot be controlled or predicted, personal choices
have an influence on future directions, and different choices result in
different benefits, risks and costs. Instructional modules will be developed and
evaluated on the basis of their success in encouraging better decisions as well
as their ability to enhance decision making skills in science domains.
Dissemination will be conducted with assistance from the International Society
for Technology in Education. ***
