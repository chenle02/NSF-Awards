Northern wintertime atmospheric fluctuations on very large (near global)
spatial scales and monthly to seasonal temporal scales are associated with
geographically-fixed standing oscillations with large wavelike structure. One
such pattern which often influences the seasonal character over the U.S. is
referred to as the PNA pattern because of clear connections between atmospheric
states over the near-equatorial Pacific Ocean and North America. This pattern
(called PNA teleconnection pattern) is often enhanced during warming events (El
Nino/Southern Oscillation episodes) in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. While the
spatial pattern is well known, its time behavior, including onset, maturity, and
decay, are not yet understood. These properties are important to understanding
the dynamical nature of intra-seasonal variability and to developing numerical
methods for their prediction. The PIs, Drs. Wallace and Kushnir are proposing to
carry out systematic diagnostic studies of the temporal behavior of such
teleconnection patterns. The proposal concerns the study of atmospheric
teleconnection patterns on time scales of 30-150 days. The analysis emphasizes a
comparison between the observations and general circulation model data from the
NCAR CCM. The 30-150 day fluctuations will be isolated in the data using digital
filtering. The patterns will be identified using a rotated principal component
analysis. The goals of the study are: (a)To determine the characteristics of the
temporal evolution of the patterns (b)To identify the changes in the circulation
during periods of onset and decay of the patterns.
