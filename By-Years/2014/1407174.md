Geometric complexity theory is an approach to P versus NP and related problems
in complexity theory using algebraic geometry and representation theory. A
fundamental problem in representation theory, believed to be important for this
approach, is the Kronecker problem, which asks for a positive combinatorial
formula for decomposing the tensor product of two irreducible representations of
the symmetric group into irreducibles. The theory of quantum groups and crystal
bases, which has been actively developed over the last several decades, is a
powerful tool for connecting combinatorics and representation theory. In the
last decade, there have been several attempts, by Berenstein, Zwicknagl,
Mulmuley, Sohoni, and others, to use this tool to study the Kronecker and
related plethysm problems. Recently, the investigator and his collaborators
Mulmuley and Sohoni have obtained the beginnings of a theory of crystal bases
for the Kronecker problem. The main goal of this project is to push this
approach further. More broadly, this project aims to further explore the
potentially deep connections between complexity theory and positivity in
algebraic combinatorics as has been initiated by geometric complexity theory.

Objects arising in algebra are typically complicated, mysterious, and have many
symmetries. Algebraic combinatorics is the study of counting and organizing such
objects. This project will explore some surprising connections between this area
and complexity theory (the study of algorithms and their limitations). The
tensor decomposition problem is an important and difficult problem that shows up
in many fields, including algebraic combinatorics, complexity theory, and
statistics, and has applications in medicine, computer vision, chemistry, and
fast matrix multiplication. Essentially, it is the problem of recovering
individual signals from a mixture of signals. This project offers potential new
insights into this problem by applying powerful tools from algebraic
combinatorics.
