Increasing the effectiveness of teaching through the increased utilization of
computerized learning is the objective of a project being implemented in the
Economics Department at Western Illinois University. A multi-user multiprocessor
computer and specialized software is being used to expand and enhance the
capabilities of the Department's Advanced Learning System (ALS) that provides
students with a choice of the manner in which they learn. In addition, the
incorporation of new analytic software packages into upper-level courses and the
Honors Program is providing "hands-on" computer experience for students
preparing for specific careers. Significant improvements in undergraduate
instruction in economics are being implemented.
