El Infiernillo and La Villita earth dams in Mexico have been subjected to a
number of earthquakes since their construction, but especially the Mexican
earthquake of September 19, 1985. Measurements of strong-motion acceleration,
crest displacements, and settlements were obtained during several of these
earthquakes. This research program will utilize this information to verify
numerical analysis techniques developed as a result of studies in the earthquake
response of dams in the United States. In particular, the effects of successive
earthquakes in changing the stress conitions, motion response, and performance
of the foundation materials, will be examined.
