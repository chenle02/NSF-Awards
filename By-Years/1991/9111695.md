The University of Houston Gene-Server was made public in 1988 as an electronic
mail server for Genbank entries. At that time, such a service was not available
elsewhere (now Intelligenetics is also providing a similar service). Over time,
support for the PIR database was added, and various analytical software packages
were also added to the distribution system. Today, PIR entries are updated
quarterly, GenBank weekly, and software as available. GeneServer also provides
anonymous ftp access to its contents. The Gene-Server has now been operating for
26 months and has responded to more than 5000 requests for information from
researchers around the world. With additional support, the system will be
expanded with additional disk space and additional services to meet the needs of
the molecular biology community.
