Exploration is a very basic, conspicuous and biologically important behavior of
mammals. At the same time, it is complex and involves important experiential and
developmental parameters. Dr. Renner's research project consists of several
investigations designed to provide detailed descriptive information about the
spontaneous exploratory behavior of rats. This objective will be accomplished by
recording videotapes of rat exploration, followed by transcription of these
recordings using existing methods for measuring exploratory behavior, as well as
by applying for the first time a standardized movement.notation technique to the
analysis of interactions with inanimate objects. Such an account, if available,
could be used as benchmark data for several types of studies, including
investigations into the functional significance of spontaneous exploration,
research on its relationship to other behaviors related to learning and
information.processing, and the study of the biological mechanisms controlling
these behaviors.
