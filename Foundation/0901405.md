The PI intends to work on three different topics involving descriptive set
theory and its applications in Banach space theory and topological dynamics.
Firstly, he intends to further elaborate on the structure theory of large Polish
group and, in particular, automorphism groups of countable first order
structures. The PI's main interest in this domain is the existence of generic
representations of countable discrete groups in such automorphism groups and its
uses in investigating the dynamics and algebraic structure of the automorphism
group. Secondly, the PI will be working on the classical problem of J.P.R.
Christensen of whether any universally measurable homomorphism between Polish
groups is continuous. Again, this problem is tightly connected with the geometry
and dynamical properties of Polish groups and very likely to leads to new
techniques and concepts of value outside of the study of automatic continuity.
Finally, Rosendal will be continuing his collaboration with V. Ferenczi on the
rough classification of separable Banach spaces, a programme initiated by W. T.
Gowers in the course of the solution to the homogeneous space problem. This
programme heavily relies on Ramsey theoretical and game theoretical methods from
descriptive set theory and thus enriches both descriptive set theory by
developing new techniques and functional analysis by contributing to one of the
most central problems of Banach space theory.



In recent years, there has been a growing collaboration and sharing of ideas
between researchers working in dynamical systems and descriptive set theory.
Initially, this was largely fostered by work on Borel equivalence relations but
has lately also come to include topological dynamics. The principal objectives
of descriptive set theory consists in studying the definable subsets of the real
line, showing that these are much better behaved than arbitrary subsets. This
has developed into a large structure theory of such sets which gives a solid
framework within which most of mathematical analysis takes place, and as such,
the use of descriptive set theoretical techniques in parts of functional
analysis is continuously expanding.
