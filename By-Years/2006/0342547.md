This project will investigate informal technology education outcomes for people
who engage in community network activities. It will develop and evaluate an
infrastructure for highly interactive and collkaborative World-Wide Web
projects, populated with community-built examples, and incorporating end-user
authorizing tools and instructional materials designed to support informal,
community-oriented community-oriented learning-by-doing of Web programming. It
will document case studies of example application development utilizing this
infrastructure, and an empirical evaluation of the technology literacy impacts
that result from these application development activities; the empirical
evaluation will also exmine career choice and employment outcomes, and
collateral community impacts. It will produce a participatory design model for
community groups (including an analysis of the boundary conditions for such an
approach). It will investigate the hypothesis that the learning of information
technology skills, and motivation for applying those skills, is increased and
sustaied when people are emopowered to become producers rather than consumers of
technology (i.e via end-user authorizing tools) and when they are provided with
a meaningful contxt for learning and application that persists beyond and
independently of the immediate learning context (i.e., the community). The
potential impacts of this project are large. Thirteen community groups that vary
according to age, gender, socio-economic status, and ethnicity will be included
in this study. The model that is developed will be disseminated to other
communities.
