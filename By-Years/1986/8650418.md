This project aims to upgrade the analytical chemistry education of under-
graduate students at York College of Pennsylvania by incorporating the use of
computer-controlled UV/visible and atomic absorption spectrophotometers into the
laboratory coursework of the analytical chemistry sequence. In the first
analytical course, students will use the computer-controlled instruments to
study modern techniques of chemical analysis similar to those performed in
industrial laboratories. The instrumentation will also enhance the second
analytical course, in which students learn principles of instrument design as
well as instrumental analytical techniques.
