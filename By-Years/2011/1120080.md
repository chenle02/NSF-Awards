Loeselia is an obscure and little studied lineage in the flowering plant family
Polemoniaceae (phlox family), which includes two genera: Loeselia L. and Dayia
J.M. Porter. Despite the lack of detailed knowledge about the lineage, Loeselia
has played a pivotal role in hypotheses concerning the origin of temperate
members of Polemoniaceae from tropical ancestors. This research program will
provide a better understanding of Loeselia (with 22 or more species).
Preliminary studies of comparative DNA sequences provide evidence that Loeselia
is composed of two groups of species based on ancestry, corresponding to
Loeselia L. and Dayia J.M. Porter. Exhaustive taxon sampling within Loeselia and
dense sampling of related groups will be used to develop an understanding of
genealogical relationships (phylogeny) within and among species, using
chloroplast and nuclear DNA sequences, morphological, and anatomical data.

Evidence generated through this research will lead to a new classification
system and the first comprehensive monographs of Loeselia, including keys,
descriptions, illustrations, distribution maps, and on-line resources. The
studies of character evolution, using the same data, will provide a model for
analyses of variation in reproductive traits such as self-incompatibility and
floral symmetry, which is thought to be an important generator of flowering
plant diversity.
