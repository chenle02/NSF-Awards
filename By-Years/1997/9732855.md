Indiana University The proposed activity is a workshop which focuses upon the
topic of social change and sustainable transport. The workshop represents a
continuation of discussions on cooperative and collaborative research under this
theme with the European Science Foundation. It will bring together scholars from
geography, economics, political science, regional science, and sociology to
discuss the formulation of a detailed research agenda that builds upon the
earlier workshop discussions. The purpose of the workshop is to identify basic
transport science projects that will benefit from collaboration with European
counterparts. A part of these discussions will involve appropriate methodologies
and data availability and acquisition. The project will result in a conference
report that will be broadly distributed to appropriate communities of scholars.
