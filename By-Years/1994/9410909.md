9410909 Leer ABSTRACT The objective of this research project is to produce a
relational database documenting the genetic relationship of Tlingit, Eyak, and
Athabaskan, plus explanatory prose. The main tables within the database will
include (a) a combined morpheme list for the (proto-) languages compared, (b)
citations for Proto-Athabaskan reconstructions and other comparisons in the
published and unpublished literature, (c) the cognate sets themselves, (d) sets
of conceivably interrelated cognate sets, and (e) tables of regular sound
correspondences. The database and prose explanation will be disseminated in the
form of sets of diskettes that are compatible with either MacIntosh or DOS-
based computers.
