The strong motion data recorded during the Whittier Narrows (California)
earthquake of October 1, 1987 included not only ground motion data, but also a
detailed record of the motion induced in buildings. The type, quality and
quantity of this data is unique and constitutes a potential source of
information on many aspects of earthquake hazard mitigation. To realize this
potential, the data must be digitized and processed. Moreover, correlation and
comparison between records from different sites requires a knowledge of the
absolute times at various strong motion stations: this can yield detailed
interpretations of the response of structures. This action is to provide funds
for the processing of the strong motion accelerograms maintained in the Los
Angeles basin by the University of Southern California.
