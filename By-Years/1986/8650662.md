At Lebanon Valley College, the Animal Physiology laboratory historically has
emphasized human physiology at the organismic level. The current instructor
(director of this project) has taken steps to move the course in a more
comparative and more cellular direction. Laboratory exercises now include enzyme
kinetics and small mammal metabolism. To implement this change effectively, more
sophisticated instrumentation was needed to continue the development of new
exercises. This project facilitates the introduction of three exercises which
are designed to elucidate basic physiological principles and to teach basic
physiological techniques. With the new microcomputer-driven instruments provided
through this award, it is possible to expose students in the teaching laboratory
to such topics as membrane potentials, active transport of sodium ions, and
basic principles of neurobiology. The new instrumentation is broadening the
range of student laboratory experience, familiarizing the students with advanced
data gathering techniques, and expanding the opportunities for independent
student research projects. The majority of enrollees are biology or biochemistry
majors who plan to pursue graduate degrees in biology/biochemistry or to attend
professional schools. Approximately one-fourth of the total majors in biology
and biochemistry, excluding freshmen, enroll in this pivotal course each spring
semester.
