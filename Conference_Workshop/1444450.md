This award will fund a CBMS Conference entitled "The Basic Homotopy Lemma, The
Asymptotic Uniqueness Theorem, and Classification of C*-Algebras" with principal
lecturer Huaxin Lin to be held at the University of Wyoming during June of 2015.
The study of operator algebras is one of the major branches of modern
mathematics. It was launched by John von Neumann in 1930's with an aim of
explicating quantum mechanics. The classification of at least the more well-
behaved amenable C*-algebras is considered as one of the main questions at the
moment in operator algebra theory. Recently this subject has been developing
very rapidly, and substantial progress has been made. The main goal of this
conference is to have a detailed and systematic account of this breakthrough in
the classification of C*-algebras, with an emphasis on basic homotopy lemmas and
asymptotic uniqueness theorems. The conference will pull together these recent
results, to get a clear picture of the current status, and to chart the possible
direction of future research. This grant will support the participation of
graduate students and junior faculty members in the conference, and also foster
the production of a monograph which will be used by the wider community. The
topic of the project is on the classification of C*-algebras, the basic homotopy
lemmas, and the asymptotic uniqueness theorems. After the discovery of various
exotic examples of AH-algebras, the program of the classification of amenable
C*-algebras has been focused on the more well-behaved C*-algebras, or the class
of C*-algebras which absorb the Jiang-Su algebra Z. With the one-parameter
deformation technique introduced by Winter, the classification of Z-stable
C*-algebras can be reduced to the construction of a certain homotopy between two
homomorphisms of the rationalized C*-algebras. The existence of such a homotopy
is ensured by Lin's very recent asymptotic uniqueness theorems and basic
homotopy lemmas, which have already had an impact outside classification theory.
