This research aims at the accurate numerical constructions of the full 3+1
dimensional black hole spacetimes. Instead of the traditional approach of using
special time slicings to avoid the singularities inherent in black hole
spacetimes, a new approach using black hole horizons as inner boundaries in
numerical evolution is being developed in full 3-D numerical relativity. Such a
horizon boundary scheme is expected to have major impact on the numerical study
of black holes. The theme of the research is on the numerical study of black
hole spacetimes. Since the LIGO/VIRGO arrays are expected to begin taking data
during this decade, it is important to perform accurate calculations for the
shape and strength of the wave forms generated during collisions of black holes,
as such events are considered to be one of the most interesting sources of
detectable gravitational radiation.
