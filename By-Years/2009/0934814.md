This Phase II Noyce project is supporting eighteen individuals seeking teacher
certification in mathematics or science. Six undergraduates are receiving annual
scholarships of $10,000 for two years and twelve career changers are receiving
one-year scholarships of $10,000. The Noyce scholars teach high school
mathematics or science for two years in a high needs school district for each
year of scholarship received. Phase II continues the integration of research and
teaching that was established during Phase I. Added Phase II activities include
1) a mentorship program; 2) summer professional development workshops; 3) a
summer research institute; and 4) a summer mathematics and science academy.

Currently, 85 school districts recruit teachers graduating from this college.
While the Noyce scholars may complete their service requirement in any high
needs school district, the college is working closely with such local high needs
school districts as Wyandanch Union Free School District, Uniondale School
District, Brentwood Union Free School District, and Central Islip School
District.
