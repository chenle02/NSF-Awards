This program continues studies of solar energetics and dynamics, based on the
Mount Wilson solar tower observing facility and its digital database (dating
back to 1967). The investigator's intent is increasing understanding of the
solar cycle of variability and its influence on Earth's environment. In
addition, he makes his data available to the community via the website.
Specifically, this continuing program: (1) makes magnetogram observations
consisting of magnetograms, dopplergrams and intensitygrams for at least 6 pairs
of line wing samples in four different spectral lines, (2) applies an improved
solar radius definition to the 1986-present data set, and (3) studies the
vertical propagation of acoustic and magnetic oscillations using the sodium D
line.
