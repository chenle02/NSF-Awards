Tree-indexed processes are a way of studying classical tree-related probability
models in a unified and more powerful way. Examples of such models are:
branching random walk, branching Markov chains, first passage percolation on a
tree, parallel searches, random and non-random Cantor sets and hyperbolic
manifolds. Current work on tree-indexed processes is focused on extending some
results on Hausdorff dimensions of random sets and on determining exact capacity
criteria for subsets of the range space to be polar for a given tree-indexed
process. Probability models with branching or tree structure arise in many areas
of science. Much of the classical work on branching processes was motivated by
random family trees that arise in population genetics; the theory of cascades
encompasses atomic chain reactions and rainfall models; more recently, random
trees have been used to study self-similarity (fractal behavior) in spatial
models. By abstracting the common structure of these models into "tree-indexed
processes", we have been able to prove many new results about this class of
models, as well as strengthening previously known results.
