In the upper ocean mixing processes occur which tend to homogenize properties
and disperse organisms throughout the mixed layer. However, organized motions in
the vertical plane may be established due to Langmuir circulations. When these
occur, they may suspend particles and biological species. This study is a
theoretical investigation of the process of suspension of material by organized
circulation. The investigators will utilize concepts from chaotic theory to
calculate the statistics of residence time as functions of depth, the expected
spatial distributions, and the levels of concentration of these suspended
materials.
