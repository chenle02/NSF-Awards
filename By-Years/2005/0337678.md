The rapid aseismic deformation that often follows earthquakes
&lt;br/&gt;provides a natural opportunity to learn about the mechanical behavior
&lt;br/&gt;of the Earth's crust. Geodetic data sets documenting postseismic
&lt;br/&gt;deformation have become much more plentiful and detailed in the last
&lt;br/&gt;few years, yet many studies of these data sets have been limited to
&lt;br/&gt;documenting that a particular mechanism "is consistent with" the
&lt;br/&gt;observed data. The wide variety of candidate mechanisms that have
&lt;br/&gt;been proposed as the responsible process testifies to the importance
&lt;br/&gt;of postseismic deformation in geodynamics, but also to our current
&lt;br/&gt;lack of understanding of this phenomenon. The proposed study will
&lt;br/&gt;combine a modeling framework that can simultaneously consider
&lt;br/&gt;multiple rheological behaviors with the geodetic observations through
&lt;br/&gt;a data assimilation algorithm. This approach, will identify the range
&lt;br/&gt;of processes consistent with the data and rule out others,
&lt;br/&gt;constraining the rheology of the crust directly from geodetic data.
&lt;br/&gt;Models of shear zone formation and evolution coupled with a
&lt;br/&gt;seismogenic fault will be developed to address whether the source of
&lt;br/&gt;postseismic deformation is distributed or
localized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study will contribute to basic
knowledge of dynamical &lt;br/&gt;processes in the Earth's crust and to our
ability to evaluate their &lt;br/&gt;contribution to earthquake hazards. The
improved understanding of &lt;br/&gt;shear zone formation will have implications
for structural geology &lt;br/&gt;and mechanical engineering, where localization
is a permanent &lt;br/&gt;concern. The data assimilation aspect of this work
will help &lt;br/&gt;introduce a widely successful scientific approach to fault
mechanics &lt;br/&gt;problems. The project represents the merging of the
complementary &lt;br/&gt;research fields of the investigators, geodynamics for
one, and &lt;br/&gt;geodesy and data assimilation for the other.&lt;br/&gt;--
