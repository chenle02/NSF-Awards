This project focuses on the development of an earthquake resistant design
technique for structures made out of precast prestressed concrete members. The
emphasis is on developing a strong and ductile cast-in- place joint between the
precast column and beam elements. The main parts of this project are: (1) the
study of ductility of partially prestressed concrete members subjected to
simulated seismic type excitations, (2) the evaluation of ductility demand of
the structure to the joint, (3) the study of the joint-connection using typical
beam-column elements, and (4) the study of model frames with selected connection
using pseudo-dynamic testing. The project, if successfully completed, would have
a major impact on the prestress concrete industry.
