During deformation in accretionary complexes, sediments undergo large volume
losses spawning active hydrologic systems. The consequent fluid flow affects
virtually all aspects of the complex's tectonic evolution and must be understood
to evaluate this process. This study will investigate a Neogene accretionary
complex on the Washington State continental margin. Mapping will be conducted
along cliff exposures and the tidal zone where contacts between melange zones
and normal sediments are exposed. The structural petrography of associated veins
and cements will be examined and fluid inclusions analyzed to characterize the
nature of rock-fluid interactions that were operative. Results will address to
what extent melange zones are conduits for fluids and will help define
hydrologic systems in actively deforming accretionary complexes.
