This award to a Primarily Undergraduate Institution will support research in the
general area of organometallic chemistry. The award will permit the
participation of four undergraduates in the synthesis of new compounds which may
be useful as homogeneous catalysts for structural transformations of organic
compounds. The undergraduate participants will gain experience in the use of a
number of essential spectroscopic tools, such as nuclear magnetic resonance and
infrared spectroscopy. The focus of the research project is the chemical
reactivity patterns of iron pentadienyl species, with specific emphasis on
transformations at the metal center. The development of stereocontrolled carbon-
carbon bond forming reactions is the central theme of the research. The four
specific goals of the project are: 1. To define the fundamental mechanistic
differences between the pentadienyl ligand and its two isoelectronic
counterparts, cyclopentadienyl and pi-allyl; 2. To develop new synthetic routes
to metal pentadienyl complexes which contain ancillary ligands other than
neutral two-electron donors; 3. To develop the first general procedures for
selective endo substitution of (polyolefin)metal complexes; 4. To provide the
first general and versatile methods for functionalizing metal(polyolefin)
complexes with electrophiles.
