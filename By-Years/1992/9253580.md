This is a 1992 Presidential Faculty Fellow Award (PFF). Micro- and nanostructure
fabrication can be applied to a plethora of interesting problems. The PI will
expand his work on ultrasmall electronic devices. An especially significant
topic will be issues in ultrasmall interconnects for ULSI. This includes cross
talk in very dense circuits and electromigration in lines narrower than 0.1
micron.
