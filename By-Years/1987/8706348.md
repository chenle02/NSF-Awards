This project examines the relative importance of social and intellectual factors
in the distribution of influence or recognition in diverse segments of the
scientific community. The unit of analysis is not the individual scientist, but
the basic element of the communication system: the scientific article. Since
articles contain the intellectual contributions in science, the study of their
characteristics provides a means of uniting several of the divergent approaches
used in the sociology of science. In a regression analysis used to predict
citations to scientific articles, the predictor variables will be classified
into two categories: author (social) variables and article content
(intellectual) variables. The relative importance of these two sets of variables
will be examined in several different research areas, which vary in their levels
of intellectual integration.
