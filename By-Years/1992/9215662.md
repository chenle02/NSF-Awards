The objective of this research is to significantly advance the-state-of-the-art
in operation of semiconductor manufacturing. Specifically, it will address real-
time control of wafer production (i.e., the fabrication of integrated circuits
onto silicon wafers). If successful, this research will lead to substantial
improvements in factory operations, and ultimately, increased competitiveness of
United States microelectronics manufacturers. This research addresses
development of an advanced real-time system control framework that will direct
the efficient operation of large wafer fabrication facilities. Specifically, the
research will develop control policies within a new framework (Generalized Semi-
Markov Decision Processes) that controls to target sets rather than to moments.
With this research, the investigator will seek to develop the fundamental
science base required to significantly advance real-time product flow control of
wafer fabrication processes.
