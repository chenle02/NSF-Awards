This project introduces the concepts of parallel computing to the undergraduate
curriculum at Blackburn College. The primary acquisition is the Intel iPSC
4-node hypercube. This small, distributed-memory parallel system provides a
cost- effectivelaboratory for experimenting with parallel programming. This
award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
