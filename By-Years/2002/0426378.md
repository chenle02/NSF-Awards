Cornell University, through Main Street Science (the education program of its
Nanobiotechnology Center), proposes to create a 3,500 sq. ft. traveling
exhibition on nanoscale science and engineering in partnership with Sciencenter
of Ithaca, New York.

Intellectual Merit: The exhibition will address two questions: How do we see
things too small to see, and how do we make things too small to see? In sections
titled Small, Smaller, Nano; Seeing Nano Structures; Making Nano Stuff; and Nano
and Me, hands-on activities and experiences will present the tools, processes
and applications of nanoscale science and engineering for children ages 8 to 13
and adults.

Broader Impact: This traveling exhibition is projected to reach some three
million visitors in at least six sites as part of its national tour. It will
then become a permanent exhibition at Sciencenter. Dissemination will be
supported by a web site, take-home materials, a children's book and activities
to carry out at home, along with links to formal education.
