The physics department will purchase a SPEX optical spectrometer, detectors, and
a light source to be used for advanced laboratories and student research
projects. Physics students will use it to learn the principles of spectroscopy
and to study atomic spectroscopy, solar and skylight spectra (i.e. Rayleigh
scattering), wavelength dependence of absorption and emission, and optical
properties of solids, and for their student research projects. Physics computing
and engineering students will interface it to a microcomputer for control and
data collection. This instrument will significantly broaden the research and
advanced profits available to students.
