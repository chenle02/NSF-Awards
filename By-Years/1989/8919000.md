In this project in the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Dale F. Shellhamer in the Chemistry Department of Point Loma Nazarene
College will study the reactions of xenon difluoride with unsaturated
hydrocarbons in protic solvents in order to obtain a better understanding of the
reaction pathway. This project will provide research training for undergraduate
students. The reactions of xenon difluoride with unsaturated hydrocarbons
(alkenes, unsaturated ketones, 1,3-dienes, and aromatics) in protic solvents
(alcohols and water) will be investigated. A study of the kinetics and products
of these reactions will allow a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms.
Earlier studies on the ionic fluorination of acyclic 1,3-dienes with xenon
difluoride in aprotic and protic solvents will be extended to include cyclic
dienes. The stereoisomers from fluorination of cyclic dienes with xenon
difluoride will be compared to previously reported data for bromination and
chlorination of the same cyclic dienes.
