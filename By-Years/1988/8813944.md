This project will update statistics on the number and characteristics of
scientists and engineers (S/E) in France, West Germany, the United Kingdom and
Japan for the data base on scientists and engineers established in an earlier
project (Agreement Nos. SRS 8512763 and SRS 8412763 A01). The National Science
Foundation has the responsibility to collect and analyze data on resources
devoted to science and engineering in the United States and other countries.
This project helps to meet that goal by providing information on the S/E
personnel resources in several important industrial countries.
