$99,000 in support of this proposal to create a statewide Alliance of
technology-related, education and business groups which will plan a sustainable
telecommunications network for rural educational and community use, as a key
component of Vermont's systemic reform activities. The plan, when implemented,
will boost Vermont's active educational restructuring with innovative
technologies available to, and useable by, teachers, students, and community
members. There is a great deal of work going on in Vermont in
telecommunications, but it is not coordinated toward a single goal and it is not
directed toward systemic reform of education. However, educational reform can be
greatly facilitated by telecommunications advances both in its scope and tempo.
True reform looks at new methods. not just revisions of past ideas, and requires
participation from many diverse groups that make up our broad societal system of
education. This project provides fertile ground for the necessary collaborations
to funnel energy and innovation toward creation of a strong statewide Alliance
that will link schools and communities.
