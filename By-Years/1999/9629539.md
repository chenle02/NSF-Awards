9629539 David J. Anderson The number of offspring that individuals can produce
depends on the amount of food and care they can provide. Birds are good
organisms to study how foraging, resource allocation among offspring, and
sibling competition affect the number of young produced. Three sets of birds
will be studied. In the first project, the foraging patterns of widely ranging
seabirds, Laysan and black-footed albatrosses near the Hawaiian Islands, will be
used to test hypotheses linking their slow reproductive rates to their foraging
biology. The data will be distributed in near-real time to over 39,000 fifth and
sixth grade students via email and educational satellite networks. These
students will participate in the data analysis, to increase their scientific
literacy and to attract them to scientific careers. The second project will
study nestling competition in two species of boobies, seabirds of the Galapagos
Islands. The regulation of sibling competition will be studied, to understand
why a nestling bird sometimes kills its sibling nestmate. The third project will
study variation in offspring sex ratio in broods of the American kestrel.
Mothers provide sons with larger eggs, although sons die more than daughters do
from sibling competition. Undergraduate students will use DNA fingerprinting to
determine how this size difference arises. These studies will increase the
understanding of tradeoffs in allocating resources, for number of offspring
versus their survival rates. This is useful for plant and animal breeding and
for conservation biology.
