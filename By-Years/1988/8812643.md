This topical meeting on "Optical Computing" is international in scope and
includes a large number of top researchers in the field. Topics to be discussed
include nonlinear optical phenomena, optical light modulators, optical
interconnects, optical processors, optical neuro- networks, massively parallel
architecture, symbolic processors, etc. The meeting should be an extremely
excellent breading ground for scientific exchange in a field that offers
tremendous potential for advanced computing power.
