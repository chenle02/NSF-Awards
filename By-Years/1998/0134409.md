0134409 Le Doux The objective of the proposed research is to develop greater
understanding of lentivirus-cell interactions, with the long-range goal of
developing improved lentivirues that will be useful for cystic fibrosis gene
therapy. Specifically, the goal of this research is to develop a targeted
lentiviral vector and to examine the intracellular pathway that leads to maximal
transfection. The specific tasks of this research include: (1) the test of the
hypothesis that lentivirus gene transfer can be improved by incorporating escort
proteins into the lipid bilayer of the viruses, (2) the quantitative analysis of
the effect of the escort proteins on infection, and (3) the engineering of
lentiviruses to target receptors on the apical surfaces of polarized epithelial
cells. The knowledge gained from this research could help the design of the next
generation of lentivirus vectors that would be useful for human gene therapy
protocols.
