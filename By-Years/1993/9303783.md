The NSF-owned Research Vessel WECOMA, operated under a charter party agreement
by the Oregon State University, has operated continuously for 17 years. The
average projected life of a research vessel is 30 years. This project will make
major modifications and upgrades to the vessel to prepare her for the second
half of her operational life. The viability of an oceanographic research vessel
to conduct the changing needs of ocean science research diminishes with time.
The modifications and upgrades will modernize the WECOMA and equip her to be as
effective and reliable as when she was originally delivered for service in 1975.
The improvements focus on three major areas. Improvements to increase and
enhance the ability of the ship to conduct ocean science research; upgrades to
improve the day to day operation and maintainability of the ship; and
refinements to improve the habitability of the ship. Attention to all these
areas will result in a vessel well equipped to continue a long standing
tradition of good service to the community of ocean science research.
