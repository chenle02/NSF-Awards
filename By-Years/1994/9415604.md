9415604 Kadanoff The topics for investigation include the study of the
separation of drops from a mass of fluid, the development of techniques for
measuring and modeling well-developed turbulence, and the study of flows past
obstacles. The specific applications include data analysis for flow near a
boundary, simplified models of energy dissipation in highly turbulent flow, some
instabilities of the motion on the surface of liquids, and the motion of shaken
sand. This theoretical project is co-funded by the Divisions of Materials
Research and Physics. %%% This theoretical project involves both research and
teaching. Under research, we study the separation of drops from a mass of fluid,
turbulent flow, and the motion of granular materials. Under teaching, we train
graduate students and postdoctorals to do research on the motion of fluids and
also develop new course material, for example, for an undergraduate course on
the subject of chaos. This project is co-funded by the Divisions of Materials
Research and Physics. ***
