Preliminary work which was funded by NSF, identifies a large area of the South
Pacific bounded on the east by the East Pacific Rise and on the north by the
Marquesas Fracture Zone where the seafloor is unusually shallow, fails to
subside to its expected depth, is morphologically rough due to a large hot spot
population, is underlain by a shallow zone of slow shear wave velocity, and
shows geochemical anomaly. In this award, Dr. McNutt will examine the existing
geoid, bathymetric, age, seismic and geochemical data to test various theories
of the origin of the superswell. This study may lead to a detail field program
for further geologic and geophysical data collection for the superswell study.
Dr. McNutt is a very capable scientist and the project has a very high chance of
success.
