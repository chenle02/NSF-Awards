This project reaches out to attract a heterogeneous mix of students, including
ethnically diverse and under-represented minorities, as well as women into
engineering and engineering technology programs.&lt;br/&gt;We have developed
methods for motivating students to pursue a degree program, in part, by
offering&lt;br/&gt;financial incentives to academically talented but
economically disadvantaged students in&lt;br/&gt;Engineering Technology
(Electrical, Computer, and Telecommunication) and Engineering&lt;br/&gt;Science
programs. The program increases retention rates of these students by providing
enhanced support structures and prepares the students to be successful employees
in the technical work force.&lt;br/&gt;The support is provided by forming a
learning community comprised of students, faculty advisors/mentors from each
discipline, and industry mentors.&lt;br/&gt;
