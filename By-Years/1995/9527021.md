Jeanloz 9527021 The PIs propose an experimental investigation of the thermal
equation of state of perovskitite, the high-pressure perovskite-bearing
asemblage of minerals thought to dominate the petrology of the lower mantle. The
experiments will involve high-pressure, high-temperature determinations of P-V-T
relations using synchrotron radiation, and the results should allow testing of
models of distinct bulk composition for the earth's upper and lower mantle.
