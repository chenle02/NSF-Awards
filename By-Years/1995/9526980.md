9526980 Walter This award provides partial funding (37% of total cost) for the
acquisition of an inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) system
to be installed and operated in the Department of Geological Sciences at the
University of Michigan. The University of Michigan is committed to provide
funding for the remaining cost of acquiring and installing the equipment. The
ICP-MS system will fill a need at the University of Michigan for elemental
analysis in fluid and mineral phases at trace levels. Many of the research and
teaching programs in the geological sciences at Michigan require complete
analyses of very small samples or of elements present in very low concentrations
of parts per billion or less. Samples include natural waters, solids such as
minerals, biological tissues, sediments and soils. The spectrum of research
projects needing such analytical capabilities is large and varied, including
research in environmental geochemistry of regional groundwater systems, trace
element contents of carbonates, paleoceanography, and mid-ocean ridge
geochemistry. The analytical facility will be open to all researcher at the
University, and will be used extensively by workers in the departments of
chemistry and biology, the College of Pharmacy, School of Natural Resources,
School of Public Health, and the Center for Great Lakes Research, among others.
