9505343 Hairston Dr. Hairston requests funding for a Small Grant for Exploratory
Research (SGER) for a project which has great potential to move research on
chaos to a new arena: real experimental validation of methods for detecting
nonlinearity and chaos. The ultimate goal is the development of methods for
determining whether chaos underlies the dynamics of natural populations. In this
project, real organisms will be used to create data sets that demonstrably
exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics (either chaos or complicated periodic
oscillations). These data will be used to experimentally test existing and new
methods for characterizing complex dynamics. The experimental system is a
single-state chemostat culturing rotifers and their algal food with variable
supply rate of the nutrient limiting algal growth. There is experimental
evidence that this system can exhibit predator-prey oscillation. Mathematical
theory suggests that such oscillations can be driven into complex mode-locking
oscillations, and eventually into chaos, by pulsed or periodically varying
nutrient supply rate. SGER funding will be used for a one-year pilot study to
demonstrate the feasibility to: construct and maintain the experimental system;
vary conditions to obtain useful population dynamics; and conduct experiments.
These will be the first studies in which statistical methods, intended for use
on natural populations, are validated through experiments on real organisms.
This represents a major step towards reality, compared with conventional tests
using simulated data.
