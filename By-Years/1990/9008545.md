Among many unique animals and plants on the island of Madagascar are more than
forty species of lemuriform primates. In terms of skeletal anatomy these animals
represent the best living analogues for the earliest euprimates (Eocene Adapidae
and Omomyidae). Thus, a study of the positional behavior (posture and
locomotion) of these animals is crucial for a thorough understanding of the
locomotor system of early primates. Although aspects of social behavior and
ecology of Malagasy lemurs have been the subject of several studies, positional
behavior has not received the detailed, objective, quantitative scrutiny it
needs in order to generate the kinds of data most useful for integration with
morphological and historical studies. The purpose of this project is to collect
such data for six species of Malagasy lemurs living among a community of 12
species at Ranomafana National Park. The number of species, ranges of body
sizes, phylogenetic diversity, and microhabitats represented by these animals
allow many crucial comparisons to be made which test the influence of various
factors on the expressions of positional behavior. The results generated from
this study will be compared with similar studies on other primates, with the aim
of generating and testing the nature and regularity of the influence of body
size, habitat structure, and heritage on primate positional behavior.
