Absolute Proper Motions of the Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way Globular Clusters

ABSTRACT

AST 0407292 van Altena

Dr. William van Altena, at the Yale Southern Observatory, Inc., will undertake a
program to study the inner structure and gravitational potential of the Milky
Way. From the three dimensional velocities of globular clusters, the PI plans to
investigate the structure of the bulge region of the Galaxy, the structure and
properties of the inner halo, the inner dark-matter density profile, properties
of the accretion-assembled halo, and the correlation between the orbital
distribution and the dynamical evolution of the globular-cluster system.
Additionally the PI proposes a roughly 450-square-degree proper-motion study of
the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC) and an Intercloud Bridge
region.

The program will result in a broader understanding of the formation of galaxies.
The work has an international component, fostering interaction between Yale and
the University of San Juan (Argentina). Student training, and in particular the
inclusion of female astronomy majors at the University of San Juan, is also a
component of the effort.
