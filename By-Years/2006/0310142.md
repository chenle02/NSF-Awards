EAR-0310142&lt;br/&gt;Marc Hirschmann&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Small amounts of
carbonate melt in the upper mantle are believed to have significant geochemical
and geophysical consequences, but little is known about the depth of formation
or the compositions of these melts. Decarbonation of peridotite during upwelling
beneath ridges influences the rate of mantle degassing and the geophysical
properties of the deepest parts of mid-ocean ridge basalt source regions.
Partial melting of carbonated eclogite may be a key step in global deep cycling
of carbon and may be the source of some carbonatites. This project is to
determine melting relations of natural carbonated peridotite and eclogite at
conditions of melting beneath oceanic ridges. Iterative experiments will be
conducted in a multi-anvil device at pressures between 5 and 10 GPa. They will
determine solidi locations for carbonated peridotite and eclogite and near-
solidus major element compositions of partial melts. They will also provide the
first data on partitioning of key trace elements (U, Th, Pb, Rb, Sr, K, Na,
HFSE, REE) between carbonate liquids and residual minerals at pressures similar
to those where such melts form in the convecting mantle.&lt;br/&gt;
