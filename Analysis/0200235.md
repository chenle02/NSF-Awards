DMS-0200235 Project title: Quantum corrections to classical approximations

PI: Laszlo Erdos, Georgia Institute of Technology

Abstract:

The proposal contains three related projects that investigate residual quantum
effects in classical approximations of complex quantum problems. The first
project considers the correction due to the self-generated magnetic field in the
Thomas-Fermi theory of large atoms. The optimal magnetic field obtained from a
variational principle is spatially inhomogeneous. The second project aims at
deriving nonlinear self-consistent evolution equations from the quantum dynamics
of many particles interacting via weakly coupled Coulomb force. The quantum
statistics of the particles determine the scaling and the limiting classical
equation (Hartree or Vlasov). The last project studies the long time dynamics of
noninteracting electrons in a random environment in the diffusive regime. On the
shorter kinetic time scale the Boltzmann equation has been established earlier.
The goal is to determine the quantum corrections to the classical diffusivity
obtained from the Boltzmann equation and verify some predictions of the
celebrated scaling theory of conductance.

The physics of charged particles governs all electric phenomena. From
theoretical point of view, these particles can be accurately described using
many-body quantum mechanics. In practice, however, the fundamental equation of
quantum physics, the Schr\"odinger equation, is too complicated. Typical
electronic devices contain a huge number of electrons and it is impossible to
describe their precise microscopic behavior even with the current computer
technology. The Schr\"odinger equation is usually replaced with much simpler
equations that are computationally more feasible. These equations do not contain
all information about the complex electronic system, but they may describe
certain quantities of interest with a sufficient precision. The proposal studies
three complex quantum systems: (i) a large atom in a self-generated magnetic
field; (ii) many charged particles with a weak interaction; (iii) a single
electron in an impure medium. The goal is to find the correct approximating
equations and to justify rigorously that they are consistent with the
Schr\"odinger theory in certain limits. Heuristically, some of these equations
can be guessed based upon classical mechanics. Quantum mechanics, however, may
modify the classical picture. The proposed work identifies the quantum
correction effects in the classical description of these three basic models.
