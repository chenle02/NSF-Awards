2021 (Public Law 117-2). Algebraic geometry is the study of algebraic varieties,
geometric objects described by polynomial equations. To study algebraic
varieties, it is often convenient to divide them into different classes
according to their geometric properties. An important class of algebraic
varieties is given by those whose first Chern class, a basic invariant of
algebraic varieties, is zero. A fundamental result from the 1980s, called the
Beauville-Bogomolov theorem, states that there are exactly three kinds of
building blocks for smooth compact algebraic varieties with zero first Chern
class: complex tori, strict Calabi-Yau manifolds, and irreducible holomorphic
symplectic manifolds. This project focuses on the last of these three building
blocks, which traditionally has been the least studied. Thanks to some
fundamental theorems in differential geometry, irreducible holomorphic
symplectic manifolds admit a special metric called a hyper-Kähler metric. The
geometry of holomorphic symplectic manifolds is relevant not only to algebraic
and differential geometry, but also to representation theory and mathematical
physics. As part of this project, the PI will organize activities to strengthen
the hyper-Kähler research community in the United States, activities for
undergraduate students from under-represented minorities in math, and K-12
activities in the broader community around Columbia University.

K3 surfaces constitute one of the most studied types of algebraic surfaces, and
irreducible symplectic manifolds are arguably their higher dimensional
analogues. In this analogy, Lagrangian fibrations on compact hyper-Kähler
manifolds are the natural generalizations of elliptic K3 surfaces. Together with
symplectic resolutions, Lagrangian fibrations provide one the strongest means to
study, classify, and construct this class of manifolds. The PI aims to advance
the current knowledge of (compact) hyper-Kähler manifolds through the systematic
study of Lagrangian fibrations. More specifically, the PI will introduce new
techniques to compactify quasi-projective Lagrangian fibrations and will study
the cohomology, derived categories, and Chow groups of Lagrangian fibered
compact hyper-Kähler manifolds.
