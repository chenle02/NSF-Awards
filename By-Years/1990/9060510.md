Recently developed CVD diamond thin films can be used in a wide variety of
applications from electronics to cutting tools, infrared optics to abrasives.
High quality diamond films are presently grown at rates of about 1 micron/hr.
Crucial to the successful commercialization of the technology is the attainment
of larger growth rates. Atmospheric pressure plasma torches have been used to
obtain high diamond growth rates but are limited to small areas. A high power
density, 1 kW/cm2 at 200 Torr pressure, microwave plasma discharge is proposed
to increase growth rates by at least one order-or- magnitude. A microwave
discharge is chosen for scale-up of the deposition area, and the high quality
films which are obtained. A study of power density, neutral pressure, substrate
temperature and plasma chemistry is proposed, for understanding the mechanisms
for diamond growth. A commercially available high growth rate diamond reactor
could be designed as a direct consequence of this research.
