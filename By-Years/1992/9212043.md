This research will investigate people's perceptions of multidimensional
auditory stimuli. Examples of such stimuli include simple sounds, like tones,
that can be made to vary in both frequency and intensity and speech sounds,
which are inherently complex. The principal research question is whether or not
the components of such sounds are perceived independently, and if not, what
kinds of interactions take place. Experiments will use speech and nonspeech
sounds that are difficult to distinguish. The presence of perceptual interaction
can be diagnosed by comparing people's ability to discriminate different
combinations of sounds with the predictions of a quantitative theory. Several
series of experiments will be conducted. The first series will test whether
observed interactions are sensory effects, or arise from the observer using
less-than-ideal decision processes. The second will measure whether interactions
change with experience and whether such improvement is due to a change in the
decision rules the observers use. The third will investigate whether listeners
find some auditory dimensions more available than others in analyzing complex
sounds. The fourth will compare interactions with hard-to-discriminate stimuli
and with clearly audible sounds. The results of these experiments will shed
light on the problem of designing informative auditory displays.
Multidimensional displays are known to be optimal for conveying complex
information, but only if the dimensions are independent; determining whether
dimensions are independent, or become independent with training, is a goal of
this research.
