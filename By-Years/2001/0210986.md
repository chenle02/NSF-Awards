In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Berg will undertake researches in condensed matter
chemistry, namely fast time scale dynamics of supercooled and high viscosity
liquids. New non-linear spectroscopies are to be developed and existing methods
to be extended. Heterogeneity and non-exponential decays in high viscosity
liquids and other complex materials are to be investigated, and rotation and
solvation measurements are to be made and internal diffusive transitions
invetigated. A Fifth Order Rotational Spectroscopy (FORS) is to be developed. A
new viscoelastic (VE) theory is to be developed, one that includes both inertial
and diffusive dynamics in a unified formalism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
deals with important issues in the behavior of fluids, such as the relationship
between the dynamics of single molecules and that of the collective behavior of
fluids. Existing theories have been partially successful in accounting for the
dynamical properties of fluids and the present work addresses fundamental issues
that have in the past been treated only slightly. New experimental techniques,
coupled with theory will be developed. This research will be conducted with the
aid of graduate and undergraduate students, and postdoctoral research
associates. They will gain valuable experience through their involvement in
contemporary forefront research in physical chemistry. These experiences will of
great advantage in their further studies, or employment in industry, government
laboratories, or academia. &lt;br/&gt;
