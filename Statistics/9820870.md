Abstract: This award provides partial travel support and local expenses for the
20 invited speakers at the conference on "Application of Heavy Tailed
Distributions in Economics, Engineering and Statistics" on June 3-5, 1999 in the
Ward Circle Building at the American University in Washington, D.C. Although
heavy tailed distributions are increasingly being used to model phenomena in a
wide range of applications in economics, finance, signal processing,
telecommunication network analysis, time series, physical and biological
provblems, progress in this area has been limited by the lack of efficient and
reliable methods of modeling, analyzing and predicting for such models. In the
past decade, there has been significant progress in both the theory and methods
of working with non-Gaussian models. This conference will bring together many of
the top theoreticians and practitioners, national and interenational, working in
the field of heavy-tailed, non-Gaussian models and those with experience with
massive data sets. The invited list of speakers includes four women. Support for
graduate students and young investigators is provided with reduced registration
fees.
