The project provides for continued operation of the CHILL radar as a national
facility. The radar allows cutting edge research into convective storm
initiation and evolution and will enhance scientific understanding of storm
microphysics. The proposed cooperative agreement specifies the management,
staffing, testing, operation, technical upgrades and educational and outreach
activities for the proposed 5 year period.

The project is an interdisciplinary activity between the Departments of
Atmospheric Science and Engineering, and it serves the broad research community
as a primary radar remote sensing facility. The combination of engineering and
atmospheric sciences gives faculty and students the opportunity to explore
technical and scientific topics in radar meteorology. In research projects CHILL
also provides high quality, real-time dual doppler information to coordinate the
flight of a storm penetration aircraft in and around convective storms.

Enhanced use of the Internet allows real time access of data from any
institution and faculty and students can operate the CHILL from remote
locations. The project provide far-reaching educational opportunities.
