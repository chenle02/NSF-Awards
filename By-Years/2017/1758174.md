The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in resolving
the long-standing graphical access problem for millions of blind and visually-
impaired (BVI) people. Lack of access to these substantial informational
components of daily life represents one of the biggest challenges to the
independence and productivity of BVI individuals. This project addresses this
vexing accessibility issue through a viable information access solution built on
commercial, low-cost touchscreen-based smart computing devices such as
smartphones and tablets. The solution will assist BVI people by potentially
providing dynamic access to digital school books and test materials, graphics in
vocational settings, digital maps, and graphical contents of printed materials.
The broader impact of this project is that it will promote empowerment of BVI
individuals by supporting increased educational advancement, vocational
opportunities, enhanced quality of life, and overall greater
independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corp project will explore the
commercial potential and market fit for a touchscreen-based graphics screen
reader. This solution will allow blind people to freely explore and access
graphical information via vibration and auditory feedback on a smartphone or
tablet. Through a battery of usability, psychophysical, and technical
experiments, the technology has been shown to be effective compared to existing
solutions and is accurate in conveying informative graphical materials such as
graphs, shapes, patterns, and indoor maps. The focus of the proposed I-Corp
project is to understand the commercial fit and usability of the solution in
meeting end-user needs and problems.
