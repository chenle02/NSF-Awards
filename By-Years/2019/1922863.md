This student travel grant is to enhance the education of selected US graduate
students in the research area of Logic Programming. This will be realized by
enabling them to attend the 2019 International Conference in Logic Programming
(ICLP), which will include a logic programming Doctoral Consortium (DC) and a
Fall School in Logic Programming (FSLP) for these students. An important focus
of the conference is to improve student education in the field of Logic
Programming. The conference organization and governance include many prominent
researchers in the area. The conference will help nurture the next generation of
ICLP researchers by enabling students to meet senior researchers at the
conference and take part in face-to-face discussions with them.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity furthers technological advancement
in the area of logic programming, which is currently seeing substantial
industrial interest. ICLP has been the premier international event for
presenting research in logic programming in areas including foundations,
languages, declarative programming, logic solver implementation, and
applications. Contributions are sought in all areas of logic programming.
Supporting the educational mission of the conference will bring long-term
benefits to both industry and academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
