This award will support a symposium on the National Science Foundation (NSF)
small business programs, to be held at the MassChallenge facilities in Boston,
Massachusetts in November 2013. The workshop will feature presentations from NSF
program staff, current and former NSF awardees from the Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
programs, and invited thought leaders in the entrepreneurial and investment
communities, and will involve a large number of entrepreneurs, students, and
researchers interested in innovation. One primary goal of this symposium is to
bring together the research and business communities and make entrepreneurs
aware of the resources available to them via these programs. The workshop will
be bolstered by MassChallenge's existing network of early-stage companies, and
will leverage existing social and traditional media channels to ensure maximum
visibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event has the potential to promote
awareness and deepen knowledge of NSF?s innovation programs within the extensive
startup ecosystem to which MassChallenge has access Additionally, this event
offers the possibility for future collaboration among these participants by
providing a networking environment for entrepreneurs and innovators from
different communities. This outreach across a broad and diverse range of
industries and backgrounds will also extend to groups who are typically
underrepresented in science: 30% of the participating companies were founded by
women, and 31% of the participants are from underrepresented groups. By
educating entrepreneurs about the resources available to them via the NSF, these
entrepreneurs will be empowered to increasingly apply their science and
technology insights to solve some of society's greatest challenges.
