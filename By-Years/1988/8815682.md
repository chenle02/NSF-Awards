This award supports cooperative research in condensed matter theory to be
carried out by Diana Farkas of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and E.J.
Savino of the Atomic Energy Commission in Buenos Aires. Theoretical models will
be developed for transport mechanisms that occur during ion implantation
alloying and ion beam mixing. The collaboration began with concentrating on
phenomenological models and it is now proposed to study the particular transport
mechanisms that occur during irradiation. Starting with Monte Carlo simulation
of collisional mixing, including dynamic compositional changes, the study will
proceed to look at segregation effects during implantation due to point defects
and investigate ion beam mixing in layered structures. The collaboration has
been productive, resulting in several papers in good journals. Both the P.I.'s
are recognized as experts in theoretical analysis of radiation effects and
impurity defect interactions. The research area has wide application in ceramics
and semiconductors as well as in metals and alloys.
