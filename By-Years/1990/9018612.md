The aim of the study is to examine the mechanisms involved in regulating the
stability of messenger RNAs (mRNA). An early focus will be on the mechanism of
RNA turnover and the enzymes involved, using a combination of genetic and
biochemical approaches. The model system will be the yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, and both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial mRNA stabilities will be
examined, ultimately. The regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms
involves the coordination of both initiation of transcription as well as RNA
processing at the post-transcriptional level. This study is aimed at elucidating
the mechanism of RNA turnover and an understanding of the enzymes that catalyze
this significant process.
