Steering sound beams: Biophysics of public and private signaling in mixed
media&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animals display an extraordinary diversity of sounds,
odors, and colors to communicate within and between species. The efficacy of
communication hinges on signal detection by receivers following propagation
through an often cluttered environment. Two key solutions to minimizing
distortion involve producing signals that are resistant to degradation, and
advertising at times and positions that optimize signal transmission. While much
attention has focused on the physics of signal design, little research has
explored physical mechanisms underlying behavioral strategies aimed at
maximizing propagation. This work explores the biophysics of behavioral
strategies employed by Neotropical singing mice (Scotinomys) to maximize sound
propagation in different social contexts. The goal is to quantify the influence
of relative humidity on the active space of advertisement signals, and
investigate how postural changes contribute to the directionality and
degradation of specific acoustic parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training
objectives include developing proficiency in physical acoustics, publishing at
the interface of biology and physics, mentoring undergraduate students, and
improving methods of disseminating research findings to the scientific community
and public. Broader impacts include development of inquiry-based curricula aimed
at exploring the interface of biology and physical sciences as they relate to
animal communication. The fellow will build on existing networks within local
communities in Costa Rica where fieldwork is conducted. Students from elementary
schools will be trained to assist in collection and presentation of biological
data.
