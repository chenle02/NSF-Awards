9312048 Starnes This research will be directed toward the elucidation of the
detailed structures and polymerization mechanisms of poly(vinyl acetate),
various vinylidene chloride polymers, and poly(vinyl chloride). All of these
polymers have great technological significance, and all of them are made
commercially by free-radical polymerization. Much of the effort will relate to
the identification and quantification of structural defects in the polymers such
as long and short branches, long-chain ends, adventitious unsaturation,
adventitious structures containing oxygen, and groups derived from solvents. The
principal analytical tool will be high-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, and
both the poly(vinyl chloride) and the vinylidence chloride polymers will first
be converted chemically into the corresponding "polyethylenes" in order to
facilitate the analyses. Resonance assignments will be confirmed by comparing
the polymer spectra with those of reference models that are to be synthesized
during the course of the project. In the case of poly(vinyl acetate), a major
goal will be to understand fully the striking effects of aromatic solvents on
the polymerization chemistry and kinetics. The work with poly(vinyl chloride)
and the polymers of vinylidene chloride will be concerned especially with the
structural defects that contribute to the thermal instability of these
materials. Results obtained from the project should suggest ways of modifying
the polymerization processes in order to form polymers with improved properties.
