9706641 Pipher This project is concerned with the applications of techniques of
harmonic analysis to various problems in linear elliptic theory. It uses
Littlewood-Paley theory to study boundary value problems for second order
divergence form equations, in particular for equations with non-smooth
coefficients and/or whose matrix is not assumed to be real-valued or symmetric.
There are close connections to linear problems in non-smooth domains. Thus,
included in this project is the study of higher order elliptic operators in
domains with Lipschitz boundary. In particular, it treats boundary problems with
data in Sobolev spaces or Hardy spaces. There are many problems arising in
various areas of mathematics, physics, engineering, and manufacturing which
reduce to being able to approximate solutions of linear partial differential
equations in regions which have corners and edges. This phenomenon, the presence
of corners and edges, causes inherent mathematical difficulties in obtaining
good approximations. In particular, it is important to be able to measure how
small the error will be in terms of the data (the known quantities). This
project is concerned with formulating the theory upon which these numerical
approximations and applications are based.
