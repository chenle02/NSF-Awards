This Faculty Development Award supports the effective integration of research,
teaching and service. Research goals are the study of the interaction of metal
nanoparticles with electrode surfaces in order to control nanoparticle
entrapment in electrodeposited metal oxide thin films. The resulting thin film
composite materials will have applications in electrochromics, advanced
batteries and luminescent mateterials. The education goals include new general
chemistry laboratory curricula on nanoscale chemistry. The service goals include
fostering undergraduate research at both Lewis and Clark College and Portland
Community College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program
is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models
that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps
Postdoctoral Fellows are eligible to apply for this Faculty Development Award.
