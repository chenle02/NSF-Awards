In the State of Washington, the engineering schools at the two major state
universities (University of Washington and Washington State University) and four
community colleges (Seattle Central Community College, Yakima Valley Community
College, Highline Community College, and Columbia Basin College) along with
other institutions in the State have formed the Northwest Engineering Talent
Expansion Partnership (NW-ETEP). The overall project goal is to increase by ten
percent the total number of students in the State of Washington that earn an
undergraduate engineering degree over the next five years. Specifically, over
the next five years, the NW-ETEP will 1) increase the number of underrepresented
minorities that earn engineering degrees in the State by 100%; 2) increase the
number of women that earn engineering degrees in the State by 20%, and 3)
develop and implement a statewide strategy to fully utilize the capacity of all
the State's engineering programs. Support programs are being jointly developed
at each community college with an explicit focus on supporting underrepresented
students in engineering with the intent to transfer. These efforts include a
comprehensive team comprised of existing faculty and student services providers,
an on-site coordinator, and services ranging from academic support to
major/career exploration to transfer assistance/support. At the universities,
efforts are focusing on increasing the retention of women by maximizing the use
of existing services by the large population of women already interested in
engineering that enter these institutions. And at the state-level, the team is
implementing a comprehensive strategy to increase awareness among high school
students, parents, teachers, and guidance counselors of all the options to earn
engineering degrees in the state and all the existing support available to
students.
