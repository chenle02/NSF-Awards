This is a project to develop a special-purpose computer called SNAP for
inference in semantic networks and rule-based systems. Each node of the network
will be held in one processor within a mesh of processors. The processors are
specialized for semantic net processing; they can search in parallel for nodes
with specified relations to other nodes. In this one-year project, detailed
design and simulations are being performed to determine the suitability of SNAP
for real-world problems and to identify system bottlenecks.
