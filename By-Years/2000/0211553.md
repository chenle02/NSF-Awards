ABSTRACT

Proposal Number CTS-0211553 Principal Investigator Niels Jensen Affiliation U.
of California, Davis Title International Conference on Computational Nanoscience
(ICCN)

Computational analysis of the nanoscale structures, systems, and processes play
a critical role to provide insight into different approaches in nano science and
engineering. However, this field is in the early stages of development. The
Computational Nanoscience Conference will provide a forum for broad discussion
of methods and ideas that will otherwise be limited to a relatively small group
of investigators. It will furthermore encourage the participation of students
and faculty early in their career to engage in this important field. The
international participation will allow the most advanced methods and ideas to be
discussed and evaluated.
