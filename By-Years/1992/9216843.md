The University of Maine seeks funding to purchase a scanning electron microscope
(SEM) for its marine laboratory, the Darling Marine Center, for use by 1)
resident faculty and students, 2) scientists at the nearby Bigelow Laboratory
for Ocean Sciences, 3) numerous visiting investigators, and 4) members of
MEDUSA, a consortium of over 60 Marine undergraduate marine science faculty who
are given special access to the Center's facilities. The SEM would support
research by University faculty in residence involving the functional morphology
of gametes and reproductive systems of shallow water and deep-sea invertebrates,
comparative morphology, systematics, and phylogeny of crustaceans, the
systematics and biology of coralline algae, studies of plant- herbivore
interactions, the process of stromatolite formation by cyanobacteria, and
paleoecological studies of deep-sea foraminifers as part of global climate
change research. The SEM would be integrated into our summer teaching program to
enrich existing courses and to establish new ones. The instrument would be used
to support research by scientists at the Bigelow Laboratory's Center for Culture
of Marine Phytoplankton to identify species of dinoflagellates and diatoms used
for resident research and supplied to other researchers throughout the world.
The SEM would also be used to support the diverse research of visiting
investigators to the Center including invertebrate systematists supported under
a new Marine Biodiveristy Program being developed at the Center.
