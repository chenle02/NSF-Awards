This project introduces into the chemistry curriculum at Hamline University a
benchtop GC/MS complete with computer operating system and software. The use and
applications of this instrument are introduced into the curriculum at several
levels, affecting a wide range of science students. The GC/MS is utilized in six
undergraduate laboratories and undergraduate research. Specific course
improvements include the enhancement of traditional qualitative organic
analysis, the computer- controlled acquisition and processing of data,
applications of the technique of thermolysis to the characterization of polymers
and polymerization kinetics, analysis of hazardous waste and environmental
samples, and the characterization of synthesized compounds in the advanced
inorganic and organic laboratories.
