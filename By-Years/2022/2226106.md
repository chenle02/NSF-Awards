The NSF-ARMI|BioFabUSA Workshop: Facilitating Advanced Tissue Manufacturing,
will be held in Manchester, NH during the summer of 2023. The workshop focuses
on state-of-the-art tissue fabrication technology and identifies grand
challenges and opportunities for future work in this field. The workshop
addresses the mission of NSF, which has been increasingly committed to
integrating the engineering sciences with the life sciences, encouraging
research and development in multidisciplinary areas, educating the next
generation of young scientists, and translating cutting edge science to
solutions for current and future challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop
will focus on converting manual processes for tissue manufacturing to protocols
that can be implemented in fully automated and closed tissue manufacturing
environment. It will provide a forum for industrial practitioners and academic
researchers in the tissue manufacturing space to interact and create productive
networks. It will also provide a demonstration of the integrated Design-Build-
Test-Learn (DBTL) capabilities of the ARMI/BioFabUSA tissue manufacturing
facility, as well as an explanation of how those facilities might be
accessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
