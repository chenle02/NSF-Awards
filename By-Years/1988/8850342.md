The Hands-On-Science Outreach (HOSO) program, with support from NSF, has
established more than 15 sites across the country where it operates after school
science enrichment classes taught by local community resource staff using
materials and training provided by HOSO. With steady growth, these outreach
sites have over three years reached more than 10,000 children with multi-session
science programs. In the 87-88 school year 681 classes at 15 sites were offered,
while the parent Hands-On-Science (HOS) program in Montgomery County, Md
provided 532 classes. HOSO will extend the results of the first three years,
establish new sites, strengthen existing ones and develop an overall plan for
economic self-sufficiency. Additional curriculum materials will be developed,
manufacturing and distribution methods will be improved, and experiments with
more cost-effective teacher training implemented. Planning options will include
whether to emphasize centrally managed and operated program sites, or to expand
the model of local "franchises" that operate independently, but are supported by
HOSO as an initiator, developer and supplier of materials and training. Other
project support from user fees and private grants will total more than $
300,000.
