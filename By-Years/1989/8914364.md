Dr. Rudolph Schuster is a prominent figure in the research community interested
in bryophytes, being the major group of plants that includes mosses. Having
received NSF research support for more than 30 years, Dr. Schuster has completed
the final volumes (the fifth and sixth) of his series "The Hepaticae and
Anthocerotae of North America." The publication of these volumes will provide a
comprehensive identification guide and research reference for the liverworts and
hornworts of this continent, along with comparisons to species elsewhere. These
volumes will be an important resource for the next generation of researchers and
students in botany.
