Lempp proposes research in both applied and pure computability theory. In the
former area, Lempp proposes to investigate the computational complexity of
models of uncountably categorical first-order theories, and of Boolean algebras.
He also propose to study the proof-theoretic strength of combinatorial
statements, esp. variants of Ramsey's Theorem, in order to find new proof-
theoretic systems of weak second-order arithmetic. In the latter, i.e., in pure
computability theory, Lempp plans to reach a better understanding of three
important degree structures, the computably enumerable Turing degrees, the
enumeration degrees of the Sigma^0_2-sets, and the Turing degrees of differences
of computably enumerable sets, by investigating their finite substructures, in
particular the embeddability of finite lattices and extensions of embeddings of
partial orders into these degree structures.

Computability theory is the study of the theoretical limitations of computation
by machines, irrespective of limitations of bounds on memory space or run time.
It is thus in some sense the theoretical cousin of complexity theory, an area of
computer science studying computability within given time or memory space
bounds. Typical results in computability theory show that certain mathematical
problems cannot be solved by any computer, no matter how fast or how large. Up
until the late 19th century, mathematics was essentially algorithmic: If you
solved a problem, you could also give an effective procedure to find a solution.
However, in the late 19th century, it turned out that many mathematical proofs
could be done more abstractly and more elegantly, at the expense of
effectiveness. Suspicions about this approach came to the front in the 1930's
with the first undecidability results, showing that this abstraction often led
to "non-algorithmic solutions". Lempp's research focuses on the analysis of
unsolvable problems, mainly in algebra and combinatorics. Techniques and results
in this area are often not only of great theoretical interest, but also have
practical applications in computer science.
