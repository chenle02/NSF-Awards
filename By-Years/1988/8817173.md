Project continues seismologic studies of the thermal regime and dynamics of
ocean ridges, the oceanic lithosphere and aesthenosphere. Investigates the
relationship between earthquake seismicity, source characteristics to the
thermal and mechanical structure of the oceanic lithosphere. Determines the
seismic and thermal structure of the crust and mantle below the oceanic ridges
and hot spots. Investigates the relationships of earthquake cycles and fault
geometry, the state of stress across major fault zones.
