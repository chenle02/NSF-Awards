9413065 Moehle This is a "SGER" grant to support a team efort to recover
perishable data of structural damage immediately following the January 17, 1994
Northridge earthquake. The effort was made by a team conprising 50 individuals
from the Earthquake Engineering Research Center (EERC) of University of
California, Berkeley. The Reconnaisance team focused its effort on seismology,
geology, geotechnical engineering, and structural engineering fields studies in
the damaged area. A comprehensive report, containing preliminary summaries of
multi-disciplinary research finding is prepared and distributed. This report is
valuable to re-evaluate research priorities and to formulate research projects
based on lessons learn from this damaging event. ***
