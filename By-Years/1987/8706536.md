This program is being supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program. The goal of the work is to meet the increasing demand for efficient
synthetic approaches to complex organic molecules of theoretical and biological
interest. New tools in the form of new reactions and reagents will result from
this work. Four diverse areas cover a broad scope of endeavor. A major effort
asks the question of whether simple molecular entities in the form of transition
metal complexes can serve as catalysts for selective organic transformations in
a fashion analogous to what enzymes do for the living cell. Manipulation of
allyl systems for chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselective
transformations will involve exploring designed complexes embracing Pd, Mo, and
W. Intramolecular carbametallation of unsaturated functional groups represents a
new exciting thrust for ring construction. Such reactions involving molecular
change by isomerization enters an era of designing reactions for minimizing
chemical waste and therefore minimizing disposal. Another development envisions
a general cycloaddition approach to odd membered rings in contrast to the
extremely import Diels-Alder reaction. Bifunctional reagents which do not self-
annihilate but may be activated by transition metal templates provide the basis
for such a development. Unexpected reactvity of organosulfur compounds provides
a unique opportunity for multifaceted reactivity. These reagents become
"chemical chameleons" since they can totally interconvert between two opposing
types of reactivity depending upon their environment. They also offer a unique
approach for asymmetric synthesis. The final section deals with the concept of
designing composite functional groups or "pseudofunctional groups" based upon a
partnership of strain and reactivity.
