The region of the atmosphere known as the lower thermosphere (80 to 130 km in
altitude) is more difficult to study than the regions at higher altitudes
accessible to satellites and regions at lower altitudes accessible to balloons
and aircraft. The high altitude energy inputs of the solar wind and solar
ultraviolet propagate downward through it, and the lower altitude tidal and
gravity wave energy inputs propagate upward through it, both depositing some of
their energy on the way. To understand the coupling between the upper and lower
atmosphere we must understand the structure and dynamics of the lower
thermosphere and how it affects the energy propagating through it. High latitude
studies are especially important in view of auroral energy sources. Two
incoherent scatter radars in Alaska and Sweden have made extensive measurements
over the last solar cycle that can be analyzed to yield the temperatures and
winds and their variation with season, magnetic activity and solar cycle.
