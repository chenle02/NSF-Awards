This is an NYI award for FY 92. The research will focus on two areas: (1)
diffusive voiding in metallizations caused by electromigration and thermal
stress, and (2) mechanics of ferroelectric ceramics. The first problem area
involves diffusive voiding in metal interconnects in very large-scale integrated
(VLSI) circuits. A unified approach to thermal voiding and electromigration will
be developed that will establish the explicit dependence of the phenomena on
design variables such as material properties, current density, thermal history
and interconnect configuration. This will enable the mathematical model so
created to be validated by comparison to a variety of experimental results. The
second problem area is concerned with deformation, polarization and degradation
of ferroelectric ceramics. The research will provide an analytical framework
relating the mechanisms of domain wall motion and twinning to macroscopic
response between stress, electric field, deformation and polarization of
ferroelectric ceramics. This physically-based constitutive relation would be
used to study the important phenomena of fatigue cracking under alternating
electric fields.
