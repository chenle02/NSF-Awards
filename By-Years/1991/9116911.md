This proposal for the third and fourth year of an intended six-year project,
will determine the trace element and isotopic systematics (Sr, Nd, Pb) of
minerals and whole-rocks from contiguous layers in the Horman Peridotite. These
data are being integrated with new and previous whole-rock and mineral major
element analyses. Interpretations of the comprehensive data generated in this
collaborative U.S.-Japan effort will enable the PIs to understand the processes
that created compositional variations and layering within the Horoman
Peridotite. As a result, they expect to significantly improve the understanding
of melt formation, migration and segregation in the upper mantle. In addition,
this peridotite is in an arc tectonic setting, and it may be an example of how
oceanic asthenosphere is modified by subduction processes. Therefore, the
results of this research may contribute to an understanding of the arc volcanism
that results from plate convergence.
