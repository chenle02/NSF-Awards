DMS-010&lt;br/&gt;Anatoly S. Libgober&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concrete issues
proposed in this project are the study&lt;br/&gt;of 2-variable elliptic genus
and chiral deRham complex&lt;br/&gt;for non-singular and singular
varieties,&lt;br/&gt;mathematical foundations of the second quantized
elliptic&lt;br/&gt;genus and orbifold elliptic genus,&lt;br/&gt;ODE and PDE
appearing in mirror symmetry, the Chern&lt;br/&gt;classes of mirrors and the
topology of the&lt;br/&gt;complements as well as the study of the fundamental
groups&lt;br/&gt;of the complements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
project is to analyze from&lt;br/&gt;mathematical point of view several methods
and&lt;br/&gt;techniques which were used in theoretical physics,&lt;br/&gt;more
precisely in string theory. Such mathematical&lt;br/&gt;investigation should
lead to new results in&lt;br/&gt;the physical theories involved and produce
a&lt;br/&gt;broader understanding of the reasons of effectiveness&lt;br/&gt;of
the methods used by physicists.&lt;br/&gt;Particular problems which we are
planning to solve&lt;br/&gt;are motivated by dualities in string
theory&lt;br/&gt;and more specifically by mirror correspondence.&lt;br/&gt;One
of the problems is to find new properties&lt;br/&gt;of mirror correspondence and
its characterization.&lt;br/&gt;This involved the study in topology, algebraic
geometry&lt;br/&gt;and differential
equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
