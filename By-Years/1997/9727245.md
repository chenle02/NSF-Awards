9727245 Page This collaborative research team employs computational and
mathematical models to improve an understanding of the nature and performance of
decentralized political systems. The project has two principal goals. The first
is to understand better the advantages and disadvantages of different
institutional arrangements in federal political systems. More specifically, the
investigators study the effects of different degrees of power-sharing and
coordination among central and local governments. The methodological goal is to
continue extending and analyzing computational models as a methodology in
political science and the social sciences in general. In federal systems, there
are several layers of institutions, including those in the central government,
those that specify relations between the central government and local
governments, and those that decide policies at the local level. The basic idea
behind the project is that a federal system as a whole (a country or an
international organization like the European Union) can benefit when local
jurisdictions develop innovative policies, yet incentives for policy
experimentation are not independent of institutions set up at the system-wide
level or at the local level. The researchers analyze closely models that
incorporate institutions resembling those in two federal systems, the United
States and the European Union. ***
