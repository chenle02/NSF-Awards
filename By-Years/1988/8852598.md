The University of Northern Iowa will purchase a dual-channel, real-time spectrum
analyzer, x-y recorder, calibrated sound power source, and an integrating sound
level meter. This equipment will be used to improve instruction in acoustics
courses both for physics majors and non- majors. The spectrum analyzer will be
used to examine phase differences between different parts of sound systems, and
to look at the dynamic structure of sound spectra. The calibrated sound power
source will permit several new experiments to be added to the courses, and the
sound level meter will be used to analyze noise sources. Advanced undergraduates
also will be able to use the new equipment in research projects. The University
of Northern Iowa will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
