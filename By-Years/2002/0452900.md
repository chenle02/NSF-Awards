The proposed research is to undertake ethno-archaeological and experimental
investigation on ceramic manufacture in the Southwest region of Alaska to better
understand the social, economic, and environmental context of indigenous pottery
production. The pottery of this region is of particular interest because of its
unrefined character and the fact that it was utilized among mobile hunter-
gatherers - a very rare occurrence, pottery being primarily adopted for use by
sedentary groups. The proposal, which at its core is based on archaeological
theory, is unique in two ways: a) the design involves interviewing local people
to gain insight into archaeological phenomenon, b) the PI will do experiments to
better understand the production and use of the ceramics.&lt;br/&gt;
