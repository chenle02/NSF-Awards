EIA-0215588&lt;br/&gt;Paul Rosenbloom&lt;br/&gt;University of Southern
California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Government: Responding to the
Unexpected&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will explore the technical and
social research issues associated with unexpected events. These are
occurerences, man-made or natural, for which prior planning has not been done,
and formal response processes have not been agreed upon or established. In such
cases, virtual temporary organizations must be created quickly, to share and
coordinate data, people, and resources. Attendees will include engineers,
emergenccy response experts, computer and information scientists, and
social/organizational science researchers.
