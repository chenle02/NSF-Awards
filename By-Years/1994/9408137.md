Theoretical research in proposed in the field of intermediate and low-energy
nuclear physics. The projects share, in the main, the methods and models of the
few-body problem, attention to the successful phenomenology of the strong
interaction at the hadronic and at the quark level, and use of the
electromagnetic interaction as a probe of properties of systems bound by the
strong interaction. These projects include three-nucleon forces, nuclear charge
asymmetry in nuclear and hypernuclear systems, and three- body models of light
nuclei and hypernuclei.
