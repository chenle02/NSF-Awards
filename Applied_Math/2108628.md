The role of statistical mechanics is to study large assemblies of microscopic
entities (such as atoms and molecules) and to bridge the gap between microscopic
entities and macroscopic properties like temperature profile and thermal
conductivity. Mathematical justifications of numerous problems in nonequilibrium
statistical mechanics, such as, for example, Fourier?s law statement that the
heat flux is proportional to the temperature gradient, remain highly
challenging. This project aims to develop novel analytical tools and data-driven
computational methods to study a series of nonequilibrium thermodynamic models
arising from statistical physics and wave turbulence. These nonequilibrium
models are relevant not only for the statistical physics, but also for countless
applied scientific problems that are intrinsically irreversible and multiscale,
such as chemical reactions and neural dynamics. The project also provides
research training opportunities for graduate students and advanced undergraduate
students.

In this project, the principal investigator (PI) will use a combination of
analytical and computational approaches to investigate how thermodynamic
properties are derived from a class of microscopic energy transfer models,
including classical billiards-like systems and nonlinear oscillator chain models
coming from nonequilibrium statistical physics and wave turbulence. The general
approach is to use minimum computational work to bypass some difficulties and to
derive mathematically tractable stochastic models. Developing thermodynamic laws
from those stochastic models are usually much easier. The development and
application of data-driven computational methods is a constitutive element of
the proposed research. The PI has developed a series of novel computational
methods that combines traditional Monte Carlo simulation with tools like
numerical partial differential equation solver, coupling method, and artificial
neural network. They overcome several disadvantages of traditional,
discretization-based algorithms, especially for high-dimensional problems. When
studying many high-dimensional problems in this project, we need computational
results of high-dimensional invariant probability measure and its ergodicity to
bypass difficulties that are beyond the reach of rigorous methods.
