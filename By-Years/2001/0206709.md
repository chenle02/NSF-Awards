Habitat loss and conversion are major contributors to biodiversity loss. This
dissertation research project addresses how land use conversions may contribute
to morphological changes in butterflies, ultimately changing dispersal
capabilities and influencing evolutionary pathways. The objectives of the
project are: 1) To evaluate the effectiveness of dispersal proxies for
butterflies; 2) To determine the effects of urban growth patterns and habitat
fragmentation on butterfly dispersal; and 3) To evaluate whether dispersal
morphology in selected California butterfly species has changed in response to
landscape changes.

Butterflies exhibit a range of dispersal behavior from sedentary to mobile.
These behavior differences contribute to a species' success in spatially
structured populations. Within a population there also exists a range of
dispersal capabilities that are influenced by selective pressures from the
environment. Thus, changes in the distribution of habitat can alter dispersal
capability through selection, ultimately reflected in morphology. This project
will use an urban growth model to analyze different landscape patterns using
measures of connectivity for different disperser types. Museum specimens will be
used to investigate morphological changes over time in six butterfly species.
The results of this research will enhance our understanding of how land use
changes and landscape patterns influence population processes that may lead to
evolutionary changes or species extinctions.
