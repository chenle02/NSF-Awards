ABSTRACT PROPOSAL # : DEB-9707871 DEB-9708521 INVESTIGATOR(S) : FOWNES BINKLEY
AND RYAN INSTITUTION: UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY The aims of
this research are to evaluate several contrasting hypotheses about why
productivity of mature forests often declines after a peak at a relatively young
age. Alternatives include (1) increased respiration relative to photosynthesis
with tree age, (2) accumulation of nutrients in organic matter pools with slow
rates of turnover, (3) changes in allocation away from biomass accumulation, and
(4) changes in hydraulic conductivity of trees, leading to decreased stomatal
conductance and thus decreased photosynthesis. Tests of these alternative
hypotheses are important from a wide range of perspectives, from understanding
the ability of forests to store C in response to global climate change to
improving our ability to manage forests for timber and other products. The
location of the study is a Eucalyptus plantation in Hawaii that has been
manipulated for several years by varying tree density and by fertilizer
application. Results thus may be useful to management of plantation forests as
well to understanding of more general successional changes in forest
productivity.
