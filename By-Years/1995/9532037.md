9532037 Riggs The term very large floating structure (VLFS) is often used to
describe floating structures which are at lease an order of magnitude larger
than existing floating structures. Implicit in the definition of VLFS is that
the wave-induced motions of these structures will be significantly affected, if
not dominated, by the flexible, deformational motion of the structure. This is
in contrast to traditional floating structures (such as a ship), the design and
analysis of which are usually based on the hydrodynamics of a rigid body.
Potential applications of VLFS technology include offshore waste treatment
plants, electrical power plants, water desalination plants, mariculture
platforms, oceanographic research facilities, airports, and military bases.
Unfortunately, the field data and experience upon which to base the design of a
VLFS is limited to much smaller structures. It is the objective of this project
to develop further the analysis capabilities and the fundamental understanding
of the response of VLFSs to the ocean environment. Because of their size and
complexity, efficient methods and simplified models are required for their
design and analysis. The work proposed herein builds on the existing technology
base for the analysis of large floating structures. Such work is required prior
to the construction of any VLFS, and hence the results will represent a
significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in offshore floating structure
technology. This research program proposed to: 1) improve existing linear
analysis methods; 2) establish simplified analysis models to be used for design;
and 3) develop a nonlinear analysis methodology to determine the response to
extreme events. ***
