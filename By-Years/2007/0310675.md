Bioinformatics is an emerging collaborative area of research spanning many
disciplines, including biology, computer science, and statistics. Explosive
growth in the amount and variety of data has changed the research landscape to
one where pattern analysis, data mining, information fusion and efficient access
to large, diverse, distributed data sources have become important. The workshop
will bring together researchers in biology and databases. Because the meetings
is associated with an international conference on data engineering, many leaders
in the area of databases will be present. Invited speakers and refereed papers
and panel presentations will insure cross-disciplinary representation. The
impact of the workshop will not only be the introduction of new faculty and
students to an interdisciplinary set of problems, but also highlight the area of
bioinformatics in data engineering.
