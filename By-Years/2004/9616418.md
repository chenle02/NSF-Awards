Licis 9616418 A conference, entitled "Clean Products and Processes", is proposed
for May 4-8, 1997. The conference is to address state of the art developments in
pollution prevention and sustainable technology, with an emphasis on clean
products and processes. The objective of the conference is to bring together
recognized experts from industry, academia and government for the purpose of
presenting, exchanging and discussing information dealing with the cooperative
design, development, manufacture and use of products and processes that provide
reduced risked to human health and the ecology. More specifically, the
conference will provide a forum for exchange of information covering topics such
as clean product technologies, green chemistry and engineering, life cycle
analysis (LCA) and full cost accounting, computer based design tools, clean
energy production and use, and applied pollution prevention (P2) solutions. The
expected benefits are the stimulation, growth and advancement of pollution
prevention practices on an international scale. The Engineering Foundation (New
York) will assume prime responsibility for admission, logistics, mechanics,
publicity, coordination of housing, and finances for the conference. ***
