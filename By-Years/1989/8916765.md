This award provides partial support for the forthcoming Symposium on
"Reversals, Secular Variation and Dynamo Theory", a symposium organized by the
US Committee of SEDI (Study of the Earth's Deep Interior). The Symposium will
take place at St. John's college, Santa Fe from August 6 through August 10,
1990. Support is principally to help defray the travel expenses of some key
participants from abroad who would otherwise be unable to attend the Symposium.
