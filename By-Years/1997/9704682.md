A scalable parallel algorithm is proposed for carrying out molecular dynamics
with quantum transitions. The inclusion of quantum transitions in molecular
dynamics implies that one must solve the Schrodinger equation for the electronic
degrees of freedom along the trajectory of the classical nuclei. The calculation
of forces on the classical nuclei is complicated by the lack of specific
analytic expressions for derivatives of the basis state expansion coefficients
for each adiabatic wavefunction. The problem can be solved through the use of
perturbation theory, however the resulting equations must be solved iteratively.
This iterative calculation, and subsequent calculation of forces and
wavefunction derivatives can be done in parallel for each classical coordinate.
The application of the algorithm to a specific chemical system and electronic
structure method is outlined. Given the large number of chemical and physical
phenomena that exhibit nonadiabatic effects, the algorithm outlined here should
be widely applicable. This proposal represents the first instance of the
application of parallel computers to nonadiabatic dynamics.
