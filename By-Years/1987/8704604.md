This project will expand the existing Standardized Cross Cultural Time
Allocation Database (created under NSF award BNS 8419033) by three times, from
17 datasets to 50. The advantages of doing so are that previous work has made
the addition of new datasets a relatively straightforward and inexpensive
process; that a number of high quality datasets now exist or are being collected
in new fieldwork, but can not be added to the database because current resources
are not sufficient; and that a 50 dataset sample will allow superior hypothesis
testing over a 17 set sample. Each new dataset will be published as a monograph,
containing a user's guide, cednsus, cultural context summary, original data
source codes, and standardized data codes. This research is important because it
adds to a developing database of research on how primitive and peasant peoples
spend their time. This will allow the development of theory through hypothesis
testing on an improved sample of behaviors.
