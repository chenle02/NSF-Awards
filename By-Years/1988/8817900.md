The research program used both an experimental and analytical approach to
investigate the effectiveness of grouting in modifying the behavior of sand
under static and dynamic loading conditions. It is anticipated that this
research will lead to a better understanding of the interactive role of grout in
grouted sand, and a representation of grouted sand behavior in terms of its
constituent properties and the interaction between those properties. A wide
spectrum of grouts from strong and brittle to weak and ductile will be
investigated. A grout quality rating system will be developed based on the
working properties and mechanical properties of grouts. This will help in
systemati- cally evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of old and new
grouting materials. Bonding between the grout and the sand will be studies under
tension, shear and mixed-mode loading using various test configurations. A
biaxial model test will be utilized to study the composite behavior of grouted
sand in terms of the behavior of grouts in soil pores, particle rolling and
sliding, and initial and progressive failure with different particle size and
cluster arrangements. Chemical and long term properties (time dependant) of
grouts and grouted sand will be investigated. Modeling of stress-strain-time
relationships and failure criteria for grouted sand will be done using the
continuum approach, the composite approach, and the probabilistic approach.
Factors such as irrecoverable strain, hysteresis and volume changes will be
incorporated. Fracture mechanics concepts will be introduced to explain some of
the observed brittle behavior of grouted sand including modes of failure.
