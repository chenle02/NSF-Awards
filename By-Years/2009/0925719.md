The objective of this research is to offer a fundamental study of video
communications over dynamic ad hoc networks. The approach is to exploit recent
advances in multiple description coding, multi-path routing, packet scheduling,
and per-node power control across the layers of the protocol stack.
Specifically, there are three main thrusts in the research activities: (1)
cross-layer modeling and theoretical study; (2) design of distributed algorithms
and protocols; and (3) testbed prototyping and validation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project includes the
following components. First, there is limited research pursuing a holistic
consideration of video transport under the impact of multiple lower layers. Such
efforts, however, are necessary to optimize video performance. This research
will thus offer new cross-layer video optimization models and theoretical
results. Second, the efforts on the development of distributed algorithms and
protocols will offer not only practical operational algorithms, but algorithms
that can approach the theoretical limits. Finally, the efforts on testbed
prototyping will offer deeper insights into the challenges associated with video
communications over ad hoc networks as well as valuable feedback to the
theoretical and algorithmic research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
of this project include: (1) the development of new educational materials to
bridge the gap between software applications, networking, and wireless
communication, and (2) research experience for undergraduates and special
opportunities for underrepresented minority students.
