The DelPhi program will be extended to problems related to membrane protein
systems. These studies aim at clarifying the principles that underlie the
structure and function of membrane proteins. Membrane protein electrostatic
properties will be characterized, free energies of insertion of proteins into
the membrane phase will be calculated, and pH effects relevant to the function
of membrane proteins will be investigated. %%% Theoretical and computational
methods will be employed to characterize the structure of proteins which
interact with biological membranes. Initially protein structure will be reduced
to a simple electrostatic-geometric model which will be interacted with a
membrane bilayer. Such studies will contribute important insights into: the
stability of proteins when embedded in biological membranes, the energy required
to insert proteins into membranes, and how protein behavior is controlled in
membrane systems. Since the membrane: protein system is largely responsible for
transferring information from the environment into the cell, understanding the
fundamentals of the structure of the protein: membrane system itself is of great
importance.
