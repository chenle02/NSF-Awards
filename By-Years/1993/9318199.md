9318199 Phillips Description: This project is a calorimetric determination of
the complete magnetic phase diagram for the ordered phases of EuNi3P3. The
existence of a very complex and unusual phase diagram for this material was made
clear by measurements of the magnetization that showed a series of steps at 4.3
and 5.5K, but which left much of the interesting region of the phase diagram
undetermined. The proposed research will define the phase diagram associated
with these steps from the lowest temperatures of interest to TN =7.5K, and
through the entire range of magnetic fields of interest. The results will permit
a detailed comparison with magnetic structures, which are being determined by
neutron diffraction, and with the theory of the steps; and thus contribute to a
fundamental understanding of the relations among magnetic interactions, magnetic
structures, and the properties of magnetic materials. Scope: Dr. P. Radhakrishna
of Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Studies, Bangalore, India,
will play a key role in the project by bringing his expertise in neutron
diffraction and magnetic structures to bear on the design and interpretation of
the experiments. ***
