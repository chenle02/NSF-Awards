This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims at developing a
novel diamondoid/promoter/carbonaceous nanostructure with enhanced hydrogen
storage capability, through simultaneously increasing their pore sizes and
hydrogen binding abilities, as potential on-board hydrogen storage materials.
Developing compact, lightweight, safe and affordable on-board hydrogen storage
media is a crucial step towards the eventual implementation of hydrogen as
transportation fuel. It has been demonstrated that a pure, undoped carbon
single-walled nanotube at room temperature cannot meet the targeted criterion as
the on-board hydrogen storage materials. The success of this Phase I project
could demonstrate that a "hybrid" approach including increasing available
surface areas and increasing binding energies of carbonaceous materials could
enhance the hydrogen uptake capacity of carbon-based nanomaterials and thus
could lead to a commercially viable pathway for hydrogen fuel application in
transportation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful development of on-board hydrogen
storage materials will greatly boost the domestic "Hydrogen Economy."
Utilization of hydrogen, a renewable and clean energy, as fuel for
transportation vehicles or other mobile power supplies will greatly benefit not
only the national economy but also the national energy security and
environmental protection. Therefore, it can be anticipated that intense interest
will be drawn from industry and government as well as academia if the
feasibility of the approach for producing novel on-board hydrogen storage
materials is successfully validated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded
