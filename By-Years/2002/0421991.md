This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II research project will develop a
commercial biotherapeutic using a unique bacterial conjugation technology to
deliver cytotoxic genes and their products to bacterial pathogens. The Phase I
work successfully demonstrated proof of concept by effectively killing multi
drug resistant bacteria in vitro. The Phase II project will optimize the
technology further to create a treatment for nosocomial (hospital acquired)
urinary tract infections.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of anti-infective
therapy. The proposed work provides a unique therapeutic approach that can
compliment standard antibiotic therapies as well as reduce the dire problem of
the burgeoning development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the clinic.
