The "Mission Discovery" project targeting middle school youth is a collaborative
endeavor between the Carnegie Science Center (CSC) and the Hill House
Association. This year-round project will work with inner-city children from
communities in southwestern Pennsylvania. Thirty middle school students will
experience standards-based, creative programs and activities. Physical Science,
Life Science and Earth &amp; Space Science will be the content focus of the
project. CSC provides the mathematics and science expertise while the Hill House
Association (serving six predominately low-income African American communities)
provides the community, recruitment and staffing expertise.
