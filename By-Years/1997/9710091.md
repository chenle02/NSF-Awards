This project is designed to gather, organize and analyze data from the
Northwestern Tungusic languages: Oroqen, Evenki, Negidal, and Solon. The
languages, which are spoken in northern China and Siberian Russia, are not well-
documented and all are seriously endangered. Therefore, a primary goal of the
project is to collect information about the structure of the languages while
they are still spoken. This information will be derived through recordings of
the languages and elicitation sessions with native speakers. The geographic
distribution of the Northwestern Tungusic languages has hampered comparative
work on them in the past. Russian linguists and Chinese linguists who have
engaged in fieldwork on these languages have had little scholarly dialogue. An
important aspect of our research involves bringing together the work of our
Russian and Chinese colleagues. The actual genetic relationships among these
four languages and their relationships to other Tungusic languages are unclear.
On the basis of the data we collect, we can provide a more accurate assessment
of the genetic affiliations within the language family. We will also conduct
tests of mutual intelligibility using recordings of narrative texts. The
Northwestern Tungusic languages are being replaced by Russian, Chinese, and
Yakut, all of which are genetically and typologically distinct. We aim at
determining the kinds of structural changes the Tungusic languages are
undergoing as they become obsolescent, with specific attention to the role of
the three contact languages.
