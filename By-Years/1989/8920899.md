Between 1850 and 1893 an agrarian elite of coffee growers, processors, and
exporters came to power in every independent republic in Central America except
Honduras. They governed, directly or indirectly, until 1948 in Costa Rica, 1979
in El Salvador, and were influential in the Somozas' and the Sandinistas'
Nicaragua. The social origins of dictatorship, democracy, and revolution in El
Salvador, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua are closely tied to the divergent politics
of these coffee elites. Their views remain crucial to prospects for economic
development, peace, and democracy in the region. This research will explore the
economic and political views and historical experience of these elites and
supplement earlier research on their economic activities and social origins. The
research is based on in-depth interviews with members of coffee elite families
in Central America and in Miami, Florida, supplemented by archival research in
Central American collections. The study extends the investigator's published
research on Central American coffee export economies and will contribute to an
understanding of the politics of a region in crisis.
