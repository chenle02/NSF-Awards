This research is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of separation science. This research focuses on the continued
development of capillary zone electrophoresis for analysis of complex mixtures
from biological samples. Several major areas of research will be investigated
including 1) fast separations in a time frame of tens of seconds, 2) two-
dimensional separations involving a combination of liquid chromatography and
capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), 3) acquisition of physicochemical data /
migration prediction via an automated CZE system, and 4) ultra- microscale
analysis. This research uses charge species migration in high voltage fields
(electrophoresis) in combination with new developments in capillary columns to
achieve efficient separation of charged species. This new technology will be
further developed and applied to the analysis of complex biological samples.
