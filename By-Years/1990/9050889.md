This project enhances undergraduate student skills in the related areas of
application design/development and data management. A computer system upgrade
creates a relational distributed database management system (dbms) capability
between two independent nodes running a mix of operating systems and network
protocols. The areas of dbms performance and tuning can be studied in both the
node-specific and distributed cases. The configuration builds an existing
instructional base to a point where it meets students needs. The project is
especially important at a time when dbms technology is a top priority in product
development. It also addresses the increasingly recognized connection between
dbms and expert systems. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the
principal investigator`s institution.
