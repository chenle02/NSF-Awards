The goal of this research is to make massively-parallel computers easy to
program. This means that the natural users of these machines; scientists and
engineers working on large-scale, state-of-the-art research, as exemplified by
the Grand Challenge Problems routinely exploit these computers as a research
tool. The problem of programming massively-parallel computers is attacked from
three directions: (1) collaborating with computer architects on shared-memory
architectures that facilitate programming and compilation, (2) developing new
parallel languages that permit more natural expression of parallel algo\-rithms
and the techniques to implement them, and (3) building performance evaluation
and debugging tools to help programmers to understand and increase their
program's performance and correctness.
