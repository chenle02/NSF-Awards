The prime objective of this research is to design, fabricate, and test an
actuator for an artificial human hand. Current artificial hands have attempted
to provide the required dexterity, however, the current actuator systems
employed are extremely limited and yield subpar performance. The key to creating
effective artificial hands is a light weight actuator. Actuators made from
piezoelectric materials will be used to resolve many of the problems of current
systems. These materials are light and compact, and the piezoelectric actuator
can be placed at the joint thereby eliminating some important problems while
producing better control of the hand. A number of alternative designs for a
piezoelectric actuator will be developed. Analytical models will be developed
for each design and an optimum design will be sought using the gradient search
optimazation technique. Experiments will compare the performance of artificial
hand and the human hand. Response time, dexterity, compliance and controlability
are characteristics that will be analyzed. Issues concerning the capability of
groups of piezoelectric actuators to function together and to handle reasonable
payloads will be addressed.
