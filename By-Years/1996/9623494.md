w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 9623494 Erskine This project investigates the
electronic and magnetic properties of thin film structures, surfaces, and
interfaces using recent progress in materials synthesis, advanced structure
determination methods, and magnetically-sensitive spectroscopic and microscopic
techniques. The principle scientific objectives are to explore the relationship
between structure and magnetism on several length scales and to probe magnetic
phenomenon in artificially-stabilized phases of ultra-thin films, interfaces,
and nanostructures. The experiments address issues of current theoretical
interest including the notion of 2-dimensional scaling universality classes and
related scaling parameters. It is relevant to recent initiatives aimed at a
broader commercialization of Magneto-resistance Random Access Memory (MRAM)
technology %%% The fundamental understanding of the electronic and magnetic
properties of thin film structures, surfaces, and interfaces is of current
interest due to the recent initiatives aimed at a broader commercialization of
Magneto-resistance Random Access Memory (MRAM) technology. The project addresses
issues of current theoretical interest and exploits new advances in materials
synthesis, novel structural determination methods, and state-of- the-art
magnetically sensitive techniques to probe magnetic phenomena and phase
transitions in artificially produced structures. The program is aimed at making
major contributions to the local scientific/ technological infrastructure and to
the Center for Advanced Microstructures (CAMD) at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. ***
