This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to determine the
suitability of Stimpson's Surfclam (Mactromeris polynyma) for aquaculture
development in northern New England from biological, technical and commercial
perspectives. Presently, there are too many unanswered questions about this
surfclam's biology, environmental requirements and marketability to encourage
aquaculture development. The objectives of this project are to 1) determine the
environmental requirements necessary to optimize growth and survival of M.
polynyma in northern New England waters, 2) develop management techniques to
efficiently grow this species to market size within 2-3 years, 3) determine the
impact of toxic algal blooms on the culture and marketability of this species
and 4) conduct a marketing survey and consumer preference study in order to
predict market acceptance and demand for this new product in the United States
and Japan. The results of this research will provide aquaculturists with the
information they need to decide whether or not to commercially cultivate this
species. Potentially, a new seafood product could be developed and marketed in
the Northeast and Pacific Northwest. Results from this project will also provide
fishery managers and public health officials with much needed information about
the impacts of toxic blooms on this commercial species.
