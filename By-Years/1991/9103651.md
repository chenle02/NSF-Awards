Political talk, whether in elections campaigns, legislative debates, public
meetings, or elsewhere, is vital to the political process. Yet very little is
understood about the circumstances under which talk affects political outcomes.
This research will develop game theoretic models which explore the role of
debate and explanation in political decision making. Specifically, the project
will examine talk in two circumstances: within legislatures and committees as
members debate policy choices, and during elections as legislators attempt to
explain and defend their actions to constituents. The principal analytic tool
used will be the theory of games with incomplete information -- specifically
games involving costless signals or communication. This is because political
talk is frequently cheap. It is easy for individuals to make claims that are not
true and are know to be untrue. This feature generates a fundamental credibility
problem that lies at the heart of cheap talk models. When completed this project
will help us better understand the impact of political communication on
political outcomes.
