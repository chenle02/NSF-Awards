Portland Community College (PCC) Sylvania's Realizing Engineering Technology
Achievement (RETA) project increases the number of educated and skilled
engineering technology employees in the Portland metropolitan area, focusing on
females and minorities underrepresented in STEM careers. The project provides
scholarships to students enrolled in Civil/Mechanical Engineering Technology,
Electronic Engineering Technology, and Machine Manufacturing Technology, with
the expectation that four cohorts of 13 students will receive support for two
years. Six scholars who transfer to Oregon Institute of Technology (OIT) seeking
a baccalaureate degree will also receive a one-year scholarship. Scholarships
will be awarded based upon academic achievement and financial need. Additional
program elements will help ensure that scholars are recruited and retained
within the program. A cohort-building structure including monthly roundtables,
sponsored events, mentoring and tutoring of first year scholars by second year
scholars will cement relationships among scholars. Opportunities to strengthen
interactions with PCC and OIT engineering faculty and industry representatives
allows scholars the chance to be mentored by professionals while exploring
further college and career options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses
strategies developed by other NSF-sponsored initiatives on recruiting and
retaining women and underrepresented minorities in engineering. Initiating these
strategies in outreach materials and existing engineering courses broadens the
participation of women and underrepresented minorities in the target programs.
Additionally, it adds to the intellectual merit of the project and the
engineering field overall by adding to the body of knowledge of what works in
recruiting and retaining these target populations in STEM majors. PCC and OIT
will collaborate in both formative and summative evaluations of the RETA
project. The project will collect a variety of data including surveys, student
records, and student tracking to evaluate the project's effectiveness.
