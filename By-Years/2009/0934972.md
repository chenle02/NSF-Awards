The CSUN NSF Teaching Fellowship Program represents a partnership among
California State University Northridge, the Los Angeles Unified School District
(the second largest district in the nation), and the non-profit Art Center
College of Design. The partners are working together to develop and retain
eleven Teaching Fellows and five Master Teaching Fellows who will be secondary
mathematics teachers able to lead efforts to improve mathematics instruction in
their schools and districts. The Fellows are participating in courses and
professional development activities that are designed to meet the needs of
professionals teaching in high-need, urban settings. The goals of the project
include providing Fellows with professional development opportunities such as
mentoring, summer workshops, and in-service activities, increasing achievement
of students as measured by their Academic Performance Index scores, and
improving the long-term retention of the Fellows. The Master Teaching Fellows
are providing leadership in the supervision of student teachers who are
employing research-based pedagogies. The project is being rigorously assessed to
determine the impact of the program on the Fellows' content knowledge,
instructional practices, and attitudes about teaching and learning and
ultimately the impact of the program on the attitudes and achievement of the
students they teach.
