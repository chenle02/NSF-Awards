The mathematical conference "Singular Landscapes" will be held from June 22 -
June 26, 2015 in Aussois, France, in a conference center of the French
government's national center for scientific research, CNRS. The conference will
explore recent progress in singularity theory and its application to diverse
areas of mathematics. There will be a special half day on interactions of
singularity theory and neuroscience. It is expected that there will be between
90 and 100 (international) participants. The conference will allow participants
to establish new working relationships with leaders in this area, and to develop
ongoing collaborations. NSF will provide significant travel and lodging support
for 12 - 15 U.S.-based participants to the conference. The emphasis on the
funding will be towards students, postdoctoral scholars, and participants who do
not have other federal support. More information can be found on the conference

Singularity theory has recently been applied in many different areas of
mathematics, and the talks in the conference will provide an overview of this
progress. The meeting will provide an opportunity for researchers from diverse
fields to interact and establish research connections with each other; in
particular, the participants will benefit from this interaction and from seeing
recent developments in the field and its relationships with other areas. The
primary impacts of the conference will be its dissemination of recent ideas on
an important topic -- Singularity Theory -- and the stimulation and enrichment
of the research careers of the students and early career participants. The
international makeup of the participants to this meeting and its
interdisciplinary focus will be particularly effective at enabling productive
collaborative relationships. The encouragement and mentoring from the conference
will significantly contribute to the success and professional development of
early career mathematicians.
