Nanometer-sized silicon-metal Schottky barriers will be fabricated in a
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) by an electrochemical deposition method. The
electrical properties of these interfaces, which are measured in-situ in the
STM, will allow the chemical nature of the silicon-metal interface to be
deduced.
