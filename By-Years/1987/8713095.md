This award will enable Professor Alfred G. Bishara, Ohio State University, to
collaborate with Professor Ir. F.J.C. Rademacher, University of Twente, The
Netherlands. They will study the interactions between bulk solids and hopper
silo walls under flow conditions. The need to do this research is indicated by
the high incidence of hopper silo structural damage and failure that takes place
under gravity flow of bulk solids. The increasing number and size of silos in
agriculture, mining, chemical, slipping and other industries makes it more
important to understand the response of these structures to various loading
conditions. Many silo construction codes are based on incomplete evidence for
good design. Professor Bishara is expert in the finite element analysis of bulk
solids silo interactions and Professor Rademacher is skilled in parametric
experimental investigations of the flow of bulk solids in hopper silos. Their
skills are complementary and useful to the research they have successfully
collaborated in the past.
