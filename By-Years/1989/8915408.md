Laboratory experiments in a rotating tank will be performed to examine the
separation of a baroclinic coastal current from a coastline of various
curvatures. Additionally the formation of isolated eddies that result after
separation will be observed. A theory based on the results of these experiments
will be developed to understand the physical mechanisms leading to the
separation of coastal jets.
