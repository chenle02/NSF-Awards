This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This project will continue work on developing powerful new
reactions and strategies for chemical synthesis. The proposed research aims to
develop highly useful synthetic methods centered on the use of N-allylhydrazones
as readily prepared compounds that can undergo a diverse array of powerful
reactions. Specifically, the research will provide inventive reactions and
strategies for preparing complex molecules from simple precursors. Hypothesis
driven studies to elucidate the mechanism of these new transformations will
provide insight into the underlying molecular processes and inform future
reaction development. Application of the reactions in the context of target-
directed synthesis of bioactive molecules will demonstrate the methods'
usefulness and broader impacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of
Professor Regan J. Thomson of the Department of Chemistry at Northwestern
University. Professor Regan Thomson's research efforts revolve around the
development of powerful synthetic transformations, in particular those of
N-allylhydrazones. Such chemistry will contribute to our fundamental ability to
construct complicated molecular structures from simple building blocks.
Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in
the pharmaceutical industry.
