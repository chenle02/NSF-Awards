The goals of this project are to help facilitate development of community
consensus regarding planning for ocean observations, long time series and
observatory systems and to provide technical expertise to OCEAN.US. This will be
accomplished through workshops designed to bring disparate participants together
for strategic discussions on the future of technology and through coordination
with other planning activities internationally.
