The goal of Phase I of this research is to study the feasibility of implementing
the ADA programming language on Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISC). A
long-range goal is to design and develop a RISC- based microprocessor for ADA.
The ADA programming language has been designed to serve real time, embedded
applications. RISC-based computers have been found to be cost-effective in
directly supporting programming languages. This study on the implementation of
ada using RISC will lead to future use of commercial microprocessors for real-
time applications.
