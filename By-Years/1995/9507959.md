9507959 Echt This proposal for the study of "Energetics and Dynamics of
Metallofullerenes", deals with the stability of metal atoms encaged in the newly
discovered carbon structures called fullerenes. The approach will involve
collisions between a pulsed beam of charged metal atoms of defined, tunable
kinetic energy with a thermal beam of fullerenes at low vibrational energy.
Experiments will be performed on C60, C70, and possibly some higher fullerenes.
Among the metal that will be used are Y, Sc, La, Several rare earth elements,
Na, K, Mg and Ca. Knowing the energetics of metallofullerenes will help in
identifying species that are potentially useful for applications and in
designing strategies to produce and isolate them in macroscopic quantities. ***
