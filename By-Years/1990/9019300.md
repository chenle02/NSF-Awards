The P.I.s have been funded for 8 days of ALVIN dives to establish the
chronology of active hydrothermal vents at the Fairy castle site on the Endeavor
segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Both old and new samples will be used to: 1)
provided isotopic and mineralogic measurements: 2) test assumptions of the
dating methods; 3) map the chimneys in the study area; 4) model the growth of
these chimneys. Visual and analytical data will be compared between the new and
old samples. Dating will be based on the disequilibria among isotopes of the U
and The decay series, specifically th228/Ra228,Ra228/Ra226 and Pb210/Pb. Fluids
collected by ALVIN will be analyzed and accompaying mineralogic studies will be
performed under separate contracts to J. Edmond (MIT) and M. Tivey (WHOI),
respectively. Benefits will include and evaluation of the Th228 and Pb210 dating
techniques and forman improved understanding of the temporal mineralogic and
fluid evolution of hydrothermal vent systems.
