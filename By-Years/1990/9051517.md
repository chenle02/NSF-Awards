The equipment provided here is needed to introduce a new series of experiments.
As part of an on-going development of a junior-year research-grade laboratory
physics course. These experiments are to center upon coherent optics and
holography. They will be added to a recently developed repetoire of experiments
in the course which currently includes experiments on pulsed NMR, gamma ray
spectroscopy, Compton scattering, quantum oscillations, tunneling and particle
lifetimes. This laboratory serves ten to twelve majors a year. This laboratory
serves a vital function for preparing them for a graduate career.
