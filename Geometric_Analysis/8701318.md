This wide-ranging project will involve researchers at both Arizona and
Berkeley. The underlying theme of the research is the concept of Hamiltonian
system or Poisson structure. The topics to be covered have the potential for
significant applications to both mathematics and physics. The investigations
will cover the following topics and their interconnections: Poisson geometry and
the bundle picture; transverse structures, Lie algebras, and singularities;
differential equations in the complex domain; algebraic Poisson structures;
geometry of bifurcations and normal forms of Hamiltonian systems; Hamiltonian
chaos; modulation theory; Kac- Moody Lie algebras and integrable systems.
