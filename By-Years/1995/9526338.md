9526338 Lange This grant awards $16,610 as one-half of the costs of acquiring
equipment necessary to construct a rapid-quench, cold-seal pressure apparatus
for experimental petrological research to be conducted at the University of
Michigan. Specifically, the system will be used to synthesize volatile-bearing
silicate liquids at low pressures (&lt;300 MPa). These samples will then be used
for low- temperature (&lt;1000 degrees C) measurements of density, thermal
expansion, viscosity, and heat capacity. In situ density (sink/float) and
viscosity (falling sphere) experiments will also be conducted using volatile-
bearing silicate liquids. These experiments will allow precise determination of
the partial molar volume of water and other volatiles in silicate melts. ***
