All cellular RNA molecules are synthesized as immature precursors bearing 5' or
3' terminal extensions which must be removed during RNA maturation or
processing. Despite the fundamental importance of RNA processing reactions,most
are not well-understood biochemically. In particular, little is known about
these processes in the nuclei and organelles of higher plants. Here this focus
is on the key reactions of transfer RNA processing; formation of mature 5'
termini by the endonuclease ribonuclease P, and formation of mature 3'termini by
as yet uncharacterized endonuclease(s). RNase Ps previously described from
eubacteria yeast and vertebrates have an RNA component. In the eubacterial
enzymes, this RNA is the catalytic subunit, whereas its role in nuclear enzymes
is unknown. Surprisingly, RNase Ps from plant nuclei and chloroplasts appears to
lack an accessible RNA subunit like that of eubacteria. In the studies proposed
here, the physical structure of purified RNase P from plant chloroplasts and
nuclei will be elucidated. In particular the presence or absence of any RNA
components in these enzymes will be verified. To understand how RNase Ps with
different structures accomplish the same reaction. The basic features of
substrate recognition and catalytic mechanism of plant RNase Ps and will be
compared to them with those established for eubacterial RNase P.
