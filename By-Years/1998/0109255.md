0109255 Ho This award supports fundamental theoretical research to study the new
dilute quantum gas systems which have been made possible by recent experiments
at JILA and MIT. Projects include studying the physics of Bosons and Fermions in
scalar and spinor limits (i.e. in magnetic and optical traps), the physics of
mixtures of quantum gases, many-body effects in optical lattices and in the fast
rotating regime, and the dynamics in the strongly interacting limit, i.e. near
the Feshback resonance. %%% This grant supports theoretical research to study a
wide range of physics in new dilute quantum gas systems which have been made
possible by recent experiments at JILA and MIT. These experiments have, for the
first time, been able to create a new state of matter, the Bose-Einstein
condensate, which was predicted many years ago. The PI will investigate a wide
range of phenomena in these dilute quantum gas systems. The emphasis will be on
fundamentally new aspects of these systems, effects of strong interaction, many-
body effects and possible applications. This award also supports graduate level
education in condensed matter theory. ***
