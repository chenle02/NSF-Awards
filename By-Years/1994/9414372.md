9414372 Villareal Global mass-balance consideration, vertical nutrient
profiles, and seasonal nutrient cycle data all indicate that the large
subtropical mid-ocean gyres may account for the majority of the global oceanic
production of biogenic silica. Although diatoms can become abundant during
spring blooms in these regions, the available evidence suggests that most of the
annual silica production in summer and autumn. This may be especially true in
the oligotrophic North Central Pacific which does not have a strong seasonal
cycle of phytoplankton production due to Persistent stratification. The surface
waters of the Central North Pacific contain the highest concentrations of
silicic acid of any oligotrophic gyre. It is unknown whether this greater
availability of silicic acid results in higher rates of silica production in
this region compared to other mid ocean systems. Siliceous biomass in this
region has been reported to be overwhelmingly dominated (>90%) by centimeter-
sized mats are not effectively sampled by traditional water bottle samplers and
are typically collected by divers. This give rise to a unique situation where
silica cycling in this region, which is likely to be significant in global
terms, may be dominated by large rare sells that would be essentially invisible
to investigations which employ traditional sampling methods. This project will
be the first study of the production and dissolution of biogenic silica in the
oligotrophic Central North Pacific Ocean. Our study will combine traditional
water column sampling using water-bottle samplers with collections of mats made
by divers to compare the relative roles of these large mats and suspended
diatioms in the cycling of biogenic silica in the surface waters of this region.
This study will have two major objectives: (1) to evaluate of the magnitude of
silica production in the North Central Pacific Gyre, and (2) to assess the
relative contribution mats of Rhizosolen ia two cruises out of Hawaii.
