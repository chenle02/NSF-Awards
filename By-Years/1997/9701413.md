9701413 Springer This award will provide funds for materials and supplies to
enhance the dissertation research of Ms. Angela Burk, a doctoral student at the
University of California - Riverside who is working under the supervision of Dr.
Mark Springer. Ms. Burk's dissertation research involves acquisition of DNA
sequences from three mitochondrially-encoded genes (12S rRNA, valine tRNA, and
16S rRNA) and one nuclear-encoded gene (protamine P1) from a representative of
all living genera of Macropodidae. Macropodids consist of kangaroos, wallabies,
and rat-kangaroos, and are the most species-rich group of all known marsupials.
The groups contains 62 living species that occupy a wide diversity of habitats,
including tropical rain forests, alpine tussock grasslands, and arid inland
plains. Numerous attempts have been made previously to unravel the phylogenetic
history of Macropodidae, but thus far complete resolution has not been obtained.
Ms. Burk's research will establish such a phylogenetic framework and, in
addition, will provide estimates of divergence times of examined taxa. Her
research also will examine the historical development of several morphological
characters and character complexes, address questions regarding rates of
evolution (divergence) of each gene, and evaluate different character-weighing
approaches for phylogenetic inference. Support for training of graduate students
in modern technologies is critical to maintain the workforce of scientists
capable of addressing questions and issues in global biology.
