This CRPA award demonstrates to the public the unique use of nanoscience in
Nature. The Blue Morpho butterfly is large, has blue wings and is eye catching
to say the least. Its wings have been shown to exhibit interesting color
characteristics under varying conditions. These characteristics and uniqueness
are due to nano-molecules that are a chemical construction in the wing
structure. Thus, this butterfly is the hook and segues into a discussion of
nanoscience and crystal structures in Nature. Furthermore, the exhibit which is
referred to as a flex-hibit is small and portable facilitating its use in out-
of-museum demonstrations at public events and in rural areas.

This is a colorful demonstration that is quick, interesting and reversible so
audiences can be entertained for a short 5-10 minutes during which the
"scientist" or staff member can briefly discuss nanoscience and how the
butterfly uses this disguise. Other scientists may find this flex-hibit idea
useful in their desire to demonstrate science concepts, as well. The integration
of this work into the NISE network may pay large dividends in helping others
with demonstrations.

This is a collaboration between Georgia Tech and the Lawrence Hall of Science at
Berkeley.
