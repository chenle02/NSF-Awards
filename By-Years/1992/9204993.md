This project involves a detailed investigation of oxygen isotope variations in
volcanic rocks of the Comstock Lode. A remarkable and perhaps unique opportunity
exists to combine oxygen data on surface samples with data on samples from mine
workings and drill cores in order to construct the first detailed 3-dimensional
image of a hydrothermal system in an important mining district. This work will
include examination of 18 variations down several 1-km-deep vertical mine shafts
as well as the preparation of an isotopic cross-section of the famous Con
Virginia bonanza. The research will disclose critical relationships between
circulation patterns and geologic factors that will advance understanding of
these systems and may prove to be invaluable guides to ore deposits.
