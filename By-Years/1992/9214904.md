This project investigates the design and implementation of algorithms for
generating highly optimized code for current and future processors. Of
particular interest are processors used in embedded applications. To fully
exploit the power of this type of processor requires compilers that use
sophisticated algorithms for performing register allocation, instruction
scheduling, global data flow analysis, data dependency analysis, and processor-
specific optimizations. This research investigates how these optimizations and
others interact, and use this knowledge to develop and implement new
optimization algorithms that operate seamlessly and cooperate to produce very
high-quality code. The starting point for the research is an existing
retargetable optimizer that has been used to build compilers for a wide array of
architectures, including both general-purpose architectures and specialized
architectures used in signal-processing and real-time systems. Its organization
is particularly well-suited to exploring the implementation and evaluation of
cooperative optimization algorithms for high-performance processors.
