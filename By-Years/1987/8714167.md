This award provides travel support for US scientists to attend the Second
Interamerican Meteorological Congress and Congremet V which will be held 30
November to 4 December 1987 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. While the focus of the
conference is weather prediction, presentations will cover a wide range of
subjects from the effects of El Nino and the Antarctic stratospheric ozone hole
on South American weather and climate to the prediction of mesoscale weather
phenomena. The U.S. participation in this conference should help to strengthen
ties with atmospheric scientists in Latin America.
