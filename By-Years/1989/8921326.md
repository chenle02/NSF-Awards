The distribution of galaxies remains both the primary motivation and the primary
test of theories of the origin and growth of structure in the universe. The
dynamical and positional informa- tion which is contained in the distribution of
galaxies in red- shift space is still the only good handle we have on the
underly- ing mass distribution. This research will extend our knowledge of the
distribution of very distant galaxies to a very large degree, approximately
doubling the number of redshifts available for the construction and testing of
cosmological models. This program, to be carried out by members of the group
which first discovered very large scale inhomogeneities in the uni- verse,
builds on work supported under a previous NSF grant in the form of a multi-
object fiber system which permits obtaining thirty or more good spectra of
galaxies in only two hours. This will permit the measurement of some 20,000
redshifts, distributed over 800 square degrees of sky over the next two years.
