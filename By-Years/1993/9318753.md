9318753 Yokota This project investigates the regulation of the reptilian kidney
by neural and hormonal mechanisms, and uses the snake kidney as a model for the
development and application of methods to assess vertebrate renal function in
fine detail, in time and space. The ophidian kidney allows the analysis of renal
function at whole animal, isolated organ and individual functional unit
(nephron) levels, and because of its unique morphology permits the simultaneous
application of several microtechniques which provide unprecedented resolution of
function of filtering units of the kidney, the glomeruli. Using videomicroscopic
and micropuncture methods the blood flow in single glomerular microvessels,
which supply the glomeruli, and glomerular capillary blood pressures can be
measured continuously. These measurements allow us to define the state of
glomerular function and the mechanisms for modulation of glomerular functional
by neural and hormonal factors. Studies on whole kidney function will define the
functional range for the control of renal function by vasoactive hormones. And
studies on intact animals will define the physiological range of endogenous
neural and hormonal effectors in controlling normal renal function and in
regulating responses to changes in physiological state. Integration of these
studies will provide a more detailed picture of vertebrate renal regulation than
has been heretofore possible and may serve to illuminate general principles for
the regulation of renal function for all vertebrate kidneys. ***
