The project will purchase a site license for the SPARTAN computational chemistry
and molecular modeling package for use in general and organic chemistry. The
programs will run on the PC network and will serve four campuses of the college.
The SPARTAN software will be used as an aid in the study of bonding and
structure. The graphics workstation will be used to further develop SPARTAN
applications. The graphics and video production features of the workstation, in
conjunction with the EXPLORER visualization package included, will allow the to
produce images and video tapes useful as classroom aids to understanding
chemical bonding and structure.
