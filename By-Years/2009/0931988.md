0931988&lt;br/&gt;Beskok&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advancements in nanotechnology and nanofluidics
require an understanding of mass, momentum and energy transport in liquids
confined in nanoscale enclosures or channels. Specifically, there exists a need
for (a) fundamental understanding and modeling of the interface (Kapitza)
resistances for realistic and technologically relevant liquid-solid interfaces
and (b) determination of the limitations of continuum hypotheses for thermal
transport applications involving nanoscale-confined liquids.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The interface resistance and thermal
transport in nanoscale-confined liquids will be investigated with the following
objectives: (a) characterization of the liquid-solid interface resistances and
Kapitza lengths for water-silicon, water-graphite, water-aluminum (hydrophilic)
and water-gold (hydrophobic) interfaces, (b) development of phenomenological
Kapitza length models for the aforementioned water-surface pairs, and model
validation using experimental data available in the literature, and (c)
exploration of the ranges of validity of the continuum hypothesis in water-
filled nanochannels. The research will include development of computationally
efficient, interactive thermal wall models for molecular dynamics simulations of
nanoscale heat transfer and interface thermal resistances. Also investigated
will be the temperature jump boundary conditions for nanofluid flow in
nanoscale-confined geometries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Research
results will be disseminated through presentations, conference and journal
publications. The molecular dynamics model and code will be made available to
the public through our web-site with a users? manual. This research will support
the development of a new Ph.D. track in micro- and nanofluidics in the PIs
institution.
