This project is a follow-on of a proof-of-concept project where preliminary
materials for activity-based college geometry using The Geometer's Sketchpad
were produced. Addressing DUE themes of teacher preparation and integration of
technology, this project is developing a textbook and supporting CD. Various
institutions are testing the textbook and conducting a comprehensive evaluation
of its effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit is in the
pedagogic design. The textbook incorporates exploratory activities using
Sketchpad to develop intuitive understanding. The text &lt;br/&gt;(a) engages
students in explorations leading to making and testing
conjectures;&lt;br/&gt;(b) improves geometric reasoning, encouraging transitions
from concrete visualization&lt;br/&gt;to abstract conceptions to axiomatic
thinking;&lt;br/&gt;(c) develops skill in constructing mathematical proofs;
and&lt;br/&gt;(d) encourages articulation of mathematical observations and
ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Course materials support cooperative learning, and
offer an introduction to mathematical reasoning. Since most geometry students
are future teachers, this course models strategies recommended by NCTM (National
Council of Teachers of Mathematics) and includes exploratory activities,
cooperative learning, and mathematical software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts include dissemination of course materials through publication,
workshops, and presentations. Key College Publishing, The Geometer's Sketchpad
distributor, is publishing the book. Faculty development workshops model the
pedagogy through computer explorations and small group discussions, influencing
faculty's teaching in geometry and beyond. The course is valuable for any
mathematics student, particularly for future mathematics teachers.&lt;br/&gt;
