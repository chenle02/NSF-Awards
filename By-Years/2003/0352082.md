This proposal by Dr. Roger Harritt of the University of Alaska, ENRI, is to
complete the excavations of the multiple sites at Wales, Alaska. These sites
have been severely damaged by subsistence digging and erosion. The proposed
project is multifaceted in using history, ethnography, archaeology and faunal
analysis to get a complete picture of pre-contact Inuit life-ways from 1700-200
BP. In addition, the research hopes to shed light on the prehistoric cultural
complexes of the region. The PI has done outreach into the community and has
strong community support, including hiring Wales residents to build community
out reach project, as well as including Wales students and other residents in
the actual research analyses and the excavations of the sites in their
community.
