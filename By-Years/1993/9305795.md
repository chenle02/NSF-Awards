9305795 Quay Determining the effect of man's activities on the concentration of
atmospheric hydroxyl radical is critical to obtain accurate predictions of
global change. Hydroxyl radical levels determine, to a large extent, the
capacity of the atmosphere to oxidize reduced gases. Many of these reduced
gases, like chlorofluorocarbons and methane, are greenhouse gases that are
increasing in concentration. Accurate estimates of present concentrations are an
important test for photochemical models used to predict the future levels of
greenhouse gases and climate change. This project is designed to determine the
seasonal and meridional variability of atmospheric hydroxyl radical
concentrations through a combination of carbon-14 labeled carbon dioxide
concentration measurements and modeling. This work will measure the seasonal
trends in atmospheric carbon-14 labeled carbon dioxide concentrations, with
samples collected on a biweekly basis, at a marine air site on the coast of
Washington State (48 N) and at a remote site. A 2-D radiative-chemical-transport
model will be used to derive zonally averaged hydroxyl radical fields that best
describe the measured seasonal and meridional variability in carbon-14 labeled
carbon dioxide.
