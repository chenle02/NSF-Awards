This proposal from the University of Oklahoma (OU) in collaboration with the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) requests funds to
establish a Science and Technology Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms.
The Director of the Center will be Professor Douglas K. Lilly. A new generation
of models must be developed to address the storm-scale prediction problem and
there is currently no critical mass of scientists anywhere in the U.S. to carry
out this research. The Center will fill this gap and will serve as a focal point
for other researchers interested in this area. Complementary modelling work is
being carried out at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and
other universities, but the models used in these related research efforts do not
provide adequate frameworks for the multi-scale tasks required in the OU Center.
The Center plans to enhance their working relationships with NCAR and other
university researchers, especially through exchange of faculty, staff, and
students. The initial research will proceed in three directions: model
development; predictability research and sensitivity testing; and data
assimilation and initialization research. The scope of the problems being
addressed spans basic theory, experimentation, and operational testing. The
success of such models will necessarily require the use of advanced numerical
techniques not previously applied to atmospheric modelling; many will force a
complete change in the framework of existing models. In addition, the
assimilation/initialization problem will require a different theoretical
framework than has been heretofore used. Finally, by developing a new model,
full advantage can be taken of rapidly evolving computer architectures,
particularly the large memory and highly parallel supercomputers. The research
couples the multidisciplinary expertise at OU. The governing physics of many
phenomena, e.g., cloud dynamics and surface energy balance, must be investigated
and modelled. The model must then be incorporated into a general mesoscale
predictive capability, using numerical procedures which accurately simulate the
flows involved. With the methods envisioned, the computer is allowed as an
"expert system" to alter its numerical algorithm and its spatial and temporal
resolution, in response to observable changes in the fields. All of these must
be tested using the inputs from real data, and the initialization and
assimilation of these data are the linchpins of the process, allowing the
predictive capability of the simulation to be tested and evaluated against
measured atmospheric processes.
