This award supports the travel and maintenance costs for a project-planning
visit to Vietnam and Laos. The participants are the PI, Dr. Monique Leclerc, a
senior US scientist; one junior scientist, her post-doctoral associate, an
Hispanic female; and four additional senior US scientists representing a
complementary array of expertise as well as a broad institutional and
geographical distribution across the US. This group of six US scientists will
travel first to Chiang Mai, Thailand, and then on to Vientiane, Laos. In both
locations, they would meet extensively with local partners to plan a large
proposal to be submitted at a later date. &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this visit
is to plan a comprehensive research project that, if funded, will focus on the
entire Mekong River environment, including not just the hydrology and biology of
the river, but also the effects of new dams upstream on agriculture, on
microclimates, on forestry, on land mammals in the Mekong drainage, and on human
populations. This broad-based approach to analyzing the effects of damming of
the Mekong sets this project apart from so many other Mekong-based projects, and
it has the potential to bring in many different partners including US and local
government agencies, non-governmental organizations such as WWF and The Nature
Conservancy to support planning and environmental protection as well as
involvement of young researchers in a comprehensive study.
