The proposal is for an experimental and theoretical research program to
investigate turbulent flow and convective heat transfer in pin fin arrays, which
are an important component of modern gas turbine blade cooling systems. From the
database generated from comprehensive experiments, the development of more
physically based turbulence closure models will be undertaken, and these will be
applied to commercial software packages. The results, if successful, will allow
improved cooling system design with more rapid design cycles, leading to reduced
cost and higher engine efficiencies due increased allowable turbine inlet
temperatures.
