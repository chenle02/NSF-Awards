Center for Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) &lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1128748
&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1127923 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding
for the Center for Electromagnetic Compatibility located at the Missouri
University of Science and Technology and the University of Houston site,
respectively. Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF
approved solicitation, NSF 10-601. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit
proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will provide a novel insight into EMC
coupling path physics, especially in complex geometries such as systems and
printed circuit-boards. The project will provide solid theoretical and numerical
basis for coupling path direction, which can open an entirely new solution
strategy for EMC problems, thus transforming the practice of electromagnetic
problem solving in EMC and provide the industrial consortium members with a
practical and useful diagnostic and mitigation methodology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The availability of coupling path detection methods can
drastically improve the understanding of complex EMC problems, enabling more
functionality to be integrated into products as diverse as high-speed
electronics, automobiles, or military hardware. The proposed project will help
assure the relevancy of the research to industry and ensure that results will be
integrated into the development of real products that make their way to the
consumer. The center will gain the unique capability to visualize coupling
paths; this will allow an increase in the scope of the center by addressing
additional audiences.
