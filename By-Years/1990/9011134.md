This project involves a comparative analysis of damage to public property
caused by the Loma Prieta and Whittier earthquakes. Specific objectives of the
study are: (1) to collect a detailed listing of physical damage to public
facilities including public buildings, streets, bridges and water sewer systems
and document repair and replacement costs for each class of damage; (2) to
produce one way descriptive statistics that show the overall damage pattern and
the damage pattern for each jurisdiction; (3) to compare the distribution of
damage across types of facilities with that experienced in the Whittier Narrows
earthquake and test the hypothesis that the proportion of damages for each class
is the same; (4) to calculate damage ratios for various systems based on the
actual losses and secondary data on the amount and value of property in each
case study jurisdiction; and (5) to compare the actual damage experienced in
both Whittier Narrows and the Loma Prieta earthquakes to the damage predicted by
the ATC-13 damage estimation method and determine the variation of each to the
predicted values.
