Mathematicians at Amherst, Hampshire, Holy Cross, Mount Holyoke, Smith and
Williams Colleges and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst will set up a
Regional Geometry Institute beginning in January of 1991. The Institute will
bring together researchers, graduate students, undergraduate students and
college and high school faculty. The overall theme of the Institute will be the
interaction between geometry and computation. The research part of the Institute
will consider situations where computational techniques shed new light on
classical geometric problems and it will examine topics that have come to the
fore because of the existence of such techniques. The educational part of the
Institute will explore how computers make it possible to uncover these themes at
home and in the classroom and it will examine the opportunities this presents
for the geometry curriculum at the high school and undergraduate levels.
