The goal of the targeted infusion project at Saint Augustine's College is to
increase the number of STEM majors that complete the baccalaureate degree and
matriculate into graduate degree programs in these fields. There is a special
emphasis on plant biology and environmental science, two disciplines where
diverse students are grossly underrepresented. By exposing Biology undergraduate
majors to courses and career opportunities in plant biotechnology and
environmental science, as well as strengthening student preparation for the
rigor of graduate study, the institution expects to contribute to diversifying
the US STEM workforce in a meaningful way. Specifically, the project will
provide for curriculum additions and revisions beyond the traditional emphasis
on biological processes. The project will also support modernization of
laboratory equipment and research internships for students at partnering
research intensive institutions. Collectively, these interventions have the
potential to yield significant outcomes that can be easily transferable to
similar institution types.
