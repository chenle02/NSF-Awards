The University of Washington, as the lead organization of the Research+Practice
Collaboratory, proposes an EAGER project to convene three workshops on
strategies for forming and sustaining research-practice partnerships (RPPs).
RPPs have been shown to be effective in building knowledge about and
implementation of education efforts in preK-12 settings and they have been
required for applicants to the CSforAll:RPP solicitation (NSF 17-525). The first
two workshops will provide technical assistance to groups on the process of
forming RPPs focused on inclusive Computer Science (CS) education. The third
will focus on strengthening newly formed RPPs that were funded under the FY17
CSforAll:RPP solicitation.

The first two workshops will be modeled on similar, successful technical
assistance meetings that were held in 2017. They will host groups of
stakeholders--CS faculty, CS teachers, school administrators, state and local
education officials, and representatives of local Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) organizations--interested in forming an RPP
to address equitable, sustainable CS education. The workshop activities will
help participants identify compelling questions that can be supported by an RPP,
design projects that include measures to develop and sustain robust RPPs, and
gain insight into the ways in which RPPs can be leveraged to develop evidence
that can inform both practice and theory. The third workshop will provide
additional technical assistance to PIs that have already received funding for
RPPs through the FY2017 CSforAll:RPP solicitation (NSF 17-525), helping the to
strengthen their partnerships, better understand the co-creation of suitable
research agendas, learn from other RPP teams, and resolve any organizational
challenges they have encountered. It will be held in conjunction with the 2018
Broadening Participation and Education in Computing PI and Community Meeting.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
