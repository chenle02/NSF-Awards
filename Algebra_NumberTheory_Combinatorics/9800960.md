9800960 Nakano This award supports work on problems in the representation and
cohomology theory of algebraic groups and related structures. These related
structures include Lie algebras, infinitesimal group schemes, quantum groups,
Schur algebras, symmetric groups and Hecke algebras. Many of the problems reduce
to studying the representation theory for certain finite-dimensional algebras.
These algebras are in general not semisimple so the fundamental representation
questions involve determining the simple and projective modules, computing the
composition factors of the projective modules, understanding the block theory
and classifying the indecomposable modules. The principal investigator will also
work on the use of geometric methods in the representation/cohomology theory for
these related structures. The research supported concerns the representation
theory of various algebraic objects including algebraic groups and Lie algebras.
Representation theory is an important method for determining the structure of
these objects. This work has implications for a number of areas of mathematics
including ring theory, group theory, topology and the study of Lie algebras.
