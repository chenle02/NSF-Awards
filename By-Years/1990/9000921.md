The existing quasi-steady model for face seals for use with two-phase fluid
flows will be extended to include dynamic analyses of axial motion and other
effects which cause wobble and associated instabilities and pressure distortion.
Dynamic coefficients for tilt and axial displacement will be calculated and used
to develop criteria for dynamic stability.
