9400195 Maxwell The aim of the research of this project is to find a combination
of piezoelectric materials and surface mount electronics that, in a unique
geometry, will produce a reliable Large Tactile Computer Controlled Array
suitable for a full page Braille display. The choice of piezoelectric materials
and geometry must produce a robust design, a design that when mass produced is
affordable to the Blind community. The reliability is a particular key aim in
that a dense tactile array can have several thousand pins, all of which must
work. Present displays of 40 characters compared to the proposed display of
approximately 1000 characters means that the manufacturing yield must be
improved by a factor of 25. Research directed at the piezoelectric ceramic
materials to identify the stress/strain, applied electric fields and fixture
cycles to predict lifetime requires finite element computer modeling. To enhance
the manufacturability and reliability, a geometric modular approach
incorporating planar element rather than stacked cantilever actuators is
required. Thus the Large Array will be made from many small, flat, identical,
mass produced modules. ***
