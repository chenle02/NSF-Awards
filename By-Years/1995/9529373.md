This award is for a series of discussions at academic institutions and a
national meeting in Washington to illuminate the major sources of stress
affecting the academic research and education community in the sciences and
engineering, and to provoke debate on constructive approaches to change. This
project builds on the experience a similar project carried out in 1993-1994 by
expanding the initial campus-based dialogues to a wider array of institutions
and addressing some new issues. This second phase of the study has three
objectives: to catalyze discussion and change on campuses; to encourage national
dialogue among all parties with interests in the academic enterprise; and, to
revive or recast the compact between the federal government and universities. As
in the previous study, a report will be issued and widely disseminated to
colleges and universities and other stakeholders jointly by the National Science
Board and the Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable. This report
will serve as a record of the insights and proposals of the project
participants, and it will enumerate activities or "best practices" that have
proven to be useful in resolving outstanding concerns.
