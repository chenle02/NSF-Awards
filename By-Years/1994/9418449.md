The color patterns of butterfly wings are some of the most spectacular examples
of pattern formation in cellular fields. Little is known, however, about how
these patterns develop and evolve. Recently, a molecular characterization of
butterfly wing pattern formation was initiated by cloning butterfly homologs of
numerous Drosophila appendage- patterning genes. The expression of these genes
in developing imaginal discs indicates that while the overall organization of
the developing butterfly wing is similar to that of Drosophila, the
suborganization of the butterfly wing is marked by novel and dynamic patterns of
regulatory gene expression, some of which presage the future position of adult
wing pattern elements. The project proposed here aims to test three hypotheses
emanating from this initial characterization of the patterning landscape in
butterfly wings, including: (1) eyespot formation is the product of a genetic
circuit involving proximodistal patterning genes; (2) the secreted wingless,
decapentaplegic and hedgehog signaling proteins are involved in wing pattern
formation; and (3) the developmental prepattern may be conserved and its
interpretation by downstream genes is species-specific. The experimental plan
involves the cloning of several additional proximodistal patterning genes, the
analysis of their spatial and temporal relationships throughout wing formation,
assessment of individual protein functions through ectopic expression studies,
and the comparative analysis of developmental prepatterns in different butterfly
species. The combination of descriptive, experimental, and comparative work is
aimed at identifying some of the principal mechanisms guiding the development
and evolution of wing patterns.
