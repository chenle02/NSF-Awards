I am researching how moisture influences a multi-predator trophic cascade in a
soil system. At my research site on the California coast, the entomophagous
fungus Beauveria bassiana is the most potent predator of root-feeding insects in
dry summer soil. During the rainy winter and spring, however, soil moisture
increases sharply and the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis marelatus
becomes the primary predator as B. bassiana decreases in predatory efficiency.
Both prey on ghost moth (Hepialus californicus) larvae, root-feeding herbivores
that feed on the bush lupine Lupinus arboreus. The lupine shows increased
growth, seed set, and survivorship in the presence of the nematode, which preys
on H. californicus that would otherwise eat the lupine's roots. The wet-season
interactions in this food chain are known as an important example of a
terrestrial trophic cascade. My research seeks to develop a complete picture of
this food web by understanding predation on the herbivore during the dry season,
and the role that moisture plays in both predators' activities. I also propose
testing whether the two predators have equivalent impacts on the prey
population, possibly leading to cascades due to different predators in the wet
versus dry season.
