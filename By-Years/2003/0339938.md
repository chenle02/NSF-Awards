This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
investigate the feasibility of a key technology designed to enhance seismic
resolution and imaging of deep-water complex geologic structures by using
variable azimuth wave-equation migration (VAWEM). VAWEM will provide much
greater resolution and accuracy than what can be accomplished today for towed
marine streamer data, and at significantly less computational cost.

This advanced imaging methodology will improve success rate and cost
effectiveness for new field discoveries and increase recovery efficiency for the
development of existing fields. This technology does not exist in the industry,
it is a fundamental revolutionary advance, and is a necessary building block in
any seismic processing system that images 3-D prestack data using wave-equation
methods for imaging deep water, under-salt complex geological structures which
are the focus of modern oil- and-gas exploration.
