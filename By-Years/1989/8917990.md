The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Steve Yates of the University of Kentucky and Dr. Gabor Molnar of the
Institute of Isotopes, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, is to measure short
nuclear lifetimes. The researchers will employ a technique known as the Doppler-
Shift attenuation method to follow inelastic neutron scattering reactions. Their
collaborative studies of spin-flip excitations in N=50 nuclei, of collective M1
scissors mode states in deformed rare earth nuclei, and of octupole and
multiphonon excitations should yield new, high quality spectroscopic information
of exceptional intrinsic merit in the field of nuclear structure physics. This
project in nuclear physics fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.//
