This project will develop interactive computer-based tutorials at two levels of
difficulty for 21 major topics in Introductory Chemistry. The tutorials, for use
by individual students outside the classroom, will be produced using HyperCard,
a powerful Macintosh program for organizing and interacting with information and
images. HyperCard integrates high-quality graphics, sound, animation, and
controlled test fields to allow production of sophisticated computer-assisted
instructional software. Feedback on one such tutorial, "The Mole Concept", is
sufficiently positive that we wish to generalize and extend the approach. Aids
such as printed cards and lecture materials based on the HyperCard stack can be
easily obtained, and the tutorials can be easily customized by individual
instructors. The tutorials will be made available for the cost of materials and
handling.
