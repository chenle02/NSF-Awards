This three-year teacher enhancement project, starting in the summer of 1990 and
sponsered by the University of Michigan- Dearborn, will provide a four week
summer program and follow- up activities for 30 high school teachers each year
from the Detroit Metropolitan area. Preference for selection to the program will
be given to teachers who apply as part of a team from the same school and
represent the natural sciences and the social sciences. The project will teach
science through interdisciplinary problem solving by focussing on the Rouge
River Watershed-the area which contains the school systems of Detroit, Wayne
County, and Oakland County. This program will interrelate the areas of biology,
chemistry, environmental science, geography, geology and social science. The
Rouge River Watershed is the subject of intense scrutiny by the Michigan
Department of Natural Resources and the media because of its extreme pollution
problems and the mandated Remedial Action Plan. Because the problems are more
serious than most citizens recognize, a science education program which relates
the scientific, technological, and social basis for the problems and the
solutions will lead to improved understanding of science as well as create
citizenry concerned and informed about its environment.
