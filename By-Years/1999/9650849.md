This project involves acquisition of a near infrared (NIR) spectrometer,
filling "the spectral gap" between UV-visible and mid-infrared spectroscopy in
the department. This instrument represents an opportunity to explore and apply
one of the spectroscopic methods most neglected in academic course offerings.
Interest in the applications of NIR spectroscopy has increased dramatically in
the last decade, particularly in chemical industrial settings. However, this
department is not able to adequately convey the current relevance of this
methodology in industrial, agricultural, and biological applications because of
the lack of proper instrumentation. To better prepare undergraduate students,
not only those majoring in chemistry but also those pursuing degrees in
engineering and biology-related fields, the project is introducing, at the
sophomore and senior level, several experiments designed to emphasize the wide
range of applicability of NIR spectroscopy. The project's experiments couple
remote sensing with NIR spectroscopy to study processes relevant to industry and
biology. Furthermore, to improve the sensitivity and selectivity of complex NIR
spectra, students are taught the cautious use of signal processing algorithms.
Graduates who are exposed to NIR spectroscopy will be better qualified and more
able to tackle relevant questions with the best available technologies. The
impact of this addition to the program's instrumentation not only benefits
undergraduate students, but also attends to one of the most neglected, yet most
powerful, spectroscopic methodologies.
