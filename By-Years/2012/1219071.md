This project is studying statistical inference from datasets tracking the
diffusion of new ideas or behaviors through a population. Game theoretic models
for the diffusion are utilized in which members of the population decide to
adopt a technology by maximizing a pay-off that depends on an underlying network
structure. Example questions include the identification of "first movers" and
the most likely series of actions that result in a given observed state of the
network. Algorithms are being developed for characterizing the maximum
likelihood estimate of first movers for an evolutionary game theoretic framework
with smoothed best response dynamics. Additionally algorithms to identify
influential nodes and the network graph along with the associate payoff
functions are being studied. The associated modeling and analysis build upon
foundations in probability and statistics, Markov processes, statistical
mechanics, optimization and game theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding
diffusions in social networks is broadly applicable across society including
areas such as marketing, economics and social sciences; efforts are being made
to disseminate the results of this work to such fields as well as to incorporate
ideas into undergraduate and graduate courses in EECS.
