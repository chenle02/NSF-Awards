An important problem in industry is coordinating production processes in multi-
product factories, so as to minimize the sum of production and inventory costs.
In this research effort, the plan is to generalize a method previously developed
for scheduling production in such plants (e.g., paper mills). First, a classical
production model schedules end-of-period inventories for finite periods, as well
as cumulative or aggregate quantities of production. Then, a parametric method
schedules production within each period to meet the planned goals for end-of-
period inventories and total production, taking capacity constraints into
consideration. Product prices are used as incentives to produce and as penalties
for deviating from target inventory levels. The program simulates the
consequences of choosing specific products for specific time periods. It
generates good (not optimum) schedules rapidly, and thus can be used
interactively. Schedules can be changed in real time to reflect changing or
unforeseen conditions. A variety of mathematical methods will be used to improve
product sequencing, choice of time period, and transition of production from one
product to another.
