The generating and testing of random variables has provided some of the most
widely used methods for Monte Carlo simulation. Several new methods have been
developed for new kinds of computer architectures, notably the subtract-with-
borrow method that is very fast, requires few memory locations, has extremely
long periods and provable uniformity. Current efforts are directed toward
methods that will take advantage of massively parallel systems, new mass storage
devices and other supercomputer features so that software for statistical
computing can keep up with and take advantage of the remarkable advances in
hardware. Many computer simulation studies call for random input at various
point because of uncertainties or complexities of the underlying models. The
construction of "pseudo-random" numbers can be sufficiently sophisticated to
give workable substitutes for true random observations from a natural process.
At the same time these generated numbers are readily available and can, when
needed be reproduced exactly for testing purposes or to compare two different
computing approaches to the solution of extremely large and complicated
mathematical problems.
