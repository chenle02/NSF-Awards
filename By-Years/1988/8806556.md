Funds will be used to update the central rheology laboratory by adding a state
of the art rotational rheometer. The laboratory is under the direction of H.
Henning Winter (own use of about 60%) and is shared with several faculty, their
students, and with visiting scientists. The current laboratory lacks essential
measuring capability in several respects (large shear strain, normal stress in
shear, combined large strain with small amplitude probing, low stress
viscoelastic measurements) which will be covered by the proposed commercial
instrument.
