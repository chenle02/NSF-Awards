A single-channel spectrograph currently used for astronomical spectroscopy
introduces limitations into the kind and quality of experiments which may be
performed, and is not representative of the ability of multichannel detectors
which are becoming widespread in laboratory physics and especially in
astronomical imaging at many institutions. The current experiments at Middlebury
are being revised and improved using a modern, sensitive multichannel detector
(CCD array camera) and extended to fainter astronomical objects, including solar
system objects and the brighter stars. This is done by the assembly of a bench-
mounted spectrograph and an optical fiber feed from the telescope to the
spectrograph. The techniques and instruments developed make possible a wide
variety of highly educational lab exercises for physics and astronomy
undergraduates, and creates student-faculty research opportunities in the field
of precision stellar radial velocities. The instrumentation being developed
emphasizes modularity and flexibility and is being documented and publicized in
a manner that will help any institution with a modest telescope incorporate
astronomical spectroscopy into its undergraduate program.
