This research is focused on (1) unique chemistry and quench textures of Rooiberg
Felsite, the earliest member of the giant Bushveld Complex. (2) progressive
recrystallization (T>1,200oC) of intensely strained quartzose sediments below
the Rooiberg Felsite into a network of tridymite needles and (3) structure and
evolution of the Bushveld-Vredefort system. Present data suggest that multiple
impacts of a disintegrating asteroid or comet caused the Bushveld-Vredefort
catastrophe; endogenic alternatives are possible but involve novel and
unverified processes. Vredefort rocks furnish evidence for shock in the form of
planar features in quartz, shatter cones, pseudotachylite, coesite and
stishovite. Rocks in equivalent structural positions are not exposed in the
Bushveld Complex; elsewhere, recrystallization and incipient melting have
destroyed earlier textures and minerals. Nevertheless, a search for shock
features will continue in favorable localities, other field work will be carried
out, and detailed petrologic and geochemical studies will be made. This study
has the potential to completely change long standing ideas as to the origin of
the world's largest layered mafic complex and its very extensive ore deposits.
