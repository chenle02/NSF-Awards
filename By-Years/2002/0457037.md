This proposal requests funds to support the High Energy Physics research of a
group at Michigan State University that is participating in CDF and ATLAS, two
experiments probing the energy frontier. The CDF experiment at Fermilab's
Tevatron is studying proton-antiproton collisions. These studies have yielded a
number of important results including the discovery of the top quark, an
accurate measurement of its mass, and the measurement of the jet cross section
at the highest transverse energies currently accessible. The CDF detector has
been extensively upgraded to take full advantage of the increased energy (1.8 to
1.96 TeV) and the increased luminosity present in Run II and this group has made
major contributions to the upgrades. The group is working on studies of heavy
quarks, electroweak particles, Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) and searches for new
phenomena with a data sample that is currently a factor of 3-4 larger than that
taken in the previous run. The group is also contributing to the development of
new physics tools, especially for the analysis of QCD phenomena, that will be
necessary to fully exploit the Run II data as well as to exploit the data to be
taken by the next generation of experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) near Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The main focus of this
group on the ATLAS LHC experiment has been the construction and testing of parts
of the hadron calorimeter. The group is designing, building and installing
scintillator planes to be used for triggering and timing and is working on the
installation of the detector. The group is involved in pilot studies to maximize
the physics extracted from the early running of ATLAS.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The group includes
undergraduates and high school science teachers, and their students, in research
activities. They are participating in the QUARKNET program with the goal of
sharing the excitement of discovery in particle physics with many young
students.&lt;br/&gt;
