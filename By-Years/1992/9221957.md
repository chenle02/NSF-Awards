The conference, Arithmetic Geometry with an Emphasis in Iwasawa Theory, is to
be held at Arizona State University, March 15-18, 1993. This conference has
several goals. . Recently, there has been a great deal of activity and many
striking advances in arithmetic geometry. Due to the heavy backlog in journals,
work frequently does not appear in print for several years after completion.
This conference will provide a means for researchers outside of select circles
to learn what is currently the state of the art. . The problem of time lag
alluded to above is more acute for new conjectures and work in progress. The
overwhelming preponderance of journal articles in number theory are for finished
work. The conference will provide an arena for researchers to pose new questions
to the number theory community, offering interesting ideas for new directions
researchers may wish to take. . By bringing people together from across the
country and around the world, the conference will facilitate researchers
discussing their work with the world's experts, potentially leading to new
insights. . Finally, talks which survey a sub specialty can provide direction
for researchers looking to enter a new area (especially graduate students). The
conference will include a combination of one hour and half hour talks, with no
two given simultaneously (so that participants can attend them all). All of the
talks will be on the conference theme of arithmetic geometry; some talks will
focus on recent results, some on new conjectures, and others will give overviews
of sub-disciplines within arithmetic geometry. All lectures and informal
discussion periods will take place in space provided by the mathematics
department on the Arizona State University campus.
