This research project examines how elementary, high school, and college
students develop intuitive conceptions about calculus--which in this case is
broadly defined as the mathematics of change and variation. The central
assumption is that, from an early age, people develop models about how things
change. Mathematics instruction must build upon these intuitive models. The
method of investigation involves sequences of teaching interviews in which
individual students are presented with problems about situations of change such
as the motion of cars, flow of water, or plant growth. They are given physical
materials and software tools to help them experiment with the problems.
Researchers observe and videotape the ensuing discussion, use of materials, and
student-constructed representations of the solution. Subsequent analysis focuses
on students' constructions of the problem, the ideas that guide their
predictions, the resources they use, and the principles they generate to verify
predictions and explanations. The project's findings will help mathematics
educators rethink the ways in which calculus is currently taught, as well as the
age levels at which key calculus ideas are introduced. Results will also feed
directly into a major elementary mathematics curriculum, in the form of a
curriculum strand about "change."
