&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0123456&lt;br/&gt;Raghavan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Americas Program award will support Dr. Madhavan Raghavan of the University of
Iowa to make a planning visit to work in collaboration with Dr. Erasmo S. da
Silva from the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil. This planning visit will
permit the researchers to perform pilot studies and plan a collaborative
research proposal. The overall objectives of the proposed research are: (1) To
study the biomechanical properties of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) using
specimens obtained during autopsies performed at Sao Paulo University School of
Medicine and (2) To evaluate the practicalities of the long-term collaboration.
The structure of the planning visit takes into account the intellectual and
physical assets of both participating investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
long-term goal is to comprehensively study the biomechanical properties of
abdominal aortic aneurysm. Both of the participants in the study, and their
associates, will learn much about the science and the technique practiced by
their counterparts. If the follow up were successful, the results would be of
significant benefit worldwide. &lt;br/&gt;
