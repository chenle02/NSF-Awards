&lt;br/&gt;Multi-homed networks are typically consisting of a number of access
links be-longing to several distinct service providers. Many networks in the
Internet are becoming multi-homed because multi-homing has the potential to
improve availability and robustness, improve end-to-end application performance,
re-duce operational cost of a user's network, and improve competitiveness of
ser-vice providers. In this research project, the researchers will design
architecture, algorithms, and protocols for multi-homing to contribute to the
efficient opera-tion of multi-homed networks, which are becoming a critical
component of the national information infrastructure. This research also aims to
develop and dis-tribute a software tool to evaluate key perspectives of global,
heterogeneous networks consisting of adaptive single-homed networks, multi-homed
networks, and overlay networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
