This research involves new and improved methods for robust estimation of
multivariate location and shape and identification of outliers. Massive data
sets, especially in high dimension, form a particular target of the research.
The research focuses on theoretical, methodological, and computational questions
in robust multivariate analysis, and also extends the investigators previous
work into cluster analysis.

Identification of outliers and clusters of data in high dimension and in massive
data sets is an important and difficult problem. These data sets occur in
satellite imagery, in the human genome project, in x-ray astronomy, in
geophysics, and in many other areas of science. They range in size from multiple
gigabytes to terabytes, and present significant challenges for analysis. This
project is aimed at methods for uncovering previously unknown structure in these
data sets. The computationally intensive nature of the methods relates this
research directly to the High Performance Computing and Communication Federal
Strategic Area, and the applications to environmental science data relates it to
the Environment and Global Change area. The project is supported by and
associated with the National Partnership for Advanced Computational
Infrastructure.
