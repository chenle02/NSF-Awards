The role of solvation in interfacial electrochemistry is the focus of this
research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. Ion
transfer reactions, probed spectroscopically and electrochemically, will be used
to study the mechanism of solvation. Single crystal gold electrodes modified
with self-assembled monolayers form the basis of the work. The role of water at
these interfaces will be probed using admittance measurements and simple
electron transfer test reactions. Solvation in very fast electron transfer
processes will be examined, and the theory of solvation for these systems will
be developed. The information generated by this study will be useful in
developing an understanding of charge transfer and control in biological
membrane systems. An experimental and theoretical study of charge transfer at
organic monolayer modified gold electrodes is the focus of this research
project. Understanding the mechanism and kinetics of electron transport across
these model membranes will be useful for understanding the role of solvation in
these biological model systems.
