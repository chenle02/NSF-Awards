A new high-resolution cathode-luminescence (CL) imaging system will support the
next generation of research studies at Weber State University, a primarily
undergraduate institution in northern Utah. The new CL system will interface
with an existing scanning electron microscope (SEM) housed in the College of
Science Microscopy (COSMic) lab and promote student training in instrumentation,
data science, and image processing via undergraduate research experiences and
course-based projects with a focus on enhanced recruitment and retention of
students from under-represented groups into the physical sciences. The system
will improve the institutional research infrastructure and capabilities,
supporting interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty and students in
multiple science departments and with outside institutions and government
agencies. Images from the SEM-CL system and research results will be
disseminated to broad, diverse audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEM-CL is a key
micro-analytical technique to image features within a variety of materials.
Projects that will utilize integrated CL imaging include: (1) geochronologic and
geochemical analysis of minerals to test models of crustal evolution of
Paleoproterozoic basement rocks with inherited Archean components western North
America, which record a key time in Earth history marked by onset of
supercontinent cycles along with the characterization of source-to-sink patterns
in synorogenic strata in Cordilleran sedimentary basins, which will increase
understanding of retroarc fold-thrust belt exhumation patterns and volcanic arc
tempos; (2) microstructural analysis of quartz and calcite from fault/shear
zones and vein systems will increase understanding of fluid pathways and fluid-
rock interaction that result in hydrolytic weakening, reaction softening, grain
size reduction, and concentrated deformation, which partly control overall
crustal rheology; and (3) characterization of thin-film materials providing key
data to understand the nature of impurities and defects that can be used to
refine deposition/synthesis processes and control/passivate impurities
ultimately improving the opto-electronic performance of
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the EAR
Instrumentation and Facilities Program and Division of Earth Sciences to support
projects that increase research capabilities, capacity and infrastructure at a
wide variety of institution types, as outlined in the GEO EMBRACE
DCL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
