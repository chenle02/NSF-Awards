The Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Science will continue to operate its Flow
Cytometry Facility. The overall Facility goals are to provide modern
instrumentation for quantification of marine particles and cells, to provide
space and technical expertise for visiting researchers, and support for sample
and data analysis. Funding will provide salary for a technician, maintenance
contracts, travel and expenses for the advisory committee, and a new
epifluorescence microscope. Part time support for the Facility's director is
also provided. The Marine Cytometry Facility will be closely linked to the
existing Phytoplankton Culture Collection Facility at Bigelow.
