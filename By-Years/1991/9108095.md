An International Conference on Gauge Theories - Past and Future will be held
May 16 - 18, 1991 at the University of Michigan. The conference will bring
together some of the leaders in elementary particle physics (in which gauge
theories have played a central role in the past two decades), as well as younger
physicists, and provide a forum for the discussion of both experimental and
theoretical developments in gauge theories.
