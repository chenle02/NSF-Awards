In real-time database systems, transaction processing must satisfy not only the
database consistency constraints but also timing constraints such as deadlines.
For the most part, database researchers have not dealt with timely issues while
the real-time research community has ignored the problem of guaranteeing the
consistency of shared data. This work involves the development of an integrated
approach for supporting real-time transactions. The following topics will be
investigated in depth: (1) Concurrency control protocols, (2) Recovery
techniques, (3) Deadlock resolution strategies, and (4) CPU scheduling
algorithms. In addition, we will investigate two secondary issues: I/O
scheduling and time constrained communication. While we plan to employ
simulations and analytical methods where appropriate, to a large extent, all our
protocols and algorithms are to be implemented, evaluated and compared on an
existing distributed database testbed called CARAT. This is significant because
CARAT has the ability to account for the (usually neglected, but not negligible)
overheads involved in supporting distributed transactions. This research will
have an impact on both the topics with which it overlaps, namely database
systems and real-time systems. Also, because of the ubiquitous need for the
timely processing of information in all applications that employ computers, such
as in banking, command and control, automated factories, and process control
systems, this project is expected to produce results that will positively affect
many application areas as well.
