This project will study near-field optics of nanoscale complexes of rare earth
ions with DNA-wrapped nanotubes for bio-sensing applications. A new class of
rare earth based bio-compatible materials will be explored. In these materials
DNA-wrapped nanotube, functionalized with bio-analytes for optical sensing, will
serve as a plasmonic nano-antenna. The approach is to apply a theoretical
modeling along with an optical characterization, to understand the near-field
interaction between nanotube plasmonic modes and rare-earth emitter in the
presence of surrounding bio-molecules.&lt;br/&gt; The intellectual merit is in
understanding the physics of the near-field electromagnetic modes in the rare-
earth/DNA/nanotube complexes, developing schemes for their bio-functionalization
and exploring effects of surrounding environment on their near-field response.
This will lead to developing new nano-materials and optimizing it for bio-sensor
applications on a long run.&lt;br/&gt; The broader impact will include
dissemination of accumulated fundamental knowledge to undergraduate and graduate
students at Lehigh University as well as to students from other PA Schools via
the web-based inter-university network MatPAC. Research results will be
disseminated to local industry, via the Lehigh Nanotech Network, and to other
Lehigh part¬ners from industry, national labs and academia. The K-12 outreach
program will include lectures at local schools in Lehigh Valley and
contributions to the exhibition at the National facility ? DaVinci Discovery
Center. STEM enhancement programs are planned for teachers from local Community
Colleges and Kutztown University. Research will benefit the REU and GAAN
programs of the Physics Department, with special attention paid to strong
involvement from STEM-under¬rep¬re¬sen¬ted groups.
