Theories are created in science to explain a certain set of phenomena.
Intuitively, however, we tend to increase our belief in a new theory if it not
only explains the phenomena that it was specifically created to address but then
is found to follow from something we had already accepted. Yet in Bayesian
Probability Theory, the dominant tradition concerning the confirmation of
scientific theories, old evidence does not increase the probability of new
theories. How should this so-called `old evidence/new explanation` issue be
resolved? Richard Jeffrey came up with one solution. Professor Wagner is
extending Jeffrey's principles and, in process, gives rise to two different
revision methods for generalization of this problem. The PI will investigate
both the mathematical and the philosophical aspects of this phenomenon, both
because of the intrinsic interest of generalizations of the old evidence/new
explanation problem and in order to clarify the essence of Jeffrey's solution to
the classical version of this problem.
