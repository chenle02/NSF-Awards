Irwin Kra will continue his research on Kleinian groups and their deformations,
the automorphic forms and Eichler cohomology associated with Kleinian groups,
and the accessory parameters associated with Fuchsian and Kleinian
uniformizations of Riemann surfaces. Bernard Maskit will also work on Kleinian
groups. In particular he will study constructions of special classes of Kleinian
groups, parameter spaces of deformations of Fuchsian and Kleinian groups, and
fundametal domains for the Teichmuller modular group. Many of the problems to be
considered by Kra involve the geometric significance of the spaces of cusp
forms. This is related to the problem of choosing finite spanning sets of
relative Poincare series. The calculations of fundamental domains for
Teichmuller modular groups, to be carried out by Maskit, are related to problems
in both geometry and dynamics.
