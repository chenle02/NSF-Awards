The proposed research involves the development of a novel competitive
association method for determining association constants for very weak molecular
complexes from measured solute solubility and chromatographic partition
coefficients in binary solvent mixtures. Research efforts will be focused in
five areas. First, a systematic study will be made of the solubility and
spectroscopic properties of carbazole, phenoxazine and phenothiazine dissolved
in a large number of binary solvent mixtures. Second, the competitive
association model will be extended to include ternary solvent systems in order
to assess the effect that a third inert cosolvent has on the calculated
association parameters. Third, gas-liquid chromatographic methods and partition
coefficients will be used to test the applications and limitations of the
derived competitive association model. Fourth, the basic thermodynamic mixing
model will be extended to excess volumes of ternary associated nonelectrolyte
solutions. Finally, the basic thermodynamic model will be extended to tautomeric
solute molecules.
