This work continues recent advances in atomic physics experiments designed to
find and measure violations of parity and time-reversal symmetries. A new laser
source and other improvements to the measurement of the electron dipole moment
in mercury should make an exacting test of low energy supersymmetry and other
models in which T-violation should occur naturally. An improvement of the
measurement of parity violation in thallium, as observed through optical
rotation, from a 1% to a 0.3% accuracy is sought. Finally, the first steps in a
PNC measurement in the barium plus ion are being undertaken, with the long-term
goal being a decisive atomic test of electroweak physics complementary to the
best high energy accelerator tests.
