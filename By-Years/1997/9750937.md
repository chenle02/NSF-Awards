This project is designed to enhance training in the fields of biology and
chemistry related to the areas of biotechnology. The focus of the project is to
establish an interdepartmental degree in biotechnology as a joint effort of the
biology and chemistry departments. This degree will be designed as a laboratory
intensive, research rich experience. The degree will culminate in all students
being members of a research team performing a project under the supervision of a
faculty member. Students will be encouraged to submit successful research
projects to be presented at local and regional scientific meetings. This degree
will prepare students to seek employment in research positions related to the
growing agriculture based molecular genetics and pharmaceutical industries in
this region of the country as well as providing training for students interested
in application to graduate school. The introductory courses in the core of this
new biotechnology degree will be comprised of courses currently offered as part
of both the biology and chemistry majors at Moorhead State University. The
majority of these courses have been converted to an investigative laboratory
format to enhance student involvement and enthusiasm for science. The equipment
purchased will allow additional exercises to be added to the laboratory portion
of several of these large enrollment introductory courses in order to give
students the background and experience required for upper division courses in
biotechnology. The benefit of using courses which are already part of the
biology and chemistry majors to initiate this new degree is that all students
taking courses in the two departments will be exposed to new techniques and have
the opportunity to learn more about molecular and cellular biology and
biochemistry research.
