Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will
include&lt;br/&gt;studies of: (i) the partonic structure of the nucleon within
the&lt;br/&gt;framework of perturbative quantum chromodynamics, (ii) the origin
of&lt;br/&gt;electroweak interaction symmetry breaking; and (iii) observable
signatures&lt;br/&gt;of new physics, such as supersymmetric particles and extra
dimensions. Partons&lt;br/&gt;are fundamental constituents (i.e. quarks and
gluons) of observed nuclear&lt;br/&gt;particles, such as protons and neutrons.
Electroweak interaction symmetry&lt;br/&gt;breaking is intimately related to the
origin of masses of fundamental&lt;br/&gt;particles. New physics scenarios, such
as supersymmetry and extra&lt;br/&gt;dimensions, if discovered, could extend our
understanding of the extremely&lt;br/&gt;successful Standard Model of elementary
particle physics to a much deeper&lt;br/&gt;level.
