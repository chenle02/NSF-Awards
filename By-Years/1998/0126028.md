Holzworth&lt;br/&gt;0126028&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; This project is a balloon-
borne experiment whose main goals include 1) a focused program of investigation
of high latitude ionospheric electrodynamics (the study of the properties of
electromagnetic radiation and the way in which it interacts with charged matter)
using multiple long duration balloons launched in Antarctica, and 2) the
investigation of the fast penetration of electric fields from the outer to the
inner magnetosphere in response to external inputs. The project is cooperative
with Japanese X-ray and magnetometer investigators. The bulk of the proposed
effort will be focused on investigation of outstanding problems of the polar and
auroral ionosphere such as the nature of polar cap convection under varying
solar wind conditions, dynamics of the dayside cusp, the transient and steady
state coupling of the solar wind to the magnetosphere, transient phenomena on
wholly closed magnetic fields lines such as traveling convective vortices (TCVs)
and those related to magnetic pulsations with periods greater than one second.
Another important effort will be to investigate the rapid transmission of
ionospheric and magnetospheric electric fields from higher to lower latitudes in
response to variations in the interplanetary magnetic field.&lt;br/&gt; This
project consists of the construction, integration and testing of the electric
field instruments for the geophysics payloads that are planned as part of the
2002-2003 continuation of the Polar Patrol Balloon Program managed by the
Japanese National Institute of Polar Research Three balloons will be flown from
the Japanese Antarctic Station, while one payload will be launched from McMurdo
Station.&lt;br/&gt;
