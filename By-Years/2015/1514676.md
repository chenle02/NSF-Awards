One of the more difficult problems in astrophysics is determining how old a star
is. We can measure the mass of a star and how big it is. We can find out how hot
it is and what it is made of. But to find out how old a star is, we rely on
computer models. Stellar models can be very uncertain; making models requires us
to estimate parameters that we are unable to actually measure. Asteroseismology
is the study of stars by measuring the way their surfaces pulsate. Stars like
the Sun pulsate, and the frequencies of stellar pulsation carry information
about the interior of the star. Asteroseismic data will be used to refine the
basic parameters of stellar models and thereby obtain more reliable age
estimates. These results will be important for a wide range of other
astronomical topics, including studies of extrasolar planets. This program will
provide student training in techniques of data analysis, statistics, and
computational methods that have a wide range of technical and commercial
applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Estimates of stellar ages suffer from
uncertainties, because parameters that cannot be determined from first
principles need to be chosen before models can be constructed. The most
important among the free parameters are the mixing length parameter and the
initial helium abundance. Secondary parameters include overshoot. The aim of
this investigation is to use asteroseismic data to constrain model parameters.
Asteroseismic data will be used to determine whether and how the mixing length
parameter varies as a function of stellar parameters, in particular with
metallicity. The same will be done for the the initial helium abundance. These
results will then be used to construct improved isochrones. The signature of
core-overshoot will also be studied using seismic data. A related theoretical
investigation will investigate whether the entropy-(metallicity, effective
temperature, surface gravity) relationships determined from convection
simulations match the mixing-length parameter determined with seismic data.
