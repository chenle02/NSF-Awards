In this award from the Chemistry of Life Processes Program of the Division of
Chemistry, Dr. Charles Clapp, from Bucknell University, will use chemical
synthesis and site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the binding of substrates
to the enzyme soybean lipoxygenase-1, with a focus on the role of
phenylalanine-557 (phe-557), which has been proposed to be at the binding site
for the methyl terminus of substrates. This hypothesis will be tested by
synthesizing fatty acids that are slightly longer than linoleic acid and
determining whether these new substrates show enhanced activity with site-
directed mutants in which phe-557 is replaced with smaller amino acids. It has
also been proposed that replacing phe-557 with smaller amino acids alters the
regiochemistry of the reaction by allowing substrates to bind in a reverse
manner. This hypothesis will be tested using synthetic substrates,
stereochemical studies, and additional mutagenesis.

Lipoxygenases catalyze a useful reaction, the incorporation of oxygen into
polyunsaturated fatty acids, that chemists cannot carry out in a controlled way
without enzymes. Understanding the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes provides
an opportunity to learn useful chemistry from nature. Soybean lipoxygenase-1 is
the most extensively studied lipoxygenase, but our mechanistic insight is
limited by uncertainty about how substrates bind. The proposed work is designed
to address this deficiency. Better understanding of how lipoxygenases bind
substrates could lead to the rational design of mutant lipoxygenases that would
catalyze transformations that cannot be achieved with the natural enzymes.
Undergraduate students will play a major role in this work. The proposed
experiments use basic techniques that students learn about in their courses, and
students working on this project will gain experience applying these techniques
to test hypotheses in research.
