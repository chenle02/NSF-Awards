This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2004.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Hybridization, introgression,
disease resistance and conservation of native elms." Genetic assimilation
following hybridization between red elm, Ulmus rubra, and the exotic invasive,
U. pumila, makes the long-term survival of red elm uncertain. Using molecular
markers, this research examines hybridization and introgression and the
susceptibility of U. rubra X pumila hybrids to Dutch elm disease (DED). Results
will help evaluate the threat that introgression with U. pumila represents to
native elms and be useful in developing strategies for the long-term
conservation of U. rubra.
