Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy has become a commonly used noninvasive
therapy for crushing kidney stone. The therapy, however, may lead to injury. The
proposed research is to gain new fundamental knowledge about the focusing of
shock waves and their interaction with kidney stones. Pressure transducers
(based on PVDF piezoelectric material and differential interferometry) will be
developed for characterizing the developed pressures; the transducers also have
the potential of being used as exposure meters in a clinical environment. If
successful, the research will result in new technology that will reduce the risk
associated with lithotripsy.
