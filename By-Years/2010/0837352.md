Engineering - Chemical (53)&lt;br/&gt;Current engineering education embraces
computer-based visualizations and simulations to foster student learning. There
is evidence that these technological advances, while improving student
understanding of complex theories, have simultaneously led to a decrease in
opportunities for students to explore forces, causal factors, and effects in the
real world. The result is that diminished opportunity to physically experience
produces a diminished ability to perceive among our undergraduate students. In
this project, laboratory exercises are being developed to reconnect
undergraduate chemical engineering students with the physical world. The new lab
experiences emphasize somatic opportunities that promote physical insight and
engineering judgment. These activities are designed to stimulate independent
thought and creativity while promoting use of the human senses, tactile
learning, tinkering, and data interpretation. The project's impact on student
learning is being rigorously assessed through qualitative and quantitative
measures. Project results are being broadly disseminated through presentations
at conferences and through the development of a project web site.
