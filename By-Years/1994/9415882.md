This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
biochemical genetics among several American and French researchers at the
University of Colorado and the Laboratory for Molecular Genetics, French
National Center for Scientific Research, in Strasbourg, France. The
investigators are Arthur Gutierrez-Hartmann, Andrew Bradford and Bohdan Wasylyk.
The objectives of their research are to define regions of the molecules Ets-1
protoocogene and GHF-1/Pit-1 and their role in cellular differentiation and
malignant transformation. They will perform site-directed mutagenesis
experiments in order to define regions of the two proteins that are involved in
mediating their interaction. The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration
their expertise in hormonal regulation of gene expression. This is complemented
by the French investigator's expertise in the Ets molecules and takes advantage
of French techniques in generating on site Ets mutants. The results will advance
our understanding of molecular mechanisms common to all cell types, healthy and
malignant, and cell-specific responses.
