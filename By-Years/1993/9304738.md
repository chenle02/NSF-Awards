PI will study the stratigraphy and depositional history of several
Mississippian-age formations in southern New Mexico, along an ancient carbonate
ramp to basin, during a period of paleoclimate transition of "greenhouse" to
"icehouse." Excellent exposures and biostratigraphic control will allow detailed
sequence stratigraphy, and elucidation of depositional processes and of controls
on slope and platform morphology. Interregional comparison will allow the test
of sequence stratigraphic concepts and of models for carbonate platform/slope
evolution.
