This grant supports organization of the workshop that brings together thought
leaders from industry and academia to discuss use-case scenarios for use of
robots in small and medium sized enterprises. The objective of the workshop is
(1) to present and discuss industry use-cases for robotics in manufacturing and
in particular examples where a move from fixed automation to flexible automation
is an economic enabler and (2) to have broad discussions across academia and
industry to internalize a common set of challenges and opportunities. The
workshop participants gain new insights into what advances needed to deploy
robotics in small and medium manufacturers. The workshop report provides a
roadmap of challenges and research opportunities to guide the robotics
community. The workshop stimulates future research towards development of robots
for manufacturing applications. These activities directly impact the U.S.
manufacturing.
