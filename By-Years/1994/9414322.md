Abstract ATM-9414322 Young, George S. The Pennsylvania State University Title:
Development/Testing of a Convective Wake Parameterization of Air/Sea Fluxes and
Convective Organization Using TOGA COARE IOP Results The proposal aims at
parameterizing air-sea interface fluxes in the context of convective
organization processes. Such physically correct parameterizations are meant to
be used in future GCMs and climate models. The PI will also test and validate
these parameterizations with the help of the COARE data.
