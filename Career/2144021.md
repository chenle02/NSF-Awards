This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). A large swath of modern number theory is concerned with
the study of symmetry. One way in which symmetry arises in number theory is
through Galois theory: this is the study of the symmetry of solution sets of
polynomial equations over the rational numbers. Another way in which symmetry
arises in number theory is through analysis: there are a class of special
functions, called automorphic forms that satisfy a certain set of differential
equations and possess an infinite group of discrete symmetries. The conjectural
Langlands Program relates Galois theory to automorphic forms, even though on
first appearance the two areas of mathematics have nothing to do with one
another. This project concerns the study of automorphic forms, especially those
that exhibit "exceptional" groups of symmetries. The Principal Investigator will
investigate the subtle and surprising connections that automorphic forms have to
arithmetic. He will also study L-functions of automorphic forms, which are
generalizations of the Riemann zeta function. The grant includes funding for
graduate students, who will receive training in automorphic forms. While
supported by this grant, the Principal Investigator will write a graduate
textbook on "exceptional algebraic structures", which will fill a need in the
literature. He will also help train the US workforce through mentoring of
undergraduates and early-career colleagues.

This award has three related research projects. In one project, already
underway, the Principal Investigator will develop the theory of half-integral
weight modular forms on exceptional groups. It is expected that the Fourier
coefficients of these half-integral weight modular forms will be highly
interesting arithmetic quantities. The second project involves the production of
modular forms on the exceptional group G_2 with rational Fourier coefficients
and development of arithmetic consequences of the existence of such modular
forms. This will lead to a partial database of modular forms on G_2. In a third
project, the Principal Investigator will construct new automorphic L-functions.
Techniques involved in these projects include the theta correspondence and the
Rankin-Selberg method.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
