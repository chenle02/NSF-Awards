This award will support participants in a conference to be held at Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Connecticut on April 4-5, 2020. The conference is in
the area of dynamical systems. There will be twelve main speakers, and will
include early career mathematicians, especially graduate students and post-
doctoral scholars. Several important problems originating from various fields in
mathematics and computer science can be studied in terms of dynamical systems.
The motion of a particle in space has been modeled by the action of a function
or transformation of the space. Later mathematicians considered several such
functions that were put together in group of transformations and studied what
are called group actions. The goal of the conference at Wesleyan is to bring
together a variety of researchers and students whose work connects to the study
of group actions in dynamics to discuss the latest research findings and to seek
collaborations to attack open problems in this area.

Homogeneous dynamics has proven to be a powerful tool in the study of number
theory and geometry. Although in many cases qualitative results already suffice
for applications, there are situations in which it is essential to obtain
effective, quantitative results in homogenous dynamics. It usually involves
giving estimates on the rates or error terms which concern various aspects of
group actions on spaces. The conference will discuss recent progress on
effective equi-distribution and shrinking targets in homogeneous dynamics, and
study how these results could help advance the understanding of problems in
number theory. Another main topic of the conference is the behavior of dynamical
systems modeling a ball bouncing around inside a polygon. This research subject
has found exciting connections and applications to algebraic geometry, rigidity
theory in geometry, Teichmuller theory, and other areas of mathematics. The
conference will host talks on recent works in this direction and discuss their
applications to the geometry of tiling, translation surfaces, interval exchange
transformations, and related topics. The conference will also include research
talks in probability theory and random walks on groups, geometry of nilpotent
groups, marked length spectrum, and rigidity of surfaces. It will provide a
great opportunity for graduate students to be exposed to different perspectives
of the modern theory of dynamical systems and to communicate with conference
participants. The conference website is
