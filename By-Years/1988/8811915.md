This research program implements the resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization
(REMPI), a new laser-based diagnostic method, for the ultrasensitive in situ
detection of chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons in flue gases and the detection
of radical intermediates to assist in mechanistic studies of the formation of
such effluents. A major goal of the proposed research is the implementation of
REMPI spectroscopy for the real-time continuous monitoring of selected principal
organic hazardous constituents in the flue gases of municipal and hazardous
waste incinerators. This method has been highly successful in the combustion
field in general. Its application to the elucidation of the burning of hazardous
waste will produce a major accuracy increase in the understanding and control of
incineration effluents. This aspect is critical in this sensitive, lawyer-ridden
area of US concern. ***
