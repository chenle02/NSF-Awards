This proposal will support the 2014 Space Weather Workshop to be held in
Boulder, Colorado on April 8-11, 2013. This annual workshop brings together
representatives of industry, academia and government to present papers and
discuss issues related to space weather. This is one of the few opportunities
for the broad community interested in space weather to get together. Emphasis at
the workshop is on the impacts of space weather on technology including
communications, navigation, spacecraft operations and electric power.

In addition to bringing the three communities interested in space weather
together this workshop invites both undergraduate and graduate students. This
provides the students with information on research developments and on how that
research is relevant to operations. Because the emphasis of the workshop is to
discuss the impacts of space weather on technology and identify the operational
needs for space weather forecasting it has high societal value.
