The North American Perpendicular Magnetic Recording Conference (NAPMRC) is
designed as a highly interactive focused meeting with the purpose to promote
accelerated implementation of perpendicular recording. Following the highly
successful 1st NAPMRC convened on January 1-9, 2002 in Miami, FL, the 2nd NAPMRC
will be held in Monterey, California on January 6-8,
2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will subsidize the registration fee for
students from U.S. institutions. Support from NSF will ensure that the program
is open to the widest range of interested applicants from the U.S. universities.
