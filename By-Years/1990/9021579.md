One of the fundamental problems in neuroscience is understanding the
multifaceted relationship between hormones and behavior. We know that hormone-
regulated behaviors involve the interactions between hormone-sensitive neural
structures, and the sensory and motor systems. However, it is still not clear
how the central nervous system integrates environmental stimuli impinging upon
sensory receptors with an individual's physiological milieu and then outputs
this information into appropriate behavioral responses. Dr. Edwards' research
program is aimed at providing answers to this important problem. Using a
functional neuroanatomical approach in combination with an extensive series of
behavioral tests, he will define the neural pathways through which hormonal,
chemosensory, and somatosensory information are integrated towards the
production of behavior. Dr. Edwards will concentrate on the brain regions that
are connected to the preoptic area, a nuclei important for androgen-dependent
behaviors. He will evaluate the types of behavioral changes that result from the
manipulation of these specific brain structures and their afferent and efferent
pathways. This work will lead to a coherent picture of the critical neural
circuits involved in the expression of behavior.
