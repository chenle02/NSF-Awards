The equipment obtained through this project assists students and faculty in
furthering research goals by establishing a laboratory of molecular ecology. The
faculty have devised a curriculum that both encourages and requires students to
become actively involved in research. In addition to the training of biology
majors in a broad assemblage of current molecular techniques, the project
focuses on experimental design and data analysis and emphasizes problems
relating to population biology, ecological and evolutionary genetics, and
phylogeny reconstruction. Consequently, a broad suite of course offerings is
affected, including Ecology, Evolution, Genetics, and Molecular Biology.
