9322384 Wu This award is for measuring (1) high-resolution high-, room-, and
low-temperature photoabsorption cross sections of molecular nitrogen and (2) the
temperature-dependent fluorescence cross sections for producing the N I
emissions through photodissociative excitation of molecular nitrogen and that
for producing the N II 1085 and 916 angstrom emissions through dissociative
photoionization excitation of molecular nitrogen, from their respective
thresholds to 200 angstroms. Such cross sections are required for accurate
quantitative analysis and evaluation of the nitrogen dayglow models of the
Earth, Titan and Triton. ***
