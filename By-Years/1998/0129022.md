Temperate river systems and their associated floodplains have been substantially
altered by human activity. Although the effects of dams on river hydrology and
downstream ecosystems have been studied extensively, data on how changes in
historic sedimentation regimes and geomorphology affect floodplain ecosystems is
practically nonexistent. This research will demonstrate for an entire model
river system (the Roanoke River of North Carolina) the degree of post-colonial
landscape-scale ecosystem alteration due to sediment deposition, and the future
changes likely to affect vegetation dynamics as those sediments are
redistributed and transported out of the system. We will test a series of
specific hypotheses centered on the following: (1) Anthropogenic sediment
deposition on the Roanoke River floodplain over the last 250 years has led to a
dramatic alteration of the extent and distribution of landforms within the
geomorphologic system; (2) The vegetation of the lower Roanoke floodplain has
been substantially altered as a consequence of environmental changes due to
geomorphic alterations from post-colonial sedimentation; (3) Models of sediment-
impacted riparian areas developed from geomorphologic and paleoecological data
can be used to predict future landforms and vegetation composition. To address
these hypotheses we will integrate dendrogeomorphic, palynological and modeling
techniques to (1) develop a spatially explicit model of post-colonial sediment
accumulation for the lower Roanoke River floodplain, (2) model the pre-colonial
geomorphic landscape and simulate future floodplain geomorphology, and (3)
predict vegetation distributions for those surfaces using vegetation-environment
relationships.
