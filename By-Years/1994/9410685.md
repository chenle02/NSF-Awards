ATM-9410685 Portman, David Atmospheric and Environmental Research Inc. Title:
Effects of Urban Heat Islands and A Refined Surface Database for China Utilizing
the archived primary datasets the PI will construct distinct time series of
urban and rural surface temperatures for each climatic region in China, and will
adjust the urban temperatures to remove the heat island biases. These regional
time series will constitute a refined climatological database, which the PI will
document and make available to the general climate research community through a
national data center. The PI will also compare the variations in time series of
urban and rural temperatures averaged for all of China with those in some other
time series of large-scale regional, hemispheric, and global average
temperatures. Quality assurance of the surface data from China is not readily
ascertained by use of conventional methods, such as those that reply on abundant
station history information. Results of this research will therefore provide an
important basis for further assessment of potential inhomogeneities and urban
heat island effects in surface data from China and other parts of the developing
world. This research is important because it evolves methods of producing clean
and quality research datasets for global change studies. This grant is funded
under USGCRP GEOSYSTEM DATABASE program.
