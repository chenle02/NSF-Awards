Abstract

Award: DMS-0080037 Principal Investigator: Alexander S. Freire

The Barrett Lectures at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in May 2000, "New
Directions in Differential Geometry" will present four main speakers and a
number of additional lecturers. These talks will address a broad spectrum of
recent work in the subject, including lecture series by four leading researchers
on partial differential equations and analytic methods, minimal surfaces,
symmetries and isometries in Riemannian geometry, and Lagrangian cycles in
symplectic geometry. The major component of this award will support
participation in the lecture series by graduate students and recent Ph.D.s.

The Barrett Lectures have been held annually since 1972, covering a variety of
topics and attracting a national audience. They are one of the few long standing
lecture series in mathematics in the southeastern United States. The subject of
these lectures for 2000 is differential geometry, the study of aspects of a
space that can be captured by measures of length, angle, surface area, volume,
and related notions. Riemannian geometry concentrates on issues related to
curvature, the measurable quantity that makes rigorous the notion that a flat
plane and a round sphere are distinct even at very small scales of attention.
Symplectic geometry concerns an idealization of the structure underlying the
Hamiltonian framework for mechanics, a structure that enables measurements of
areas and volumes but does not require that length and angles be measurable.
Both of these flavors of geometric information have dramatic consequences for
problems concerning efficient or optimal placement of objects such as a surface
in a three-dimensional space, consequences which are mostly expressed in the
language of partial differential equations and related ideas from mathematical
analysis.
