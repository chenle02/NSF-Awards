The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve clinical outcomes and quality-of-
life for pancreatic cancer patients. Only 10% of pancreatic cancer survive five
years after diagnosis because most cases are detected at later stages when
clinical interventions are relatively ineffective. Earlier detection improves
interventions, prevents unnecessary procedures arising from uncertain diagnosis,
and leads to health system cost savings. Roughly 5 million individuals in the US
are at higher risk, but there is no screening test available today for earlier
stages, a surveillance market estimated at $3 B. This project will develop a
diagnostic test for surveillance of people at high risk for developing
pancreatic cancer, with methods potentially applicable to other types of cancer
and other diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase II project will advance a technology using a small blood sample to
detect the functional state of multiple biological signaling pathways known to
participate in cancer inception and progression. This technology can analyze
these low abundance proteins at a low cost suitable for a widely adopted
surveillance test. A purpose-built bioinformatic system analyses and compares
the bio-signature identified by the assay across many individuals. This Phase II
project will optimize the panel of protein targets in the assay to detect high-
performing differential bio-signatures for early stages of the disease, and it
will enhance the machine-learning-based matching
methodology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
