A 3-manifold is a space where an object can move around in three distinct
perpendicular directions. The universe that we inhabit is a 3-manifold whose
global structure we do not yet understand. Thanks to powerful theorems by
Thurston, Perelman, and Mostow, we do know that the geometry of a manifold
(measurements of angles, distances, and curvature) is closely tied to its
topology (an account of the different ways in which one may head off in one
direction and eventually come back from another). However, we do not yet have a
good quantitative understanding of exactly how geometric measurements determine
topological structure and vice versa. A deeper quantitative understanding of
this relationship can eventually be used to analyze cosmological data and shed
light on the topology of the universe.



This project seeks to build and strengthen connections among the following
perspectives in low-dimensional topology: combinatorial topology, hyperbolic
geometry, quantum invariants, and group theory. This goal splits into several
sub-projects. The first sub-project is to build explicit combinatorial models
for hyperbolic 3-manifolds based on the combinatorial data of a fibration over
the circle. The second sub-project is to use quantum invariants such as the
Jones and colored Jones polynomials to gain information about the boundary
slopes of knots, fibration data, and hyperbolic volume. The third sub-project is
to use ideas from 3-dimensional triangulations to build metric models for
hyperbolic groups.
