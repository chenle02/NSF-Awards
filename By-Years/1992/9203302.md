An approach to integrating set theory with functional programming languages is
to be investigated. This includes both the design of a class of logics and their
application in a system supporting the development of mechanically verified
software. It is hoped that ideas from set theory can make constructive type
theories more practical, flexible, expressive and widely applicable.
