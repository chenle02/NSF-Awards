9401110 Fuhrman Although prokaryotes are ubiquitous and immensely important in
numerous biological processes, the diversity of naturally occurring marine
populations is poorly known. The reasons for this include a general lack of
recognizable morphological differences, difficulties in culturability required
for standard identification, and questions about proper classification. This
proposed renewal project will survey planktonic prokaryotes in diverse U.S. and
remote ocean locations, classifying them by means of 16S rRNA gene sequences.
This approach has provided a valuable and extremely broad phylogenetic framework
of classification, and is the only one at this time that can be done without
culturing the organisms. The results are in the form of readily distributed
sequence data, and interpretation within the context of a large existing
database is via phylogenetic analysis computer programs. Previous work (in our
lab and others) has successfully applied this approach to about 15 marine
samples, and major new taxa have already been discovered (e.g. 3 major groups of
archaebacteria, a few potentially phylum or class level eubacterial groups). The
novel archaebacteria dominate the deep-sea clones from the 4 deep Atlantic and
Pacific samples examined so far, and may be the most abundant group of organisms
on Earth. Results suggest that it is highly likely that other novel major taxa,
as well as additional members of better-characterized ones, are awaiting
discovery in regions not yet studied. This proposal is to extend the global
coverage of these studies to surface and deep waters of South Australia (SE
Indian Ocean), the Greenland Sea, the North Polar Ocean, the Northwestern
Pacific and Western Tropical Pacific (coral reef), the Arabian Sean (NW Indian
Ocean), the Antarctic, and Gulf of Mexico, all remote from locations that have
previously been examined by such approaches. Cost-effective remote sampling will
be done by colleagues already studying these areas for their own work. Also
proposed is repeated sampling from different seasons in California coastal
waters, to cover temporal shifts in local microbial composition. The results can
be used in tests of hypotheses in ecology, biogeography, and phylogeny, but
primarily will serve as framework for future such studies.
