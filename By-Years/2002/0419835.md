This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
improved thermocycler for high speed PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) using a
systems engineering approach, thereby improving the throughput of PCR by two
orders of magnitude.

The commercial application of this project will be to improve the performance
characteristics of a critical instrument in clinical and biological research.
