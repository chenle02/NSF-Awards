The focus of this project is understanding the mechanisms causing the equatorial
temperature and wind anomaly (ETWA) and its relationship to the structure of the
low-latitude ionosphere. This study will require a thorough understanding of the
characteristics of the low-latitude thermosphere-ionosphere system, including
the complex interaction of its dynamics, temperature, composition, ionospheric
density and electrodynamics. Resulting knowledge will lead to a definition of
the electrodynamic forcing necessary to reproduce the extreme conditions during
ETWA observations. Finally, the PI will determine if the E and F region wind and
conductivity fields simulated by the model can generate realistic electric field
signatures.
