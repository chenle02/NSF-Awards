This project involves the application of principles and techniques from
dynamical systems to the problem of approximating the eigenvalues of a matrix.
Rayleigh quotient iteration and the QR algorithm are two iterative numerical
algorithms for the approximation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The principal
investigator will study global convergence of these algorithms and quantify
their average speed and likelihood of success. He will either determine that the
present QR algorithm is optimal or produce a more efficient modification. For
many years, numerical linear algebra's favorite scheme for finding the
eigenvalues of a matrix has been the QR algorithm. Examples were known where
this scheme failed but these were thought to be rare. The principal investigator
discovered an entire pocket of matrices where a related scheme, called Rayleigh
quotient iteration, fails. He will now determine whether the QR algorithm fails
as well.
