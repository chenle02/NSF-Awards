9505544 Haskell The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a ten-month postdoctoral
research visit by Dr. Deirdre Haskell to work with Dr. Zoe Maria Chatzidakis at
the University of Paris. This research concerns topics in the model theory of
p-adic fields. Dr. Haskell wants to undertake two projects. The first concerns
the model theory of algebraically closed fields with an automorphism. The second
concerns the recent proof by A. Wilkie of the model-completeness of real closed
fields with exponentiation. Dr. Haskell would pursue analogues of their results
for formal power series over valued fields. ***
