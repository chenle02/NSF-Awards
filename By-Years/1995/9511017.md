IBN-9511017 Buckley, Kathleen M. The formation of vesicles containing product
secreted by cells of the brain, and other tissues, occurs by two mechanisms.
First, vesicles may be formed from newly produced proteins as occurs during
neural development, and second, neurons recycle vesicles following the secretion
of included products by the cells. The proteins involved in vesicle recycling
contain targeting sequences that direct their recovery by the cell. In the
proposed studies, Dr. Buckley will investigate the molecular mechanisms involved
in vesicle recycling with particular attention to the molecules involved in
targeting the recovery of the proteins by the cell. Dr. Buckley will examine the
role of a synapse-specific, vesicle associated protein called AP-3. The effect
of overexpression of this protein on vesicle recycling will be examined, and
several novel approaches will be used to identify proteins associated with AP-3
that may also participate in the reuptake of membrane into vesicles. The
proposed studies will provide fundamental information on the mechanisms cells in
the brain, and throughout the body for that matter, use to communicate with one
another. These studies have great potential for providing novel information
related to human physiology and pathophysiology.
