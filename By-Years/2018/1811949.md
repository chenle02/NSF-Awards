The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is providing
affordable and effective method to treat chronic wounds based on the use of two
natural compounds. Chronic wounds affect millions of people in US and account
for a significant fraction of overall health care costs. Nevertheless, the
regeneration of skin remains a huge challenge due to its multilayered structure
and the presence of different cell types organized within the extracellular
matrix. This complexity necessitates the use of multi-functional drugs with
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, pro-angiogenesis and pro-healing
properties. The potential advantages of the proposed treatment strategy over
conventional approaches include reduced cost, decreased side-effects, lower risk
of infection, and increased patient compliance.

This I-Corps project core technology is a chronic wound healing product composed
of two phenolic compounds isolated from a botanical source to yield an active
source of anti-inflammatory, pro-angiogenic and pro-regeneration activities.
Chronic wound healing is a complex physiological process controlled by a well-
orchestrated cascade of interdependent biochemical and cellular events. The
proposed innovation harnesses the multi-targeting ability of natural compounds
to modulate the crosstalk between inflammation, epithelialization and vascular
formation in chronic wounds. The team will potentially develop a minimum viable
product based on a proprietary formulation of phenolic natural compounds to
accelerate fibroblast and keratinocytes migration, enhance blood vessel
formation, and modulate macrophage response. The scope of this project is not
necessarily confined to the field of wound repair. Unraveling the cellular and
molecular modes of action that regulate immunomodulatory signaling cascades is
an important step in drug discovery with a wide array of potential applications.
