The African continent is slowly breaking up along the East African Rift. While
the landforms that define this rift are clear, the actual mechanisms of rifting
and the role of magmatism in this have been unclear. Recently, a series of low
frequency earthquakes (tremor), active volcanism, and ground deformation, show
that magma is intruding into one portion of the East African Rift. This allows
for an unusual opportunity to study the processes that lead to continental
breakup. This proposal is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, to augment
existing seismic and GPS arrays to collect data that will give insight into the
nature of rifting and the role of magmatism in the process. Broader impacts
include international collaboration and training of local students in Tanzania,
training of graduate students, and hazard mitigation in a developing country.
