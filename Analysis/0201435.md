ABSTRACT

Conformal mapping and Loewner evolutions

Marshall and Rohde will investigate conformal mappings generated by the Loewner
differential equation, and related topics. The Loewner differential equation
describes the flow associated with the conformal mappings onto a continuously
decreasing sequence of simply connected planar domains. It relates a sequence of
domains to a real-valued function, the driving term of the equation. Schramm's
recent discovery of the stochastic Loewner evolution SLE, the Loewner equation
driven by one-dimensional Brownian motion, has opened up a new area of
investigations involving conformal mappings, probability theory and mathematical
physics. The Loewner equation is also related to an algorithm for numerical
conformal mapping.

Conformal mappings have applications in many areas, both within and outside of
mathematics, such as control theory, heat conduction, fluid dynamics, and
complex dynamics. They are often used to change coordinates from one region to a
simpler region like a disc. Regions with smooth boundaries are well understood.
However, the appearance of fractals in many branches of science led to the
natural problem of investigating regions bounded by highly nonsmooth, fractal
curves, from the conformal mapping point of view. In recent years, fractal
curves generated by random processes arising, for instance, in statistical
physics, have received enormous attention. The core of Marshall's and Rohde's
research is to better understand random fractal curves by means of conformal
mappings, and conversely to study some problems about conformal mappings by
analyzing domains bounded by fractal curves.
