The long term goal of this project is to understand the nucleotide-protein
interactions that are essential for activity of 2 enzymes: the dsRNA-dependent
2-5A synthetase and the 2-5A- dependent RNase L. These enzymes play an
intriguing role in the antiviral and antiproliferative defense mechanisms of
mammalian cells. Phosphorothioate-substituted ATP and 2-5A molecules have
provided beochemical probes of these two key enzymes and have permitted the
separation of the binding and activation processes required for enzyme
catalysis. Photoaffinity labeling technology is being used to examine the
nucleotide-protein interactions occurring during binding and activation of 2-5A
synthetase and RNase L. This project investigates 2 enzymes which regulate
levels of oligonucleotides in cells and play a role in the cell's defense
mechanisms. In addition to the role of the 2-5A synthetase/RNase L system in
defense against virus infection, it has been suggested that the system may also
be involved in the control of cell growth, proliferation and differentiation.
Fundamental questions remain and are being addressed.
