The development of molecular biology techniques - including the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) - has increased dramatically the rate at which new proteins are
identified, characterized, sequenced, and expressed in milligram amounts.
However, further progress in many of the systems created by these new
technologies is being hampered by the lack of 3-D structural information.
Multidimensional NMR methods have helped to release this bottleneck, but for
many systems, especially those involving proteins of 18KD or larger, x-ray
diffraction analysis is still the best technique available for atomic structure
determination. Our Department is in the process of expanding and the addition of
new faculty is placing excessive demand on our x-ray data collection equipment.
We must therefor expand our data collection capabilities in order to provide
adequate access to all members of our department. In this application we propose
to purchase a new data collection system consisting of a rotating anode, an
image plate system and a cooling device. This system, in addition to effectively
doubling our present data collection throughput, will allow us to collect better
high resolution data and to improve the accuracy of anomalous dispersion
measurements.
