9622106 Boyd This research focuses on models and solution methodologies for
minimizing fuel consumption in compressor-driven flow networks. Recent advances
in the fields of discrete optimization and large-scale integer programming will
be employed, and solution algorithms will be developed on parallel computing
platforms. The domain of feasible solutions prescribed by the models is
mathematically complicated by virtue of the existence of both nonlinearities and
discontinuities. Classical techniques are wholly inadequate for many of the
large and growing pipeline networks in operation today. Necessary mathematical
results will be developed for obtaining optimization algorithms, first, for the
steady-state case, and then, for the transient case. Intelligent search
procedures will be developed and mixed-integer linear programming models will be
developed for the steady-state case. Based on the experience gained in the
steady-state analysis, an algorithm for solving the transient case will be
developed. Results of this research can be used to operate existing networks
efficiently, to evaluate tradeoffs between safety and throughput, and to design
safe and energy-efficient new networks. The direct impact of the research will
be applicable methods for reducing operating costs and pollutants generated by
the thousands of gas pipeline networks in operation throughout the world. A
better understanding of a little-studied class of network flow problems with
broad applicability in a variety of industries will also result.
