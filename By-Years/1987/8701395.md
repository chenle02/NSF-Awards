Operator theory is a major discipline in Modern Analysis. Its origins lie in
the study of mathematical physics and partial differential equations in the
early twentieth century. Subsequently, the subject of operator theory has grown
to a central position in such investigations, and in core mathematics as well.
Indeed, since many explicit operators arise in complex function theory,
differential geometry, and approximation theory, there is a broad range of
applicability. In particular, the connection between operator theory and complex
function theory has long been actively pursued from various points of view. The
recent brilliant innovations by deBranges that led to the solution of the
Bieberbach conjecture have further developed the deep interdependence of these
disciplines. Professors Rosenblum and Rovnyak form a research team that has had
an excellent record of research on this interface, and their earlier work was in
a distant way a precursor of deBranges' ideas. Both singly and together, their
successes include seminal results in perturbation theory of unitary
transformations, spectral theory of the Hilbert matrix, factorization and
interpolation theory for bounded analytic functions, a generalization of the
corona theorem, and extensions of the basic inequality in deBranges' work (loc
cit). The current proposal seeks to extend the estimation theory of Riemann
mapping functions that produced the proof of the Bieberbach conjecture. Known
extensions treat powers greater than -3/2, and it is proposed to explore
nonpositive integral powers. Other extensions involve interpolation theory, and
have applications in operator theory. Professors Rosenblum and Rovnyk will also
study interpolation theory for Newton spaces, which are finite difference
analogs of Hardy spaces. Emphasis will be placed on the special functions
related to Newton spaces, and to logarithmic versions of these spaces. The
project also includes operator equations associated with analytic functions of
bounded mean oscillation and with the corona theorem.
