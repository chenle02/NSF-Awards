This investigation will focus on two aspects of the regulation of genes for
bioluminescence (lux) from Vibrio harveyi: 1) the density-dependent control of
transcription; and 2) the mechanism which generates luminous variants. The
regulatory genes controlling expression of luminescence are not linked to the
operon encoding enzymes for light production and have not been cloned. However,
using transposon mutagenesis of the native organism, we have identified the
"lost locus" encoding regulatory function(s). This unlinked second region, now
marked by transposon insertion, will be cloned and the genetic circuitry
analyzed: the specific lux genes and transcriptional units will be identified
and sequenced; the Lux functions will be inferred from analysis of mutant
phenotypes; and transcriptional control of genes in this region will be examined
by using gene fusions. Regulation is known to involve a pheromone-like substance
called autoinducer, and genetic analysis should yield insight into mechanisms
bacteria use to perceive and react to their environment. Luminous variants of V.
harveyi arise spontaneously at high frequencies and can change back to the
original or new luminous forms. Indication that changes in genome organization
correlate with luminescence variation has been obtained by using a hybridization
probe representing part of the second locus mentioned above in Southern blot
analysis of DNA from luminous variants. We will proceed to clone the entire
region of DNA involved in variation and define precisely the changes in DNA
structure which affect the intensity of light emission. Luminous variation could
be one manifestation of a general process for creating the diversity of
phenotypes needed for survival in the varied and changing circumstances
encountered in the ocean, and studying this phenomenon could enrich our
understanding of how genome plasticity generates diversity.
