Synapses have traditionally been thought to be fixed structural elements but
work during the past decade has revealed the dynamic nature of synaptic endings
in the brain. This project is to study a unique synapse residing in the
mammalian retina, the ribbon synapse. This synapse resides in the
photoreceptors, which transduce light energy into neural signals. The
photoreceptor ribbon has an exceptionally large active zone and one of the
highest rates of vesicular transmission of any synapse in the nervous system. It
was first described over 50 years ago as a fixed structural member of the
photoreceptor presynaptic terminal. The precise function of the ribbon remains
unclear. A monoclonal antibody that recognizes synaptic ribbons in the retina
(B16) has been developed in the PIs laboratory and used to isolate a family of
retinal specific proteins. The function of these proteins in vesicular
trafficking and signal transduction pathways at the photoreceptor ribbon synapse
will be studied, the identity of the B16's epitope on the synaptic ribbon will
be determined and determination of the amino acid sequence of the proteins
composing the synaptic ribbon will be attempted. It is also proposed to study
the circadian control of the morphological dynamics observed in the synaptic
ribbon. &lt;br/&gt;NSF funding will continue to support a rich educational
environment promoting hands-on research experience for high school students from
the New England area, undergraduate and graduate students at Boston College, and
undergraduates from other east coast universities has been established.
