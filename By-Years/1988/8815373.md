This award supports cooperative research on the variability of cosmic radio
noise absorption in the southern polar region to be carried out by Prof. T.J.
Rosenberg of the University of Maryland and Prof. Alberto J. Foppiano of the
University of Concepcion in Chile. It appears that recent statistical results on
the diurnal and seasonable variability absorption by the aurora in the southern
hemisphere that radiowave propagation models need modification. Such models have
been developed by Prof. Foppiano and this work will be directed toward refining
and extending these models to a wider range of locations and conditions. The
extensive data base on the radio noise absorption in the southern hemisphere
compiled by the University of Maryland will be used during Prof. Foppiano's
visit to the U.S. Further collaborative work including possibly establishing a
joint experimental program at U.S. and Chilean Antarctic stations will be
explored. By providing partial support for the Chilean scientist, this project
fulfills the goals of the SDC Program.
