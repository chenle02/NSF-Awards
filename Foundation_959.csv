The special semester and its tutorials and workshops will promote research in theoretical computer science and logic, areas with important applications for computer science. All three workshops include introductory tutorial lectures. The US graduate students will benefit from participation in the tutorial courses and workshops, and have a valuable opportunity to interact with and learn from an international community of researchers in complexity, and to promote their research and education training.<br/><br/>Proof complexity has important connections to computational complexity, and to the highly successful computer-based theorem proving systems. Proof complexity has made substantial advances in the understanding the complexity of resolution theorem proving, and better understanding of algebraic proof systems. Low-depth complexity studies the complexity of functions that can be computed with low-depth Boolean and arithmetic circuits. Low-depth complexity is intimately connected with research into communication complexity, proof complexity, algorithms for NP-hard problems, learning and cryptography. Property testing and communication complexity deal with understanding what can be feasibly computed or approximated when given only part of the input, or when the input is shared among multiple parties. All these areas are of fundamental importance for a better understanding of algorithms and proof search.<br/><br/>Main web page: http://en.chebyshev.spb.ru/complexity2016/<br/><br/>Workshop web pages:<br/>http://math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/SPB_Workshops/AlgCPTC_1.html<br/>http://math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/SPB_Workshops/ProofComp_1.html<br/>http://math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/SPB_Workshops/LowDepth_1.html"

The tools for testing whether a mathematical structures is suitable for classification are various hypotheses called ""dividing lines"", which forbid some fixed pattern in the behavior of a structure. A main focus of this project is one such dividing line called VC-dimension, which originated in machine learning, and uses ideas from graph theory to measure randomness in mathematical objects. In model theory, this notion emerged in the study of so-called ""NIP theories"". Conant will apply this model theoretic framework to questions in group theory, from both the discrete and topological perspectives, and also in the newer field of arithmetic combinatorics, which is a fusion of algebra, analysis, and discrete math. <br/><br/>A large part of past research in model theory has focused on structures which exhibit tameness at the global level, in the sense that every definable relation in the structure omits a combinatorial configuration of some fixed type. This research focuses on the local level, in which one analyzes a single tame relation inside an otherwise complicated structure. A major aim is to develop an algebraic theory of NIP formulas in arbitrary groups, which continues prior research of Conant and Pillay in the case of pseudofinite groups. A second aim is to extend this work on pseudofinite groups outside of the NIP environment. This setting is suitable for applications to arithmetic combinatorics in finite groups, for example previous research of Conant, Pillay, and Terry on tame arithmetic regularity. In the proposed research, Conant will use Lie theory and representation theory to develop arithmetic regularity in the pseudofinite setting without extra tameness assumptions. The goal is to give a model theoretic account of arithmetic regularity results of Green and Tao, and extend these results to non-commutative groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first is related to algebra and  number theory, and the second is in machine learning. Model theory is a part of mathematical logic which has seen extensive applications in other areas of mathematics and computer science in the last several decades. The project aims to resolve several long-standing problems related to number theory and algebraic differential equations. Number theory and differential equations are central areas of mathematics with applications throughout the sciences, and this project aims to resolve fundamental questions in these areas. Connections between model theory and machine learning have emerged in the last several years, and this project seeks to build on those connections to bring new techniques to both disciplines. In the past several years open problems in both model theory and machine learning have been resolved using techniques from the other, a process this project will continue. Machine learning has emerged as one of the most influential technologies of the last decade and is in the process of rapid growth, and this project aims to attack foundational problems in machine learning using techniques from mathematical logic. The education component of the project involves training of graduate students and undergraduate students through research and outreach to high school students.<br/><br/>The first main area of this project centers around nonlinear ordinary differential equations which arise in a number of classical contexts. The project will study the differential equations satisfied by automorphic functions and apply the results to prove new transcendence results as well as obtaining diophantine applications around unlikely intersections. Here, the techniques include analysis, differential Galois theory, and geometric stability theory. Painleve equations will be studied, where the central goal is a classification of the algebraic relations between solutions. The second main area of this project is machine learning. In this area, model theoretic tools will be brought to bear to solve foundational open problems in learning theory. For instance, combinatorial characterizations of private versions of learnability in various settings will be pursued. Learnability in automata and other specific mathematical structures will also be pursued.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Martin-Lof type theory extends the lambda- calculus by admitting dependent types and terms, and is at least as strong as second-order logic. It is also used as the basis of several high-level programming languages because of its combination of expressive strength and desirable proof-theoretic properties. The system is interpreted into axiomatic homotopy theory using the framework of Quillen model categories and relying on related algebraic methods involving (weak) higher-dimensional groupoids.  This permits logical methods to be combined with algebraic and topological ones, admitting theoretical and computational applications of type theory in homotopy and higher-dimensional algebra.<br/><br/>This research pursues a surprising connection between Geometry, Algebra, and Logic which was discovered by the PI and is now under active investigation by several researchers worldwide. In addition to its importance in foundations of mathematics, it has strong potential for direct applications in computer science.  Logical systems of the kind investigated are used extensively in programming language design and implementation.  The new geometric and algebraic interpretations are of use both in securing the correctness of applied systems and as a theoretical model of the computational paradigms implemented by such systems.  Conversely, computational applications in geometry and algebra are made likely by the well-developed computational implementations of the logical system.  The broader impact of the research is both in applications in science and technology and in graduate education.  A doctoral student in Carnegie Mellon's Pure and Applied Logic program is partially supported under this research project.  The student is being trained in the relevant areas of logic, topology, and algebra, and conducts joint research with the PI, eventually leading to the degree of PhD."

They often appear as the set of symmetries of a geometric object, for example, of 3-dimensional space, a molecule or a crystal. Oftentimes, the set of symmetries themselves, i.e., the group, has a natural topological structure. That is, one can speak of one symmetry being close to another, as in the case of two rotations of 3-dimensional space being close if they differ by a small angle. These latter groups are called topological transformation groups and are trivially related to geometry via the geometric object of which they are the set of symmetries. However, other topological groups are not so easily viewed as coming from geometry. This is, for example, the case for the systems of solutions to many differential equations which form a group under addition called a Banach space. However, one of the principal ideas of the present project is that all topological groups have natural intrinsic geometric structure which is defined jointly by their topological and algebraic structure. Moreover, this geometric structure can in many cases provide significant insight into the structure of the group by blotting out finer details that obscure the global or large scale properties of the group.<br/><br/>The primary aim of this project is to investigate the coarse geometry of topological and, in particular, Polish groups. In earlier research, the PI has established and investigated a natural coarse structure that every topological group is equipped with and which coincides with that traditionally studied on finitely generated or locally compact groups, Banach spaces or even homeomorphism groups of compact manifolds. Particularly interesting subclasses to be studied are the Polish groups of bounded geometry for which the geometric structure theory is well-advanced. Several interesting questions on the extent of this class of groups remain open, for example, whether every Polish group of bounded geometry is coarsely equivalent to a locally compact group. The research program is by nature interdisciplinary. While its origins lie in descriptive set theory, the main examples of groups to be studied arise in various disciplines of mathematics, including functional analysis, logic, and geometric and differential topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its philosophical beginning had to do with the foundations of mathematics, which at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century was not standing on firm grounds. Set theorists of the time devised an axiomatic system known as Zermelo-Fraenkel with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), that removed all paradoxes of the time, and put all of mathematics on firmer grounds. On the other hand, Cantor, working on questions coming from the study of Fourier sequences, needed to device longer inductions then the set of natural numbers allowed him to do. His work led him to what is now known as cardinal numbers, ordinal numbers and above all the study of the real numbers. His work led to what is called The Continuum Hypothesis, which was the first open problem on Hilbert's infamous list of problems. Godel and Cohen  eventually showed that The Continuum Hypothesis is undecidable, i.e. neither provable nor disprovable, from, ZFC, thus exposing a major weakness in the axiomatic system ZFC. It does not decide simple questions about sets of reals, one of the most basic mathematical objects. Descriptive Inner Model Theory is one part of what is now called Godel's Program, which is the program of removing undecidability from mathematics by studying stronger and stronger natural axiomatic systems extending ZFC that decide more and more natural questions about sets of reals and other mathematical objects. Godel himself suggested that the Large Cardinal Hierarchy should be used for the aforementioned purpose. The goal of descriptive inner model theory is to build canonical models for large cardinals and also study their impact on the set of real numbers. For example, one of the greatest achievements of the subject due to many authors is that given large cardinals, projective sets of reals behave exactly as Borel sets of reals as far as their regularity properties are concerned (i.e. measurability, category and etc). In addition the project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The PI is proposing to attack some of the central open problems of the area such as the HOD Problem or the Iterability Problem. The HOD Problem essentially says that in models where sets of reals posses all regularity properties one may desire, the universe consisting of sets that are hereditarily definable from ordinals is a canonical inner model for large cardinals. It connects the desirable regularity properties of sets of reals with the existence of large cardinals in a fundamental way showing that the regularity properties of definable sets of reals are a consequence of large cardinals and vice versa. The HOD Problem was isolated in late 90s and early 2000s as one of the most central open problems of the area. Iterability Problem is of similar nature but avoids determinacy models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it turns out that there are natural and important mathematical theories which cannot be decided by ZFC alone. The Large Cardinal Axioms (LCAs) are extensions of ZFC designed to settle all such theories. This is Gödel's program in Set Theory. If an LCA is ""correct,"" then the theories it decides are also correct. How can one test for correctness of an LCA? The Inner Model Program, a major program in modern Set Theory, justifies correctness by constructing canonical models for LCAs much like the natural numbers are the canonical model for the Peano Axioms of Arithmetic (PA) (and as such PA is a correct theory). This project contributes to the Inner Model Program by advancing methods for constructing canonical models for LCAs from various extensions of ZFC. The educational component includes annual conferences, curriculum development, and outreach and broadening participation activities. <br/><br/>The project fits into the general framework of studying the connections between inner models, sets of reals, hybrid structures (such as hereditarily ordinal definable sets (HOD) of determinacy models), forcing, and strong combinatorial principles (such as the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA)). The problem of building a canonical inner model for an LCA is referred to as the Inner Model Problem for that LCA. One of the project's main goals is to identify certain obstructions that may prevent the current approaches to resolving the Inner Model Problem for various LCAs from going further as well as proposing ways of overcoming them. Specifically, the project will study obstacles to the current techniques of the Core Model Induction (one such obstacle is the Sealing of the Universally Baire Sets) and develop new approaches to the Core Model Induction that overcome these obstacles. One main application of the above analyses is in constructing canonical inner models of large cardinals from various strong extensions of ZFC, like the Proper Forcing Axiom.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It maintains a tradition of an inclusive attitude towards developing new application areas.  This conference will bring together researchers across subfields of Topology, and across generations, to share the latest developments in Topology and related fields.  The organizing committee will ensure the representation of graduate students, young researchers, women, and researchers from underrepresented groups.  All sessions will host a mix of talks by established specialists, graduate students, and early career mathematicians.  Talks will be centered on recent advances and techniques that impact the future of the discipline.  In keeping with tradition, conference proceedings will be published by the peer-reviewed journal Topology Proceedings.  Additionally we plan to video and live stream the invited talks. This way, the latest developments in Topology will be broadly shared.<br/> <br/>This year the conference will focus on five research themes in the topology plus model: topology + algebra and analysis, topology + asymmetric structures, topology + dynamics and continuum theory, topology + foundations, and topology + geometry.  There will be a workshop on monotone covering properties, and one on entropy in topological groups.  These fields were chosen to be representative of the broad range of research being actively pursued today.  The conference structure will promote  interaction between these diverse fields by having one plenary talk in each field, providing workshops where interested parties can learn about new fields, and by providing dedicated collaboration space and social space where researchers can discuss problems informally.  The conference will invite one plenary speaker from each of these fields along with the Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award winner.  For more information see https://go.udayton.edu/sumtopo2017."

While abstract set theory is replete with counterintuitive pathologies (such as splitting a ball into five pieces and reassembling them into two copies of the original ball), many of these are circumvented by imposing constraints on the definition of the sets involved.  Moreover, the search for definable solutions to some question is often tied closely with the study of algorithms in computer science.  In this fashion, algorithms for analyzing configurations in large finite networks often correspond to descriptive set-theoretically simple solutions to infinite problems, and there are notable examples of the infinite analysis shedding light on the finite counterparts as well.  Drawing out further connections between these finite and infinite settings is a major focus of the project, which is accessible to student researchers as well as more advanced mathematicians. The project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>More specifically, the project applies descriptive set-theoretic methods to examine the structure of definable graphs.  Such graphs often arise in topological dynamics and ergodic theory, and in particular their combinatorial properties are often intertwined with algebraic aspects of the acting group. Specific combinatorial problems under investigation include: determining definable chromatic numbers of graphs, identifying when matchings and circulations can be found, and characterizing when such graph admit useful acyclic subgraphs. The project also explores applications of these ideas towards finding tilings of group actions and understanding the equidecomposability relation arising from such actions.  These topics are all closely tied with the local model of distributed computing in theoretical computer science and also have interactions with finite combinatorics, graph limits, probability, and geometric group theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will use the tools of mathematical logic (and computability theory in particular) to study the way that information can be coded into mathematical structures of the types that arise in all areas of mathematics. The general paradigm is that information is encoded into a mathematical structure if it can always be recovered in an intrinsic way from the structure, without artifacts from the way that the structure is presented. For the simplest kinds of information, like a string of 0's and 1's, the situation is well-understood. But for more complex kinds of information, the situation is much less well-understood and there are many interesting phenomena to explore. Understanding the coding of information will help us understand both the nature of information and the ability of structures of various kinds to code information. This, in turn, informs and guides the mathematical practice of other mathematicians. This project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students and outreach to high schools.<br/><br/>More formally, we say that a piece of information A is coded in a structure B if from every copy of the structure, we can recover in a computable way a copy of the information A. For example if B is a countably infinite group then a copy of B is a Cayley table for the group, noting that for an infinite group there are many different Cayley tables obtained by listing the elements of the group in different orders. By a piece of information we mean, in order of increasing complexity, a binary string (or subset of the natural numbers), an infinite family of binary strings, an infinite tree, or some other structure. For the first case of a binary string, there is a good structural characterisation of when a structure codes a binary string; one can interpret this as saying that there is always a good reason for a binary string to be coded by a structure. This is not the case for any more of the more complicated types of information; it seems that there are structures which happen to code information, but there is no good structural reason as to why. This project aims to explore these phenomena and push them to their limit with one aim being to give new tools to attack difficult open problems on degree spectra which have been resistant to current techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In mathematics, as we all know, some objects, constructions, or proofs are more complicated than others. Logicians have developed various ways of measuring this complexity. When one is interested in countable objects, which are central to a wide range of mathematics, the tools to measure these complexities come from computability theory. The objective of this project is to draw connections between complexity issues and structural issues to improve understanding of what forms complexity can take. The investigator will also continue work on a book series that aims to make it easier for the logic community to learn about the subject of computable structure theory, to help graduate students reach a research-level understanding of the subject, and to provide researchers with a modern reference.<br/><br/>The main component of this project is the study of the structure that emerges when considering computability theoretic properties on a cone, that is, properties that hold relative to almost every oracle with respect to Martin's measure. The project will study generalizations of the uniform Martin's conjecture and the almost-everywhere structure of Turing equivalence. The study of on-a-cone properties led to structural characterizations for a variety of notions from computable structure theory over the last decade. This project investigates the one-a-cone structure of the Turing degrees, of Turing equivalence, and of other recursion theoretic objects. The research will pursue two lines of inquiry. On the one hand, recent work suggests Martin's conjecture is just the tip of the iceberg, and that there are other situations where one can get a nice structural classification of relativizable objects. This research will search further for such structural classifications for equivalence relations other than Turing equivalence. On the other hand, conjectures about properties of the Turing equivalence and its interactions with its sub-equivalence relations may provide information on where Turing equivalence is located in the landscape of Borel equivalence relations, and the project will investigate this possibility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most fruitful developments in this field has been the study of the algorithmic content of mathematics. At the same time, concerns about the foundations of mathematics have led to the analysis of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning, and the study of the relative power of such systems. The computability-theoretic approach has turned out to play a key role in this project. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics whose methods and results underlie a great deal of mathematical reasoning, so the study of its algorithmic content and of the systems required to formalize its methods is particularly important. Computable combinatorics has a long history, but has seen a recent surge of interest highlighting the fact that computability-theoretically natural notions tend to be combinatorially natural, and vice-versa. This project aims to strengthen the connections between computability theory and combinatorics by increasing our understanding of the algorithmic content of combinatorial principles, through a concerted group effort to use what we have learned in recent years to systematize the area further, work toward solving a number of its outstanding questions, and explore its outward-facing aspects.<br/><br/>This project will address major open problems such as determining whether Hindman's Theorem holds arithmetically, and whether it is equivalent to its restriction to sums of length at most two; determining the first-order part of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs, and clarifying the computability-theoretic relationship between this principle and its stable version; and determining the exact proof-theoretic strength of Laver's Theorem. More importantly, it will focus on the development of lines of research particularly relevant to the growing interest in connections between computability theory and combinatorics, including the study of questions of methodological interest to combinatorialists, for instance ones involving Hindman's Theorem and the use of ultrafilters in combinatorics; the development of new proofs of combinatorial theorems inspired by questions regarding the computational content of these theorems, along the lines of Montalban's new proof of Laver's Theorem; the analysis and comparison of different general methods, such as the use of ultrafilters, topological dynamics, and probabilistic methods; the development of notions of comparison between theorems that, while still computability-theoretic in spirit, are closer to being direct reflections of combinatorial differences; the understanding of splittings of combinatorial principles into computationally and combinatorially simpler parts; the study of the usefulness of combinatorially-defined objects as computational oracles; and the study of the first-order consequences of the existence of combinatorially-defined second-order objects. This project is thus aimed at developing the study of the connections between computability theory and combinatorics along a large number of related directions, making use of the computability-theoretic, proof-theoretic, and combinatorial expertise of its PIs, senior personnel, and key collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because the notion of a set is among the most primitive in mathematics, it was used as the basic fabric with which to build the more complicated objects of mathematics. Since that time, it has been realized that the properties of infinite sets are themselves quite subtle and defy a complete axiomatization. Moreover, these set-theoretic complexities sometimes manifest themselves in more complex mathematical structures, such as those studied in algebra, analysis, and geometry. The aim of this project is to further develop both our understanding of set-theoretic methods and also how they can be applied to problems arising in fields of mathematics such as algebra, analysis, and topology. While the project involves several lines of investigation, a central theme will be to develop a deeper understanding of the structure of the algebra of all piece-wise linear functions from the unit interval to itself using the lens of transfinite ordinal numbers.<br/><br/>The first part of the research project involves attempting to prove the following conjecture of Matthew Brin and Mark Sapir: if G is a group of piece-wise linear homeomorphims of the unit interval, then either G is elementary amenable or else G contains an isomorphic copy of Richard Thompson's group F. It is the PI's thesis that not only is this conjecture true, but that it will be a consequence of a much finer analysis of subgroup structure of PLoI, the group of piece-wise linear homeomophisms of the unit interval. This analysis is expected to have a number of other consequences: that the finitely generated subgroups of F are well quasi-ordered by embeddability; that any finitely presented subgroup of PLoI is either abelian or contains a copy of F; that Peano Arithmetic does not prove that F is amenable. Central to the analysis will be the countable transfinite ordinals.

Logic<br/>is used in expert systems which, for example, help doctors diagnose<br/>illness with the aid of computers. Current research on hybrid<br/>algorithms is using logic in the development of software which will<br/>map out the flight plan of an airplane in real time. While the program<br/>is based in the mathematics department, other departments, including<br/>philosophy and computer science, will also participate.

Digitization methods for voice and picture transmission take advantage of the regularity and repetition in typical voice signals or digitized images, using much less space or time to record the sound or image data than might seem necessary.<br/>From the point of view of Kolmogorov complexity, a genuinely random binary string is probably its own shortest description, or nearly so.<br/>Some of the problems studied by this research group seek to establish properties of subsets of strings that have the same complexity, such as their dimension.

Set theory provides the popular way to lay the foundations for             all of mathematics, the best known systematic attempt to do this                being Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, dating from                the early days of the 20th Century.  Important foundational                     questions concern the independence and the consistency of the                   axioms used to establish set theory.  Zermelo and Fraenkel's axioms             (ZF for short) are one of the most convenient sets of basic axioms.             However, it has been known since the work of Kurt Goedel in the                 1930's that no axioms for set theory can be complete as well as                 consistent.  This means that no set of axioms can be powerful                   enough to prove every possible proposition or else its negation,                but not both.  Upon this startling theorem has been erected a rich              theory, treating possible propositions P such that either P or Not              P can be added to ZF without resulting in a contradiction.  Any                 such proposition P is said to be independent of ZF and can be taken             as an additional axiom of set theory.  The principal technique for              finding such independent propositions is Paul J. Cohen's so-called              method of forcing and its offspring.  This is the circle of ideas               involved in and motivating a large part of the investigator's                   research."

In addition to applying set-theoretic ideas to this branch of algebra, he is looking for new set-theoretic concepts and results motivated by algebraic problems.  He is exploring the connection between universal algebra (in Lawvere's category-theoretic formulation), the theory of classifying topoi, and the theory of unification (which plays a prominent role in some areas of computer science).  The connection is already understood in the case of absolutely free algebras, but further exploration is needed in the more general case of algebras subject to nontrivial identities.  Unification in the presence of identities is in general a troublesome topic, and it is hoped that the connection with other, better understood areas can clarify it.  The proposer is also studying a topos-theoretic approach to extending the notion of Borel functions to higher types.  Such an extension is useful for the theory of cardinal characteristics of the continuum.<br/>Borel functions at the base type (real numbers) already play a major role in this theory, but so does an operation of sequential composition that necessarily leads to higher types.  The proposer is also studying several questions at the border between constructive logic, category theory, and game semantics.  This research includes an attempt to amplify the connection between games and free (or co-free) bicomplete categories, axiomatization of game-semantical validity, and a game-theoretic principle that may be fruitfully added to intuitionistic logic.  Finally, the proposer is studying several questions in set theory, most of which are connected with ultrafilters and in particular with the equivalence relation of near coherence on ultrafilters.  There are also some questions in infinite combinatorics growing out of considerations in abelian group theory.<br/>  The project builds on the proposer's past experience in several areas of mathematics --- set theory, category theory (especially topos theory), abelian group theory, game semantics, constructive mathematics, and computer science --- in order to address problems bridging these areas.  Almost all of the topics in the proposal connect two or more of these areas.  In each case, it is reasonable to expect that ideas and styles of reasoning from one area can benefit other areas.  Among the potential outcomes of this research are: (1) a better understanding of unification, which is an essential ingredient of logic programming, (2) a clearer view of constructive mathematical reasoning as based on strategies in certain sorts of debates, and (3) applications of a context that resembles traditional set theory in many ways yet avoids the phenomena sometimes regarded as pathological.<br/>"

Algebra is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, whereas model theory is a branch of mathematical logic, a fairly new subject that originated in the late 19th century with philosophical investigations into the foundations of mathematics. However, in recent decades logic has found many applications in other parts of mathematics, in computer science, and even in engineering. For about fifteen years, the PI has been involved in a collaborative effort to develop a model-theoretic treatment of asymptotic analysis. These investigations are naturally related to other fields within mathematics (mainly logic and analysis) but may also lead to novel applications of differential equations in science and engineering. They recently led to some decisive positive results, and many questions which seemed out of reach previously may now be answerable.<br/><br/>More concretely, the goal of this project is to unify three seemingly very different approaches to enrich the real continuum by infinitesimal and infinite quantities: surreal numbers, germs of real-valued functions, and transseries. Surreal numbers have a combinatorial flavor and encompass Cantor's ordinal numbers; they were introduced by J. H. Conway in the 1970s in connection with game theory. Germs of real-valued functions are central objects in analysis; they were first systematically studied by P. du Bois-Reymond in the 1870s. Transseries are formal objects that model the growth rates of such germs at infinity; they arose in both analysis and logic during the 1980s. Their formal nature also makes transseries suitable for machine computations in computer algebra systems. The goal of this proposal is to deepen our understanding of these structures, and to establish links between them. For example, we would like to know: Are there analytic structures (Hardy fields) with the same logical features as transseries? Is there a natural isomorphism between surreals and transseries? Answers to questions such as these may now be within grasp due to fundamental advances in our understanding of the ideas of number, series, and function within the last decade, and would exhibit heretofore unknown relationships between them."

First, in collaboration with Hart and Hrushovski, the investigator is seeking to  determine the `fine structure' of models of classifiable theories. This amounts to determining the amount of flexibility one has in choosing a decomposition tree for a model of such a theory. Recently, Laskowski has discovered that any shallow, strictly stable theory that does not have the dimensional order property interprets an infinite group.  In collaboration with Shelah, Laskowski is seeking to understand the extent to which this group determines the dependence relation of dividing. Finally, in collaboration with Dolich, Laskowski is seeking to identify a class of theories that contains the simple theories, yet also a satisfactory notion of independence.   <br/><br/><br/>Model theory is concerned with the interplay between theories (i.e., sets of sentences in a very formal language) and the classes of algebraic structures (models) that satisfy these sentences.  Most of Laskowski's research to date concerns broad classes of theories, as opposed to concentrating on a specific theory or structure. Because of the breadth of the context, applications have been found in other areas of mathematics and in computer science, specifically in the analysis of structured data bases. These classes of theories are described in terms of the embeddability  or non-embeddability of certain configurations of elements  into models of the theory.  Laskowski is continuing to analyze three classes of theories.  In all three cases, the combinatorial assumptions on the class of theories imply that the models of such theories contain  some algebraic content.  The investigator is studying the extent to which this algebraic component determines the behavior of a model of the theory.    <br/>"

Ramsey theory is that part of combinatorics that deals with the question of what sort of homogeneous structures one can expect to find in some one cell of a finite partition of specified sets (or sometimes in any suitably ""large"" subset). For example, the simplest nontrivial instance of the infinite version of Ramsey's theorem says that whenever the two-element subsets of the natural numbers N are finitely colored, there must be some infinite subset of N all of whose two-element subsets are the same color. Ramsey theory has applications in a wide variety of areas of mathematics as well as in theoretical computer science, communications, and information theory. The principal investigator will continue to mentor graduate students in projects on finite Ramsey Theory; this award consists solely of support for graduate students, facilitating the training through research involvement of the next generation of mathematicians.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will continue his research in Ramsey theory, including the interactions between this part of combinatorics and the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech compactification of a discrete semigroup. The principal investigator proved many years ago that whenever N is finitely colored, there must exist in one color an infinite sequence together with all of its finite sums of distinct terms without repetition. The original proof was elementary, but very complicated. Subsequently, other proofs were found that were less complicated. But in 1975, F. Galvin and S. Glazer showed that this ""Finite Sums Theorem"" is a completely trivial consequence of the fact that the Stone-Cech compactification of N can be given an algebraic structure extending ordinary addition which is a compact right topological semigroup, and therefore has idempotents. Sets with the property that they contain all the finite sums from a sequence are called IP sets. By virtue of the connection discovered above, a set is an IP set if and only if it has an idempotent in its closure. Those that have special idempotents which are called minimal in their closure are central sets. These sets have much stronger properties, many of which are consequences of the Central Sets Theorem. But central sets have a very complicated elementary description. Sets that satisfy the conclusion of the Central Sets Theorem are called C sets, and are much easier to describe in an elementary fashion. Investigation of these various algebraically characterized large subsets of N should continue to yield new Ramsey theoretic results."

His work addresses the logical and computational complexity of formal, symbolic proofs; this includes the analysis of proofs in a variety of proof systems corresponding to feasible computation, and the possibility of extracting computational information from proofs. <br/><br/>This project will be supported by the Foundations program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Theory of Computing program of the Division of Computer and Communications Research.<br/>"

Topology is an area of abstract mathematics that emerged from analysis and geometry as its own discipline in the late 19th century.  It has since become one of the foundational disciplines of mathematics, underlying much of mathematics and its applications to the sciences.  Modern applications of topology include logic, computer science, data processing, life sciences, game theory, and enriched category theory.  In keeping with its predecessor conferences, SUMTOPO 2020 will be an important international event that reflects the ever-expanding world of topology and its applications, with sessions dedicated to natural and social sciences, category theory, computational topology (including block chains and data science), algebra and geometry, general and set-theoretic topology, dynamics and continuum theory, asymmetry and many-valuedness, and enriched categories and topology.  SUMTOPO 2020 will contribute to better understanding the topological structures inherent in big data, as well as solidifying topology as a foundation of data science, thus contributing to the NSF goal of Harnessing the Data Revolution. SUMTOPO 2020 will have special sessions for recent doctoral recipients and faculty at smaller institutions to help them develop sustainable research programs, as well as outlining strategies for recruiting women and minorities to mathematics.  Participants will comprise a diverse group of established researchers, junior researchers, graduate students, and retirees, with special emphasis on recruiting speakers and participants both internationally and from underrepresented populations. <br/><br/>SUMPTOPO 2020 features sessions on Algebra and Geometry, General and Set-Theoretic Topology, Dynamics and Continuum Theory, and Asymmetry, while beginning and/or expanding sessions on Topology in Data Science for Natural and Social Sciences, Category Theory, Computational Topology, Many-Valuedness, and Enriched Categories and Topology. In each session, ?topology,? whether explicitly stated or not, is a basis of the session. In the natural and social sciences, scientists and mathematicians are discovering that there are natural occurrences and phenomena that can be explained or better understood using topology and that some of the explanations raise new topological questions. Data science is of special interest in two of the sessions in SUMTOPO 2020. Data science is not only a rapidly developing area in its own right, it is also a driving force in important and on-going developments in many disciplines including most if not all the natural and social sciences. Topology is proving to be an integral part of the development of data science and its applications. Regarding category theory, we want to explore the ways in which category theory has influenced topology in the past and the ways that category theory will continue to influence topology in the future. Since the very nature of (big) data means that applications involving data science must be computational, computational topology is a critical area of focus. Computational topology also gives rise to new topological questions and areas of research. An asymmetric topology is one for which the associated specialization preorder is non-symmetric; while a many-valued topology is a collection of open sets, each of which is a mapping from the carrier set of a space to a designated complete lattice of ?truth values.? In recent years it has been discovered that these two areas of topology are linked to each other and to computational topology, particularly to spaces and topological systems often associated with programming semantics.<br/><br/>The conference web page is https://ysu.edu/sumtopo.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The tools for testing whether a mathematical structures is suitable for classification are various hypotheses called ""dividing lines"", which forbid some fixed pattern in the behavior of a structure. A main focus of this project is one such dividing line called VC-dimension, which originated in machine learning, and uses ideas from graph theory to measure randomness in mathematical objects. In model theory, this notion emerged in the study of so-called ""NIP theories"". Conant will apply this model theoretic framework to questions in group theory, from both the discrete and topological perspectives, and also in the newer field of arithmetic combinatorics, which is a fusion of algebra, analysis, and discrete math. <br/><br/>A large part of past research in model theory has focused on structures which exhibit tameness at the global level, in the sense that every definable relation in the structure omits a combinatorial configuration of some fixed type. This research focuses on the local level, in which one analyzes a single tame relation inside an otherwise complicated structure. A major aim is to develop an algebraic theory of NIP formulas in arbitrary groups, which continues prior research of Conant and Pillay in the case of pseudofinite groups. A second aim is to extend this work on pseudofinite groups outside of the NIP environment. This setting is suitable for applications to arithmetic combinatorics in finite groups, for example previous research of Conant, Pillay, and Terry on tame arithmetic regularity. In the proposed research, Conant will use Lie theory and representation theory to develop arithmetic regularity in the pseudofinite setting without extra tameness assumptions. The goal is to give a model theoretic account of arithmetic regularity results of Green and Tao, and extend these results to non-commutative groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Here, an ""object"" is represented by a point in some mathematical structure, and ""motion"" is understood to mean a group of symmetries of this structure. By considering different mathematical structures, ideas from dynamics interact with several other areas of mathematics, in particular logic, group theory, and combinatorics. In turn, ideas from these fields give rise to new phenomena in dynamics. This project will focus on ideas coming from ""countable combinatorics,"" broadly construed. Combinatorics is the study of discrete structures, as opposed to continuous ones, while the emphasis on ""countable"" combinatorics means that these discrete structures will be infinite, but still small enough that we can write down a list, or enumeration, of their elements. Much research in the past two decades has elucidated how pigeon-hole principles on countable structures can yield examples of groups with simple dynamics; here, the group of symmetries will be large, i.e. uncountable. On the other hand, attention has shifted recently to considering combinatorial arguments on countable groups themselves; these can be used to show that countable groups always have wild dynamics.<br/><br/>The PI has two primary goals for this project. The first is to continue to develop the dictionary back and forth between combinatorial principles and dynamical properties of countable groups and more general Polish groups. In the case of countable groups, the existence of certain patterns on the group can lead to the construction of subshifts with interesting behavior, such as doubly minimal shifts or shifts disjoint from another given dynamical system. For more general Polish groups, Ramsey-like principles can be used to produce interesting spaces of ultrafilter-like objects on which the group can act. These dynamical systems will then have important universal properties, such as being universal for minimal flows, or being a universal ""completion flow,"" a dynamical object previously defined and investigated by the PI. The second is to develop techniques to prove new theorems in countable combinatorics. Of particular interest are theorems asserting that various countable first-order structures have finite big Ramsey degrees. While the properties of interest are about countable objects, the techniques used can deal with extremely large objects, such as spaces of ultrafilters or forcing posets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Von Neumann algebras do not contain significant information about the group or action that they were constructed from. Nevertheless, in the past decade, Popa's deformation/rigidity theory has led to an explosion of rigidity results. These show that many properties of groups or actions can be recognized by looking at their von Neumann algebras. Ioana will develop new methods to study rigidity for von Neumann algebras. Three specific directions of research will be pursued. Firstly, Ioana will expand the scope of super-rigidity for von Neumann algebras by providing new examples of groups and actions that can be entirely reconstructed from their von Neumann algebras. A second direction concerns  Cartan subalgebras of von Neumann algebras.  Finally, Ioana will investigate the notion of orbit equivalence for group actions. Several research projects on these topics will further the discovery of new knowledge in all of these directions.<br/><br/>This mathematics research project is in the general area of operator algebras, and it deals with the classifications of von Neumann algebras. These algebras are connected and have direct applications to a number of areas of science, such as quantum computing, biology (structure of DNA) and engineering (cell phone design).  As part of this mathematics research project, the principal investigator Adrian Ioana will develop two new courses at the undergraduate and graduate level, respectively.  Ioana is currently mentoring several graduate students and running a seminar in areas close to the research-related content of this project.  In addition to supporting graduate students, Ioana will hire and mentor one postdoctoral scholar.  Ioana will also organize a research workshop, whose goal is to acquaint young researchers with some of the latest exciting developments on the topics pertaining this project.  Finally,  Ioana will train high school students  and college students to participate in mathematics competitions."

Finite-state automata are Turing machines with fixed finite bounds on resource use.  Continuing a tradition of studying that part of mathematics which can be performed effectively, the field of automatic structures explores mathematical objects which can be represented by automata.  Questions about automatic structures may be grouped into two themes: developing structural characterizations and studying algorithmic consequences of such characterizations. Dr. Minnes has worked in both of these areas, including proving both positive and negative results about the existence of such characterizations. Through this NSF grant, she will work towards answering these guiding questions in the context of less understood classes of structures.  For example, the fundamental groups associated with certain manifolds have intimate connections with automata and some sequences arising in symbolic dynamics and combinatorics may be seen as generated by automata.  The tools developed by the automatic structures community may lead to a better structural understanding of these objects.  In parallel,  Dr. Minnes seeks to develop the area of automatic model theory.   Much work has been done in understanding how the standard results of model theory change when restricted to the framework of computable or polynomial-time objects.  Preliminary work shows interesting analogies in the automatic structures world and suggests the promise of fruitful results.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>With the increasing reliance of the modern world on computerized and networked systems, the theoretical underpinnings of computational feasibility have gained more immediate relevance.  Starting in the 1950s, the Turing machine, an idealized model of a computer with no bounds on memory use or computation time, led to astonishing and foundational insight into what problems can or cannot be solved by any algorithm.  This NSF project focusses on a different model for the computer, the finite automaton, which more closely captures online computation and resource bounds.  Dr. Minnes will study questions which relate finite automata both to traditional topics of mathematical logic  and to new interactions with other fields of mathematics and computer science."

The union of model theory and operator algebras has already proven to be fruitful and we plan on continuing the emerging evolution of model-theoretic methods in operator algebras.

Nonstandard analysis takes advantage of idealized elements to replace limiting processes and offers new insights into difficult problems.<br/><br/>The study of operator algebras originally began as a rigorous mathematical formulation for studying various phenomena in quantum physics.  A Hilbert space is a space consisting of vectors that can be added and multiplied by scalars and for which a notion of angle makes sense.  An operator on a Hilbert space is a continuous transformation of the Hilbert space that respects the addition and scalar multiplication; operators can themselves be added and multiplied and there is also a notion of an adjoint of an operator, which in some sense is akin to taking a matrix and taking its transpose.  An operator algebra is a collection of operators on a Hilbert space that is closed under addition, scalar multiplication and adjoint and is closed under taking limits in a suitable sense.  Understanding the properties of various kinds of operator algebras and attempting to classify them has been an important venture in functional analysis for over half a century.  In this project, we propose to continue the use of techniques from logic to study operator algebras and their model-theoretic properties, that is, the properties they possess that can be expressed in logical terms."

If S is a discrete semigroup, then its Stone-Cech compactification is, in a natural way, a compact Hausdorff right topological semigroup. As is true of any compact Hausdorff right topological semigroup, this Stone-Cech compactification has a smallest two sided ideal, and this ideal usually has elaborate algebraic structure. This project involves the study of the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech compactification and its smallest ideal and investigation of the combinatorial applications of that structure, primarily to Ramsey Theory.<br/><br/>Ramsey Theory is that part of combinatorics that deals with the question of what sort of homogeneous structures one can expect to find in some one cell of a finite partition (or ""coloring"") of specified sets. For example, the simplest nontrivial instance of the infinite version of Ramsey's Theorem says that whenever the two element subsets of the set N of positive integers are finitely colored, there must be some infinite subset of N all of whose two element subsets are the same color. The principal investigator gained some fame many years ago when he proved that whenever N is finitely colored, there must exist in one color an infinite sequence together with all of its finite sums of distinct terms without repetition. The original proof was elementary, but very complicated. But in 1975, Fred Galvin and Steven Glazer showed that this ""Finite Sums Theorem"" is a completely trivial consequence of the fact that the Stone-Cech compactification of N can be given an algebraic structure extending ordinary addition which is a compact right topological semigroup, and therefore has idempotents, that is elements such that p + p = p. Since then, numerous other applications of the algebraic structure of Stone-Cech compactifications to Ramsey Theory have been found.<br/><br/>"

Broadly speaking, the goal is to describe their dynamics and identify types of dynamics that cannot occur in them. In recent work the principal investigator and others have applied methods from recursion theory and topological dynamics to describe the complexity of some classical dynamical invariants associated to SFTs and CA, such as their entropy and directional dynamics (subdynamics). This project represents a continuation of that investigation. The principal investigator hopes to extend the classification of subdynamics to co-rank 1 actions (currently only co-rank 2 and higher are known) and begin a systematic study of the full dynamics, which are related to more quantitative measures of complexity drawn from computer science rather than the qualitative ones of recursion theory. He will also study the relation between SFTs, CA, and other dynamical systems, specifically addressing which actions on the Cantor set can be approximated by certain types of SFTs.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the class of dynamical systems arising from infinite collections of discrete elements in which only ""nearby"" elements interact. Such models are widely used as theoretical models and in simulation in many areas of science and engineering, such as thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, the theory of quasi-crystals, information theory, and computer science, to name just a few. In that context, it is a fundamental problem to determine which dynamics such systems can represent and what their theoretical limitations are and to identify subclasses that are more amenable to study and use. Precise results in this field have come to light recently, and this project aims to continue research in this direction."

The goal of this research is to find an effective estimate of complexity of the ``quantifier simplification'' for expressions with Pfaffian functions, i.e., replacing an expression with existential and universal quantifiers by an equivalent expression without universal quantifiers.  This includes estimates of the complexity of different operations with semi- and sub-Pfaffian sets, such as the frontier, closure, stratification, and resolution of singularities.    Modern computer algebra qystems allow one to perform on a computer many operations with algebraic equations and inequalities previously considered the domain of abstract algebraic geometry.  The results can be applied to such practical problems as visualisation, robotics, and coding theory.  The complexity of computer codes performing these operations becomes a practically important problem. This complexity usually grows quickly with the degree of polynomials.  A new approach to reduce computational complexity lies in the Pfaffian theory studying a class of non-algebraic functions with global finiteness properties similar to the properties of algebraic functions.  The complexity of a polynomial considered as a Pfaffian function depends only on the number of its non-zero monomials (or, more generally, on the complexity of a formula representing this polynomial) independent of its degree.  Exponential and trigonometric functions, and many special functions, are Pfaffian, too. Thus Pfaffian methods, when applicable, allow one to produce fast computer codes for computations with simple algebraic, exponential and trigonometric formulas, possibly of a high degree."

He asked whether the properties of his integral are really fundamental and follow from more familiar integral axioms.  The class of amenable groups was introduced and studied by von Neumann in 1929, and he explained why a paradox appeared only in dimensions greater or equal to three. In the 1940s the amenability theory shifted into the field of functional analysis.  Currently amenability theory appears in many fields of mathematics, most notably in operator algebras, functional analysis, ergodic theory, probability theory, and harmonic analysis.<br/><br/>The core part of the project is based on the recent technique used by PI to prove that certain groups are amenable. PI plans to develop this technique in a more conceptual way using random walks on Schreier graphs. There are several classes of groups to which the technique can potentially be applied. They include Thompson group F, interval exchange transformation group, topological full group of abelian groups. The expected impact of the project is to give deeper understanding of analytic properties of the group actions and relate them to other fields. One of the central impact of this proposal is through its educational goals, in particular, in organizing of several summer schools and workshops.  The schools are aimed toward graduate students and other young researchers, focused on the recent developments in group theory and operator algebras."

The PI proposes to use<br/>various new techniques to find surface subgroups in examples of<br/>word-hyperbolic groups, including doubles of free groups along<br/>maximal cyclic subgroups.<br/><br/>A group is a collection of symmetries, for example the collection<br/>of all translations of the Euclidean plane that preserve the<br/>integer lattice.  This group is generated by the translations of<br/>one unit of length in the north, south, east, or west directions,<br/>in the sense that any element of the group can be obtained by<br/>composing copies of those four basic translations.  Every<br/>finitely generated group carries a notion of distance between<br/>pairs of its elements, defined by counting the number of<br/>generators that must be applied to carry one element of the group<br/>to another.  These projects concentrate on word-hyperbolic<br/>groups, which have many of the properties of the hyperbolic plane<br/>from non-Euclidean geometry and are known to be so common that a<br/>randomly selected finitely generated group is almost surely<br/>word-hyperbolic.

This dual algebraic/geometric view is applied in many branches of mathematics, especially for the study of algebraic equations involving numbers (under the name of Diophantine geometry), the study of solutions to polynomial equations (under the name of algebraic geometry), or the study of the possible algebraic relations among solutions to systems of differential or difference equations (under the names of differential algebraic geometry or difference algebraic geometry,  respectively), among others. In practice, some of the questions considered in these areas suffer from extreme complexity inherited from their connection to number theory or to even more complicated domains. Work in mathematical logic has elucidated the boundary between those complicated theories and those admitting a tame, geometric theory. This research project aims to extend the class of theories for which a tame geometry can be established and to use these results from mathematical logic to answer questions from the target domains. <br/><br/>This research project studies the connections between geometries of various kinds, including algebraic, differential, Diophantine, and analytic geometries, through the model-theoretic lens of definability in suitable theories.  Mathematical theories as diverse as those of partial differential equations, difference equations, perfectoid spaces, formal geometry, algebraic dynamics, and homogenous dynamics will be studied. Technically, methods including geometric stability theory as applied to differentially closed fields, o-minimality, and quantifier elimination for valued differential fields and analytic difference rings will be applied for the purpose of answering questions internal to model theory (such as proving or refuting the trichotomy principle for regular types in differentially closed fields with several commuting derivations) and for applications to problems in functional transcendence, dynamics, and Diophantine geometry. It is anticipated that the work will have applications to the structure of algebraic differential equations, the arithmetic of dynamical systems, and mathematical physics, as well as in other areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While ""an o-minimal structure"" is a notion of model theory, it turns out that many important expansions of real numbers are o-minimal, and this model theoretical notion provides a natural framework for the study of ""analytic-geometric"" categories.  Tools of model theory have been successfully applied to these categories yielding interesting theorems about the real numbers.  The starting point for this project is the observation that groups definable in o-minimal structures can be viewed as Lie groups over real closed fields.  Certain aspects of these groups are easily overlooked when treated only over the field of real numbers.  These aspects come into full view, however, when we regard the groups as definable in model-theoretically well-behaved structures.  The main goal of Starchenko's project is to obtain a reasonable classification of o-minimal groups, in order to develop a model-theoretical analogue of Lie theory.  He conjectures that locally o-minimal groups are algebraic and Lie morphisms are, essentially, Nash morphisms.  If this is the case, then many properties of algebraic groups can be transferred to o-minimal groups, thus providing new tools to study such groups.  Since the field of algebraic real numbers is o-minimal, these tools can then be applied to study groups definable in expansions of number fields.  On the other hand, any negative example will provide new information about interactions between geometric and algebraic properties of Euclidean groups.  The second part of the project concerns some open questions in stability theory.  It has been shown that many ideas and tools of model theory have natural geometric analogues in o-minimal structures.  The investigator hopes that the presence of a nice geometry can help to solve o-minimal versions of the two most famous questions in stability theory.    This project employs l ogical tools of model theory, and specifically a notion called o-minimality, to deepen the mathematical understanding of several important number systems, including the real numbers.  An understanding of the real numbers and of their geometric properties is basic to mathematics, and also to many applications of mathematics, e.g. to manufacturing.  Model theory provides a valuable perspective in this understanding."

By allowing for both in person and remote participation, the 55th STDC will be able to bring together a broad and diverse group of mathematicians to disseminate research and establish connections for future collaboration. The organizers expect to host more than 100 participants from the United States and from abroad on-site, as well as more than 100 remote participants.  A crucial part of the STDC is its involvement of researchers at all career stages?graduate students and early career researchers as well as established researchers?allowing for younger generations of mathematicians to find mentors and to establish their research trajectories. In addition, the STDC makes a conscious effort to promote diversity in mathematics in its recruitment of organizers and speakers, with a focus on ensuring representation of women and underrepresented minority groups. <br/><br/>The 55th STDC is structured around five special sessions, each with a focus on one aspect of topology?continuum theory, dynamical systems, geometric group theory, geometric topology, and set-theoretic topology. The invited and contributed talks of these special sessions and their associated plenary and semi-plenary speakers provide an opportunity for the announcement and discussion of the most significant advances in the various subfields of topology over the last year. In addition, the STDC reserves a plenary address for the winner of the annual Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher award, which is given to an early-career topologist with outstanding contributions to the field. This year, the STDC will also host a workshop on Linear Dynamics, a relatively young subfield of dynamics, aimed at graduate students and early-career mathematicians, as well as a series of open problem, collaboration, and mentoring sessions. These talks and activities provide an excellent framework for the establishment of new collaborative efforts in mathematical research and for encouraging full participation of graduate students and early career researchers.

The outstanding algorithmic questions: Is there an algorithm to determine whether the quasi-equations valid in a finite algebra F are finitely based?  Is there an algorithm to determine if the quasi-variety generated by F possesses a natural duality?  Is the class of finite algebras possessing a finite equational basis recursively enumerable?  Is the class of finite algebras generating a residually large variety recursively enumerable?  Among the important structural questions: What collection of algebraic properties is necessary and sufficient for a finitely generated variety to be finitely decidable, or to have few models?  <br/><br/>Purely theoretical research in this branch of general algebra is driven today not by the likelihood of supplying any pressing practical needs, but rather by the sheer difficulty of the intellectual challenge and the tremendous sense of satisfaction that accompanies success.  However, this work, like all of algebra, spawns a constant stream of algorithms, many of which, though feasible, are extremely difficult to implement efficiently on a computer, providing a severe test of the state-of-the-art in hardware and software and programming skills.  The current theorem-proving programs for equational logic are a good example of this phenomenon.  There appears to be a growing realization in the theoretical computer science community that general algebra is the mathematical language in which they most need to be fluent.  The principal investigator believes that research into the interplay between, on the one hand, the existence or nonexistence of algorithms to recognize fundamental properties of finite algebras, and on the other hand, the levels of structural complexity manifested in the algebras---what this project is all about---has the potential not only to expand our understanding of the structural possibilities in finite algebraic systems (which it has already done), but to produce, some day, superior codes and ciphers for secure information transfer.<br/><br/><br/>"

This amounts to providing a ""catalog"" or ""listing"" of these objects, in principle not unlike that of cataloging species in biology or stars and galaxies in astronomy. If such a classification is possible, one has a ""complete"" understanding of the mathematical structures involved.  Otherwise a more or less ""chaotic"" behavior is expected. It is thus very important to understand under what circumstances a classification is possible. This difficult foundational question is further complicated by the fact that what constitutes an acceptable classification is very much dependent on the particular field of mathematics studied, so the criteria for a ""good"" classification in one area might not be appropriate in another.  At its basic level, this project aims to develop a general quantitative theory, which in many situations can precisely measure the complexity of a classification problem and thus provide objective means by which one can decide, in any given field, whether a satisfactory classification of the objects in question is possible. Developments arising in this program often lead to the study of the symmetries of various mathematical structures and their dynamics as well as connections to areas of discrete mathematics, dynamical systems or probability and this is another important aspect of this project. In addition the project also provides research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/> <br/>The general aim of this project is the development of the theory of definable actions of Polish groups, the structure and classification of their orbit spaces, and the closely related study of definable equivalence relations and graphs.

This theory is developed within the context of descriptive set theory which provides the basic underlying concepts and methods.

Problems having to do with extensions of o-minimality deal in particular with the notions of weak o-minimality and local o-minimality. A range of natural examples of weakly o-minimal structures is now known and there already is a significant body of results in the subject. It is hoped that local o-minimality may provide a suitable framework for developing some model theory for subanalytic sets. The research described above falls under the heading of model theory, one of the principal subfields of mathematical logic. Model theorists study  properties of familiar mathematical structures which can be described by a formal mathematical language such as predicate logic. The distinctive point of view of model theory can provide insights and understanding into such structures that otherwise might not be easily achieved. This project focuses on structures that include and behave in important respects like the ordered field of real numbers, that is, the real numbers together with the polynomial and algebraic functions that are studied in first-year calculus and describe many phenomena.

Most importantly, he plans to                 attempt to develop an analogue to stability theory for linearly                 ordered structures, and to investigate the possibilities for a                  general model theory for classes of structures whose natural                    topology is given in a first-order way.                                              The principal investigator also is currently engaged in                    writing a monograph with Y.

Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies mathematical structures and their definable sets (i.e., the basic sets that ""live"" in those structures). On the other hand, differential and difference equations are equations that describe how things change with time and are the fundamental tools that modern science and engineering use to model physical reality. The basic idea of the project will be to view the set of solutions of a differential or difference equation as a definable set in an appropriate structure, and use the tools of model theory to understand its properties. The equations that the project focuses on -- the Painlevé differential and difference equations and the Schwarzian differential equations -- appear in many important physical applications such as statistical mechanics and general relativity, as well as in important problems in number theory. <br/><br/>The project builds on recent successes by model theorists to use techniques from geometric stability theory to classify special cases of these differential equations according to the trichotomy theorem in differentially closed fields of characteristic zero. The investigator will extend his work on the generic Painlevé (differential) equations to non-generic ones as well as to the Schwarzian equations. The objective is to both fully describe the structure of the sets of solutions and to use such descriptions to better our understanding of geometrically trivial sets in the theory. This work is expected to have applications to problems in number theory and functional transcendence theory. The project will also transport some of the ideas and techniques used to study classical differential equations to the difference setting. The main challenge will be to develop a notion of irreducibility (in the sense of classical functions) for difference equation and show that the difference Painlevé equations are irreducible. In addition to model theory, the work will also employ techniques from algebra and geometry and from the analytic study of differential/difference equations."

The fundamental questions include that of Cantor?s Continuum Hypothesis. This was the first question on the now famous list of proposed by Hilbert in 1900. By the results of Godel in 1940 and Cohen in 1963, this problem has been shown to be formally unsolvable on the basis of the axioms of Set Theory. But this does not mean that the question has no answer, rather it simply shows the accepted axioms of Set Theory are incomplete. In previously funded research, a single new axiom has been discovered which resolves not only the problem of the Continuum Hypothesis but essentially all the other questions which Cohen? method has been used in the last 50 years to show are also unsolvable. The compatibility of this new axiom with large cardinal axioms is now the central problem. The focus of this project is to bring the analysis of this new axiom to a conclusion, by either showing this new axiom cannot be refuted by large cardinal axioms, or by showing that some reasonable large cardinal axiom refutes this new axiom. In addition the project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The HOD Dichotomy Theorem isolates the fundamental issue raised by the Ultimate L Conjecture. This theorem shows that assuming reasonable large cardinal axioms, HOD must be either very close to V or very far from V. The HOD Conjecture is the conjecture that the ?far option? is vacuous. The only plausible approach at present to resolving the problem of the HOD Conjecture lies in the Ultimate L Conjecture. The focus of this project is in two parts. Either prove the Ultimate L Conjecture by extending inner model to the level of a supercompact cardinal, this would prove the HOD Conjecture, or refute the Ultimate L Conjecture which would strongly argue that the HOD Conjecture is false. The latter possibility is now a reasonable research target because of the increasing number of constraints which have been discovered that the inner model theory for a supercompact cardinal must satisfy. Either way, the successful conclusion of this project will resolve the problem of the compatibility of the axiom ``V=Ultimate? with large cardinal axioms. Depending on the outcome, one either verifies the HOD Conjecture or discovers why the HOD Conjecture is likely false.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most fruitful developments in this field has been the study of the algorithmic content of mathematics. At the same time, concerns about the foundations of mathematics have led to the analysis of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning, and the study of the relative power of such systems. The computability-theoretic approach has turned out to play a key role in this project. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics whose methods and results underlie a great deal of mathematical reasoning, so the study of its algorithmic content and of the systems required to formalize its methods is particularly important. Computable combinatorics has a long history, but has seen a recent surge of interest highlighting the fact that computability-theoretically natural notions tend to be combinatorially natural, and vice-versa. This project aims to strengthen the connections between computability theory and combinatorics by increasing our understanding of the algorithmic content of combinatorial principles, through a concerted group effort to use what we have learned in recent years to systematize the area further, work toward solving a number of its outstanding questions, and explore its outward-facing aspects.<br/><br/>This project will address major open problems such as determining whether Hindman's Theorem holds arithmetically, and whether it is equivalent to its restriction to sums of length at most two; determining the first-order part of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs, and clarifying the computability-theoretic relationship between this principle and its stable version; and determining the exact proof-theoretic strength of Laver's Theorem. More importantly, it will focus on the development of lines of research particularly relevant to the growing interest in connections between computability theory and combinatorics, including the study of questions of methodological interest to combinatorialists, for instance ones involving Hindman's Theorem and the use of ultrafilters in combinatorics; the development of new proofs of combinatorial theorems inspired by questions regarding the computational content of these theorems, along the lines of Montalban's new proof of Laver's Theorem; the analysis and comparison of different general methods, such as the use of ultrafilters, topological dynamics, and probabilistic methods; the development of notions of comparison between theorems that, while still computability-theoretic in spirit, are closer to being direct reflections of combinatorial differences; the understanding of splittings of combinatorial principles into computationally and combinatorially simpler parts; the study of the usefulness of combinatorially-defined objects as computational oracles; and the study of the first-order consequences of the existence of combinatorially-defined second-order objects. This project is thus aimed at developing the study of the connections between computability theory and combinatorics along a large number of related directions, making use of the computability-theoretic, proof-theoretic, and combinatorial expertise of its PIs, senior personnel, and key collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of model theory concerns the ways in which a theory, which is simply a set of sentences in a formal language controls its class of models.  For many years, the PI has concentrated on mechanisms by which a theory can either admit or forbid certain combinatorial configurations in its models, and the proposed research is to continue these investigations in several  disparate contexts.  In some cases, this investigation melds well with computational learning theory.  As one example, if a theory forbids the independence property, then all of the concepts i.e., definable sets, arising in the models of the theory are PAC learnable.<br/><br/>In more detail, potential canonical Scott sentences have proved to be a useful tool in determining the Borel complexity of invariant classes of countable structures and we intend  to streamline these methods by exploring thickness and groundedness of classes of models.  It is hoped that the Borel complexity of every mutually algebraic theory can be computed.  Theories with non-maximal uncountable spectrum are classifiable.  Recent technical results about the existence of prime models make it tractable to settle Vaught's conjecture for classifiable theories and possibly for superstable theories as well.  In first order logic, aleph1-categoricity of a theory is an absolute notion, as can be seen by the Baldwin-Lachlan characterization of aleph1-categoricity.  The PI proposes to determine whether a similar characterization can be found for aleph1-categoricity of sentences of L(omega1, omega), or equivalently for classes of atomic models.  Specifically, the proposed research is to determine whether  aleph1-categoricity is absolute  for classes of atomic models.

While this method originates in foundational questions, over the years profound applications to the study of many central objects of classical mathematics and computer science were discovered. This project will investigate an emerging connection to the area of graph theory. Graphs are the basic discrete mathematical objects used to model networks and related systems. In combinatorics, one often investigates the asymptotic behavior of various quantitative properties (such as the density of the edges, or the size of a certain regular pattern) for large finite graphs. Model theory provides a method of converting asymptotic quantitative questions about properties of a family of graphs into qualitative questions about the shape, volume or dimension of a certain limiting infinite object (via the so-called ultraproduct construction). Infinitary model-theoretic machinery to study such limit objects will be used to address questions in finite graph combinatorics, and conversely rich body of results in combinatorics will be used to attack open questions in model theory.<br/><br/>As demonstrated in the previous work of the principal investigator and other researchers, recent advances on pseudo-randomness and Ramsey-type phenomena for restricted families of graphs (e.g. semialgebraic regularity lemma by Fox et al., Tao's algebraic regularity lemma over finite fields, regularity lemma for graphs of finite Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension by Lovasz-Szegedy, etc.) admit a uniform model-theoretic treatment well-aligned with the methods and ideas in Shelah's classification theory. This project initiates a systematic program of investigating these connections, centered around the study of Keisler measures and various model-theoretic notions of dimension (e.g. coming from forking independence or pseudofinite counting) in tame classes of first-order structures (stable, distal, dependent, simple, NTP2, etc.), as well as the finer questions on generalized ""incidence bounds"" and their relation to Zilber's trichotomy phenomena."

A generalized algorithm runs for transfinitely many steps, and even a single step is too hard for an ordinary computer, but this kind of algorithmic thinking gives a useful perspective on mathematics.  This project will use the algorithmic perspective of computability theory to analyze various hierarchies from classical analysis, topological dynamics, and descriptive set theory.  Sometimes a hierarchy-derived tool, such as the measurability of a Borel set, is less powerful than a full hierarchy analysis, but still strong enough for many purposes.  The research will explore this distinction, among other questions.  The project will also support the training of graduate students. <br/><br/>Theorems about Borel sets are sometimes proved by recursing along the structure of the Borel sets, but more often they are proved via measure or category. When the usual measure and category approaches do not pan out, reverse mathematics provides one framework for formalizing the question of whether any measure or category approach could succeed.  This framework will be applied to analyze various theorems about Borel sets, in particular theorems from descriptive combinatorics.  Second, the PI will address a number of questions about computability-theoretic properties of hierarchies in classical analysis, such as the Bourgain rank or the hierarchy of Denjoy integrable functions.  Finally, shifts of finite type (SFTs) are certain topological dynamical systems which are simply described but exhibit complex behavior, because their dynamics can simulate Turing computations.  It is not well understood which properties of the resulting dynamical system can be controlled by these computations.  The project aims to develop usable meta-theorems describing classes of algorithms that can be implemented in SFTs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The properties are at the heart of Shelah's fundamental work on classification of first-order theories, as well as the results on excellent classes. Preliminary results allow to conjecture that failure of generalized amalgamation is witnessed by certain category-theoretic objects. Study of such objects is the central topic of this research. <br/><br/>Kolesnikov's approach allows to treat generalized amalgamation properties in first-order theories and non-elementary classes as particular cases of a common phenomenon. The starting point of this research is the development of a theory of generalized amalgamation for algebraically closed sets in stable first-order theories, extending the work of Hrushovski. Such a theory appears to be rich even for totally categorical theories and could be of independent interest.<br/><br/>A novel feature of this research is the idea to phrase generalized amalgamation in terms of functorial embeddings of simplicial complexes into models (of a first-order theory or those of an atomic class). <br/>The projected characterization of generalized amalgamation in terms of homological algebra would lead to influx of new ideas into model theory of both first-order theories and non-elementary classes.<br/><br/>Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic that aims to analyze classes of mathematical structures that are axiomatized in some way (the terms ""first-order theory"" and ""non-elementary class"" refer to certain kinds of axioms that are used). One of the subfields of model theory, called classification theory, attempts to identify conditions on a class of structures that provide substantial information about the overall behavior of the elements of the class. The finer analysis of geometric model theory attempts to connect the combinatorial geometry of structures, defined in model-theoretic terms, with geometries coming from classically known structures. Generalized amalgamation properties originated in classification theory. The expectation is that Kolesnikov's research will connect the failure of properties to the existence of certain objects studied in a different area of mathematics. This research will contribute to the broader efforts on solving a long-standing (classification-theoretic) conjecture of Shelah and, potentially, will help in developing geometric methods in model theory of non-elementary classes. <br/>"

They originated as a way to describe symmetries in both mathematics and nature. It turns out that almost all algebraic mathematical structures can be considered as a group with some extra structure. More recently, group theory has also found uses in cryptography. Many tools from other fields, like combinatorics and geometry, have proven useful in the study of groups. Furthermore, group theory has a long history of interaction with logic. In the early developments of logic, group theory was an important testing ground for ideas in logic. On the other hand, it became gradually clear that many ideas from logic were also useful in the study of groups. This project aims to explore this connection and applies tools from logic to advance our understanding of various important classes of groups. This project also provides opportunities and support for students at California State University, Northridge to engage in research in logic and group theory.<br/><br/>This project aims to understand the model-theoretic, computability, and complexity properties of groups, and use this understanding to make progress in classifying the finitely-generated groups. The project contains three main parts. The first part aims to analyze the model-theoretic properties of random groups, especially the 0-1 conjecture of first-order sentences in Gromov's random group model. The main tool is the theory developed by Sela, and independently by Kharlampovich and Myasnikov, which they used to solve the 70-year-old Tarski's problem. The second part aims to understand the complexity of describing the elements and multiplication of groups. This includes analyzing the word problem and representative systems of groups using the framework of formal language theory. The third part builds on previous work of the investigator and aims to understand the descriptive complexity of groups, and how they connect to various important classes of finitely-generated groups. More broadly, this part aims to understand the complexity of classes of groups and the relations on them, especially isomorphism, within the context of computability theory. Overall, the project is conducive for student research as it contains many concrete and experimental examples, and will provide training and research experience for the diverse students at California State University, Northridge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Similarly, simple concepts are often used to approximate, illuminate, or even define more complicated concepts.  For example, calculus uses the extremely simple concepts of lines and rectangles to approximate very complicated functions and regions; and when a function cannot be nicely approximated by a line, the next-simplest kind of function (a polynomial) can often be used to do the approximation. This project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Approximation Problems abound in algebra too, where they often have the form: suppose C is a subcategory of a complicated category K. Can C be used to approximate, or extract information about, arbitrary members of the ambient category K? Approximation Problems appear in many guises in homological algebra and homotopy theory, and affirmative solutions to such problems can provide useful new invariants for K.  Starting with Shelah's work on the Whitehead Problem in the 1970s, set-theoretic methods have been surprisingly effective in dealing with such questions, which often turn out to be independent of the axioms of mathematics.

Much of model theory concerns the ways in which a theory, which is simply a set of sentences in a formal language, controls its class of models. The PI has previously investigated on mechanisms by which a theory can either admit or forbid certain combinatorial configurations in its models; this project continues these investigations in several contexts. In some cases, this investigation melds well with computational learning theory. As one example, if a theory forbids the independence property, then all the concepts i.e., definable sets, arising in the models of the theory conform to the probably approximately correct (PAC) learning framework. This project will provide research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI has noted a strong connection between the complexity of hereditary classes C of finite structures and monadic expansions of infinite models of Th(C).  There is a hierarchy of dividing lines, such as monadic NFCP, monadic stability, and monadic NIP.  Working with Braunfeld, the PI has multiple characterizations of a model of Th(C) being monadically NIP.  The project expects to show that if some model of Th(C) is not monadically NIP, then the class is wild, e.g., the growth rate of unlabelled structures in C is superexponetial and the class is not n-wqo for some integer n.  Potential canonical Scott sentences have proved to be a useful tool in determining the Borel complexity of invariant classes of countable structures and the research intends to streamline these methods by exploring thickness and groundedness of classes of models. The project aims to compute the Borel complexity of every mutually algebraic theory.  Theories with non-maximal uncountable spectrum are classifiable. Recent technical results about the existence of prime models make it tractable to settle Vaught's conjecture for classifiable theories and possibly for superstable theories as well. In first order logic, aleph1-categoricity of a theory is an absolute notion, as can be seen by the Baldwin-Lachlan characterization of aleph1-categoricity. The PI aims to determine whether a similar characterization can be found for aleph1-categoricity of sentences of L(omega1, omega), or equivalently for classes of atomic models. Specifically, the project intends to determine whether aleph1-categoricity is absolute for classes of atomic models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Von Neumann algebras were introduced by John von Neumann in his mathematical account of quantum mechanics and consist of infinite-sized matrices closed under various natural operations.  Quantum complexity theory considers the difficulty of solving or verifying solutions to decision problems using the quantum model of computation, that is to say, computers that run according to the laws of quantum physics as opposed to classical physics.  Recently, a landmark result in quantum complexity theory showed that classically unsolvable decision problems could be reliably verified by a quantum computer.  This quantum complexity result established a negative solution to a famous problem in operator algebras, the so-called Connes Embedding Problem, posed in 1976, which asks whether or not every von Neumann algebra can be approximated by a simple von Neumann algebra known as the hyperfinite II_1 factor.  Using techniques from model theory, a branch of mathematical logic that studies classes of structures by examining what is expressible about them using first-order logic, the PI and a collaborator greatly simplified and elucidated the connection between the quantum complexity result and the solution to the Connes Embedding Problem.  This project plans to deepen the connection between these three areas by isolating the exact model-theoretic content behind the quantum complexity result and deducing further von Neumann algebraic consequences. <br/><br/>More specifically, the PI plans on extending the model-theoretic analysis of the quantum complexity result to understand the complexity of the full first-order theory of the hyperfinite II_1 factor; the PI's work with Hart established this connection for the one-quantifier theory.  In addition, the PI plans to pursue proofs of the failure of the Connes Embedding Problem which avoid the use of the quantum complexity result by using the model-theoretic notions of existentially closed models and Robinson forcing; due to the difficulty in proving the quantum complexity result, a new proof along these lines would serve as a great simplification of the resolution of the Connes Embedding Problem.  The project will also study other uses of model theory in von Neumann algebra theory, including furthering progress on Popa's embedding problem, which asks about the existence of certain kinds of ergodic embeddings of II_1 factors into ultrapowers.  The PI also plans on making progress on the C*-algebra version of the Connes Embedding Problem known as the Kirchberg Embedding Problem, which asks if every C*-algebra is approximated by the Cuntz algebra, an algebra of extreme importance in the classification program for nuclear C*-algebras.  Finally, while the majority of the model-theoretic study of von Neumann algebras has focused on so-called finite algebras, the PI plans on studying the model-theoretic properties of arbitrary von Neumann algebras through the lens of W*-probability spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A particular focus is to study the structure of certain natural mathematical objects which occur as definable equivalence relations on the reals. These objects greatly generalize the objects of traditional study in descriptive set theory, and also extend naturally the objects, dynamical systems, studied in dynamics. The focus of this project is to use recently developed, cross-disciplinary techniques to study some of the fundamental properties of these objects. There are several important open questions for which the new techniques seem promising, and with which we can benchmark progress. Further progress in this area will lead to a better understanding of these areas of mathematics and their connections.<br/><br/>A major focus of the proposal concerns the combinatorics of countable Borel equivalence relations. These are the relations generated by the Borel actions of countable groups. A natural plan of study is to proceed by increasing complexity of the group generating the relation. Even for relatively simple groups, the combinatorics of their group actions is interesting. As an example, recent methods allow for a computation of both the continuous and Borel chromatic numbers of free Bernoulli shifts by finitely generated abelian groups. There have also been recent developments to extend the proposers' result that all actions of countable abelian groups are hyperfinite to countable nilpotent groups (Schneider and Seward) and to some solvable, non-nilpotent groups (Conley, Jackson, Marks, Seward, and Tucker-Drob). The proofs show an interesting interplay between the properties of the equivalence relations and the combinatorial structure of complete sections in the relation.

Our knowledge of the mathematical universe comes through deduction from axioms. This knowledge is inherently incomplete, and there is a wide range of questions that cannot be decided from the standard axioms. Set theorists have developed and studied additional axioms that allow settling some of these questions. These axioms are broadly divided into two types: Large cardinal axioms, and forcing axioms. The large cardinal axioms form a natural hierarchy ordered by axiomatic strength. Forcing axioms have applications outside set theory. This project involves the development of new forcing axioms primarily meant to deal with questions related to the second uncountable cardinal, methods for applications of these axioms, the theory of large cardinal axioms primarily at the level of strength expected to be connected to the new forcing axioms (the level of supercompact cardinals), and other applications of large cardinal axioms at this strength, primarily to questions of infinitary combinatorics. While there has been a large body of work on forcing axioms related to the first uncountable cardinal, analogous forcing axioms related to the second uncountable cardinal were only discovered recently. Similarly the theory of large cardinal axioms at the level of supercompact cardinals is only now beginning to come into focus. This project will obtain results in these emerging subjects, develop methods that open these subjects to broader research, and aim to apply them to some long standing open problems.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This project deals with several central areas in set theory: (i) forcing axioms and their applications; (ii) inner models theory; and (iii) infinitary combinatorics. Forcing axioms are strengthenings of the Baire category theorem that allow meeting a prescribed number of dense sets with filters in prescribed classes of partial orders. In connection with (i) this project is particularly concerned with higher analogues of the proper forcing axiom (PFA). PFA, developed in the early 1980s, allows meeting aleph_1 dense sets in proper partial orders. It has proved incredibly useful both as a starting point for consistency proofs and as an axiom leading to set theoretic structure theorems. Recent work of the PI shows that there are analogues of PFA which involve meeting more than aleph_1 dense sets. Separately, the PI developed new reflection principles at aleph_2. It is one of the goals of this project to combine the higher analogues of PFA with these reflection principles, and use the new resulting axioms to extend applications of PFA to new contexts. The inner models program has as its main goal the construction of models for large cardinal axioms from assumptions that do not directly involve large cardinals (for example from forcing axioms). In connection with (ii), this project is primarily concerned with the theory of inner models at the level of supercompact cardinals. In connections with (iii) this project is primarily concerned with the tree property, a remnant of large cardinal strength that can consistently hold at small cardinals. One of the goals of the project is to obtain it simultaneously at all successors in increasingly large intervals of cardinals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most famous example is the Continuum Hypothesis, which states that any infinite subset of the real numbers is either countable or in a one-to-one correspondence with the whole set of real numbers. The technique known as forcing can be used to show that the Continuum Hypothesis is logically independent of the standard set of axioms for mathematics, known as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC).  A major theme in modern set theory is development of relative consistency results and ZFC-strengthenings. ZFC-strengthenings are given by large cardinal hypotheses, which assert the existence of certain highly compact mathematical objects, called large cardinals, with strong reflection properties, that is, if a property holds at the large cardinal, it must hold at many cardinals below it. Assuming large cardinals exist, the method of forcing can be used to create various mathematical models.  This project analyzes these constructions, motivated by two complementary notions: what is mathematically necessary? what is mathematically sufficient? The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The main objectives of the project are analyzing what is possible from large cardinals and forcing, versus what constraints are imposed by ZFC. Forcing in the presence of large cardinals is the main tool to create models of ZFC and prove consistency results. In contrast to having large cardinals, Gödel's constructible universe L is the minimal class model of set theory. Two central questions are how much the universe resembles L, and how much compactness can be achieved by forcing. Compactness is the phenomenon where if a certain property holds for every smaller substructure of a given object, then it holds for the object itself. It follows from large cardinals, and often fails in L. Compactness is captured by some key combinatorial principles such as the tree property and its strengthenings. On the other hand, square properties are the canonical instance of incompactness and serve as a yardstick how close a model is to L. The project will focus on the interplay between these principles and forcing extensions constructed from large cardinals. The PI will also investigate how they interact with cardinal arithmetic and especially with singular combinatorics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Distributed computing is the area of computer science that studies distributed systems, i.e., decentralized networks of computers that communicate with each other by passing messages. Distributed computing is especially relevant in the modern era of large networks, such as the Internet, where millions of machines are interconnected. On the other hand, descriptive set theory investigates the structure of subsets of the real line and other well-behaved spaces. It is used to understand the complexity of various sets defined by mathematical formulas and to classify them according to their complexity. Surprisingly, it turns out that these two areas are closely related, and that ideas and results from one can often be applied in the other. As this relationship has only recently been discovered, it is still poorly understood. This project will explore it in depth with the ultimate aim of developing a unified theory that integrates the two subjects. The educational component of this project is focused on creating opportunities for junior researchers to enter this rapidly developing field. Specifically, it will support training of graduate students and designing a suite of materials (textbooks and lecture notes, instructional videos, workshops, and courses) aimed at students and scholars with background in combinatorics or computer science but no prior exposure to descriptive set theory.<br/><br/>Known interactions between descriptive combinatorics and distributed computing take place in the framework of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems, where the objective is to assign labels to the vertices of a given graph subject to some ""local"" constraints. Part of the project is to investigate the following general question: Given an LCL problem that can be solved with some degree of regularity (e.g., Borel, measurable, etc.) on Borel graphs, when can we find an efficient algorithm for this problem in some model of distributed computation? Currently, the answer is only known in a few special cases, and this project aims to extend it to a much wider context. Another goal of this project is to develop an effective classification of the complexity of LCL problems from the perspective of descriptive set theory and distributed computing, or to prove that such classification is impossible. Thirdly, this project will study specific problems of particular interest, such as graph coloring and perfect matchings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A unified implicit computational complexity theory would enable the development of software environments for program derivation and verification, which will assure that the computer programs produced are not only demonstrably correct, but can also be executed within feasible computation time and memory.

Convergence, i.e.             termination of this method produces finitistic proofs of                        combinatorial identities and numerical realizations of provable                 Sigma-zero-one-formulas.  The problem of convergence was treated by             von Neumann (1927) for quantifier-free induction and by Ackermann               (1940) for the system of first-order arithmetic.  The problem for               analysis remained open until very recently, when it was settled by              Mints (1990).  Mints now intends to investigate convergence                     problems for other systems where the problem is still open,                     including the following:  1) predicative analysis and predicatively             reducible systems, 2) stronger subsystems of analysis whose proof-              theoretic ordinal is known, 3) the theory of types, 4) full                     analysis with the axiom of choice, 5) Zermelo set theory and                    possibly stronger systems.                                                           Proof theory examines questions about proofs that lie to one               side of their correctness.  Correctness is understood and taken for             granted.  For example, what axioms are required, all the axioms of              a system or only a proper subset?  Indeed, certain axioms are                   particularly critical in such studies, the necessity of employing               the so-called Axiom of Choice, involving orders of infinity greater             than that of the set of all the positive integers, 1, 2, 3, ...,                being considered particularly interesting.  Other strong axioms of              infinity often play this role too.  In another direction, one can               ask of a proof that shows that something or other exists whether it             provides an explicit recipe for constructing the thing shown to                 exist.  Proofs which do are called ""constructive,"" and others,                  ""non-constructive.""  A particularly intriguing part of proof theory             concerns itself with whether a non-constructive proof can be                    reworked in some automatic way into a constructive one.  It turns               out that the answer depends on the theory being studied.  The                   investigator has shown that a method known as the Hilbert                       substitution method can be used to turn any non-constructive proof              in a certain formulation of analysis into a constructive one by                 essentially turning a crank, and he would like to know if the                   argument he gave can be adapted to obtain the analogous result for              certain other mathematical systems."

This theory provides a general framework for understanding the nature of classification of mathematical objects up to some notion of equivalence, and, due to its broad scope, it has natural interactions with many areas of mathematics. A central place in this theory is occupied by countable Borel equivalence relations (CBERs), which arise via actions of countable groups as well as via locally countable graphs. These connections between equivalence relations, group actions, and graphs create an extremely fruitful interplay between descriptive set theory, ergodic theory, measured group theory, and descriptive graph combinatorics. The overarching goal of the reseach is to deepen the understanding of these connections and further the theory of CBERs having major open questions as guiding targets.<br/><br/>The projects can be grouped into four topics.

The third topic is the existence of desirable subgraphs of graphings of a CBER, e.g., the existence of cost-approximating subgraphings or subtreeings, as well as that of maximal hyperfinite free factors.

The driving idea is contained in the book ""Canonical Ramsey Theory on Polish Spaces"", coauthored by the PI, to appear in 2013. Given a Borel or analytic equivalence relation on a Polish space, is it possible to find a large subset of the space on which the equivalence is as simple as possible? Here, the largeness is to be interpreted in the sense of some sigma-ideal on the space, and the simplicity in the sense of the Borel reducibility rating of complexity of equivalence relations. This question, stated in terms similar to canonical Ramsey theory, uncovers a broad landscape indexed by sigma-ideals and equivalence relations, generalizing such results as the Proemel-Voigt theorem on canonization of smooth equivalence relations on Ramsey cubes, or Blass theorem on canonization of analytic graphs on perfect sets. The overarching general theme is a correspondence between Borel equivalence relations and models of set theory. The applications include nonreducibility results with the strongest possible statements and Silver type theorems for various sigma-ideals encountered in mathematical analysis. The project offers numerous other offshoots as well.<br/><br/>The project follows the general theme of classification of equivalence problems in mathematics. Most areas of mathematics start with a class of objects and a notion of similarity between them. It is often of paramount importance to that branch of mathematics to evaluate the complexity of that notion of similarity. It turns out that there is a natural rating of complexity of such similarity problems that ties together most branches of (infinitary) mathematics. In order to evaluate the complexity correctly within this rating, one needs, among other things, tools for showing that one such notion of similarity is not reducible to another. The project offers a novel way for doing that: certain notions of similarity greatly simplify when one is allowed to restrict attention to a smaller, but still significant, class of objects--while others do not. Results of this type may not have immediate practical applications, but they do help with the understanding of methodology of mathematics. As is typical for this field, they also tie the fabric of mathematics closer together, showing that concerns of one field may reduce to questions solved by another field."

The organizing committee will ensure the representation of graduate students, young researchers, women, and researchers from underrepresented groups. All sessions will host a mix of talks by established specialists on one hand and graduate students and early career mathematicians on the other. Talks will be centered on recent advances and techniques, and the future of the discipline. In keeping with tradition, conference proceedings will be published by the peer-reviewed journal Topology Proceedings. Additionally invited talks will be video recorded and shared online. This way, the latest developments in Topology will be broadly shared.<br/><br/>The conference will consist of six special sessions: Continuum Theory (dedicated to Sam B. Nadler), Dynamical Systems (dedicated to Jim Rogers), Set-Theoretic Topology, Geometric Group Theory, Geometric Topology, and Topology and Computer Science. There will also be a workshop on Topology and Computer Science geared primarily towards graduate students. The Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award winner will be formally announced at the conference, and the recipient will be a plenary speaker.

The most famous example is the Continuum Hypothesis, which states that any infinite subset of the real numbers is either countable or in a one-to-one correspondence with the whole set of real numbers. The technique known as forcing can be used to show that the Continuum Hypothesis is logically independent of the standard set of axioms for mathematics, known as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC).  A major theme in modern set theory is development of relative consistency results and ZFC-strengthenings. ZFC-strengthenings are given by large cardinal hypotheses, which assert the existence of certain highly compact mathematical objects, called large cardinals, with strong reflection properties, that is, if a property holds at the large cardinal, it must hold at many cardinals below it. Assuming large cardinals exist, the method of forcing can be used to create various mathematical models.  This project analyzes these constructions, motivated by two complementary notions: what is mathematically necessary? what is mathematically sufficient? The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The main objectives of the project are analyzing what is possible from large cardinals and forcing, versus what constraints are imposed by ZFC. Forcing in the presence of large cardinals is the main tool to create models of ZFC and prove consistency results. In contrast to having large cardinals, Gödel's constructible universe L is the minimal class model of set theory. Two central questions are how much the universe resembles L, and how much compactness can be achieved by forcing. Compactness is the phenomenon where if a certain property holds for every smaller substructure of a given object, then it holds for the object itself. It follows from large cardinals, and often fails in L. Compactness is captured by some key combinatorial principles such as the tree property and its strengthenings. On the other hand, square properties are the canonical instance of incompactness and serve as a yardstick how close a model is to L. The project will focus on the interplay between these principles and forcing extensions constructed from large cardinals. The PI will also investigate how they interact with cardinal arithmetic and especially with singular combinatorics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This multiverse of equivalent descriptions tends to grow in complexity as the associated objects of study become more complex, and it often becomes very difficult to solve the associated ?classification problem?, i.e., to design an efficient method for telling whether two concrete descriptions correspond to the same object or to two different objects. It is a notoriously hard problem for example to decide whether two different concrete solutions of Einstein?s equations are descriptions of the exact same physical reality and an open problem to find measurable quantities which are invariant under the arbitrary change of coordinates. Invariant descriptive set-theory is an area of mathematical logic which provides a formal framework for measuring the intrinsic complexity of such classification problems and for deciding, in each case, which types of invariants are ?too simple? to be used for a complete classification. It also provides an important link between topological dynamics and the meta-mathematics of classification as best exemplified by Hjorth?s theory of turbulence. Unfortunately, few things are known beyond the point of turbulence. Indeed, dynamical phenomena beyond the point of turbulence reside in groups of symmetries which are neither locally-compact nor non-archimedean, rendering classical methods of harmonic analysis and discrete model theory insufficient. However, a series of recent breakthroughs coming from the work of the PI and others suggest some new strategies for dealing with such dynamics. Through this program we initiate the systematic study of such dynamical phenomena which are ?wilder? than turbulence and which can serve as obstructions to more general forms of classification.<br/><br/>The proposed research program features four independent?yet mutually interacting?projects. The first project addresses the question of whether there exist obstructions to classification by actions of the unitary group of the infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space. In doing so it will examine the connections between the Borel reduction hierarchy and some recent developments in metric model theory regarding the correspondence between stability/NIP and reflexive/Rosenthal representability. The second project focuses on the dynamics of homeomorphism groups. Among others, it addresses the long-standing open problem of whether the homeomorphism group of the interval admits a turbulent action and it proposes some ?higher dimensional? variants of turbulence which could be used as obstructions to classification by actions of homeomorphism groups of n-dimensional compacta. The third project proposes a unified framework for extracting the geometric content of various turbulent phenomena which are associated with dynamics of Banach spaces. The fourth project addresses several questions regarding the dynamics of Polish groups that do not admit two-sided invariant metrics which stem from the recent work of the PI and others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since most mathematical objects can be represented as a structure, its subject matter is very broad and it interacts with several areas of mathematics. However, whereas other fields of mathematics are interested in specific structures, or classes of structures (for instance arithmetic studies the structure of the integers with addition and multiplication), model theory takes a step back and studies structures in general, looking for dividing lines and common properties. It singles out large classes of structures defined by combinatorial tameness conditions (which imply that the structure is in some sense not too complicated) and then attempts to understand the structures in those classes. One such class is that of NIP structures, which can be thought of as structures that have a geometric flavor. This class has received a lot of attention in the past decade. Another class is that of homogeneous structures, which are structures that have a lot of symmetries. Those are objects that belong to combinatorics and have been largely studied outside, or at the border of model theory. The main goal of this project is the investigation of new model-theoretic tools to understand homogeneous structures and in particular those that are NIP. There are few general theorems on homogeneous structures and at the same time no evidence that there cannot be any: we do not know how complicated homogeneous structures can be and this project hopes to shed light on this.<br/><br/>The starting point of this project is the classification of the primitive rank 1 NIP homogeneous structures obtained by the PI. One goal is naturally to generalize this result to all finite rank NIP homogeneous structures. A more long-term goal is the classification of all NIP homogeneous structures. This would require understanding omega-categorical linear orders, which is an interesting project in its own right. A more general goal of the project is the development of model-theoretic tools to study homogeneous structures. This will build on the work mentioned above as well as on a previous work with Itay Kaplan on finitely generated dense subgroups of automorphism groups. Projects include finding model-theoretic consequences of the Ramsey property and clarifying its link with distality, finding necessary and sufficient conditions for admitting homogeneous expansions with nice properties (including having a stationary or canonical independence relation, being linearly ordered, Ramsey etc.). Finally, a more speculative project is the understanding of random-like behaviors in homogeneous structures and finding ways to measure the complexity of homogeneous structures, in particular those that lie outside the usual model-theoretic tame classes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Broadly speaking, mathematical logic is the formal study of mathematical language and its meaning.  For example, the assertion ""between every two numbers, there is a third"" changes meaning depending on which ambient universe of ""numbers"" (integers, fractions, etc.) one is referring to.  Categorical logic provides tools for constructing a ""universal abstract universe"" in which the interpretation of mathematical statements captures their meanings in all possible ""real"" universes at once.  Descriptive set theory provides tools for classifying all such possible ""real"" universes, or in certain cases, proving that no such classification exists.  Recent work has pointed toward a deep connection between these two historically disparate subfields of logic, and this project aims to further develop this connection.<br/><br/>In this project the PI studies categorical logic and descriptive set theory as dual ""syntactic"" and ""semantic"" representations of infinitary propositional and first-order logic.  In the propositional setting, a long line of work points to locale theory (""point-free topology"") as an uncountable generalization of classical descriptive set theory in Polish and standard Borel spaces, and this project aims to extend this analogy by developing localic counterparts of more advanced classical techniques, such as projective sets, effective descriptive set theory, and forcing.  In the first-order setting, recent work by the PI has shown that the Joyal-Tierney representation theorem for toposes yields a duality between theories in infinitary first-order logic and their standard Borel groupoids of countable models.  This project aims to extend this duality to continuous logic for metric structures, which will involve first developing the foundations for a metric analog of topos theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because the notion of a set is among the most primitive in mathematics, it was used as the basic fabric with which to build the more complicated objects of mathematics. Since that time, it has been realized that the properties of infinite sets are themselves quite subtle and defy a complete axiomatization. Moreover, these set-theoretic complexities sometimes manifest themselves in more complex mathematical structures, such as those studied in algebra, analysis, and geometry. The aim of this project is to further develop both our understanding of set-theoretic methods and also how they can be applied to problems arising in fields of mathematics such as algebra, analysis, and topology. While the project involves several lines of investigation, a central theme will be to develop a deeper understanding of the structure of the algebra of all piece-wise linear functions from the unit interval to itself using the lens of transfinite ordinal numbers, compactness, and large cardinals. This project includes the training of graduate students. <br/><br/>The first part of the research project involves using set-theoretic tools to study groups of piecewise linear and piecewise projective homemorphisms.  This includes attempting to prove the following conjecture of Matthew Brin and Mark Sapir: if G is a group of piece-wise linear homeomorphims of the unit interval, then either G is  elementary amenable or else G contains an isomorphic copy of Richard Thompson's group F. It is the PI's thesis that not only is this conjecture true, but that it will be a consequence of a much finer analysis of subgroup structure of PLoI, the group of piece-wise linear homeomophisms of the unit interval. This analysis is expected to have other consequences: that the finitely generated subgroups of F are well quasi-ordered by embeddability; that any finitely presented subgroup of PLoI is either abelian or contains a copy of F; that Peano Arithmetic does not prove that F is amenable. Central to the analysis will be the countable transfinite ordinals.  This part of the research project also concerns use of set-theoretic tools such as compactness and the algebra of elementary embeddings to study the amenability problem for F.  The second part of the research project concerns further developing techniques in pure and applied set theory: methods for studying the vanishing of higher derived limits in homological algebra; the role that Jensen's diamond principle plays in the theory of the sets of hereditary cardinality at most aleph1.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ramsey theory is the study of finding canonical structures within a given class of structures.  Topological Ramsey spaces are topological spaces in which every subset X which has the property of Baire is Ramsey: every non-empty open set in the space contains a non-empty open subset which is either contained in or disjoint from X.  Such spaces unify a large body of results in Ramsey theory, including the theorems of Carlson-Simpson, Galvin-Prikry, Gowers, Graham-Rothschild, Milliken, and others.  Recent progress in the theory of topological Ramsey spaces due to Dobrinen and Todorcevic has proved useful in solving problems in Set Theory regarding the precise analysis of the difference between the Tukey and Rudin-Keisler reducibility notions.  Tukey reducibility, a weakening of Rudin-Keisler reducibility, is of high interest for its ability to classify ordered structures which defy classification by other means.  This research program seeks to develop a general framework for canonical equivalence relations on topological Ramsey spaces and provide a unifying theory for ultrafilters satisfying some weak partition property.  These new Ramsey theorems will be applied to classify the Tukey types of ultrafilters with partition properties.  Methods developed are intended to solve some long-standing problems in Ramsey theory.  Further, this research program aims to establish the full Tukey structure of ultrafilters and find the model-theoretic implications which Tukey ordering has for ultrapowers.<br/> <br/>A main driving force in mathematics is finding simplicity within seeming chaos.  Ramsey theory is the study of finding simple, canonical structures from within a maelstrom.  Tukey order is a useful means of classifying strengths of objects, thereby simplifying a morass of objects by grouping together all objects with the same strength.  Ultrafilters are of interest in many areas of mathematics, as they are used for constructing mathematical structures and models of mathematical theories.  In particular, ultrafilters are fundamental to mathematics, and Tukey order gives a good notion of the strength of an ultrafilter.  This project aims to develop methods which will solve long-standing open problems in Ramsey theory while significantly improving our knowledge of Tukey Order and Set Theory.  Being interdisciplinary and focused on fundamental problems, this project is expected to have high impact on several fields of mathematical."

The first meeting will take place August 6-10, 2008, at the University of Denver.  The PI's are Natasha Dobrinen and  Nikolaos Galatos.<br/><br/><br/>The meeting is to rotate on a yearly basis between the following universities: New Mexico State University - Las Cruces, University of Colorado - Boulder, University of Denver, University of Kansas - Lawrence, University of Missouri - Kansas City, and University of Nebraska - Omaha.  The researchers at these universities, who form the Core Group of BLAST and who will be in turn organizing future BLAST meetings, are the following:  Richard Ball, Guram Bezhanishvili,  Natasha Dobrinen,  William Fleissner,  Nikolaos Galatos,  Eric Hall,  John Harding, Keith Kearnes,  Richard Laver, Donald Monk,  Jack Porter, Judith Roitman,  Andrzej Roslanowski, and Agnes Szendrei.<br/><br/> <br/>The conference will focus on the areas of logic in which the above researchers work: Boolean Algebra, Logic/Lattice Theory, Universal Algebra/Algebraic Logic, Set Theory, Set-theoretic Topology; thus the name BLAST.  Together, these areas form a cohesive sub-unit of logic and have strong connections with other mathematical disciplines such as Algebra, Combinatorics,  General Topology, and Mathematical Physics.  Some combinations of these areas, such as Boolean Algebra/Set Theory/Set-theoretic Topology or Algebraic Logic/Lattice Theory/Universal Algebra, have  well-established histories of drawing from and propelling each other.  More recently, applications of Set Theory to Algebraic Logic have proven fruitful.  BLAST will provide a forum for furthering research in these interdisciplinary combinations, and for developing more cross-pollination between other pairs of the research areas of BLAST.  In addition to this, the goals of BLAST include building and strengthening collaborations between Core Group members and other researchers from around the world, inviting at least one specialist from each of the six fields to give a plenary talk, and providing  a venue for graduate students and young researchers to showcase their work, interact with leading researchers, and provide exposure to other areas of logic early in their careers.<br/><br/><br/>The BLAST 2008 program includes 9 invited speakers, 4 tutorials, and 30-60 contributed talks.

One of the central goals of this investigation is to achieve a better understanding of the geometric consequences of the non-definability of the set of integers on the definability of fractals. Towards this goal, we will apply methods from real analysis, geometric measure theory and model theory, some of which have not yet been used in the study of expansions of the real field. The insights of this research are not only important in the fundamental study of tameness in ordered fields, but should also prove useful to questions in control theory and real-analytic geometry.<br/><br/>The study of o-minimal geometry, a branch of mathematical logic, can be considered as a framework for studying tame geometric objects. In the last two decades researchers proved that many classical phenomena from real-analytic geometry fall into the framework of o-minimality. This has led to advances not only in geometry, but also in other branches of mathematics like Lie theory and number theory, and in such diverse fields as general equilibrium theory in economics and neural networks in computer science. Unfortunately, o-minimality can only be used to model phenomena that are at least locally finite (more precisely, locally having only finitely many connected components). Many natural geometric objects like spirals or fractals do not have this finiteness property and hence the known techniques are unapplicable to such an object. Hieronymi aims to overcome this limitation by studying tameness even outside the setting of local finiteness."

(2) Applications of set theory, especially   in the theory of abelian groups. (3) Semantics of linear logic, especially   game semantics and its variants. (4) Logic of topoi, particularly the   logical properties of geometric morphisms.  The research project of Glen   Whitney concerns interpreting general recursive definitions, especially in   non-determinisitic and concurrent contexts.  Specific questions include:   (1) Finding a universal class of structures with a recursion operation, so   that every structure will be contained in one from this class. (2)   Comparing proposals for the semantics of concurrent programming languages.   (3) Seeking connections with fixpoint logics used in finite model theory.   (4) Extending the current theory to allow more detailed modelings of   parameter and message passing between subprograms.          Both the formal language of recursion FLR, which Whitney will  study, and Girard's linear logic LL, one of Blass' research topics, can   serve as mathematical models of certain aspects of computing.  FLR models   recursion, i.e., programs using subroutines identical to the programs   themselves.  Whitney's project is directed toward improved understanding of   recursion in the context of parallel computing, i.e. computations done   collaboratively by many machines operating simultaneously.  LL models data  types; its game semantics models the situation where accessing data   involves more of an interaction (access protocol) between the provider and  the user of the data than mere transmission of data.  Both theories are  currently at the stage of mathematical exploration, but it is hoped that  the information obtained w ill be of use in the design of future programming  languages and in the formal verification of correctness of programs.   Cardinal characteristics of the continuum are a way to exhibit and clarify  the combinatorial content of difficult problems from various areas of  mathematics -- originally topology and analysis, more recently algebra as  well.  They provide connections between these different areas and thus  allow progress on a problem in one area to be applied in another.  In  addition, they make these problems amenable to treatment by the methods of  modern set theory.  The final topic in Blass' proposed research, topos  theory, also serves to connect apparently disparate areas, mostly within  mathematical logic.  The particular topic of geometric morphisms of topoi  combines ideas from set theory, from information systems (introduced as a  model of computation), from sheaf theory (a part of topology), and from  constructive logic.  ***"

This applies especially in cases where these relations are Borel sets. Part of the planned research concerns the question ""Which cardinal characteristics are associated with Borel relations?""  For many characteristics the answer is known to be positive; for others it appears to be negative, but it isn't yet known to be negative for any particular characteristic.  The investigator hopes to close this gap by proving that certain specific characteristics are not associated with Borel relations.  A second aspect of the planned research concerns the sequential composition of relations, which occurs in many theorems and proofs about cardinal characteristics.  A priori, sequential compositions cannot be Borel relations, but the investigator intends to extend the theory of Borel relations, using tools from topos theory, so as to cover sequential composition.  The research also includes questions relating computability theory to cardinal characteristics.  Finally, the investigator also plans to study the use of the groupwise density number (a characteristic introduced some years ago by Laflamme and the investigator) in partition theorems.<br/><br/>Cardinal characteristics of the continuum constitute a significant area of contemporary research in set theory. Not only are they of interest for their own sake, but for the last two decades they have played a role in applications of set-theoretic methods to general topology.  More recently, there have been applications (including some due to the investigator) to other parts of mathematics, particularly algebra.  The investigator and graduate students will extend this theory in several directions.  One direction concerns connections with classical descriptive set theory, dealing with relatively easily definable relations involving real numbers.  A second direction connects this theory with recursion theory, the study of what is (and what is not) computable in principle.

In a<br/>similar manner, other parts of the project feature interactions of<br/>descriptive set theory, model theory, topological dynamics, and<br/>combinatorics in the study of extreme amenability, Borel equivalence<br/>relations, and algebraic properties of isometry groups.

In the project Rosendal will investigate both algebraic and topological properties of these groups, such as the small index property, the Bergman property, phenomena of automatic continuity of homomorphisms and extreme amenability. The main problems investigated are to a great extent motivated by the model theoretical problem of reconstructing a countable structure from its group of automorphisms. One of the principal tools used in this connection is the automatic continuity of isomorphisms of automorphism groups, which motivated the study of the broader phenomenon of automatic continuity of arbitrary homomorphisms between classes of Polish groups. Rosendal also plans to apply these ideas to study the topological dynamics of uncountable discrete groups most notably in connection with the fixed point on metric compacta property. The study of Polish groups using the very diverse methods of several fields seems likely to promote the further integration of separate knowledge and deeper understanding of the objects considered.<br/>In a separate project, Rosendal intends to continue his work with V. Ferenczi on a question of G. Godefroy concerning the number of non-isomorphic subspaces of a non-Hilbertian Banach space. The methods that have proven useful at this moment have been highly set theoretical in nature and have reduced the problem to the case of minimal spaces. Probably more analytical tools will be of greater utility for the next steps. In connection with this, Rosendal plans to revisit Gowers' determinacy theorem and by using set theoretical tools extend its applications beyond its nominal reach of analytic sets. This should provide tools in Banach space theory not obtainable by classical geometric considerations.  <br/>Also Rosendal will pursue another ongoing project with B.D. Miller of classifying Borel transformations up to a descriptive notion of Kakutani equivalence. This is a completely parallel project to the theory of Kakutani equivalence in ergodic theory, but due to the nature of the objects, the methods used are completely descriptive set theoretical and go back to works of Glimm and Effros in operator algebra. <br/>By stressing the interconnections of mathematical logic with other domains of mathematics, Rosendal hopes to enrich both logic itself and provide new insight into objects outside of mathematical logic. The main applications of his research will be in functional analysis (Banach space theory), topological groups, and ergodic theory."

More specifically, the proposed research will develop the emerging field of Computable Stability Theory, where the methods of stability theory plays a key role is the study of effective properties of first order theories. Stability theory is the part of model theory which focuses on the underlying geometrical or structural nature of the mathematical objects. Generally speaking, the more underlying structure the mathematical object respects, the easier it is to compute information about the object. This forms a back-and-forth relationship between stability and computability, and this interplay is the focus of Computable Stability Theory. Questions arising from Computable Stability Theory lead to new questions in classical model theory as well as computability, which sheds light on both subjects. Among these questions is when quantifier elimination to some level can be derived from geometrical properties.<br/><br/>Computable Stability Theory endeavors to explore the basic statement that ""structurally simple objects ought to be easier to compute."" Model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, offers tools to analyze structural simplicity by studying objects in the context of their first order language. The understanding of the language associated to an object or class of objects can often be translated to a deeper understanding of the objects themselves. Computability theory studies questions of computation and relative computation with regard to mathematical objects. By combining tools from both fields, Andrews will examine the question of when structural simplicity does and when it does not translate into computational simplicity."

In spite of the dramatic effect the discovery of infinite  cardinals had on mathematics, some of the simplest questions regarding  their arithmetic remained unanswered, such as how large the continuum is.  The answer finally obtained to this question, by Godel and Cohen, was that  the cardinalities of powers of regular cardinals, in particular that of the  continuum, are independent of ZFC. The chaotic world-view which emerged  after Cohen's and Easton's independence results was challenged some years  later by Silver's theorem about powers of singulars, and eventually by  Shelah's work on cardinal arithmetic, which restored a dimension of order  and regularity to the arithmetic of singular cardinals.     The current project employs  set theoretic methods, especially those infinite combinatorics discovered in the context of cardinal arithmetic, to study a variety   of phenomena in infinite mathematical structures, such as embeddability and homogeneity.  Infinite sets come in different ""sizes"", called  cardinals: for example,  the whole numbers and the real numbers are both infinite but the set of  real numbers has the greater cardinal.   Infinite cardinals have their own  arithmetic; one can add, multiply and take powers, as with ordinary arithmetic. Research in the arithmetic of cardinals led to the development of Axiomatic Set   Theory, which in turn has provided a  foundations for mathematics.  There are two kinds of infinite cardinals, Regular and Singular. The arithmetic of  Regular cardinals was studied first and shown to be chaotic.  The arithmetic of Singular cardinals turns   out to be better behaved.  In recent years a coherent theory has developed, called   ""pcf theory"" by its inventor, Saharon Shelah, bringing some order to the realm of cardinal arithmetic, order  which was conspicuous in its absence for almost a century. This project employs pcf theory to discover patterns and interrelations among other infinite mathematical structures, in order to classify these structures according to complexity, generality, and various symmetry properties."

The PI's research is in three areas. It is well known that almost all of the basic notions of first-order model theory are absolute, i.e., their interpretation does not change depending on the model of set theory one is working in. The situation is known to be much more complicated for similar concepts in infinitary languages, where even simple concepts such as categoricity in power  can fail to be absolute, even for cardinal preserving forcings.   A few years ago, it was noted that if one places extremely strong stability theoretic conditions on a theory, then these conditions limit the quantifier complexity of  the elementary diagram of any model of the theory.  These bounds immediately give upper bounds  on the computable complexity of definable subsets of such a theory.  The model theoretic notion of definability of types over finite sets is intimately related to the notion of a compression scheme in computational learning theory.  This connection has beein fruitful in both directions. A number of examples of concept classes that posess compression schemes have been identified, and conversely this connection has led to a deeper model theoretic understanding of dependent theories.<br/><br/>Model theory is concerned with the interplay between theories, i.e., sets of sentences in a very formal language, and the classes of algebraic structures (models) that satisfy these sentences.  There is a well established taxonomy of theories, which is based on the embeddability or non-embeddability of certain configurations of elements into models of the theory. Laskowski has identified certain classes of theories that have direct connections to limitations on data compression and computational learning theory, and will continue his examination of these theories."

The first three problems are connected with extending and generalizing Shelah's dichotomy theorem.  Specifically, the PI proposes to study the possible types of branching that can occur in decomposition trees of models of classifiable theories, inherent limitations on extending Shelah's theorem to uncountable languages, and those theories whose models are characterized by systems of invariants involving finite subsets of the model.  The first of these problems emanated from the completion of the classification of the uncountable spectra of countable theories.  The last two problems deal with new methods of constructing models that are reminiscent of forcing constructions.  In work with Shelah, the PI defined  two new methods of constructing models of small, stable theories with a type of infinite multiplicity, one based on choosing realizations of the type with positive measure and the other based on choosing non-meager realizations.  Whereas the notions of measure and category typically go hand in hand throughout mathematics, there is an essential asymmetry between the notions in this context.  The final problem is to investigate the feasibility of obtaining an o-minimal expansion of the reals containing a function whose growth rate exceeds any exponential polynomial.  It seems possible that by using new results of Wilkie and Macintyre, such an expansion could be constructed in the manner of Cohen forcing.    As the term is used here, ""model theory"" is essentially the systematic study of algebraic structures.  A theory is simply a set of sentences and its class of models consists of the possible universes in which each of the sentences of the theory is true. It turns out that if one asks rather general questions about the class of models of a theory (such as the number of models of a certain size) the answer depends only on a small set of combinations of elements.

The conference generally attracts 150-200 participants from the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and, increasingly, from Europe, Asia, and even New Zealand. The conference allows participants to interact with a large number of active topologists, both within and outside their specialties.  The conference has expanded to encompass most of the major branches of topology, as well as dynamical systems, and now includes sessions in set theoretic/general topology, continuum theory, dynamical systems, geometric topology, and geometric group theory. <br/> <br/>This grant will support travel for the 18 plenary/semi-plenary speakers and for graduate students and younger researchers who lack institutional support for travel.  Participants in the sessions come from a broad range of institutions from small liberal arts colleges to research universities, and range from graduate students to senior researchers.  Most participants do not have colleagues in their home departments with research interests close to their own. They rely on this conference to keep up with recent work in topology and dynamical systems, meet with colleagues who do have research interests close to their own, and present what they themselves have been able to contribute.

We also plan to explore the problem of conjugacies of such    systems, to study random systems and invariant continua for attractors and    repellors. In the second section we plan to deal with the phase transitions of    pressure on Julia sets and integral means of Riemann maps of a simply connected    basin of attraction to a periodic stable point or rationally indifferent    periodic point. We intend to provide appropriate definitions of pressure, to    establish relations between pressure and integral means and to investigate the    phenomenon of phase transitions by means of dynamical systems and thermodynamic    formalism.

In particular we are interested in the    asymptotic behavior of of iterates of the Perron-Frobenius operator and the    sequence of random variables generated by Holder continuous functions.    In the last section we propose to deal with geometry and dynamics of   rational functions with no recurrent critical points in the Julia sets       and Collet-Eckmann maps, exploring the problems of Hausdorff and box         dimension and the influence of critical points on finiteness of              sigma-finite invariant measures.

Broadly speaking, mathematical logic is the formal study of mathematical language and its meaning.  For example, the assertion ""between every two numbers, there is a third"" changes meaning depending on which ambient universe of ""numbers"" (integers, fractions, etc.) one is referring to.  Categorical logic provides tools for constructing a ""universal abstract universe"" in which the interpretation of mathematical statements captures their meanings in all possible ""real"" universes at once.  Descriptive set theory provides tools for classifying all such possible ""real"" universes, or in certain cases, proving that no such classification exists.  Recent work has pointed toward a deep connection between these two historically disparate subfields of logic, and this project aims to further develop this connection.<br/><br/>In this project the PI studies categorical logic and descriptive set theory as dual ""syntactic"" and ""semantic"" representations of infinitary propositional and first-order logic.  In the propositional setting, a long line of work points to locale theory (""point-free topology"") as an uncountable generalization of classical descriptive set theory in Polish and standard Borel spaces, and this project aims to extend this analogy by developing localic counterparts of more advanced classical techniques, such as projective sets, effective descriptive set theory, and forcing.  In the first-order setting, recent work by the PI has shown that the Joyal-Tierney representation theorem for toposes yields a duality between theories in infinitary first-order logic and their standard Borel groupoids of countable models.  This project aims to extend this duality to continuous logic for metric structures, which will involve first developing the foundations for a metric analog of topos theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project in the foundations of mathematics investigates the effective, and more generally definable, aspects of Diophantine approximation, the meta-mathematical status of familiar theorems in countable combinatorics, and the pure structure theory of relative definability. <br/><br/>One can view classical theorems in Diophantine approximation, such as Borel's almost-every real number is absolutely normal or Roth's every irrational algebraic number has irrationality exponent 2, as asserting properties of real numbers in terms of our descriptions of them. Borel's theorem asserts a property of expansions by integer bases, and Roth's theorem asserts a property of approximation by rational numbers. There is a natural affinity between this tradition in number theory and the study of definability in recursion theory. This research project will investigate the connections between these areas. For example, what is the exact relationship between the irrationality exponent of a real number, or more generally its Mahler transcendence measures, and the Kolmogorov complexity of the initial segments of its binary expansion? Second, a real number is absolutely normal if for every integer base b, each digit appears with asymptotic frequency 1/b. What other patterns of asymptotic frequencies are possible?

Areas of mathematics with physical applications tend to appear in the low levels of the corresponding complexity hierarchy. Passing to higher levels of complexity enables mathematicians to make connections between different areas of mathematics, and to develop productive general theories. There is a corresponding division of the universe of mathematics into an absolute part, where natural questions tend to be resolved by the standard axioms, and a more abstract part where extensions of the standard axiom system are needed to resolve many fundamental questions. The main focus of Larson's research is the relationship between these parts. The technical machinery involved in this project includes Cohen's forcing technique, axioms asserting the existence of winning strategies in infinite games, and axioms asserting the existence of infinite objects whose existence cannot be proved from the standard axioms for mathematics. These techniques originate in set theory, which serves as the most commonly accepted foundations for mathematics. Larson's work applies them to other areas, including model theory, topology and analysis. Larson hopes to make progress with this approach on several longstanding well-known open problems.<br/><br/>One aspect of Larson's work concerns forcing over models of determinacy to produce canonical models. Woodin's Pmax forcing, when applied to a model of determinacy, produces a model which is maximal for subsets of the set of countable ordinals. One project, initiated by Woodin, and continued by Larson in collaboration with other researchers, is the extent to which this maximality can be made to hold for larger cardinals. Another product, largely in collaboration with Jindrich Zapletal, converts a number of classical ZFC constructions into partial orders, which when applied to determinacy models produce models of fragments of the Axiom of Choice. This approach has resolved a number of classical questions about the relationship between forms of the Axiom of Choice, but may also be able to shine light on newer problems in the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Other aspects of the project include a new approach to Vaught's Conjecture, one of the oldest problems in model theory, and the study of the notion of universally measurability, a fundamental concept from analysis which is still not well understood. Finally, Larson is working on a book on unpublished work of W.H. Woodin, on extensions of the Axiom of Determinacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it turns out that there are natural and important mathematical theories that cannot be decided within ZFC alone. The Large Cardinal Axioms (LCAs) are extensions of ZFC designed to settle all such theories. Thus LCAs pursue Godel's program in set theory. How can one test for ""correctness"" of an LCA? The inner model program, a major program in modern set theory, justifies correctness by constructing canonical models for LCAs much like the natural numbers are the canonical model for the Peano Axioms of arithmetic (PA) (and as such PA is a correct theory). This research project contributes to the inner model program by advancing methods for constructing canonical models for LCAs from various extensions of ZFC. <br/><br/>The project focuses on studying the connections between inner models, sets of reals, hybrid structures (such as hereditarily ordinal definable sets (HOD) of determinacy models), forcing, and strong combinatorial principles (such as the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA), (generalizations of) the tree property, the Unique Branch Hypothesis (UBH)). This research project aims to advance the basic theory of hybrid structures, as well as developing methods for the core model induction beyond its current state. In particular, the project aims to make advancements in answering two fundamental questions in descriptive inner model theory: (1) Is HOD of a determinacy model fine-structural (e.g. do the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) and various square principles hold in HOD)? (2) What is the consistency strength of PFA?"

Many dynamical systems, while completely determinate, appear to have elements of random behavior. This phenomenon can be described explicitly when there is a time-invariant probability measure on the system.  Such a description could state that the system is measure theoretically isomorphic to a particular known process, such as a Bernoulli process. From this point of view it is natural to try to attempt to classify dynamical systems measure-theoretically. The hope would be to have a ""library"" of possible measure preserving systems and be able to describe an arbitrary system measure theoretically as one in the library.<br/>This project, while very successful in its early stages, runs into insuperable obstacles for deep logical reasons. Foreman's previous work with his co-authors showed that the isomorphism problem for ergodic measure preserving systems is inherently too complex from a logical point of view to admit a classification. Foreman's proposed work involves extending these anti-classification results to differentiable systems on compact manifolds and to identify those  systems for which the isomorphism problem is tractable.<br/><br/>Many natural systems evolve over time according to definite rules. Much of science involves discovering these rules and describing them, perhaps by a system of equations. These rules discuss how individual points in a system behave, and are often completely deterministic. However, what can be actually observed (for example due to round-off error) in these systems are sets  of points. At this level the qualitative behavior of a dynamical system can be apparently random. This led to the project of classifying<br/>the possible behavior statistically so that the   qualitative behavior of<br/>natural systems could be catalogued. There were many successes in the program in its early stages. Recently however, it turns out that there are reasons related to mathematical logic that the program cannot, in principle, work. Foreman's proposed research explores extending the impossibility results to concrete settings and finding large collections of systems for which there are good classifications of their statistical behavior.<br/><br/><br/>"

It<br/>consists of four parts that are connected through methods of<br/>research. The first part is devoted to the analysis of the internal<br/>structure and combinatorial properties of extender models, an area<br/>of research launched by Jensen in the late 60's; the emphasis here<br/>is on extending the methods recently developed by Schimmerling and<br/>Zeman, and creating a ""catalogue"" of such methods with broad<br/>applicability. The second area focuses on optimal forcing<br/>constructions in infinite combinatorics. A typical question in<br/>this category is obtaining the exact consistency strength for<br/>the failure of Jensen's principle ""square"" at a singular cardinal.<br/>Although the emphasis here is on developing new forcing methods,<br/>inner model theory (even at its current state of development)<br/>provides large cardinal axioms that are likely candidates for the<br/>consistency strengths in question. The third area comprises<br/>applications of inner models in establishing lower bounds for<br/>consistency strengths at large cardinal levels below one Woodin<br/>cardinal, as well as applications in descriptive set theory<br/>related to correctness of canonical inner models and inner model<br/>theoretic characterizations of descriptive set theoretic objects.<br/>The last area focuses on the theory of inner models; the main<br/>objective here is to make a progress on extender models matching<br/>higher levels of the large cardinal hierarchy, as well as<br/>exploring possibilities for constructions of the core model below<br/>one Woodin cardinal with no background large cardinal assumption<br/>on the set-theoretic universe.<br/><br/>Set theory can be viewed as a mathematical theory that formalizes the<br/>methods currently accepted as valid working methods in mathematics.<br/>It is based on the so-called Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms that describe<br/>basic mathematical constructions. The developments in mathematics<br/>in the twentieth century brought the entire subject to a new stage:<br/>It turns out that there are more and more natural questions answers<br/>of which are sensitive to the background axioms, that is to the axioms<br/>of set theory. Such questions arise even in classical disciplines like<br/>algebra or analysis. They cannot be decided from Zermelo-Fraenkel<br/>axioms alone. In order to decide such questions, it is necessary<br/>to augment the axiomatic system by additional axioms; such axioms<br/>are usually formulated in the language of infinitary combinatorics.<br/>This has to be done in a manner that will not introduce an<br/>inconsistency of the augmented axiomatic system. In some cases,<br/>the consistency of the augmented system (relative to the<br/>Zermelo-Fraenkel system) can be proved using methods formalizable<br/>in the Zermelo-Fraenkel system itself. However, there is an entire<br/>hierarchy of axioms, the so-called large cardinal axioms, which do not<br/>allow this. It is believed that every mathematical statement that is not<br/>decidable from the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms alone -- or at least the<br/>consistency of such a statement -- can be decided using the right large<br/>cardinal axiom. The mathematical praxis provides a lot of support for<br/>this belief. Thus, the large cardinal hierarchy constitutes a kind of<br/>a ""scale"" that ""measures"" the complexity of mathematical statements, and<br/>each such statement has an exact match on this scale. The large<br/>cardinal axiom, that together with Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms provides<br/>the very piece of information necessary and sufficient to decide the<br/>(consistency of) the statement, is called the consistency<br/>strength of the statement. Expressed informally: By determining the<br/>consistency strengths, set theory is able to isolate the precise amount<br/>of information that that has to be used along with the standard<br/>mathematical methods in order to decide certain mathematical questions.<br/>Inner model theory, forcing, descriptive set theory, and infinitary<br/>combinatorics constitute crucial tools for this task.<br/><br/>"

The second is the use of descriptive set theory to provide new invariants for studying objects of interest to ergodic theory.  The main thrust is to be able to classify the complexity of various classes of transformations with the hope of being able to distinguish between previously indistinguishable classes (e.g one may be Borel and the other true analytic.) An example of an important problem that may yield to such a technique is to show that there is an ergodic, finite entropy, measure preserving transformation that is not isomorphic to a smooth measure preserving transformation on a compact manifold. <br/><br/>This work is in the Foundations of Mathematics:  how mathematics fits together and why it works.  These studies often involve consideration of problems that are not solvable by the usual assumptions of mathematics:  The Zermelo-Frankel Axioms with the Axiom of Choice.  Methods to be used imclude generic large cardinals, or symmetries of the mathematical universe that reveal powerful regularities that often solve intractable problems.  Considerations arising from studies of the foundations of mathematics have led to classifications of problems based on their inherent complexity.  These measures of complexity, in turn, can be applied to natural problems in dynamical systems and ergodic theory, as will be pursued in this project.<br/><br/>"

Morley rank, a 30-year-old concept due to Michael Morley,   measures in some sense the complexity of the structure.  In a structure of   finite Morley rank, certain subsets (the so-called definable subsets) are   endowed with a natural number, and these natural numbers behave like the  ""dimension"" of the set to which they are attached.  For example, every  variety over an algebraically closed field is a structure of finite Morley  rank. In particular, every algebraic group over an algebraically closed field  is a group of finite Morley rank.  The Cherlin-Zil'ber conjecture states a   partial converse: A simple group of finite Morley rank is an algebraic   group over an algebraically closed field.  If true, the conjecture will show   that the concept of algebraic group is independent of the base field when   the latter is known to be algebraically closed: just a concept of dimension   satisfying certain simple axioms is enough to insure that a simple group is   an algebraic group, i.e., a geometric object.  Apart from its use in model   theory, this almost philosophical (even metaphysical!) consequence of the   conjecture suffices to make the subject worthwhile.  If the conjecture is   false, it will give rise to new groups that are not algebraic but that  look very much like both infinite algebraic and finite groups.  Nesin's   research is a fundamental part of the program of showing the   Cherlin-Zil'ber conjecture.       The primary purpose of mathematics is the understanding of  geometry and natural numbers.  Algebra was invented to understand better the   nature of geometry and numbers.  The concept of dimension is, of course, very   important in geometry; in general, any geometric object has dimension.  One   can ask the reverse problem: suppose each object in a class has a   dimension and that these dimensions behave well, i.e. they satisfy some   natural axioms.  Is it then true that th ese objects are geometric?  The work   of Nesin concerns this problem in a particular setting.  His objects are   groups.  His research is part of a large project whose goal is to show that   groups on which a certain concept of dimension is defined are groups of   transformations of a geometric object.  ***"

A crucial idea in this area, first developed in the 1970s by Shelah, is the notion of a dividing line. A dividing line can be thought of as a structural dichotomy within a certain class of mathematical objects.  Many of the most important dividing lines correspond to local combinatorial properties which have significant implications for global structure.  In the infinite setting, model theorists have had great success using dividing lines to classify examples and generalize their behavior. However, extensions into the finite setting have been limited, largely due to the failure there of crucial infinitary tools.  On the other hand, extremal and arithmetic combinatorics are fields which focus on the finite setting, but which study many of the same themes as model theory, such as local versus global structure and the interplay of structure and randomness.  These fields have developed finitary questions and tools which are new to model theory, but which have have deep connections to model theoretic ideas.  The goal of this project is to extend the study of model theoretic dividing lines in the finite setting by solving finitary problems from extremal and additive combinatorics which address these shared themes.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project will focus on finding local model theoretic conditions which have robust implications for bounds and growth rates in theorems from additive and extremal combinatorics.  This will be accomplished in two main directions.  The first will focus on questions from additive combinatorics.  Here a main goal will be to identify structural dichotomies for subsets of high-dimensional vector spaces over prime fields. For instance, what kinds of sets are most ""tame'', as measured through improved bounds in structural decomposition theorems?  Can the ""tame'' sets be characterized by local combinatorial configurations?  The second direction will address questions in extremal combinatorics.  Specifically, the PI will continue work on enumeration and extremal problems for hereditary properties in finite relational languages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The 2013 Shanks Lecturer will be the Fields Medalist  Vladimir Voevodsky (Institute for Advanced Studies), who will deliver two lectures on his work on univalent foundations of mathematics. The conference proper will be preceded by a four-day summer school. The scientific program of the combined events will include -- in addition to the Shanks Lectures -- invited lectures, training tutorials and contributed talks (standard and featured/selected).<br/><br/>The conference is of interdisciplinary nature and brings together a number of areas contributing to the study of logic, via semantic and syntactic methods. TACL allows for interaction between methodologies from different areas of mathematics (including Topology, Algebra and Category Theory) and the formation of hybrid approaches (for example, Algebraic Proof Theory). At the same time, via the study of classical<br/>and non-classical logics, the conference allows the investigation of the applicability of logic to diverse disciplines ranging from classical algebra, to constructive mathematics and analysis, topology, geometry, theoretical computer science, mathematical linguistics and philosophy.<br/><br/>The combined event will be publicized  widely. Due to the high quality of the planed scientific program, upwards of 120 mathematicians, logicians and computer scientists are expected to participate. This proposal supports attendance by principal speakers and other participants, particularly targeting those without other sources of support, early career researchers, women, disabled persons and minorities. <br/><br/>Information about the combined events can be found at the conference website:<br/>http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~tacl2013/"

Is the class of finite algebras<br/>possessing a finite equational basis recursively enumerable?  Is the<br/>class of finite algebras generating a residually large variety<br/>recursively enumerable?  Additionally, he will work toward a complete<br/>determination of all finitely generated varieties that possess<br/>definable principal congruences.  Farley is working productively on a<br/>large variety of problems in duality theory and combinatorics of<br/>ordered sets.  Most significant is the conjecture that all perfect<br/>sequences of a chain-complete ordered set converge to the same<br/>``core,'' up to isomorphism, and, closely related, the conjecture that<br/>the fixed-point property is preserved under direct products of<br/>(unrestricted) ordered sets.

It is expected to attract upwards of 150 mathematicians, logicians and computer scientists. <br/><br/><br/>Recent years have witnessed increased research activity on the interface between logic and universal algebra. In particular, the use of algebraic methods has proved to be fruitful in the study of non-classical logics - such as modal logic, fuzzy logic, and substructural logics - with ordered structures playing a central role in this relationship. A profound study of the connection between commutator theories and the shapes of congruences lattices of algebras, over any variety, has been completed by K. Kearnes and E. Kiss, and the central open question in the representation theory of lattices, asking whether every algebraic distributive lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of a lattice, has been given a negative solution by F.

The overall goal is to deepen understanding about how to recognize the complexity of certain types of computational problems. The project focuses on a suite of mathematical problems whose solutions will yield new information about the complexity of Constraint Satisfaction Problems. These problems (CSP's) include scheduling problems, resource allocation problems, and problems reducible to solving systems of linear equations. CSP's are theoretically solvable, but some are not solvable efficiently. The research will be aimed at identifying a clear boundary between the tractable and intractable cases, and at providing efficient algorithms for solutions in the tractable cases. Many fundamental problems in mathematics and computer science can be formulated as CSP's, and progress here would have both practical and theoretical significance. A second component of the project investigates classical computational problems in algebra in order to determine whether they are algorithmically solvable. A third component of the project is the further development of the software UACalc, which is a proof assistant developed to handle computations involving algebraic structures.<br/><br/>The researchers shall work to decide the truth of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture of Feder and Vardi, which states that every Constraint Satisfaction Problem with a finite template is solvable in polynomial time or is NP complete. They will further develop the algebraic approach to CSP's by refining knowledge about relations compatible with weak idempotent Maltsev conditions and about algebras with finitely related clones. A second goal of the project concerns the computable recognition of properties of finite algebras connected with the varieties they generate, such as whether a finite algebra with a finite residual bound is finitely axiomatizable, or whether a finite algebra can serve as the algebra of character values for a natural duality. One of the more tangible accomplishments of this project will be a broadening and strengthening of the applicability of the UACalc software. The agenda for this part of the project includes parallelizing the important subroutines, building in conjecture-testing and search features, adding further algorithms, and further developing the community of users and contributors."

Set theory and general topology are fundamental mathematical disciplines, with common historical roots, and they serve as essential tools in many areas of mathematics. Set theoretic applications to topology have invigorated both fields since the proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis fifty years ago, and the synergy between them continues to invigorate the field of set-theoretic topology. Techniques developed to solve central questions in the field were instrumental in the development of the method of forcing, combinatorial set theory, and Ramsey theory. Set-theoretical techniques are also fundamental in recent work on the structure of non-separable Banach spaces and the study of rings of continuous functions and topological vector spaces. Quite naturally, set-theoretic topology also is close to logic and has much in common with finite combinatorics and theoretical computer science in its study of partial orders, Boolean algebra, and continuous lattices.<br/><br/>This conference will feature both three plenary talks and eighteen contributed research talks, as well as a session on open problems.

There are three                  main areas of effort. The first is the application of                           classification and quantification techniques in knot theory to                  the analysis of enzyme-DNA three-dimensional structure and enzyme               mechanism. Mathematical models, such as the tangle model, will be               developed and perfected, the aim being to produce a mathematical                tool of use to the experimental molecular biologist. The                        mathematics used here is recent work in the theory of                           3-manifolds, and the biological input is experimental results                   obtained from the topological approach to enzymology. The second                area is the study of the topological entanglement of random                     chains in 3-space.  Random chain entanglement statistics are                    related to the conformational entropy of a polymer system in                    dilute solution.  Asymptotic entanglement (as the length goes to                infinity) is reasonably well understood; the fundamental problem                of scientific interest is the description and computation of                    entanglement at finite lengths.  Both rigorous mathematics and                  simulation techniques will be employed.   The third area is the                 topological description of spiral wave patterns in excitable                    media.     The methods of differential topology and obstruction                 theory will be used to provide necessary and sufficient                         conditions for the existence and time evolution of patterns on                  bounded orientable 3-manifolds.                                                      A central problem in molecular biology is to deal with                     long-chain DNA molecules. The way they fold, replicate, and                     recombine is intimately bound up with their functions. The                      behavior of long-chain polymers in solution is a more general                   form of the same questions. Important applications arise in                     genetic engineering, the design of drugs, and the development of                long-chain polymers for industrial and technological uses.  Knot                theory is a part of topology that studies exactly these kinds of                questions: how structures fold and recombine and replicate."

Model theory develops various ways of measuring the complexity of a class of functions or sets, one of which is called Vapnik-Chervonenkis (or VC) dimension and was independently discovered by researchers in statistical learning theory in the 1970's.  One part of the project is studying the fine structure of systems with finite VC dimension. A related measure of the complexity of a class of sets is called stability and another aspect of the project is using the model-theoretic understanding of stable systems to compute the equations  satisfied by special functions such as the exponential function.  Describing the symmetries of spaces and systems is a pervasive aspect of the research which ties together its various components.<br/><br/>The project has four interrelated aspects, (i) stability theory and theories without the independence property, (ii) topological dynamics, model theory, and pseudo-finite groups, (iii) tame theories of differential fields, (iv) Ax-Lindemann for semiabelian families and differential Galois theory. At the abstract level model theory is about the classification of first order theories, and part (i) is firmly of this nature. The methods and results obtained in ""pure"" model theory are often mathematically meaningful in concrete contexts, leading to new interrelations with other areas of mathematics. In particular in (iv) the PI will study transcendence properties of ""exponential"" functions relative to certain families of commutative algebraic groups, making use of a certain Galois theory of differential equations which is given by constructions in stability-theory (part of model theory). The project also connects to and impacts on topological dynamics, and also potentially and indirectly combinatorics (via the study of certain measures on definable sets in theories without independence property)."

In these cases, it is often possible to provide a translation in which we reinterpret statements about infinite numbers as more complicated statements about explicit computations. The goal of this project is to develop ""meta-theorems"" for cases where this happens - results allowing us to systematically translate infinitary proofs into finite, explicit proofs - and to test these methods by applying them to examples in model theory. The project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students through their involvement with the research topics.<br/><br/>This project considers an assortment of situations where abstract logical ideas, particularly saturation, compactness, forcing, and uncountable cardinals, are used to prove concrete theorems. One of the lessons of proof theory is that we often expect such proofs to point the way towards proofs that are more concrete; the goal of this project is to find such concrete proofs. The project focuses on results in model theory, including the combinatorial part of stability theory and its links to graph and hypergraph quasirandomness, and saturated embedding tests for quantifier elimination. The proof-theoretic functional interpretation is a central tool; domain-specific adaptations will be developed to make the approach practical.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the continuum   hypothesis seems far from the basic properties of Lebesgue integral, these   principles seem far away from mathematical practice.  However, as in the   case of the continuum hypothesis, they affect the standard objects of modern   mathematics.  Set-theorists are developing a network of infinitary   combinatorial principles that provide answers to otherwise unsolvable   problems.  Some of these principles involve the existence of two-cardinal   combinatorial objects (e.g., morasses, or families of sets whose existence   is equivalent to the existence of morasses); these objects may be viewed as   generalizations of cardinals.  Although constructions which employ these   structures are usually more complicated than constructions by the usual   transfinite induction, they may be necessary in more complicated   situations.  The first objective of the project is to extend and develop   new canonical methods of applying Velleman's simplified morasses for   constructing structures in Boolean algebras, topology and other fields.  A   second objective is to develop new methods of constructing forcing  notions using two-cardinal combinatorial principles.  These forcing notions   are used directly for proving undecidability.  If the new combinatorial   methods are applied to forcing theory, this may result in a series of new   consistency results in pure set theory as well as in its applications.  The   third objective is to introduce relatively manageable principles equivalent   to higher gap morasses and develop methods of applying them to the theory   of Boolean algebras, topology and other fields.  Koszmider has selected   well-known open problems from various fields as test cases, conjecturing   that some of these can be solved using the above new methods.        Mathematics is the language of science.  Scientific problems are  translated into formal, precise and abstract mathematical problems.   Mathematical machinery provides solutions to these problems and gives   blueprints (known as theorems) that provide conclusions to given   assumptions.  Proving theorems is what mathematics is all about; theorems   directly or indirectly affect the way we formulate and solve scientific   problems.  Is proving theorems a perfect method?  No!  In 1930, Godel showed   that in any reasonable system of mathematics there will be conjectures which   will never be decided and probems that will never be solved, unless we add   new axioms in the foundations of mathematics.  Are these unsolvable problems   only artificial logical constructions?  No!  In 1964, Paul Cohen invented  the method of forcing, which since then has been used for demonstating   unsolvability of many problems of mainstream mathematics.  We need to know   what problems are unsolvable and what extra assumptions in the foundations   of mathematics (new axioms) make them solvable.  Based on his work in the   field and on partial research, Koszmider conjectures that certain   combinatorial principles will provide a new method for demonstrating   unsolvability of a large collection of important problems.  These principles   could thus serve as extra axioms.  These problems arise in various parts of   mathematics, such as infinitary combilatorics, Boolean algebra, and   topology.  Koszmider plans to formalize this underlying theme and to prove   its relation to classical principles in order to use them efficiently.  ***"

There is a body of work designing procedures for computing certain functions, and there is work designing useful approximation procedures for other functions.  There are many real-world functions (involving population, revenue, location of objects in space or events in time, etc.) that we can know only through approximations.  Knight is particularly interested in computability and computable approximation in number systems and other algebraic structures.  Traditionally, computability theory has dealt with countable objects.  However, important algebraic structures such as the field of real numbers are uncountable.  Some of the problems that interest Knight involve computability in uncountable structures.                      <br/><br/>With Karen Lange and Reed Solomon, Knight is trying to measure the complexity of the process of finding roots of polynomials in fields of generalized power series.  Some of the ideas go back to Newton.  With Uri Andrews, Knight is interested in the problem of when an elementary first order theory that is well-behaved from the point of view of model theory has a computable model.  Andrews and Knight have a result for ""strongly minimal"" theories, with conditions on the complexity of fragments of the theory guaranteeing that the countable models all have computable copies.  For some cases, the models are produced by ""workers"" constructions, involving nested approximations.  Knight is interested in applying the techniques of computability to uncountable structures.  There are different approaches.  Some involve changing the definition of what is computable.  Noah Schweber defined a reducibility that allows us to compare the computing power of structures of arbitrary cardinality, using the standard computability notions.  The idea is to collapse cardinals so that the structures being compared become countable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many celebrated results in logic from the first half of the 20th century concerned the existence of objects considered wild. Gödel's proof of the undecidability of arithmetic established that this structure is complicated (or wild) from a logical viewpoint. Such results are negative in spirit as they point to the limitations of mathematical reasoning. However, in the second half of the last century the focus changed. Model theorists found a vast number of tame mathematical structures that exhibit no such wildness, and for often very different reasons are amenable to model-theoretic methods. This program of identifying and analyzing tame classes of structures whose model theory can be understood came to be known as the geography of tame mathematics, and in its various forms has dominated model theory throughout the last thirty years. Although arising as a program of foundational importance, it has led to striking applications of model theory to other areas of mathematics, most recently to the André-Oort conjecture in number theory. Since this program is to explore areas of tame mathematics, these connections are not coincidental at all. The development of such interactions has proven again and again to have far reaching applications outside of logic that could not have been envisioned beforehand.<br/><br/>This project continues this line of research in the setting of expansions of the real line. It aims to settle important open questions within model theory, but also naturally develops new connections between model theory and other areas in logic such as neostability and descriptive set theory, and outside of logic such as geometric measure theory and geometric group theory. The investigator will lead a large scale investigation of dividing lines between tame and wild behavior arising in the study of the geometry of definable sets in ordered structures. Building on early advances, the investigator will determine far reaching consequences of various logical tameness conditions on the topological and metric tameness of definable sets. Furthermore, the project comprises new challenges in the classification of classes of structures considered tame. The educational component of this CAREER grant ties together the investigator's research with his teaching and outreach efforts. This project involves undergraduate and graduate students and young researchers in the investigator's research program, strengthens the ties between model theory and other branches of mathematics, and continues the investigator's outreach efforts in the Urbana-Champaign area."

For example, the Continuum Hypothesis (that there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers) is independent of the standard axioms, as shown in 1963 by Paul Cohen through the breakthrough method of forcing.  Since then, a longstanding project in set theory has been to use forcing for relative consistency results and to study strengthening of the ZFC axioms. This constitutes the broad motivation of the project: What is possible in strengthening of ZFC, versus what constraints are imposed by ZFC itself? The educational component of the project features organizing two workshops and support for undergraduate and graduate student research.<br/><br/>The main candidates for ZFC strengthenings are large cardinal axioms and strong forcing axioms.  Forcing over a model with large cardinals is also the most powerful tool for showing consistency results. Combinatorial principles, especially at singular cardinals are used to understand both the nature of these extensions, and how much we can do with forcing and large cardinals. Jensen's square, Shelah's approachability property are ""anti-compactness"" type principles that hold in models that sufficiently resemble L. In contrast, the tree property is a reflection property that resembles large cardinal properties, but can hold at successor cardinals. The project will focus on the interplay between these principles and forcing extensions constructed from large cardinals. The PI will also investigate how they interact with the singular cardinal hypothesis and Shelah's PCF theory. The latter is mostly decided in ZFC, and provides certain ""canonical invariants,"" against which one can test new axioms."

Three areas  will receive special emphasis: triangulations of compact manifolds (with and without boundary) and closely related spaces,  finite linear quotients of spheres, and matroids.     Compact manifolds are one of the cornerstones of modern mathematics and physics.   In the last century a tremendous amount of research has been directed toward unlocking their topology and geometry.  However, questions of a combinatorial character have remained largely unanswered. What is the minimum number of  facets  required to triangulate a given manifold? How do various  topological invariants  determine how complicated it is to represent the manifold on a computer?  What methods are there to construct manifolds with particular combinatorial properties?   Conversely, given limits on the combinatorics of a triangulation, what does that imply about the possible geometries on the manifold?   Similar questions, where even less is known, apply to spaces with singularities which include algebraic varieties, quotients of group actions, or limits of Riemannian manifolds.  Finite linear quotients of spheres lie at the intersection of representation theory, topology, geometry and combinatorics.   How are the topology and geometry of the quotient space related to the combinatorics and algebra of the representation theoretic data?  Matroids are a combinatorial abstraction of linear independence with a variety of applications including hyperplane arrangements, linear optimization, reliability, order restricted statistical inference, and the aforementioned linear quotients of spheres. The project will concentrate on enumerative properties of matroids.  The questions above are representative of the research that will be conducted by the PI during the project.<br/><br/> How does one study complicated spaces and structures? One approach is to approximate them with simpler objects. For instance, an n-dimensional object might be represented as a collection of n-simplices - the higher dimensional analogues of triangles and tetrahedrons. How complicated are these representations? How many of the smaller pieces are needed? How is this reflected in the shape and geometry of the original object? Are there computationally practical ways of producing these models? These are types of questions addressed in this research."

The first part of the project is concerned with studying the composant equivalence relation on indecomposable continua using techniques and notions developed in the study of Borel equivalence relations. Solecki builds on his prior work on indecomposable continua. He primarily investigates the question whether on a comeager subset of an indecomposable continuum the composant equivalence relation is Borel isomorphic to one of two special Borel equivalence relations via an isomorphism preserving meager sets. The affirmative answer to this question would solve an old problem of Kuratowski and even partial results for special indecomposable continua would sharpen several theorems from the literature. In the second part of the project, Solecki studies ideals of closed subsets of a Polish space.  He investigates a certain very concrete representation of simply definable ideals of compact sets. This is connected with several open problems in this area of mathematics. Additionally, he continues his study of the ideal of Haar null subsets of a Polish group. Particular aims here are to develop the theory for all non-abelian Polish groups (the theory works fine for the class of Polish groups with invariant metrics) and to fully understand the connection between Haar null sets in infinite products of locally compact groups and amenability of the factor groups.<br/><br/>One of the themes of Solecki's project is the investigation of indecomposable continua. These are fascinating geometrical objects whose intricate topological properties attracted interest of mathematicians since the beginning of the (last) century. However, only quite recently it was realized how ubiquitous such continua are and how important a role they play in various contexts in dynamical systems and topology. There is an old conjecture, due to Kuratowski, which is still unresolved and whose confirmation would completely reveal the finer structure of indecomposable continua. Solecki works on particularly important instances of this hypothesis and other problems related to it.  Another theme of Solecki's project is the study of certain notions of smallness. These are important in various branches of mathematics to measure the size of sets under consideration. The starting point here is his observation that a vast class of such families of small sets admit surprising and very concrete type of representations. The possibility of representing a family of small sets in this fashion has deep implications for the structure of such families and, if realized, answers some old questions regarding this structure. Solecki studies the extent to which such representations can be established, interconnections between these type of representations and properties of notions of smallness, and other problems related to notions of smallness.  <br/>"

The Association also meets annually at the Joint Mathematics Meetings, where it typically co-sponsors one or more events with the American Mathematical Society and/or the Mathematical Association of America, and on a rotating basis with one of the three divisions of the American Philosophical Association. ASL-sponsored meetings are held throughout the world. The Association works to ensure that its meetings and those it sponsors cover logic and its applications comprehensively, and that they represent the highest quality work being done in the field. They accordingly provide important opportunities for serious intellectual exchange, thereby serving as a stimulus to advancement of research. For graduate students in logic, the opportunity to attend any of these meetings is a vital component of their training and subsequent entry into the profession. <br/><br/><br/>The Association for Symbolic Logic is the leading international professional society for logicians, whose membership includes researchers in computer science, cognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. It organizes and sponsors a number of important meetings. Most prominent among these are its North American Annual Meeting and European Summer Meeting, both held annually. Recent sponsored meetings have taken place in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North and South America. The Association has actively sought to increase the range and number of meetings that it sponsors, a particular aim of which is to embrace new and emerging fields in which logic has come to play an important role, including computer science, linguistics, and cognitive science. This project will permit the continuation and appropriate expansion of a successful program of graduate student travel awards that the Association has administered since 1993 and that has been partially funded by NSF since 1997. The program has proved to be a highly effective means of bringing students in logic to important professional meetings at which they can meet and exchange ideas with leading logicians, as well as present papers on their original research. Approximately eighty-four percent of the awards funded by N.S.F. during the period 1998-2005 (the first N.S.F.-supported awards were made in 1998) went to students who subsequently have earned their Ph.D.'s in logic. Many of these awardees have obtained excellent postdoctoral and permanent positions. Several of the early award recipients already have served on ASL or ASL-sponsored meeting program committees and have been appointed to standing committees of the Association.

Both of these sets are infinite, i.e. larger than any finite<br/>set, and one of the key steps in the development of logic and set<br/>theory was the realization by Georg Cantor that the set of real<br/>numbers is definitely of a larger cardinality than the set of natural<br/>numbers.

All results stated below use large cardinal assumptions, and some such assumptions are necessary. One line of research for the funded project is the investigation of classes of objects with the same properties, so-called terminal classes. A typical result states that the Ramsey ultrafilters are a terminal class: roughly, they share all properties invariant under the Rudin-Keisler equivalence of filters. Open questions under investigation involve finding further such terminal classes, and more importantly, the quantification of theproliferation of such classes throughout mathematics. Another line of research pursued is the construction of models in which the behavior of cardinal invariants of the continuum is optimal. A typical result is that the Miller model is the optimal way of increasing the dominating number d: roughly, all projectively defined invariants which are consistently less than d, are less than d in this model. The dual result states that there is an optimal Pmax model in which the bounding number is small. Open problems involve finding further cardinal invariants which have canonical models associated with them.  More challenging is the investigation of the notion of duality mentioned above, and the investigation of the limits of the method of forcing with simply definable partial orders.<br/><br/>Set theorists have for a long time studied certain additional axioms for mathematics, called large cardinal axioms. While they are largely irrelevant for solving specific problems in most traditional fields of mathematics, they do have a strong influence on the methodology used. Typically the large cardinal axioms allow the mathematician to select an optimal approach to answering a question only by considering the syntactical form of the question. Frequently this information can serve to discover the core of a seemingly complex problem.  Three examples are in order.  As the first example, it has been known for twenty years that sets of reals with simple definitions are well behaved from the point of view of mathematical analysis. Second, the PI has identified several classes of objects in mathematical practice that are ""terminal"": all objects in such a class have the same properties. Such classes have great methodological significance, and the PI plans to isolate more of them. In still another development, the PI found that for certain mathematically important classes of theories, there is an optimal approach to answering the question of whether the theories contain no contradictions. Again, the PI continues to isolate further such classes.

The program has been successful in the past, and continues to generate questions and results connecting forcing to other parts of mathematics. The current issues include among others rectangular Ramsey problems, in which the homogeneous sets have forms of rectangles with sides positive with respect to a suitable sigma-ideal, characterizations of sigma-ideals given by collections of measures, and canonical Ramsey theorems, in which Borel equivalence relations attain simple prescribed forms on sets positive with respect to a suitable sigma-ideal.<br/><br/>Paul Cohen invented forcing as a method for proving that various questions are unsolvable on the basis of the usual axioms for mathematics. Saharon Shelah sharpened this tool with his method of proper forcing. The method depends on complicated combinatorial ad hoc constructions of partial orders. The PI considers partial orders of a special form--those of Borel subsets of the reals positive with respect to a suitable sigma-ideal ordered by inclusion. It turns out that little generality is lost in this way, the decades of previous work on sigma-ideals in other branches of mathematics can be brought to bear on the resulting questions, and the approach is in fact provably optimal in certain important aspects. The project continues this line of work, connecting the powerful method of forcing with such branches of mathematics as measure theory, combinatorics, dynamical systems, and game theory.<br/><br/>"

This measure can be extended to capture the effective content of other objects in mathematics, such as real numbers. In other cases, Turing reducibility is not sufficient. For example, it is known to be impossible to assign a Turing degree to every continuous function on the unit interval. In that and many other cases, an extension of Turing reducibility, enumeration reducibility, turns out to provide a better framework for constructive mathematics. However, enumeration degrees have not been as thoroughly investigated as Turing degrees. The goal of this project is to expand understanding of the structure of enumeration degrees and their relationship to Turing degrees. The project aims to develop new methods, investigate combinatorial properties of the structure, and isolate special classes of degrees that determine the logical character of the structure, with a special focus on first-order definability. Constructive mathematics, specifically algebra and topology, will be the source for such classes. The project aims to utilize the intimate interplay between the partial orders of the Turing degrees and the enumeration degrees to extract new information in both directions.<br/><br/>A major open problem in degree theory asks if the structure of the Turing degrees is rigid. This problem is strongly connected to a possible classification of the first-order definable relations on the Turing degrees. Prior work has established a link between this problem and the rigidity problem for the enumeration degrees: if the Turing degrees are rigid then so are the enumeration degrees. The rigidity of the enumeration degrees, while still open, can turn out to be more approachable. The investigator and collaborators have established the first-order definability of a series of relations on the structure of the enumeration degrees via natural structural relations. An important goal of this project is to continue this line of investigation, building an arsenal of first-order definable relations on the enumeration degrees and bringing us closer to a solution to the rigidity problem for the enumeration degrees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ramsey's Theorem states that given any coloring of all pairs of natural numbers into finitely many colors, there is an infinite subset in which all pairs have the same color.  Since its inception, Ramsey theory has developed in multiple directions, often appearing as the core content in solutions to deep problems from a wide range of mathematical disciplines.  This project utilizes techniques in mathematical logic to more fully develop Ramsey theory of infinite relational structures.  A major motivation is to find dividing lines between those infinite structures which act like the natural numbers in the sense of possessing analogues of Ramsey's theorem, and those which do not.  Of particular interest is the advancement of Ramsey theory for structures with forbidden configurations.  Progress on infinite structures works in tandem with progress in mathematical logic and topology, creating new pathways between several areas of mathematics.  This project includes some important questions which are suitable for graduate students and early career researchers, thus providing opportunities to broaden participation of well-trained mathematicians via the PI's mentoring.<br/><br/>This research program will develop the Ramsey theory of infinite relational structures, especially those with forbidden configurations, an area which had been largely impervious to investigations prior to the PI's recent solution for the universal homogeneous triangle-free graph.  This will involve constructing new types of trees which code homogeneous relational structures and using the technique of forcing to produce (in ZFC) Ramsey theorems for these classes of trees.  These new techniques will be used obtain better bounds for finite structural Ramsey theory.  Computability theoretic strengths of varying Ramsey statements, and connections with classification schemes in model theory will be investigated.  Infinitary Ramsey theory will continue to be developed with a broad spectrum of implications for and applications to other areas of mathematics.  The techniques developed, involving simultaneous uses of logic, combinatorics and topology, will create new pathways between these areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The classic example of this is Ramsey's Theorem, which states that for any coloring of all pairs of natural numbers into two colors, there is an infinite set of numbers from which every pair has the same color.  Extensions of this theorem to more complex structures, rather than just pairs of numbers, have led to and continue to lead to breakthroughs in  mathematics.  The finding of exact copies of complex structures in which all small structures of some form behave simply is a means for sorting structural results in mathematics.  Topological Ramsey space theory unifies many of the important  theorems in the area into one general framework.  The interrelations between  in Ramsey theory, set theory, and Tukey order fuels progress in each of these areas.  The project aims to continue development of topological Ramsey space theory and its applications to mapping  exact structures in some fundamental topological spaces constructed from the natural numbers; to promote better understanding of the axiomatic foundations of mathematics; and to find dividing lines between those complex structures, for instance networks, which have large copies in which all small structures behave simply and those which do not. <br/><br/>Ramsey theory and set theory overlap both in problems of interest and in methods of proof.   This is seen in particular in the theory of topological Ramsey spaces, classic examples of which include the Ellentuck space, the Carlson-Simpson space of equivalence relations, and the Milliken space of infinite block sequences.  Tukey reduction between partial orderings is a means for classifying partial orderings when isomorphism is too fine a notion to be useful.   The Tukey structure of ultrafilters on the natural numbers is exactly  the structure of the neighborhood bases in the Stone-Cech compactification of the natural numbers.  The project's  goals are to continue developing topological Ramsey space theory and its connections with set theory and Tukey structure, with applications to ultrahomogeneous relational structures and analysis.  The aims of the project are several-fold but all interrelated.  These include mapping the exact Tukey structure of ultrafilters on the natural numbers, and on Boolean algebras in general, and proving new pigeonhole principles relevant to the ultrafilters.  In forcing theory, the project aims to streamline some areas of forcing by characterizing those partial orderings which are forcing equivalent to a topological Ramsey space, one particular focus being on creature forcings, again involving new pigeonhole principles.  Another line of work is Ramsey theory at large cardinals, extending classical Ramsey theorems on countable structures to the uncountable.  Finally, the project aims to solve problems regarding Ramsey theory on ultrahomogeneous relational structures, and to construct new types of Banach spaces via topological Ramsey space theory."

Abstract topological  dynamics extends the notion of time from the groups of real numbers and integers to arbitrary, possibly infinite-dimensional, topological groups, and restricts the space to be bounded and to contain all its limit points. Abstract topological dynamics encompasses methods from and applications into numerous areas of mathematics. This project mainly investigates its intimate relationship with combinatorics, in particular, Ramsey theory. Every topological group admits a natural representation as a group of symmetries of some mathematical structure. It turns out that wild dynamical behaviour of the group corresponds to chaotic behaviour of the corresponding structure, that is, lack of Ramsey phenomena, and tamer dynamical behaviour corresponds to a bounded number of patterns approximating the undelying structure. This relationship is a rich source of questions both on the level of general theory and concrete examples. The intent of the project is to address both hand in hand while isolating instances suitable for undergraduate and graduate research.<br/><br/>        To a great extent, dynamical behaviour of a topological group can be read from its minimal flows, in particular from the projectively largest one, the universal minimal flow. It has previously been studied by functional analytical means, whereas the PI developed a dual approach via ultrafilters, for groups of automorphisms of discrete structure, and more generally near ultrafilters for general topological groups. The corresponding Ramsey phenomena have a direct translation into the ultrafilter language as well and clarify the connection between dynamics and combinatorics. The goal is to continue studying universal minimal flows via (near) ultrafilters in general, such as what topological spaces can be the universal minimal flows, as well as concrete examples of groups and underlying structures that lead the direction of the theory, for example, whether groups of automorphisms of discrete structures exhibit all possible dynamical behaviour, or whether metric structure (allowing for small error) bring in new phenomena.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first part of the project is concerned with studying the composant equivalence relation on indecomposable continua using techniques and notions developed in the study of Borel equivalence relations. Solecki builds on his prior work on indecomposable continua. He primarily investigates the question whether on a comeager subset of an indecomposable continuum the composant equivalence relation is Borel isomorphic to one of two special Borel equivalence relations via an isomorphism preserving meager sets. The affirmative answer to this question would solve an old problem of Kuratowski and even partial results for special indecomposable continua would sharpen several theorems from the literature. In the second part of the project, Solecki studies ideals of closed subsets of a Polish space.  He investigates a certain very concrete representation of simply definable ideals of compact sets. This is connected with several open problems in this area of mathematics. Additionally, he continues his study of the ideal of Haar null subsets of a Polish group. Particular aims here are to develop the theory for all non-abelian Polish groups (the theory works fine for the class of Polish groups with invariant metrics) and to fully understand the connection between Haar null sets in infinite products of locally compact groups and amenability of the factor groups.<br/><br/>One of the themes of Solecki's project is the investigation of indecomposable continua. These are fascinating geometrical objects whose intricate topological properties attracted interest of mathematicians since the beginning of the (last) century. However, only quite recently it was realized how ubiquitous such continua are and how important a role they play in various contexts in dynamical systems and topology. There is an old conjecture, due to Kuratowski, which is still unresolved and whose confirmation would completely reveal the finer structure of indecomposable continua. Solecki works on particularly important instances of this hypothesis and other problems related to it.  Another theme of Solecki's project is the study of certain notions of smallness. These are important in various branches of mathematics to measure the size of sets under consideration. The starting point here is his observation that a vast class of such families of small sets admit surprising and very concrete type of representations. The possibility of representing a family of small sets in this fashion has deep implications for the structure of such families and, if realized, answers some old questions regarding this structure. Solecki studies the extent to which such representations can be established, interconnections between these type of representations and properties of notions of smallness, and other problems related to notions of smallness.  <br/>"

While topological transformation groups are quite trivially connected to geometry by the objects of which they are symmetries, this is not so for more general groups, that is, sets equipped with a notion of multiplication or addition. For example, solutions to differential equations can often be seen as points or vectors in infinite-dimensional spaces, namely so called Banach spaces, and such points can be added together to form new points in the space. So the solution spaces to differential equations are themselves groups. As it turns out, groups have an intrinsically defined large scale geometric structure. That is, as groups are seen from farther and farther away, the microscopical structure becomes blurred and one is left with a macroscopical perspective, which may be accessible to computation and provide structural information about the groups themselves. The PI will investigate groups from this large scale perspective, in particular expanding the existing theory to various infinite-dimensional groups originating in logic, topology and analysis.<br/><br/>The PI intends to conduct research on the large scale geometry of Polish groups. While large scale geometry of discrete or locally compact groups has been a very active area for quite some time, the realisation that Polish groups may have a well-defined large scale geometry is very recent. Several aspects to be investigated concern the large scale geometry of various concrete classes of groups such as homeomorphism and diffeomorphism groups of compact manifolds and automorphism groups of countable first-order structures. In the latter case, one particular issue is to calibrate geometric properties of the automorphism group with the model theoretical properties of the structure. The nature of the proposal is very much interdisciplinary. On the one hand, it will involve descriptive set theory, via the study of Polish groups, model theory, via the study of automorphism groups, while at the same time incorporating the multifaceted instruments of geometric group theory. On the other hand, the theory allows for a geometric study of a number of topological transformation groups that were not hitherto amenable to such an approach, which again should open up for connections with areas such as geometric and differential topology."

The PI is engaged is studying various aspect of these tools, both applying the resulting structure theory of Polish groups to problems in functional analysis, as witnessed in his recent collaboration with V.

In addition, the PI is studying the block Ramsey theory originating in the work of W.T. Gowers, which has led to significant results in the geometric theory of Banach spaces, in particular, a classification program for separable Banach spaces based on infinite-dimensional Ramsey theory.

In the project Rosendal will investigate both algebraic and topological properties of these groups, such as the small index property, the Bergman property, phenomena of automatic continuity of homomorphisms and extreme amenability. The main problems investigated are to a great extent motivated by the model theoretical problem of reconstructing a countable structure from its group of automorphisms. One of the principal tools used in this connection is the automatic continuity of isomorphisms of automorphism groups, which motivated the study of the broader phenomenon of automatic continuity of arbitrary homomorphisms between classes of Polish groups. Rosendal also plans to apply these ideas to study the topological dynamics of uncountable discrete groups most notably in connection with the fixed point on metric compacta property. The study of Polish groups using the very diverse methods of several fields seems likely to promote the further integration of separate knowledge and deeper understanding of the objects considered.<br/>In a separate project, Rosendal intends to continue his work with V. Ferenczi on a question of G. Godefroy concerning the number of non-isomorphic subspaces of a non-Hilbertian Banach space. The methods that have proven useful at this moment have been highly set theoretical in nature and have reduced the problem to the case of minimal spaces. Probably more analytical tools will be of greater utility for the next steps. In connection with this, Rosendal plans to revisit Gowers' determinacy theorem and by using set theoretical tools extend its applications beyond its nominal reach of analytic sets. This should provide tools in Banach space theory not obtainable by classical geometric considerations.  <br/>Also Rosendal will pursue another ongoing project with B.D. Miller of classifying Borel transformations up to a descriptive notion of Kakutani equivalence. This is a completely parallel project to the theory of Kakutani equivalence in ergodic theory, but due to the nature of the objects, the methods used are completely descriptive set theoretical and go back to works of Glimm and Effros in operator algebra. <br/>By stressing the interconnections of mathematical logic with other domains of mathematics, Rosendal hopes to enrich both logic itself and provide new insight into objects outside of mathematical logic. The main applications of his research will be in functional analysis (Banach space theory), topological groups, and ergodic theory."

One of the most fruitful developments in this field has been the study of the algorithmic content of mathematics. At the same time, concerns about the foundations of mathematics have led to the analysis of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning, and the study of the relative power of such systems. The computability-theoretic approach has turned out to play a key role in this project. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics whose methods and results underlie a great deal of mathematical reasoning, so the study of its algorithmic content and of the systems required to formalize its methods is particularly important. Computable combinatorics has a long history, but has seen a recent surge of interest highlighting the fact that computability-theoretically natural notions tend to be combinatorially natural, and vice-versa. This project aims to strengthen the connections between computability theory and combinatorics by increasing our understanding of the algorithmic content of combinatorial principles, through a concerted group effort to use what we have learned in recent years to systematize the area further, work toward solving a number of its outstanding questions, and explore its outward-facing aspects.<br/><br/>This project will address major open problems such as determining whether Hindman's Theorem holds arithmetically, and whether it is equivalent to its restriction to sums of length at most two; determining the first-order part of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs, and clarifying the computability-theoretic relationship between this principle and its stable version; and determining the exact proof-theoretic strength of Laver's Theorem. More importantly, it will focus on the development of lines of research particularly relevant to the growing interest in connections between computability theory and combinatorics, including the study of questions of methodological interest to combinatorialists, for instance ones involving Hindman's Theorem and the use of ultrafilters in combinatorics; the development of new proofs of combinatorial theorems inspired by questions regarding the computational content of these theorems, along the lines of Montalban's new proof of Laver's Theorem; the analysis and comparison of different general methods, such as the use of ultrafilters, topological dynamics, and probabilistic methods; the development of notions of comparison between theorems that, while still computability-theoretic in spirit, are closer to being direct reflections of combinatorial differences; the understanding of splittings of combinatorial principles into computationally and combinatorially simpler parts; the study of the usefulness of combinatorially-defined objects as computational oracles; and the study of the first-order consequences of the existence of combinatorially-defined second-order objects. This project is thus aimed at developing the study of the connections between computability theory and combinatorics along a large number of related directions, making use of the computability-theoretic, proof-theoretic, and combinatorial expertise of its PIs, senior personnel, and key collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They often appear as the set of symmetries of a geometric object, for example, of 3-dimensional space, a molecule or a crystal. Oftentimes, the set of symmetries themselves, i.e., the group, has a natural topological structure. That is, one can speak of one symmetry being close to another, as in the case of two rotations of 3-dimensional space being close if they differ by a small angle. These latter groups are called topological transformation groups and are trivially related to geometry via the geometric object of which they are the set of symmetries. However, other topological groups are not so easily viewed as coming from geometry. This is, for example, the case for the systems of solutions to many differential equations which form a group under addition called a Banach space. However, one of the principal ideas of the present project is that all topological groups have natural intrinsic geometric structure which is defined jointly by their topological and algebraic structure. Moreover, this geometric structure can in many cases provide significant insight into the structure of the group by blotting out finer details that obscure the global or large scale properties of the group.<br/><br/>The primary aim of this project is to investigate the coarse geometry of topological and, in particular, Polish groups. In earlier research, the PI has established and investigated a natural coarse structure that every topological group is equipped with and which coincides with that traditionally studied on finitely generated or locally compact groups, Banach spaces or even homeomorphism groups of compact manifolds. Particularly interesting subclasses to be studied are the Polish groups of bounded geometry for which the geometric structure theory is well-advanced. Several interesting questions on the extent of this class of groups remain open, for example, whether every Polish group of bounded geometry is coarsely equivalent to a locally compact group. The research program is by nature interdisciplinary. While its origins lie in descriptive set theory, the main examples of groups to be studied arise in various disciplines of mathematics, including functional analysis, logic, and geometric and differential topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Firstly, he intends to further elaborate on the structure theory of large Polish group and, in particular, automorphism groups of countable first order structures. The PI's main <br/>interest in this domain is the existence of generic representations of countable discrete groups in such automorphism groups and its uses in investigating the dynamics and algebraic structure of the automorphism group. <br/>Secondly, the PI will be working on the classical problem of J.P.R.

Ferenczi on the <br/>rough classification of separable Banach spaces, a programme initiated by W. T. Gowers in the course of the solution to the homogeneous space problem. This programme heavily relies on Ramsey theoretical and game theoretical methods from descriptive set theory and thus enriches both descriptive set theory by developing new techniques and functional analysis by contributing to one of the most central problems of Banach space theory. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In recent years, there has been a growing collaboration and sharing of ideas between researchers working in dynamical systems and descriptive set theory. Initially, this was largely fostered by work on Borel equivalence relations but has lately also come to include topological dynamics. The principal objectives of descriptive set theory consists in studying the definable subsets of the real line, showing that these are much better behaved than arbitrary subsets. This has developed into a large structure theory of such sets which gives a solid framework within which most of mathematical analysis takes place, and as such, the use of descriptive set theoretical techniques in parts of functional analysis is continuously expanding.<br/><br/>"

This subject is central to modern mathematics and has a rich history stretching back more than a century. TOPOSYM is a series of international topology conferences held in Prague, Czech Republic, in a five- year cycle since 1961. The conference has long served as a geographic and intellectual meeting point. On one hand it has a large attendance both from North America (and the US in particular) and from Europe (and Eastern Europe in particular). On the other, a large cross section of the more analytical side of topology is represented at the meeting. The Twelfth Symposium on General Topology (TOPOSYM 2016) will be held July 25-29, 2016 in Prague, Czech Republic, under the auspices of the Institute of Mathematics of the Czech Academy of Sciences and the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University. This grant will support the US based participants who attend the symposium.<br/><br/>The conference covers a broad range of topics on the more analytical side of topology:  general and set-theoretic topology, descriptive set theory, continuum theory, topological dynamics, topology in functional analysis and algebra, and categorical topology. The conference will contain invited lectures by many leaders in the field of general and set-theoretic topology: A. Arhangel'skii, L. Aurichi, D. Dikranjan, A. Dow, M. Hrusak, O. Kalenda, A.

Since then, a long standing project in set theory has been to find the ""right"" strengthening of the axioms. There are several candidates, and this project contributes to understanding of the nature of these extensions. <br/><br/>This project explores various aspects of combinatorial set theory. The main goal is to investigate the interplay between large cardinals, forcing, and principles such as square, the tree property, and Shelah's theory of possible cofinalities and their applications to singular combinatorics. The work is part of a project to determine the canonical structures that exist at singular cardinals and their successors in extensions of ZFC by large cardinals or strong forcing axioms. The long term goal is understanding what is possible relative to large cardinals, what can be obtained as remnants of large cardinals, and developing the theory of certain forcing posets. Forcing is used to test both the power and limitations of these strengthenings of ZFC, and combinatorial principles like the tree property provide the key test questions."

A crucial idea in this area, first developed in the 1970s by Shelah, is the notion of a dividing line. A dividing line can be thought of as a structural dichotomy within a certain class of mathematical objects.  Many of the most important dividing lines correspond to local combinatorial properties which have significant implications for global structure.  In the infinite setting, model theorists have had great success using dividing lines to classify examples and generalize their behavior. However, extensions into the finite setting have been limited, largely due to the failure there of crucial infinitary tools.  On the other hand, extremal and arithmetic combinatorics are fields which focus on the finite setting, but which study many of the same themes as model theory, such as local versus global structure and the interplay of structure and randomness.  These fields have developed finitary questions and tools which are new to model theory, but which have have deep connections to model theoretic ideas.  The goal of this project is to extend the study of model theoretic dividing lines in the finite setting by solving finitary problems from extremal and additive combinatorics which address these shared themes.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project will focus on finding local model theoretic conditions which have robust implications for bounds and growth rates in theorems from additive and extremal combinatorics.  This will be accomplished in two main directions.  The first will focus on questions from additive combinatorics.  Here a main goal will be to identify structural dichotomies for subsets of high-dimensional vector spaces over prime fields. For instance, what kinds of sets are most ""tame'', as measured through improved bounds in structural decomposition theorems?  Can the ""tame'' sets be characterized by local combinatorial configurations?  The second direction will address questions in extremal combinatorics.  Specifically, the PI will continue work on enumeration and extremal problems for hereditary properties in finite relational languages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One direction of this work involves studying unstable theories from an asymptotic (ultrapower) point of view. Specifically, Malliaris plans to work on the structure of Keisler's order, a long standing program of comparing the complexity of theories, whose structure on the unstable theories has remained open since 1967. Keisler's order directly compares theories independent of language, and it was recognized early on that this order would likely give significant model-theoretic information. A complementary direction of this work involves developing further connections between model theory and graph theory. For instance, Malliaris plans to further develop the theory of characteristic sequences of hypergraphs (associated to formulas), a framework which brings ideas and techniques from graph theory and finite combinatorics such as Szemeredi regularity to bear on the analysis of types in unstable theories, and on various tradeoffs between independence and order in unstable theories. Informally, both the connections to graph theory and to ultrapowers give a perspective in which local noise is smoothed out and the nature of the significant jumps in the complexity of pseudofinite structure can be more clearly seen. This is an ideal context for studying the independence property, in which it is crucial to see finer distinctions between 'noise' or inconsistency arising from certain random structure, and more global compatibility. Broadly speaking, the proposed research program builds toward a more unified structure theory for the unstable theories, and aims to discover and further develop productive notions of complexity inherent to unstable theories.<br/><br/>The proposed work is in model theory, specifically the classification of unstable theories. A model is a structure given by the data of an underlying set along with an interpretation for all function, relation, and constant symbols in a fixed background language L; a theory is a complete consistent set of L-sentences of first-order logic; and an elementary class is precisely the class of models of some theory, e.g. algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0. A major interest of model theory is studying theories via elementary classes of models, that is, studying a theory at hand by classifying the possible variations within its associated elementary class. One of the most fertile contexts for model theoretic analysis has been stability theory, the study of so-called stable or 'tame' theories, developed by Shelah in the 1970s. While the much larger class of non-stable or 'unstable' theories are quite complex from the point of view of stability, they are of significant interest. Many mathematical structures are unstable, so provide both theoretical motivation and examples; and there are many conjectures and problems about unstable theories which naturally attract research. The proposed work aims to build tools and a perspective from which to identify and analyze jumps in model-theoretic complexity among the unstable theories from a more uniform point of view, as well as to develop certain productive analogies and interactions with finite and asymptotic combinatorics. At the same time, these tools will be tested, in part, via the large scale structural conjecture of Keisler's order."

Among other areas in the theory of randomness, he will study properties of ``far from random'' sets and the connections between them, other notions of computability theoretic lowness, and notions such as mutual information for infinite strings. He will also seek further applications of randomness to various areas of computability theory. In computable model theory, he will continue to address issues raised by effectivizing model theoretic notions, including the relationships between the degree of effectivity of different models of theories with few models and the computability theoretic and proof theoretic aspects of special models, such as prime, homogeneous, and saturated models. He will also further investigate computability theoretic and proof theoretic aspects of combinatorial principles, as well as principles arising from model theory, measure theory, and other areas. In this work he will exploit the connections between effective mathematics and the reverse mathematics program, which aims to calibrate the strength of theorems of ordinary mathematics in terms of the (set existence and induction) axioms needed to prove them.<br/><br/>The study of the effective content of mathematics has received increasing attention in the last few decades. It is a natural outgrowth of the efforts to understand and formalize the notions of algorithm and computable function undertaken in the early part of the twentieth century. It is of both pure mathematical and foundational interest, and has important connections with computer science. This project aims to further our understanding of how structure affects computability, and how computability interacts with other fundamental notions of modern mathematics and foundations of mathematics, such as randomness and proof-theoretic strength. Computability theorists have developed a highly successful theory of relative computational complexity of sets of numbers, which, in addition to its intrinsic mathematical interest, has been influential in theoretical computer science. One of the goals of this project is to continue the development of an emerging parallel theory of relative algorithmic randomness, which can act as a theoretical framework in which to consider questions such as: When should we say that an infinite set is more random than another, and what consequences does the relative randomness of sets have for their relative computational complexity?"

The  fundamental aim is to deepen our understanding of computability  and its relation to algebraic structures and to models of various  first order theories.  The approach is to apply algebraic and  model theoretic methods to assemble apparently unrelated and  often chaotic individual results in recursion theory into a  unified theory and to point the way toward future research.  A  recent example is the Slaman-Soare result where a simple  algebraic criterion was discovered which unified many results and  methods on the r.e. degrees over the last 30 years and solved the  long standing problem on extension of embeddings.  In another  area Harrington and Soare have developed a method for generating  automorphisms of the r.e. sets on the one hand and for producing  definable properties on the other, which show that other  automorphisms cannot exist.  In addition, Lachlan and Soare have  applied certain forcing methods to study models of arithmetic and  will develop these further.       The aim is to study computability of sets of integers.  The  first objective is to study computability in terms of the  recursively enumerable (r.e.) sets, namely those which can be  listed by a computable procedure, and to relate their algebraic  structure to the degree of information they encode and to the  speed with which they can be enumerated with respect to some  measure of the complexity of computation.  The second objective  is to study the relationship of computability to other  mathematical objects, for example to certain models, and to  certain algebraic structures.  For algebraic structures, the  general problem is to determine exactly what information can be  coded into a particular type of that structure.  This will give  new information about how information can be coded between sets  and how it can be co ded into an algebraic structure.  ***"

Combinatorics is the area of mathematics concerning discrete structures, such as graphs, which can be viewed as mathematical objects representing networks consisting of nodes with links between them. This area has experienced immense growth in the past several decades, owing in part to its close connection to computer science. Recently, it has become apparent that combinatorial insights can shed new light on problems in other, seemingly unrelated, areas, such as ergodic theory - the study of the evolution of dynamical systems, encompassing a range of applications from epidemic models to planetary motion. It turns out that one can often associate a graph or another discrete structure to a dynamical system and then use combinatorial methods to elucidate its properties. The goals of this project are to extend the range of applications of this approach and develop new powerful combinatorial tools for the needs of other areas. The PI will work with graduate and undergraduate students through problem solving workshops and other collaborations. <br/><br/>More specifically, this project revolves around transferring ideas from graph coloring theory and probabilistic combinatorics to the setting where it is necessary to fulfill additional regularity constraints (measure-theoretic, topological, etc.). Particular avenues of investigation that will be covered in this project include: (a) studying the extent to which classical probabilistic tools, especially the Lovász Local Lemma, can be extended to the measurable framework; (b) finding new methods for building measurable colorings, matchings, and other useful structures in graphs; (c) applying combinatorial techniques to attack major open problems in dynamical systems, such as the entropy problem and the Ellis problem; and (d) studying the interplay between descriptive set theory and computer science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the simplicity of this concept, familiar to any child who has played a game of connect-the-dots, graphs are sufficiently general to model many phenomena both within mathematics and also in nearby scientific disciplines.  For example, graphs have found applications in computer network design, including modeling the evolution of the internet, as well as in statistical physics, including modeling atomic-scale thermodynamic interactions.  In these applications, the number of vertices is so large that for analytical purposes it is indistinguishable from being infinite.  In this project, the principal investigator will study infinite graphs from the descriptive set-theoretic viewpoint, in essence regarding such graphs abstractly as sets and relating the complexity of their descriptions with their concrete combinatorial properties.  In areas of mathematics such as dynamics and probability, such definable graphs arise as limits of finite graphs, and the descriptive set-theoretic methods shed light on this asymptotic behavior.  Additionally, the analysis finds applications within descriptive set theory as well, finding new ways of stratifying the relative difficulty of various classification problems.<br/><br/>In general, the objective of the project is to understand combinatorial parameters of Borel graphs on standard Borel spaces subject to various measurability constraints.  For example, the chromatic number of a graph (the smallest cardinality of the image of a function assigning different values to adjacent vertices) typically has different values when the coloring function is required to be Borel, measurable with respect to some Borel probability measure, or Baire measurable with respect to some compatible Polish topology.  While interesting in their own right, such parameters have (often surprising) connections with other areas of mathematics -- including combinatorial and geometric group theory, ergodic theory, probability theory, and operator algebras -- and a secondary aim of the proposal is to strengthen these connections in addition to forging new ones.  More precise proposed areas of study within this general setting include: (a) existence of measurable vertex colorings, edge colorings, and matchings, (b) applications to structurability of measured equivalence relations, in particular those arising as orbit equivalence relations of probability-measure-preserving actions of locally compact Polish groups, (c) applications to the global hierarchy of Borel/measure reducibility of definable equivalence relations, especially those just above hyperfinite, (d) connections with the probabilistic aspects of graph limits."

This is achieved by associating with each<br/>collection of objects to be classified an appropriate concept of ""magnitude""<br/>or ""size"", which in a precise sense measures the difficulty of its<br/>classification problem.

The STDC is one of the longest standing regular conferences in general topology, having started in 1967 and continuing as an annual conference.  It attracts participants nationally and internationally.  The STDC regularly attracts over 150 participants, and often over 200.  There are 7 plenary talks and 12 semi-plenary talks in most areas of topology and its applications by established researchers.  Talks bridging two or more research areas are encouraged.  In a highly technological society like the USA, a high level science research, and in particular mathematics research, is crucial for further progress. Conferences are an essential part for developing successful and competitive research programs in mathematics and for the education of young researchers. The STDC has played an essential part in the success and education of many of its participants. The conference will include contributed talks by PhD students, post-doctoral students, as well as junior mathematicians, and will encourage diversity among speakers.  There are six special sessions in subareas of topology including a new session in Topology and Graph Theory. More information and an invitation to participate may be found at the conference website:  http://www.uab.edu/cas/mathematics/mathnews/stdc<br/> <br/>The 53rd Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference will run six special sessions: Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Topology, Geometric Group Theory, Set<br/>Theoretic Topology, and Topology and Graph Theory that will include most topics of contemporary research in topology as well as highlighting connections between topology and other mathematical subjects. The session on Topology and Graph Theory is being included for the first time this year.  The winner of the Mary Ellen Rudin Award for a beginning mathematician will be announced at this meeting, and will be invited to give a plenary address.  The conference has succeeded in strengthening major connections between areas which normally do not interact. Particularly effective have been interactions between dynamical systems and continuum theory, between geometric topology and continuum theory, between geometric topology and geometric group theory, and between set theoretic topology and continuum theory. The interaction between these areas and graph theory is being encouraged by particularly inviting speakers who can bridge between the former areas and graph theory. The STDC encourages these interactions by providing travel support to students, post-docs, and junior mathematicians, by encouraging the special session organizers to seek diversity in those they invite to speak in a special session, and by welcoming unsolicited submissions for speaking in a special session.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many questions in quantum information theory can be naturally studied within the mathematical framework of operator systems.  The recent realization that operator systems can be regarded as quantum analogs of graphs has stimulated work with impact in the theories of both operator systems and quantum information.  At the same time, classical notions and results from first order logic have been generalized within the framework of continuous logic to the setting where continuous structures, such as operator systems and other objects arising from quantum physics, are considered.  The main goal of this research project is to build upon these developments to extend results from discrete mathematics and classical computing to the quantum setting. The investigator will pursue this project in collaboration with students at the graduate and undergraduate level. <br/><br/>The first part of the project aims at obtaining feasible quantum algorithms to test isomorphism of operator systems.  The next step in this direction is to determine the complexity of testing isomorphism of operator systems from the perspective of quantum computation. This question is of significant current interest for its implications for quantum physics and theoretical computer science. More broadly, the goal of the investigator is to extend classical descriptive complexity theory to the quantum setting, working within the framework of continuous logic. This research has the potential to address fundamental questions about quantum computing, including characterization of problems for which quantum computing provides a super-polynomial speedup over classical computing. Further aspects of the project involve the development of the theory of noncommutative Choquet simplices within the framework of operator systems, and the use of tools from model theory to build examples of C*-algebras that are not accessible via standard constructions."

Model theory is concerned with studying structures in a formal mathematical language. One can trace its origins in Gödel?s fundamental work on the completeness of first-order logic. Gödel, in his famous completeness theorem, settled once and for all the question of how truth and provability are connected. Roughly speaking a mathematical statement is provable if and only if it is true in all possible worlds. Although model theory seems to have originated in questions around the philosophy and foundations of mathematics, in recent years profound connections with core mathematical disciplines and computer science have been found. Hyperbolic geometry emerged from the refutation of Euclid?s fifth postulate, also known as the parallel postulate. After more than twenty centuries of efforts to prove the fifth postulate as a consequence of the rest, Lobachevsky and independently Bolyai started developing geometry synthetically employing its negation. This resulted to what is nowadays known as hyperbolic geometry. Although hyperbolic geometry is counterintuitive, in reality space can be curved at places, looking like a horse saddle, and hyperbolic geometry is the right model to apply. This project investigates the connections of model theory with hyperbolic geometry by studying major open questions about the model theory of nonabelian free groups.<br/><br/>Nonabelian finitely generated free groups are prototypical examples of hyperbolic groups, i.e. finitely generated groups whose Cayley graph is a hyperbolic metric space. They have attracted much model theoretic attention after the profound result that they share the same first-order theory (Sela, Kharlampovich-Myasnikov). The latter result answered a question of Tarski that remained open for more than fifty years. Maybe surprisingly this common first-order theory is stable. Stability is a tameness condition in Shelah?s classification program and maybe the most prominent dividing line in it. A major aim of this project is the study of natural structures, like fields and groups, interpretable in the first-order theory of nonabelian free groups, which continues prior work of the PI with Ayala Byron and with Chloé Perin, Anand Pillay and Katrin Tent. The first-order theory of nonabelian free groups seems to exhibit some unexpected behavior with respect to the geometry of forking, that will be investigated by the PI. The second component of the project involves the notions of model completeness and model companion. The first-order theory of nonabelian free groups is not model complete, but it might admit a model companion. In the same line of thought properties of existentially closed subgroups of omega residually free groups will be studied. The PI will use techniques from geometric stability theory and geometric group theory. In particular, as demonstrated by previous results of the PI and others, useful tools and notions include, forking calculus, one-basedeness and in general the ample hierarchy, omega residually free towers, test sequences, and the understanding of group actions through Rips machine. A more general goal of the project is to develop methods to tackle similar questions in wider classes of groups, like hyperbolic groups, free products of groups or right-angled Artin groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Combinatorics is the area of mathematics concerning discrete structures, such as graphs, which can be viewed as mathematical objects representing networks consisting of nodes with links between them. This area has experienced immense growth in the past several decades, owing in part to its close connection to computer science. Recently, it has become apparent that combinatorial insights can shed new light on problems in other, seemingly unrelated, areas, such as ergodic theory - the study of the evolution of dynamical systems, encompassing a range of applications from epidemic models to planetary motion. It turns out that one can often associate a graph or another discrete structure to a dynamical system and then use combinatorial methods to elucidate its properties. The goals of this project are to extend the range of applications of this approach and develop new powerful combinatorial tools for the needs of other areas. The PI will work with graduate and undergraduate students through problem solving workshops and other collaborations. <br/><br/>More specifically, this project revolves around transferring ideas from graph coloring theory and probabilistic combinatorics to the setting where it is necessary to fulfill additional regularity constraints (measure-theoretic, topological, etc.). Particular avenues of investigation that will be covered in this project include: (a) studying the extent to which classical probabilistic tools, especially the Lovász Local Lemma, can be extended to the measurable framework; (b) finding new methods for building measurable colorings, matchings, and other useful structures in graphs; (c) applying combinatorial techniques to attack major open problems in dynamical systems, such as the entropy problem and the Ellis problem; and (d) studying the interplay between descriptive set theory and computer science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Surprisingly, for such a general context, we can say meaningful things, discovering new general laws on the one hand and giving new methods for concrete mathematical theories on the other. Model-theoretic classification theory gives an approach to discovering the general laws: informally, it aims to isolate so-called dividing lines where a significant structural change in the class of theories may be detected, and in parallel to develop the internal theory to understand what is producing the phenomena observed. One such dividing line has to do with whether theories have nontrivial randomness.  Current methods have been successful in many ways on the non-random side. This project concerns independent theories, those on the random side. The randomness complicates to varying degrees the ability of current methods to gauge the full structure. This research works towards a more fundamental understanding of such theories, using a range of classical and newly developed tools able to detect average behavior and changes in the complexity of model-theoretic randomness. Along with the research developments, the project will support the training of students at various levels.<br/><br/>More precisely, the project aims to study independent theories, those with the independence property. The following interrelated test problems guide the work in this project. The first concerns characterizing saturated models of simple theories in a way analogous to the known characterization for stable theories, as a test problem for understanding of the building blocks of simple unstable theories. An approach to this question, of independent interest, involves developing a recently introduced generalization of forking. A second problem involves characterizing and developing a structure theory for a certain interesting class of simple theories 'near' the random graph. A third is to investigate the structure of quotients of Keisler's order. A fourth is to find true dividing lines within the class of independent theories and in parallel to develop the internal theory justifying these as dividing lines. These questions themselves connect to the classical problem of understanding the so called Keisler order, whose structure on dependent theories is known but whose structure on the independent theories remains in some senses mysterious.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The language we have in mind is the language of polynomial equations, the same polynomial equations one first encounters in an Algebra class in high school.  Despite its basic nature this language possesses enormous complexity and descriptive power which were not always well-understood by mathematicians.   About fifty years ago it was proved that no computer program can determine whether a certain kind of statement in this language is true even when the objects being described are sets of natural numbers, quite familiar to everyone since childhood.  In other words, no computer program can determine whether an arbitrary polynomial equation in several variables has a solution in integer numbers. On the other hand, if one asks the same question about rational numbers, one is confronted with one of the many basic questions concerning polynomial equations to which the answer is unknown.  Understanding and trying to tackle this question and other related ones requires interaction of and input from several fields of Mathematics such as Logic, Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, and Topology.  At the same time, the questions and methods developed for the study of the language of polynomial equations lead to new results and research directions in the areas of Mathematics mentioned above. This project involves graduate student training and it will develop an online collaboration platform.<br/> <br/> <br/>This project considers several problems in definability and computability over arithmetically significant fields, that is fields of importance to Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, Model Theory, Computability Theory and Valuation Theory.  The  research problems are at the intersection of all these areas of Mathematics.  While the methods employed are for the most part (though most definitely not always) algebraic or geometric in nature, the questions originate in Logic.  More specifically, the Principal Investigators intend to study computability and definability in the first-order and/or existential language of rings over number fields, their rings of integers and their infinite algebraic extensions.  Another set of related problems concerns computability and definability over function fields and rings of all characteristics.  Some of the main outstanding questions in the area concern extensions of Hilbert?s Tenth Problem to the field of rational numbers and rings of algebraic integers, decidability of the first-order theory of the largest abelian extension of rational numbers, definability of valuation rings in function fields over global and local fields, algebraically closed fields, and other classes of arithmetically significant base fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most fruitful developments in this field has been the study of the algorithmic content of mathematics. At the same time, concerns about the foundations of mathematics have led to the analysis of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning, and the study of the relative power of such systems. The computability-theoretic approach has turned out to play a key role in this project. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics whose methods and results underlie a great deal of mathematical reasoning, so the study of its algorithmic content and of the systems required to formalize its methods is particularly important. Computable combinatorics has a long history, but has seen a recent surge of interest highlighting the fact that computability-theoretically natural notions tend to be combinatorially natural, and vice-versa. This project aims to strengthen the connections between computability theory and combinatorics by increasing our understanding of the algorithmic content of combinatorial principles, through a concerted group effort to use what we have learned in recent years to systematize the area further, work toward solving a number of its outstanding questions, and explore its outward-facing aspects.<br/><br/>This project will address major open problems such as determining whether Hindman's Theorem holds arithmetically, and whether it is equivalent to its restriction to sums of length at most two; determining the first-order part of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs, and clarifying the computability-theoretic relationship between this principle and its stable version; and determining the exact proof-theoretic strength of Laver's Theorem. More importantly, it will focus on the development of lines of research particularly relevant to the growing interest in connections between computability theory and combinatorics, including the study of questions of methodological interest to combinatorialists, for instance ones involving Hindman's Theorem and the use of ultrafilters in combinatorics; the development of new proofs of combinatorial theorems inspired by questions regarding the computational content of these theorems, along the lines of Montalban's new proof of Laver's Theorem; the analysis and comparison of different general methods, such as the use of ultrafilters, topological dynamics, and probabilistic methods; the development of notions of comparison between theorems that, while still computability-theoretic in spirit, are closer to being direct reflections of combinatorial differences; the understanding of splittings of combinatorial principles into computationally and combinatorially simpler parts; the study of the usefulness of combinatorially-defined objects as computational oracles; and the study of the first-order consequences of the existence of combinatorially-defined second-order objects. This project is thus aimed at developing the study of the connections between computability theory and combinatorics along a large number of related directions, making use of the computability-theoretic, proof-theoretic, and combinatorial expertise of its PIs, senior personnel, and key collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These questions naturally admit, and benefit from, ideas and methods from graph theory and finite combinatorics. More precisely, Malliaris will work to further develop the theory of characteristic sequences, which are countable sequences of hypergraphs defined on the parameter space of a first-order formula. Malliaris has shown that a deep collection of techniques from graph theory and combinatorics, including Szemeredi regularity, can be brought to bear on model-theoretic structure via the characteristic sequence. Malliaris proposes to further explore these promising connections, which are relevant to many structural questions in unstable theories, including the fine structure of order and independence and the classification of theories with the independence property, as well as to understanding the model-theoretic significance of graph-theoretic phenomena such as edge density and hypergraph regularity in this context.  Moreover, these investigations shed light on the ways in which families of types are realized and omitted in regular ultrapowers, and are therefore relevant to the longstanding open problem of the structure of Keisler's order on unstable theories (a preorder on countable theories which, roughly speaking, measures the difficulty of producing saturated regular ultrapowers).<br/><br/>Model theory is a branch of mathematics which studies the fundamental structure of certain classes of mathematical objects, the models of a given theory. The structural variation which occurs within a given class (or between comparable models of different classes) sheds light on the inherent simplicity, or complexity, of the theory itself.  The work in this proposal arises from new indications that certain theories may have deep and previously undetected structural similarities. These similarities have to do with possible limit behavior, that is, with the complexity of infinite configurations which arise from families of finite combinatorial objects within models of the theory. One broad aim of this work is the development of finer tools to detect this behavior in certain invariants of the theory (e.g. the persistence and distribution of graphs in the characteristic sequence of certain formulas of T).  These ideas would give new leverage in the ongoing program of classifying unstable theories. Model-theoretic classification theory has, over the last forty years, developed a richly informative toolbox for analyzing the complexity of first-order theories and isolated many useful indicators of complexity, but much remains to be done. In particular, a second underlying goal of this work is to give a language in which to precisely ask, and to explore, the largely open questions of distribution and density of these indicators: how and where they cluster and how they interact with other objects in the model, e.g. base sets for types."

At the same time, developments in the foundations of mathematics led to the investigation of the relative power of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning. These two areas of inquiry turn out to be closely related, and this project is concerned with questions at their intersection. It aims to further our understanding of how structure affects computability, and how computability interacts with other fundamental notions such as randomness, the power of formal systems, and the interactions between formal systems and the mathematical structures they describe.<br/><br/>In particular, this project lies in two related areas: computable mathematics and reverse mathematics of combinatorial, model theoretic, and related principles; and notions of robust information coding, including their connections with algorithmic randomness. Reverse mathematics and computable mathematics are closely related and complementary approaches to calibrating the strength of theorems and constructions throughout mathematics, and revealing the fundamental structure behind them. The investigation of combinatorial and model-theoretic principles from this point of view has proved to be a particularly rich line of research, and this project will pursue it from several angles, for instance the study of first order consequences of second order principles and notions of computability theoretic reduction that provide a particularly fine-grained analysis of the comparative strength of mathematical statements. Several of the combinatorial principles that play a central role in this area concern the existence of particular kinds of subobjects, which leads to a natural connection with the investigation of notions of robust information coding, which are reducibilities capturing the idea of being able to obtain partial information about an object from partial information about another. This project will further the study of these notions, in particular versions of infinite information reducibility, which are particularly closely connected with the computability theoretic aspects of versions of Ramsey's Theorem, and versions of coarse reducibility, which have already been found to have significant connections with algorithmic randomness."

Immediate goals include advancing the core model induction technique beyond its current levels, and computing better consistency lower bounds for the failure of  square at a measurable cardinal. <br/><br/>Mathematics is the language of science; it is what is used to express scientific predictions and theories. Mathematics is simply the most fundamental and indispensable part of science. However, just as scientific achievements must be tested for their validity, mathematical discoveries too must be tested for their consistency. Mathematical theories are based on axioms known as the axioms of Zermelo-Frankel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). Provided that the proofs from ZFC and its various extensions are correct, it is believed that the resulting theories are correct. Set theory is the part of mathematics that deals with the consistency of ZFC and its extensions via Large Cardinal Axioms (LCA). Because of the celebrated Godel's incompleteness theorem one cannot hope to prove that ZFC or any of its extensions are consistent. Nevertheless, one can hope to provide naturally occurring models for ZFC + LCA in the same spirit that the set of natural numbers is the natural model of the axioms of Peano Arithmetic (PA). PA is the axiomatic system that guides and controls the usage of arithmetic in everyday life. The inner model program is a set theoretic program whose primary goal is to construct such canonical models for ZFC + LCA. The proposed project is a contribution to the inner model program. One specific objective of the proposed project is to advance the most successful recent method for constructing natural models for various extensions of ZFC, the core model induction, to new levels, and thus to construct natural models for extensions of ZFC that were unreachable before."

First, the classical subject of descriptive set theory has been found, in combination with techniques of ergodic theory and superrigidity theory, to have extensive applications to the analysis of problems of classification in algebra and elsewhere. In particular the subject of Borel equivalence relations will be applied to problems in geometric group theory, revolving around the central notion of quasi-isometry.  The now classical theory of Borel reductions will be sharpened by considering continuous reductions, which correspond in a number of cases to ""natural"" or ""invariant"" constructions. Second, the techniques of model theory will be applied to settle certain problems in combinatorics, notably the problem of the existence of universal graphs subject to one forbidden subgraph, and the classification of the metrically homogeneous graphs, first proposed in 1998 by Cameron and subsequently seen to have connections with topological dyamics in work of Kechris, Pestov, and Todorcevic. In both cases, new examples of homogeneous structures will be identified (in an appropriate refinement of the category of graphs), and then the relation to topological dynamics will involve the further study of structural Ramsey theory in the associated classes of finite structures.  The proposal includes a visitors' program based on extended visits by Saharon Shelah, one of the world's preeminent mathematical logicians, and a variety of his collaborators, who will collaborate on aspects of the proposed research, both on the side of descriptive set theory and in the applications to combinatorics.<br/><br/>The thrust of the research is interdisciplinary. The notion of classification is fundamental to many branches of mathematical research, and techniques of mathematical logic, in combination with more specialized tools from other branches of mathematics, some the result of very recent breakthroughs, make it possible to analyze the scope and limitations of this method, revealing a wealth of structure. The techniques of mathematical logic also provide a very broad perspective on problems of combinatorics, raising issues of computability and providing new and systematic techniques for the resolution of concrete problems regarding the complexity of classes of finite structures, and the problem of the existence of a single infinite limit of such a class with a tractable structure, which provides a way for distinguishing ""chaotic"" from ""highly structured"" classes, and the identification of new cases which can be analyzed structurally."

In 60s and 70s, major progress was made towards the resolution of the problem. In particular, such canonical models were constructed for many large cardinals in the region of measurable cardinals and strong cardinals. However, soon new obstacles were discovered and through a fundamental work done by Martin, Steel and Woodin, it became increasingly clear that the ultimate resolution of the problem has to incorporate ideas from descriptive set theory. In late 80s and early 90s, Martin, Steel and Woodin, discovered many bridges between inner model theory and descriptive set theory thus unifying the two areas of set theory. Descriptive inner model theory is the theory that has emerged through their work. Its main technical problem is the descriptive version of the inner model problem, namely, the problem of constructing canonical models capturing the truth. While many formal versions of this problem are available, the one that has been publicized most is the Mouse Set Conjecture (MSC) which conjectures that in models of determinacy, ordinal definability, the most powerful form of definability, can be captured via canonical models of set theory. Sargsyan, in his thesis, building on an earlier work of Woodin, developed techniques for proving MSC and used these techniques to obtained some partial results on MSC. These partial results then were translated into the ordinary language of inner model theory, producing canonical models with large cardinals. Sargsyan believes that the descriptive approach to the inner model problem is the most promising route to the resolution of the 50 year old inner model problem and he plans to pursue it further.<br/><br/>Set theory is the language of mathematics. It provides the basic foundations above which the rest of mathematics is build. One of the most basic problems in the foundations of mathematic has been the reduction of all of mathematics into basic set of axioms whose consistency can either be proven or convincingly argued for. Gödel's celebrated incompleteness theorems imply that the first option is impossible. However, because of major developments in the previous century, the second option is possible via a class of axioms of infinity known as large cardinal axioms which assert the existence of very large sets. Virtually, as Gödel himself predicted, every know natural mathematical theory has been reduced to some large cardinal axiom. The set theorists of the 21st century inherited the problem of arguing for the consistency of such axioms which is usually done by exhibiting canonical examples or rather models of such axioms. The problem of exhibiting such canonical models for large cardinals has been known as the inner model problem which is the main subject of the proposed research."

The space Riem(M) of Riemannian metrics (modulo diffeomorphisms) on certain manifolds is of considerable interest to a wide variety of mathematicians and physicists.  Topologists have proved for certain natural scale invariant functionals related to diameter on the space Riem(M), and for certain manifolds M of dimension > 4 that for every c.e. set A there is a sequence of points x_n, n in N, the integers, such that if n in A then x_n determines a local minimum on Riem(M) whose depth is roughly equal to the halting time of the Turing machine computation that n in A.  The investigator constructed an infinite sequence of sets A_i, i in N, of c.e. sets so that for all n the settling function (for stopping times of the associated Turing machine) of A_i dominates that of A_{i+1}, even when the latter is composed with an arbitrary computable function.  The two results together give a ""fractal"" like behavior with extremely big basins, and very much smaller basins coming off them, and those containing still smaller basins, and so on, where the relative size of one set of basins to the next exceeds any computable function, what the topologists describe in their paper on fractals as ""the astonishing richness of the space of Riemannian metrics on a smooth manifold, up to reparametrization.''  The investigator's work will also stress connections of computability to model theory and algebraic structures. With a junior colleague and a graduate student he will classify the degree spectrum of models which are prime or saturated but which have no computable isomorphic copy.  Finally, he will continue his work on the automorphisms and structure of c.e. sets.

Thomas will study interactions of set theory and group theory in connection with automorphism towers and the cofinalities of infinite analogs of finite groups, making use of forcing, pcf theory, and large cardinals, as well as character theory. An outstanding problem is the relationship of the cofinality of the infinite symmetric group to Blass' invariant, the groupwise density.  The role of matrix groups in modern mathematics is well established and occupies a central place in both pure and applied mathematics.  It has been conjectured that these groups also play a predominant role in the detailed analysis of many apparently unrelated structures of general type.  One of the goals of the present project is to confirm this in the so-called ``tame case'', which is more immediately accessible. A separate goal is to demonstrate that standard ideas of logic (model theory) can cast new light on existing problems in combinatorics (graph theory).  It is hoped that graph theorists will themselves adopt these methods in such cases. The work of Thomas uncovers previously unsuspected relations between algebraic and set theoretical issues, and should lead to new ``forcing'' tools, which are among the most powerful foundational tools of modern set theory.

How might we compare their complexity in a productive way? The foundations of the present approach to this question were built in the 1960s with the development of the ultrapower construction. Roughly speaking, ultrapowers give a way of amplifying the original object in accordance with a coherent set of conditions, called an ultrafilter. Different ultrafilters produce different amplifications, but nonetheless by observing the range and characteristics of such amplifications  it is in a few fundamental cases possible, and in more complex cases conjecturally possible, to detect and classify the basic drivers of structure. One can make this description precise via a pre-order known as ""Keisler's order. Some important and striking special cases of the structure of Keisler's order were worked out in the seventies within the mathematical field of model theory and were very productive for its development. The difficulty in going further had long been double: a mathematical theory sufficient to detect and explain the details of the amplification by ultrafilters had not been developed, and little was known about the construction of ultrafilters - perhaps they may vary much more than the known examples suggest.  The PI's 2009 PhD thesis and early papers re-opened this area, developing our understanding of the interaction of ultrafilters and theories. Among these developments were connections to some phenomena in extremal combinatorics, such as Szemeredi's celebrated regularity lemma. Recently, joint work of the PI and Shelah has leveraged this developing approach to the comparison of complexity to solve problems in diverse areas of mathematics, such as a sixty-year-old question about cardinal invariants of the continuum and a characterization of the existence of irregular pairs in the regularity lemma.  A broad aim of the present project is therefore to develop our understanding of the nature of the complexity which ultrafilters detect and classify, in light of its possible applications, while addressing related problems from model theoretic classification theory and working to settle certain basic questions about the structure of Keisler's order. By means of assistantships, courses, summer programs, and visits, the project aims to include both undergraduates and graduate students from within the PI's institution and to support visitors with a range of relevant expertise. A component of the associated education project will involve training mathematically talented high school students.<br/><br/><br/>In more detail, the proposed research concerns a large-scale classification program in model theory, which builds a framework for comparing the complexity of theories, and its emerging connections to the study of complexity in finite combinatorics, set theory, and general topology.  A longstanding open problem in this context is the problem of determining the structure of Keisler's 1967 order on theories. Recall that if D is a regular ultrafilter on I, and M, N are elementarily equivalent models in a countable language, we have that the D-ultrapower of M realizes all types over sets of size no more than |I| iff the D-ultrapower of N does. If so, let T be the associated theory, and let us say that D saturates T. Keisler's (pre-)order on countable theories, often considered as a partial order on the equivalence classes, sets T less than or equal to T' if every regular ultrafilter which saturates T' also saturates T. Three main research aims of the present project are the following.  The first is to investigate the model theory of simple unstable theories via the framework of Keisler's order. The second is to build the beginnings of a structure theory for the class of theories which are not simple but do not have the strong tree property SOP2, those conjecturally not maximal in Keisler's order, and to address related questions of ultrafilter construction. The third is to develop further the interactions with Szemeredi regularity and Ramsey theory and to investigate the effectiveness of earlier results with a view towards applications."

Certain categories of such quotients exhibit a strong permanence property: a structure reducible to another  one is either very simple, or it inherits characteristic properties of the more complex structure. Via a theory of liftings previously developed by the investigator, this phenomenon is now well understood for some  classes of groups and Boolean algebras, in the contexts of both decriptive and combinatorial set theory. (The former corresponding to the situation in which we study only the simply definable sets of real numbers and the latter corresponding to the situation in which we accept the Axiom of Choice and study arbitrary sets of reals in an appropriate ambient theory.) The investigator plans to further this research into the realm of Borel equivalence relations induced by Polish group actions.  An example of an important problem that may yield to such a technique is an isolation of a simple basis for turbulent orbit equivalence relations. <br/><br/>Quotient of a mathematical structure is formed by identifying its elements that differ ""in an inessential way.""  Different applications require different understanding of what is ""inessential,"" and therefore single structure gives rise to a multitude of quotients with rather  diverse properties. Some of them are reducible to the original structure, but the resulting quotient is frequently, yet somewhat paradoxically, much more complex than the underlying space.   One of the goals of this project is in finding a simple basis for a  class of quotients corresponding to the new notion of  ""magnitude"" introduced in order to study difficulties of classification problems in mathematics and extensively studied during the last decade.  Basis is a set, typically small, of objects from a given class that  are ""critical"" in the sense that every object reduces one from the basis. Canonical objects consisting the basis are easier to understand than the arbitrary ""generic"" objects, yet the intrinsic properties of the latter are reflected in the former. Therefore the basic objects provide a paradigm for studying the whole class.   <br/>"

Uniformity has to be understood here in the following sense. Suppose an  algebraic-geometric object, such as  a variety or a coherent sheaf,  is presented to us by means of some polynomials over an algebraically closed field. From this object other objects or invariants can be derived by applying some algebraic-geometric process. The question posed is now when can this  construction be carried out by using only polynomials of degree bounded by the degree of the initial polynomials? In particular, when is an invariant associated to this object uniformly bounded by the initial degrees only? Provided such uniform bounds exist, the following transfer principle can be applied. Encode, allowing negations and quantification, the construction or some of its properties in the field by means of the coefficients of the polynomials involved--the existence of uniform bounds is certainly a necessary, but often even a sufficient condition for this to hold. Then use the Lefschetz Principle to carry over results from positive characteristic to zero characteristic, or, conversely, from zero characteristic  to almost all positive characteristics. The investigator has already successfully applied this method to the following non-trivial facts: the Bass Conjecture, the Zariski-Lipman Conjecture and the New Intersection Theorem. In this proposal, he is especially interested in applications to tight closure in characteristic zero. Moreover, he proposes to infer from the existence of uniform bounds, the constructible nature of certain algebraic-geometric constructions. For instance, he seeks to continue the following program originally initiated by Nagata and Grothendieck: for a given geometric property of a point on a variety,  when is the set of all points on the variety for which this property  holds, constructible?<br/><br/>This program provides an alternative approach to some open problems in the field, as well as a simplified treatment of previous results. The author takes a special interest in the following old problem, simple to state but yet so far resisting all known proof methods: is every curve in three dimensional space obtained by intersecting two surfaces? On a deeper level, the current proposal can be seen as an attempt to analyze and better understand the constructive nature of Algebraic Geometry, by looking at it from a logicians point of view. In this way, the Principal Investigator intends to present the domain in a more coherent and unified way and obtain an improved link between Geometry and Algebra.<br/>"

The first objective is to study computability on the computably enumerable sets, and to relate their algebraic structure to the degree of information they encode and to the speed with which they can be enumerated with respect to some measure of computational complexity.  Here attention is focused on the computably enumerable sets because they are generated by an algorithm, and hence most easily approximated by a computable function.  The second objective is to study the relationship of computability to other mathematical objects, for example to models of Peano arithmetic, and to algebraic structures, such as Boolean algebras, and models of special theories like totally transcendental ones.  For algebraic structures, the general problem is to determine exactly what information can be coded into the isomorphism type of that structure.    The fundamental aim is to deepen our understanding of computability and its relation to structures in mathematics and computer science.  In the 1930's various definitions of computable function were proposed by Turing, Church, Kleene, Goedel, and others.  They were soon proved equivalent and they (particularly Turing's model) contributed during the war to the development of high speed digital computers.  These models can be restricted with respect to computing resources such as time and space and give rise to computational complexity, an important part of modern computer science.  Computability and algorithms now permeate many aspects of our lives.  Modern researchers in computability and complexity are heirs to the founders like Turing and Goedel in that they are trying to classify the computable content of modern mathematics."

He is interested in proving undecidability of fragments of  elementary theories consisting of sentences with few quantifier  alternations, in particular, for theories of classes of finite  groups, the theory of finite distributive lattices, and for the   theory of the lattice E of enumerable sets.  Interest in such fragments   arises from their containing the first-order sentences that usually occur  in mathematical practice.  Moreover, he will work toward determining the   complexity of theories of degree structures from structural complexity   theory and toward using coding methods to investigate model-theoretic  properties of the structure D of enumerable Turing degrees.  Both E and D  are central structures in computability theory.  Also using coding methods,  he intends to prove nonelementary equivalence of various degree structures  and intends to introduce a measure of the informational content of  isomorphism types of structures belonging to various classes of structures  from model theory.  In a further project, he plans to separate complexity  classes that are generalizations of deterministic and nondeterministic  linear time.

The decoding key consists of a collection of formulas  in first-order logic, a formal language which can be viewed as a   formalization of a major part of natural language within mathematics.

Undecidable sets can vary with respect to  their computational complexity.  The goals here, beyond determining the  complexity of the associated first-order theory, are to find out the  symmetries of the structures and to find a simple characterization of these  structures.

Nies will study this question for the theories of nonabelian free groups and for the degree structure of recursively enumerable reals compared under Solovay's domination reducibility.  As a main tool, he will use coding with first-order formulas.  This method yields not only undecidability of the elementary theory of a structure, but also further global properties of the structure itself (rather than its theory). Typical results obtained by this method are definability results and limitations on automorphisms.  Nies will study such properties, in particular for the central structure of recursively enumerable Turing degrees.      Nies' work introduces a unifying aspect into the vast and diverging area of modern mathematics, by analyzing through common methods structures from such different domains as computability theory and analysis. These methods are called coding methods. They consist of representing an object of one kind in an object of a second kind (the structure under investigation) using first order formulas.  First-order languages are central to mathematical logic and computer science.  In a sense, they are a formalization of a fragment of natural language. The first-order theory of a structure is the collection of   all facts about the structure which can be expressed in that language.  For instance, the existence of infinitely many prime numbers is a first-order fact about the structure of natural numbers (with addition and multiplication). In part, Nies investigates the question whether first-order theories are decidable. Moreover, he uses coding methods to explore global properties of the structures, like the existence of symmetries.  In several cases, the structures investigate d are considered central for the area in question (like free groups in algebra or the structure of recursively enumerable Turing degrees in computability theory)."

The origins of the fields trace back to David Hilbert's program from the 1900's and to the work by Gödel, Church, and Turing that proved several aspects of this program impossible: there are problems in elementary number theory that do not have computable solutions. Since then, incomputable problems have been identified in many different subfields of mathematics. Most famously, the solution sets to some Diophantine equations and the word problem for some finitely presented groups are incomputable. Computability theory proposes frameworks to study the relative algorithmic complexity of such problems. This project proposes an in-depth investigation of two related frameworks in computability theory, and the complex structures that they give rise to. The project presents a diverse array of research avenues, suitable for all levels of experience. Soskova and Miller intend to continue their collaboration with undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students and facilitate the quick immersion of young researchers into this area through two textbooks: a beginner level Computability Theory textbook and a more specialized advanced textbook on the precise topic studied within this project. They also maintain a visual online database that allows the quick identification of open problems. The project will support women's engagement in the field through a mentorship program organized by Soskova within the CiE Women in Computability focus group. Soskova and Miller will continue to support the Logic Community by organizing scientific meetings and through their editorial work.<br/><br/>In computability theory, the Turing degrees are used to measure the effective content of sets of natural numbers. This measure can be extended to capture the effective content of other objects in mathematics, such as the real numbers. In other cases, Turing reducibility is not sufficient. For example, Miller proved that it is not possible to assign a Turing degree to every continuous function on the unit interval. In that and many other cases, an extension of Turing reducibility, enumeration reducibility, turns out to provide a better framework for effective mathematics. In 1967, Rogers posed a list of problems that strongly influenced the development of computability theory. One of these problems asks whether the partial orders of the Turing degrees and the enumeration degrees are rigid structures, i.e., have no nontrivial automorphisms. Slaman and Woodin proved that the rigidity of the Turing degrees is equivalent to a complete characterization of its definable relations and to its biinterpretability with second order arithmetic. Building on this, Soskova proved that the same equivalence holds for the enumeration degrees. Miller and Soskova (with collaborators) answered another problem from the list: there is a first order definable copy of the Turing degrees inside the enumeration degrees. This established a link between the rigidity problems for the two structures; if the Turing degrees are rigid then so are the enumeration degrees. The rigidity of the enumeration degrees, while still open, could turn out to be more approachable. Definability within the enumeration degrees has already proved more approachable. The goal of this project is to expand our understanding of the structure of the enumeration degrees and its nontrivial connections to effective mathematics, with a focus on computable topology. We would like to accumulate new methods investigate combinatorial properties of the structure, and isolate special classes of degrees that determine the logical character of the structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some tame classes of operations are singled out for which then general theorems can be proved. Those in turn will apply to specific situations in different areas of mathematics (algebra, geometry, number theory...). This project lies at the border between the abstract and the applied side. The investigator plans to study two rather broad notions of tameness and apply this study to certain algebraic structures. <br/><br/>More precisely, the aim of this project is the study of definable groups in NIP and NTP_2 structures and more specifically in valued fields, and PRC fields and the general development of NTP_2. Our guiding intuition is that in NTP_2, ideals should work as a common generalization of non-forking extensions in simple theories and measures in NIP. Also, there should be an analogue of distality in this setting. On the more applied side, we plan to develop tools for the study of non-definably amenable groups both in NIP and NTP_2; test questions being the classification of all groups definable in PRC fields and a decomposition theorem for non-abelian metastable groups."

The principal investigator has shown that a limited amount of errors in the operation of a random number generator can lead to a loss of randomness that cannot be compensated for using algorithms. A main goal is to determine if at any point true randomness can be reconstructed as the amount of such errors becomes small. The results already obtained were proved using probabilistic potential theory and random closed sets. This approach in conjunction with work by other researchers has lead to a richer picture of the possible notions of randomness for fractional effective Hausdorff dimension, and opened up questions about a link with a statistical-mechanical interpretation of algorithmic information theory. A secondary but also integral part of the project is the computability-theoretic analysis of probability. An example here is the determination of the Kolmogorov complexity of finite strings describing random walks that approximate Brownian motion.<br/><br/>The project aims to further the understanding of random objects in computability-theoretic terms, and help clarify the theoretical limitations of random number generation, a field of wide application in science and engineering. In particular, the aim is to understand to what extent one can repair damaged randomness sources, or prove that such a repair is impossible. The goal is not necessarily to reconstruct the original undamaged random data but to obtain some random data. The notion of particular data being random can be made precise using the theory of Turing computability. The idea is that a sequence of 0s and 1s is random for all practical purposes if no computer algorithm can detect any pattern in it. Thanks to the work of Alan Turing and others, this idea can be studied abstractly without worrying about particular physical computers and implementations. Conversely, the theoretical study of algorithms played a large role in the development of modern computers. Turing computability has been used in many areas of mathematics to show that certain tasks cannot be carried out by any algorithm. For example, Matiyasevich showed this for the task of finding an integer root of a polynomial equation. Applying this computability theory to probability and randomness is especially fruitful. The theory of probability predicts what properties the outcome of an experiment will have, without necessarily giving any specific example of a reasonable ?random? outcome. For instance, the experiment of throwing a dart at a dart board can result in any region of the board being hit, but will never result in a perfect bulls-eye or any other predefined point on the board. In theory there will always be a small error, perhaps invisible to the naked eye; this can be expressed by saying that the result of the experiment is an algorithmically random point on the dart board. One can also study how algorithmically random a sequence of observations must be for the scientific method to yield information about the phenomenon underlying the observations via the methods of statistics. The mathematical delineation of the intuitive notion of an individual random object as one having no computable or definable unlikely properties may contribute to a better appreciation of probability and randomness by scientists as well as the general public.<br/>"

This project investigates further these connections, in particular in the context of graphs (mathematical ways of describing networks and related systems) and group actions (mathematical ways of describing collections of symmetries of a space). This study has the potential to open up a route for applications of the powerful infinitary model-theoretic machinery to open questions in finite graph combinatorics, and conversely for applications of deep results in combinatorics to open questions in model theory.<br/><br/>Motivated by Morley's conjecture on the possible number of uncountable models of first-order theories, Shelah isolated several important classes of ""tame"" theories and developed a rich machinery for analyzing models and definable sets for some of those classes, particularly for stable theories. Later work by many researchers demonstrated that notions and methods of generalized stability reflect important phenomena in other areas of mathematics. This project will investigate two such connections. 1) Improved Ramsey-type bounds and strong regularity lemmas were obtained for semi-algebraic graphs by Fox et al. and for algebraic graphs in large finite fields by Tao, with numerous applications in the corresponding areas. These results can naturally be viewed as results about graphs definable in certain structures fitting into the classification picture. 2) Study of definable group actions turns out to be closely related to certain questions in topological dynamics, especially around weakly almost periodic dynamical systems and tame systems studied by Glasner and others. The investigator will work on developing further methods of generalized stability and applying them to questions in combinatorics of graphs definable in various ""tame"" structures (stable, o-minimal, distal, dependent) and to study dynamical properties of definable group actions in those structures."

The notion of a scale is a central<br/>structural concept in descriptive set theory, and the axiom of<br/>determinacy was used to develop the scale theory of the<br/>projective sets, which was later extended throughout the entire<br/>model.  The scale theory by itself, however, is not sufficient to<br/>answer many questions.  A more detailed inductive analysis was<br/>begun in the mid 1980s which was successful at the lower levels<br/>of the model, including the projective sets.  This theory does<br/>not currently extend through the entire model, and finding such<br/>an extension remains a central goal.  Recently, several new lines<br/>of investigation have opened up, relating in some way to the<br/>theory of this model.  One such direction concerns investigating<br/>the connections between the existing theory of this model and the<br/>theory of ultrafilters (Shelah's p.c.f. theory).  Preliminary<br/>results, which use centrally Woodin's theory of the nonstationary<br/>ideal, suggest strong collapsing principles apply as one moves<br/>from the inner model to the real universe.  Exactly what is<br/>forced to collapse, and what principles govern this phenomenon,<br/>is a topic of investigation.  Finding and establishing principles<br/>independent of the complete inductive analysis might also provide<br/>a framework for propagating a basic ""skeleton"" of the analysis<br/>through the entire model.<br/><br/>This project attempts to advance the understanding of the<br/>mathematical universe of sets.  All of mathematics takes place<br/>within this universe, and progress here is important not only<br/>foundationally, but because of the direct influence on the<br/>various branches of mathematics.  It has been known for some time<br/>that strong assumptions are needed to answer many basic<br/>mathematical questions.  Identifying these assumptions and<br/>exploring their consequences is a major theme in set theory.  The<br/>axiom of determinacy is an important example of such an axiom.<br/>This was formulated in the 1960s but the full extent of its<br/>consequences is not known.  Recent evidence suggests that it may<br/>shed light on some basic mathematical questions, such as the<br/>continuum hypothesis (the question of how many real numbers there<br/>are).<br/>"

First, the theory of models of arithmetic, usually considered to stand somewhat apart from set theory, has several fundamental questions exhibiting a deep set-theoretic nature, and an inter-speciality approach now seems called for. The most recent advances on Scott?s problem, for example, involve a sophisticated blend of techniques from models of arithmetic and the Proper Forcing Axiom. <br/>Second, large cardinal indestructibility lies at the intersection of forcing and large cardinals, two central concerns of contemporary set-theoretic research and the core area of much of Professor Hamkins? <br/>prior work, and recent advances have uncovered a surprisingly robust new phenomenon for relatively small large cardinals. The strongly unfoldable cardinals especially have served recently as a surprisingly efficacious substitute for supercompact cardinals in various large cardinal phenomena, including indestructibility and the consistency of fragments of the Proper Forcing Axiom. Third, Professor Hamkins will investigate questions in the emerging set-theoretic focus on second and higher order features of the set-theoretic universe.<br/><br/>This research in mathematical logic and set theory concentrates on topics at the foundations of mathematics, exploring the nature of mathematical infinity and the possibility of alternative mathematical universes. Our understanding of mathematical infinity, fascinating mathematicians and philosophers for centuries, has now crystallized in the large cardinal hierarchy, and a central concern of Professor Hamkins' research will be to investigate how large cardinals are affected by forcing, the technique invented by Paul Cohen by which set theorists construct alternative mathematical universes. The diversity of these universes is astonishing, and set theorists are now able to construct models of set theory to exhibit precise pre-selected features.<br/>In his final project, Professor Hamkins will pursue research aimed at an understanding of the most fundamental relations between the universe and these alternative mathematical worlds.<br/><br/>"

One of the most fruitful developments in this field has been the study of the algorithmic content of mathematics. At the same time, concerns about the foundations of mathematics have led to the analysis of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning, and the study of the relative power of such systems. The computability-theoretic approach has turned out to play a key role in this project. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics whose methods and results underlie a great deal of mathematical reasoning, so the study of its algorithmic content and of the systems required to formalize its methods is particularly important. Computable combinatorics has a long history, but has seen a recent surge of interest highlighting the fact that computability-theoretically natural notions tend to be combinatorially natural, and vice-versa. This project aims to strengthen the connections between computability theory and combinatorics by increasing our understanding of the algorithmic content of combinatorial principles, through a concerted group effort to use what we have learned in recent years to systematize the area further, work toward solving a number of its outstanding questions, and explore its outward-facing aspects.<br/><br/>This project will address major open problems such as determining whether Hindman's Theorem holds arithmetically, and whether it is equivalent to its restriction to sums of length at most two; determining the first-order part of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs, and clarifying the computability-theoretic relationship between this principle and its stable version; and determining the exact proof-theoretic strength of Laver's Theorem. More importantly, it will focus on the development of lines of research particularly relevant to the growing interest in connections between computability theory and combinatorics, including the study of questions of methodological interest to combinatorialists, for instance ones involving Hindman's Theorem and the use of ultrafilters in combinatorics; the development of new proofs of combinatorial theorems inspired by questions regarding the computational content of these theorems, along the lines of Montalban's new proof of Laver's Theorem; the analysis and comparison of different general methods, such as the use of ultrafilters, topological dynamics, and probabilistic methods; the development of notions of comparison between theorems that, while still computability-theoretic in spirit, are closer to being direct reflections of combinatorial differences; the understanding of splittings of combinatorial principles into computationally and combinatorially simpler parts; the study of the usefulness of combinatorially-defined objects as computational oracles; and the study of the first-order consequences of the existence of combinatorially-defined second-order objects. This project is thus aimed at developing the study of the connections between computability theory and combinatorics along a large number of related directions, making use of the computability-theoretic, proof-theoretic, and combinatorial expertise of its PIs, senior personnel, and key collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These techniques, developed over the last several years, involve new types of marker structures on the equivalence relations. For example, these new structures have led to a proof that all orbit equivalence relations of countable abelian group actions are hyperfinite. An important goal is to extend the results to larger classes of groups, and to delineate the extent of hyperfiniteness. A second new method concerns marker structures on arbitrary countable groups, also referred to as ``blueprints"". The bluprints, for example, give a proof that the Bernoulli shift action of every countable group has a free subflow. They have also been used to give other results for general actions, such as results on the complexity of the topological conjugacy relation. Another goal of this project is to explore the connections between the possible blueprints that can exist on groups and the marker structures on the equivalence relations induced by actions of these groups. It is expected that progress along these lines will improve our understanding both of actions by special types of groups, and of the nature of Borel actions for general countable groups.<br/><br/><br/>Countable Borel equivalence relations are fundamental mathematical objects which occur in many mathematical contexts. Aside from their intrinsic interest, their theory interacts with other important areas of mathematics such as dynamics, ergodic theory, and geometric group theory. Thus, work in this area involves techniques from logic as well as dynamics, combinatorics, and other areas. Consider an equivalence relation studied by the ancient Greeks, that of commensurability: two positive real numbers are equivalent if their ratio is rational. A very basic question about this simple relation was not known until recently, namely whether it can be described in an effective way as an increasing union of finite relations. Several natural generalizations of this question are still open. This project seeks to further develop some of the new techniques to further the study of these fundamental questions. It is expected that this study will also make new connections with other areas of mathematics."

One of his main ongoing research interests concerns                the theory of the model L(R) with the axiom of determinacy.  The                sets of reals in L(R) form a far-reaching extension of the                      projective sets, and the goal of obtaining a more or less                       complete theory of this model with the axiom of determinacy                     (which is a natural strong set theoretic axiom for this model) is               one of his central interests.                                                        Secondly, he is working on problems connected with the                     theory of equivalence relations in ZFC.  Recently, R. Dougherty,                A.S. Kechris (who introduced the term ""descriptive dynamics"" for                this area) and the investigator obtained some results which                     suggest the beginnings of a possible classification for the Borel               equivalence relations with countable classes.  There are many                   open problems here, such as identifying a canonical cofinal                     hierarchy of equivalence relations.                                                  Thirdly, some problems of descriptive set theory of a more                 classical nature have arisen recently.  D. Mauldin and the                      investigator have recently obtained a non-uniformization type                   result for co-analytic sets.  There are open problems here, such                as how far these results can be extended in ZF, as well as other                problems in descriptive set theory which he will work on.                            Finally, he would like to devote some time to problems which               have arisen from the inner model theory for large cardinals, such               as questions about iteration trees.                                                  There is nothing more basic in mathematics than set theory.                It is arguable that the natural numbers (0,1,2,3,...) are no more               fundamental.  For this reason it is perhaps surprising to find                  questions about these fundamental objects under active                          investigation and to see that even the choice of axioms for a                   theory of sets is controversial."

This has already yielded rich dividends in both                     combinatorial and descriptive set theory.  He will also continue                work connecting amenable and non-amenable group actions with set                theory.  Furthermore, he will try to extend his previous solution               to the famous ""Marczewski Problem"" about Banach-Tarski paradoxes to             arbitrary non-amenable groups of homeomorphisms of Polish spaces.               This will provide an exact characterization of paradoxical                      decompositions of Polish spaces using sets with the property of                 Baire.  He will also investigate newly discovered connections                   between logic and set theory on the one hand and topological                    dynamics and ergodic theory on the other.                                            A famous paradox of measure theory, the Banach-Tarski paradox,             shows that ordinary intuition about volumes of sets in three-                   dimensional space is unreliable.  In particular, if the sets are                allowed to be sufficiently bizarre, certainly not anything that can             be drawn or easily imagined, then a solid ball in 3-space can be                dissected into a finite number of sets, and these sets can be                   rearranged and reassembled to form two solid balls, each congruent              to the original one.  An old question that had resisted numerous                attempts was whether the sets involved in such a paradoxical                    decomposition of the ball could have at least a minimal degree of               regularity known as the property of Baire.  Although not easy to                draw or imagine, non-measurable sets with the property of Baire do              arise in classical analysis and so are not considered so remote                 from reality as to be easy to ignore altogether.  The investigator              and a co-worker have defied widely held suspicions that such                    decompositions are impossible, developed some technical machinery               for treating this and related questions, and shown that such                    decompositions do indeed exist.  Other topics in pure set theory                and its applications will be considered."

The first involves the relationship between the                   ""generic"" large cardinal axioms and conventional large cardinal                 axioms.  Closely related to this is the problem of whether                      aleph-omega is Jonsson.  A successful resolution of these                       problems would unify the various proposed strengthenings of the                 ordinary assumptions of mathematics.  If the results                            conjectured by the P.I. are true it would also shed                             considerable light on the continuum hypothesis.                                      The second type of problem examines the combinatorial                      characteristics of definable partial orderings and graphs.

Also, the logical strength of various versions of Ramsey's theorem and related principles will be studied, again largely using the methods of computability theory.  Other topics of investigation include the conditions under which a Boolean algebra has a computable copy and the conditions under which a group has a finitely presented expansion.<br/><br/>The purpose of this work is to achieve a better understanding of what can in principle be computed and of relationships among noncomputable sets of numbers.  Many proofs of mathematical results show the existence of certain sets without giving a procedure (or algorithm) for determining membership in the sets.

This is closely related to finding what axioms are needed to prove the result and finding the consequences of the result.

The research contains three projects involving two main areas of mathematics: descriptive set theory and ergodic Ramsey theory. The first two of the research projects lie in the theory of definable equivalence relations, which provides a general framework for understanding the nature of classification of mathematical objects up to some notion of equivalence; due to its broad scope, it has natural interactions with many areas of mathematics. These two projects are devoted to studying an important subclass of definable equivalence relations and whether slight extensions of the members of this subclass still belong to it. The third project features a new method for obtaining statements in arithmetic combinatorics similar in nature to a celebrated theorem of Szemeredi, which roughly states that any non-negligible subset of integers retains much of the additive structure of the entire set of integers.<br/><br/>In the theory of definable equivalence relations on Polish spaces, a central place is occupied by countable Borel equivalence relations, an important subclass of which is that of treeable equivalence relations. The first two projects investigate the question of closure of this subclass under finite index extensions in two different contexts: Borel and measure-theoretic. The former involves Borel combinatorics and possibly Borel games, whereas the latter is tightly connected with ergodic theory and the theory of cost of equivalence relations, and may require nontrivial machinery from geometric group theory. The third project lies in ergodic Ramsey theory and its goal is to obtain multiple recurrence results for amenable groups via a correspondence principle provided by nonstandard analysis. This is done by transferring recurrence statements from a given amenable group to a more convenient setting of probability groups by taking the ultrapower of the original group and equipping it with Loeb measure. The latter, being countably additive, presents the main advantage of the probability group over the original amenable group equipped with only a finitely additive density function, enabling integration over the group and the use of Fubini's theorem."

The investigator will                   continue to work on the analysis of priority arguments in the                   theory of recursively enumerable degrees and on the proof-theoretic             strength of these arguments.  Groszek and Theodore A. Slaman (Univ.             of Chicago) have been developing a uniform presentation for all                 levels of priority argument and tying these arguments to a standard             proof-theoretic hierarchy of fragments of Peano arithmetic.  In                 addition to continuing this development, Groszek will investigate               specific statements about the partial order of recursively                      enumerable Turing degrees, considering whether and how their proof-             theoretic strength reflects this analysis.  In a different vein,                Groszek will work on some long-standing open questions regarding                the degrees of constructibility.  Finally, she will consider the                question of which partial orders can be embedded into the Turing                degrees (assuming the failure of CH), one of the remaining open                 questions about the global structure of the Turing degrees.                          Prominent among the questions to be addressed by this project              are a number that bear on theoretical computability.  They lie in               what is known as recursion theory, which deals with a model of                  computability knowing no bounds on time or space.  Although answers             to such questions have the ability to illuminate practical                      questions, they are really practical only when their answers are                negative, for it is a very strong statement indeed to say that                  something cannot be computed even when one puts no limits on                    resources available for the purpose.  The finer structure of                    computability theory is sometimes more relevant to actual                       computations, and various aspects of that will also be considered.              A major thrust of the project is to equate degrees of computability             with specific levels in a well studied hierarchy dealing with the               logic of arithmetic."

There is a sophisticated machinery available (via Shelah and others) for understanding definable sets in certain general classes of structures. For example, once a concrete structure is identified as being stable, this machinery comes into play.<br/><br/>The research problems to be emphasized in this project involve potential application of model theoretic ideas and tools within symbolic dynamics and algebraic geometry, the algebraic theory of differential equations, analysis, and geometry.<br/><br/>One of the goals of this project to find new and effective ways to help mathematicians learn how to use model theory.  In particular, the researchers selected for support by this project will often be mathematicians who work outside model theory, and who are interested in finding ways to use it in their own work.<br/>"

The meeting builds upon the success of previous symposia to establish the WIMS as an annual event rotating among colleges and universities in the Midwest. The symposium will attract female mathematicians in the Midwest at all stages of their careers; it is expected to draw about 100 participants, in particular, graduate students, early-career researchers, and faculty at small institutions who have limited access to resources enabling them to attend conferences. <br/><br/>The symposium will feature two plenary lectures by distinguished senior researchers and eight shorter ones by promising junior researchers. The speakers are chosen to reflect the variety of institutions in the Midwest. Collectively, they will discuss a broad spectrum of cutting edge research. Lectures will be accompanied by open problem sessions, where the participants will work in small groups to discuss field-specific problems and develop new collaborations. Students and recent PhDs will contribute to the intellectual activity of the symposium by making poster presentations. This workshop is jointly funded by eight programs within the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences: Algebra & Number Theory, Analysis, Applied Math, Infrastructure, Mathematical Biology, Topology & Geometric Analysis, Foundations, and Probability.

Model theory is a part of mathematical logic, and studies the manner in which mathematical objects or classes of objects are defined linguistically. Consequently, model theory has developed various ways of measuring the simplicity and complexity of classes of functions or sets.  Among the  other areas of  mathematics that the PI will study using model-theoretic methods,  is combinatorics, in particular graphs, also informally called networks.  Important results in combinatorics are ""regularity"" results, showing how networks can be decomposed into a small number of pieces, each such piece behaving ""almost randomly"". The PI will use model theoretic methods to extend and improve such regularity theorems, sometimes under a simplicity assumption. <br/><br/>The core part of the proposal has three aspects: The first is to use methods from topological dynamics to obtain new invariants for first order theories and definable groups. The second concerns applications of model theory and nonstandard methods to arithmetic regularity theorems as well as the formulation of new regularity statements in a ""tame"" environment such as stability theory in continuous logic. The third involves the formulation of the notion of an approximate subgroup in a general model-theoretic context and giving a classification in the absence of invariant measures.  Other parts of the proposal include describing p-adic semialgebraic groups and developing a model theory of affine group schemes (or pro-linear algebraic groups).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to the regular scientific program, the conference will feature a presentation and a discussion on Wikipedia editing in Mathematics, including a practical how-to guide and demonstration.<br/><br/>Interaction with computation permeated the development of geometric group theory, from the work of Max Dehn in the 1910s, through the work of Turing in 1930s, the Novikov-Boone Theorem in the 1950s and the theory of word-hyperbolic and automatic groups in the 1990s, to the present day. Now group theorists are interested not just in decidability of various problems but in specific low-complexity estimates. Various data compression techniques (such as straight-line programs, power circuits, etc.) have found amazing applications to group-theoretic decision problems. In turn, geometric group theory has repaid in kind and produced powerful ideas that have found applications in computer science and computability theory. Thus, the notion of ""generic-case complexity"" as a way of capturing the practical behavior of an algorithm on ""most"" inputs (and distinct from average-case complexity) was born in geometric group theory. This notion has led to the development of the theory of coarse and generic computability in computational complexity, which is now transforming that subject. The ideas of CAT(0) cubical geometry, coming from geometric group theory, are finding useful applications in computational topology, robotics, and computer science. The conference aims to take stock of these developments and map possible future venues of interaction between geometric group theory, computer science and computability theory. <br/><br/>More detailed information can be found at the conference website, http://web.stevens.edu/algebraic/Schupp/"

Cherlin   will investigate a class of groups arising in model theory, whose simple   sections are conjectured to be algebraic groups.  Within this class, the   class of ""tame omega-stable groups"" provides a test case in which it is   conjectured -- the Borovik philosophy -- that a modification of the   strategy used in the classification of the finite simple groups will   suffice to prove the conjecture.  This amounts in practice to doing   somewhat more than the classification of simple algebraic groups over   algebraically closed fields, using methods of finite group theory, and very   little algebraic geometry beyond rudimentary properties of dimension.  The   Borovik philosophy has been fleshed out fairly clearly in odd   characteristic, and requires similar scrutiny in characteristic two.  (The   definitions of even and odd characteristic are group theoretic but quite   different from the ones used in finite group theory.)  Thomas will continue   the study of the cofinalities of permutation groups.  This investigation   goes back to a question of Serre, the precise answer of which is heavily   dependent on set theoretic hypotheses.  Results in this area tend to rely   heavily on delicate set theoretic forcing constructions and also involve   character theoretic computations relating to rapid generation by conjugacy   classes.  There are also relationships, largely obscure, between these group   theoretic cofinalities and more standard set theoretic cardinal invariants   attached to the continuum.  Most recently it has been seen that there are   also solid connections to pcf theory, an area of set theory developed by   Saharon Shelah.  This theory is seen as a new approach to cardinal   arithmetic that is less affected by independence phenomena than the   classical app roach.       Model theory attempts to classify mathematical theories.  The  ""best"" theories are those whose models (realizations) can be given   structural classifications.  Twenty years ago Zilber showed that all such   theories can be built from familiar algebraic structures: groups.  Cherlin   and Zilber then conjectured a classification scheme for the groups that   arise in this way. One promising route is to mine the literature on finite  simple groups.  As a result of the combined labors of about one hundred  mathematicians in journal articles filling about 10,000 highly condensed  journal pages, the finite simple groups were classified.  A parallel  strategy is developed for a large class of the infinite groups arising in  model theory.  This should require considerably less than 100 mathematicians  or 10,000 journal pages, for two reasons: (1) much of the work in the  finite case relates to the properties of 26 bizarre finite groups which are  not involved to any significant extent in the infinite case; (2) the somewhat  haphazard evolution of the original proof in the finite case, over more than  two decades, can be avoided on the basis of lessons learned from that proof.  It is nonetheless a large-scale project, and large-scale planning will be   critical to its success.  At the present time the plan, though still   incomplete, is already being implemented.  Cherlin will address the urgent   need for a ""top-level"" analysis to serve as a guide for the mathematicians  working on this strategy in parts of the U.S. and also in South America and  Europe.  Set theory has developed rapidly and steadily since Paul Cohen  settled some of the oldest questions in the subject in his 1963 breakthrough.  Many areas of mathematics involve surprisingly deep questions in set theory.  Recently this has been shown by Thomas to be the case in the study of the  structure of those infinite groups which are best approximated by finite  groups. Work in this area has two quite different aspects which mesh toge ther   well.

These areas include field theory and commutative and differential algebra; manifolds, both topologically and analytically; uncountable structures and the possibility of presenting and studying them effectively; and Blum-Shub-Smale computability and degree theory for the real numbers.  In field theory, Miller has already made substantial progress, both by asking and answering natural computable-model-theoretic questions about fields, and also by noticing general questions about fields which can be answered using computability theory.  He has taken the lead in introducing computability techniques to researchers outside mathematical logic, and has often been able to interest such people in his questions and his methods.  Fields also intersect with his interest in uncountable structures:  indeed, uncountable fields fit very naturally into the framework of local computability, the approach developed by Miller for considering uncountable structures within the Turing model of computation.  In another approach to uncountable objects, Calvert and Miller have developed a definition of real-computable manifold, using the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation on the real numbers.  They have found that for the study of the fundamental group, the BSS model actually melts away and the Turing model of computation is appropriate.  However, for consideration of distances on manifolds, using geodesics or other ways of defining a metric, they expect that BSS computation or other notions of computation, such as those from computable analysis, will be essential.<br/><br/>Traditional computability theory examines the capabilities of digital computers and the limits on the problems which can be solved using such computers.  Since the pioneering work of Alan Turing, it has been known that many problems cannot be solved by any digital computer running any program whatsoever.  Even these ""noncomputable"" problems can be ranked by difficulty, however: problem A is easier (or at least, no more difficult) than problem B if we can show how a hypothetical program solving B would allow us to solve A as well.  Recently, the PI Russell Miller has made contributions to computable model theory, the branch of this field in which one studies noncomputable problems about specific mathematical structures involving the natural numbers and the rational numbers.  Structures involving all real numbers are much larger and therefore trickier to consider, but Miller and many others have introduced various methods for addressing these structures as well.  Some of these methods use digital computers, while others assume exact-precision arithmetic on the real numbers or other structures.  By examining the limits of these different models of computation, we can understand better how much extra power is provided by exact precision, and which mathematical problems require such precision if they are to be solved."

The particular focus of this project is on developing recent applications of certain model-theoretic tools to areas such as diophantine geometry (the study of solving equations in integers by means of algebra and geometry) and asymptotic analysis (the study of the growth behaviour of functions as their inputs become large), in order to obtain new insights in these different fields by exploring and profiting from the interplay between them, while also making fundamental contributions to our understanding of the foundational model-theoretic framework itself. The project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups through the Math Alliance. <br/><br/>The prevalent feature of the problems that this project proposes to address is their connection to the part of model theory known as o-minimality, a common generalization of semi-algebraic and subanalytic geometries, where the mathematical objects under consideration do not exhibit wild geometric behaviour (such as no oscillation, finiteness bounds being uniform in families, and good asymptotic growth behaviour of functions). A principal focus of this project is on the counting theorem of Pila and Wilkie, a seminal application of o-minimality to diophantine geometry, as well as on subsequent refinements and applications of this result. One key aim is to gain new insights into one of the main analytic-geometric tools used in this area, namely smooth parameterization. Another is to obtain further improvements to or new applications of these counting results, in particular by exploiting effective methods. This project moreover will use techniques from o-minimality to address questions in diophantine and asymptotic analysis, by furthering our understanding of the asymptotic growth behaviour of functions in the o-minimal setting, and making critical new insights into the wider applicability of this analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The traditional view of this program has been that of an increment program with progress measured by a progression up the hierarchy of large cardinals. It is now known that this view is not correct. A critical transition occurs at the level of exactly one supercompact cardinal, and in solving the Inner Model Problem for this specific large cardinal axiom, one solves the Inner Model Problem for essentially all known large cardinal axioms. The solution must necessarily yield an ultimate enlargement of Godel's inner model L. This  Ultimate-L must closely approximate the parent universe V within which it is constructed. Though the detailed construction of Ultimate-L is open, the axiom, ``V = Ultimate-L'',  can be precisely formulated and its consequences explored even now. One can also precisely specify a conjecture which would be the final outcome of the construction of Ultimate-L. This is the Ultimate-L Conjecture. This conjecture is closely related to several other conjectures and these collectively are the focus of this research proposal.<br/><br/>The mathematical study of Infinity is the focus of Set Theory. This subject began on the basis of principles isolated by Cantor and then elaborated on by others. By the early part of the 20th century the basic Zermelo-Frankel Axioms had been isolated and these axioms together with the Axiom of Choice are the ZFC axioms. The ZFC axioms define the current conception of (mathematical) Infinity. The seminal discoveries of the latter half of the 20th century showed that most of the fundamental questions asked about infinite sets are unsolvable on the basis of the ZFC axioms. Famous among these unsolvable questions is that of Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis which by the middle of the 20th century was widely regarded as one of the most important questions of mathematics.  This proposal focuses on the Ultimate-L Project. This project if successful will isolate (for the first time) an extension of the ZFC axioms that will resolve essentially all of these otherwise unsolvable questions (including that of the Continuum Hypothesis) and provide a framework for reducing all questions of Set Theory to questions of the existence of large infinite sets--these are the so called Axioms of Strong Infinity.  The new approach arises from a series of recent results which show that such an extension of the ZFC axioms might actually exist."

However, it turns out that there are natural and important mathematical theories which cannot be decided by ZFC alone. The Large Cardinal Axioms (LCAs) are extensions of ZFC designed to settle all such theories. This is the Godel's program in Set Theory. If an LCA is ""correct"", then the theories it decides are also correct. How can one test for correctness of an LCA? The Inner Model Program, a major program in modern Set Theory, justifies correctness by constructing canonical models for LCAs much like the natural numbers are the canonical model for the Peano Axioms of Arithmetic (PA) (and as such PA is a correct theory). The proposed project contributes to the Inner Model Program by advancing methods for constructing canonical models for LCAs from various extensions of ZFC. <br/><br/><br/>The project focuses on studying the connections between inner models, sets of reals, hybrid structures (such as hereditarily ordinal definable sets (HOD) of determinacy models), forcing, and strong combinatorial principles (such as the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA)). The PI proposes to work on advancing the basic theory of hybrid structures, focusing on strategy mice and hod mice as well as developing methods for the core model induction beyond its current state. In particular, the project aims to make advancements in answering the following fundamental questions in descriptive inner model theory: (1) Is HOD of a determinacy model fine-structural (e.g. do the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH), various square principles hold in HOD)?

But given a particular theorem, can we specify precisely which axioms are needed to derive it? This is a natural question, and also an ancient one: over 2000 years ago, the Greek mathematicians were asking it about Euclid's geometry. Reverse mathematics is an area of mathematical logic that offers a modern approach to this kind of question, by classifying mathematical theorems according to their logical strength. This offers a deeper insight into the fundamental ideas and methods needed to prove a given theorem. More precisely, reverse mathematics provides a framework in which to compare and contrast results from disparate areas of mathematics, which helps elucidate the underpinnings of various branches of the mathematical sciences, and thereby leads to a better understanding of mathematics and its applications.<br/><br/>A striking fact repeatedly demonstrated in this area is that the vast majority of mathematical propositions can be classified into one of a small number of categories. But for some very important and fundamental theorems this is not the case. Dzhafarov's research focuses on theorems of this ?irregular"" type, including Ramsey's theorem, various equivalents of the axiom of choice, and principles arising from certain problems in cognitive science. In this project, Dzhafarov will work to achieve a greater understanding of the complexities of these ""irregular"" theorems, to find new examples of such theorems from previously unexplored areas of mathematics, and to apply the reverse mathematics analysis to questions from outside of mathematics. This will be facilitated by the application of methods from computability theory and proof theory, and by the addition of ideas from various collaborations across a number of areas of pure and applied mathematics, as well as interactions with members of the multidisciplinary University of Connecticut logic group."

Within 40 years the key principles of Set Theory were discovered, these are the ZFC axioms, and the stage was set for the detailed development of transfinite mathematics, or so it seemed. However, in a completely unexpected development, Cohen showed in 1963 that even the most basic problem of Set Theory was not solvable on the basis of these principles alone. That problem was the widely discussed and celebrated problem of Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis. The 50 years since Cohen's announcement has seen a vast development of Cohen's method and to the realization that the occurrence of unsolvable problems is ubiquitous in Set Theory. This arguably challenges the very conception of Cantor on which Set Theory is based. However, during this same period, the detailed study of special cases of the Continuum Hypothesis led to a remarkable success. This was the discovery and validation of a key new principle for Second Order Number Theory. Second Order Number Theory is the study of the structure of all sets of counting numbers, and this is just Set Theory in its simplest incarnation. The resulting theory is largely immune to Cohen's method. The prospect that this could somehow be extended to produce an analogous new principle for Set Theory itself (as a single additional axiom to the ZFC axioms) has always seemed completely hopeless. But that belief was itself based on a misconception and recent discoveries suggest there is a resolution. These discoveries were the result of prior NSF supported research. This project continues and expands the research based on these discoveries.<br/><br/>Gödel's consistency proof for the Axiom of Choice and the Continuum Hypothesis involves his discovery of the Constructible Universe of Sets. The axiom ""V = L"" is the axiom which asserts that every set is constructible. This axiom settles the Continuum Hypothesis and more importantly,  Cohen's method of forcing  cannot be used in the context of the axiom ""V = L"". However the axiom V = L is  false since it limits the fundamental nature of infinity. In particular the axiom refutes (most) strong axioms of infinity. A key question emerges. Is there an ""ultimate"" version of Gödel's constructible universe L yielding an axiom ""V = Ultimate L"" which retains the power of the axiom ""V = L""  for resolving questions like that of the Continuum Hypothesis, which is also immune against Cohen's method of forcing, and yet which does not refute strong axioms of infinity? This vague question has been recast, through previously supported research,  into a specific and precise conjecture; the Ultimate L Conjecture. The goal of this project is to resolve that conjecture."

The overall goal is to deepen understanding about how to recognize the complexity of certain types of computational problems. The project focuses on a suite of mathematical problems whose solutions will yield new information about the complexity of Constraint Satisfaction Problems. These problems (CSP's) include scheduling problems, resource allocation problems, and problems reducible to solving systems of linear equations. CSP's are theoretically solvable, but some are not solvable efficiently. The research will be aimed at identifying a clear boundary between the tractable and intractable cases, and at providing efficient algorithms for solutions in the tractable cases. Many fundamental problems in mathematics and computer science can be formulated as CSP's, and progress here would have both practical and theoretical significance. A second component of the project investigates classical computational problems in algebra in order to determine whether they are algorithmically solvable. A third component of the project is the further development of the software UACalc, which is a proof assistant developed to handle computations involving algebraic structures.<br/><br/>The researchers shall work to decide the truth of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture of Feder and Vardi, which states that every Constraint Satisfaction Problem with a finite template is solvable in polynomial time or is NP complete. They will further develop the algebraic approach to CSP's by refining knowledge about relations compatible with weak idempotent Maltsev conditions and about algebras with finitely related clones. A second goal of the project concerns the computable recognition of properties of finite algebras connected with the varieties they generate, such as whether a finite algebra with a finite residual bound is finitely axiomatizable, or whether a finite algebra can serve as the algebra of character values for a natural duality. One of the more tangible accomplishments of this project will be a broadening and strengthening of the applicability of the UACalc software. The agenda for this part of the project includes parallelizing the important subroutines, building in conjecture-testing and search features, adding further algorithms, and further developing the community of users and contributors."

These topics lie at the interface of descriptive set theory, measured group theory, graph theory, ergodic theory, probability theory, and operator algebras. In recent years, mathematicians in these fields have come to realize that problems concerning algebraic, dynamical, and descriptive structural complexity of countable group and equivalence relations can be fruitfully studied via descriptive combinatorial and graph theoretic means. The principal investigator and collaborators have employed this combinatorial perspective to create new tools used to answer several open problems in these fields. In addition to a combinatorial perspective, research in these fields is also facilitated by a global perspective, from which problems in ergodic theory, for example, may be seen as topological-dynamical and descriptive problems concerning actions of the group of automorphisms of a standard probability space. This research project aims to generate more new general tools and to promote fruitful interactions among these fields. <br/><br/>Measured group theory seeks to understand countably infinite groups through ergodic theoretic properties of their measurable actions on standard probability spaces, and particularly through structural properties of the orbit equivalence relations generated by these actions. The motivating phenomenon is that algebraic properties of an acting group are often expressed through measurable properties of the associated equivalence relation. An extreme form of this phenomenon is seen in orbit equivalence and cocycle rigidity and superrigidity theorems, which state that in certain settings an equivalence relation completely remembers the group from which it was generated. At the other extreme are what might be called orbit equivalence anti-rigidity theorems, stating that certain groups and actions cannot be distinguished by looking at the equivalence relations they generate. This research project touches upon phenomena at both of these extremes. The questions are motivated by rigidity/anti-rigidity results established by the principal investigator and collaborators, which have led to new questions addressed in this project. The project will address problems concerning algebraic, dynamical, and descriptive structural complexity of countable groups and equivalence relations, specifically in the areas of orbit equivalence, treeability, cocycle superrigidity, weak equivalence rigidity, and measurable combinatorial properties and parameters of graphs and group actions. The project pursues a descriptive combinatorial and graph theoretic approach to these problems."

Broadly speaking, the major research proposed by the PI is directed at analyzing complexity and relative complexity. One area of study concerns functions on the natural numbers and then more broadly general mathematical structures. The primary measuring rod for this investigation is Turing's notion of relative computability which captures our usual intuitions and corresponds to computations by idealized versions of standard computing machines and program languages. The other major thrust of the proposed research is directed at an analysis of the complexity of mathematical theorems and constructions. Here, one compares the complexity of the inputs/hypotheses to that of the outputs/conclusions of the constructions/theorems. Strength is measured both computationally and in terms of the axioms needed to prove the theorem or correctness of the construction. The co-PI has proposed directing research in areas of logic with applications to computer science including the study of very simple machine models as well as logical languages useful for verifying that computer programs do what they are designed to do and not other (perhaps dangerous) things. He is also involved in developing and patenting methods for quantum control of ordinary (macro)processes. While this work has been influenced by his previously supported theoretical work, it now lies outside the scope of this proposal.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, the PI's proposals deal with analyzing the structure of the Turing degrees (of relative complexity of computation) and of particularly important substructures. The emphasis here is on questions of definability and nondefinability as well as (bi)interpretations of arithmetic in the relevant structures. Particular emphasis will be placed on relations to external notions such as rates of growth for functions and the complexity of the definitions in arithmetic or other languages of the functions or structures. His other major focus is on reverse mathematics. In particular, the analysis of theorems that, in terms of their proof theoretic and computational strength, lie outside the scope of the standard systems studied. Thus it demonstrates that there are many truly distinct types of construction principles occupying different levels of complexity with involved relations among them. Problems to be studied come from the realms of combinatorics, algebra, model theory and determinacy.

There are many applications of o-minimality to various areas of mathematics and recently such applications were found to arithmetic and algebraic geometry, yielding new proofs to classical problems (the Manin-Mumford conjecture) and and solving some open cases of the Andre-Oort conjecture. This proposed research project intends to take some of the ingredients which appeared in these recent applications to arithmetic and extend them to a more general setting (locally symmetric spaces), with the hope that such results will enable to solve other open cases of similar conjectures. An important feature of the proposed research is the inter-play between infinite discrete objects (eg. arithmetics groups or periodic functions), which are not definable in o-minimal structures, and their trace on definable sets in such structures. The goal is to prove definability of classical periodic maps when restricted to appropriate definable sets, and then to explore the implications which this definability might have on the periodic sets and functions.<br/><br/><br/>Model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, studies sets definable in  mathematical structures by first-order formulas. In many cases it allows one to eliminate wild phenomenas  and  to provide a rigorous  definition of a tame geometry.  This approach is useful for solving problems in areas such as number theory and arithmetic geometry. This project proposes to use tamness of various structures to answer some open problems in arithmetic geometry  which is a very important area of mathematics."

Often, the eventual behavior of these functions is of interest: Do they stabilize or tend to infinity? How fast do they grow? Valued differential fields are mathematical structures that abstractly formalize these questions and possible answers. This project will investigate valued differential fields from the perspective of model theory, a branch of mathematical logic which involves studying properties of mathematical structures that can be expressed in formal languages, in turn revealing new insights into these structures and their complexity. In recent years the ideas and tools of model theory have had fruitful applications in other areas of mathematics, a trend this project will continue in the setting of valued differential fields. The project includes the training and mentoring of undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Valued differential fields are algebraic structures that formalize the asymptotic comparison of solutions to differential equations. This project aims to deepen our understanding of such structures and their model theory in two primary ways. First, it will investigate unordered valued differential fields, most ambitiously complex transseries, which have been much less studied than ordered valued differential fields. These latter structures describe only non-oscillating behavior, while oscillating functions play an important role in mathematics and in describing the real world, from water waves to wave functions in quantum physics. This project will search for universal domains for the kinds of asymptotic differential algebra in which oscillation is permitted and study their complexity. Second, the project will investigate certain ordered valued differential fields that can arise from transexponential extensions of transseries. The work will then address natural next steps, most significantly the study of certain quotient structures, called imaginaries, associated to such ordered valued differential fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed workshop (to be held jointly and at the same location as a workshop in complexity theory, organized by Profs. Razborov and Ablayev) is the first meeting of its kind, designed to allow close contact between approximately thirty Russian and thirty scientists from the U. S. and other Western countries.   Computability theory, the study of unsolvable problems in mathematics, is a well-established branch of mathematical logic, and is particularly strongly represented in the United States and Russia.  For obvious political reasons, interaction between the two countries in this area has been quite limited in the past.  Research interests have also developed in somewhat different directions within the field;  e. g., the emphasis in Russia is on applications of computability theory to algebra, whereas in the United States, classical computability theory is more dominant.  On the other hand, close connections between the various directions obviously exist, as is evidenced by the small amount of cooperative research already taking place.  While the political barriers have by now mostly disappeared, severe financial difficulties have proven to be almost as great an obstacle to mutual cooperation in the field.  It thus appears that the only way to organize a meeting including a large number of Russians is to organize one within Russia, cutting travel expenses for Russian participants and counting on the non-Russian participants to be able to raise travel funds more easily."

Here ""ordinary mathematics""                  refers to the parts of mathematics which are not overtly set                    theoretical.  For instance ""ordinary mathematics"" includes                      subjects such as geometry, differential equations, real and                     complex analysis, countable algebra, countable combinatorics, and               the topology of complete separable metric spaces.  On the other                 hand, ""ordinary mathematics"" does not include topics such as                    general topology and uncountable cardinal arithmetic.                                It has been found that the language of second order                        arithmetic is an appropriate context for the study of the above                 question.  (This is because ""ordinary mathematics"" is to a large                extent identifiable with countable and separable mathematics.)                  Moreover, a great many key theorems of ordinary mathematics, when               formalized as sentences of second order arithmetic, turn out to                 be equivalent to the set existence axioms which are needed to                   prove them.  (The equivalent is proved over a weak base theory.)                Surprisingly, the number of inequivalent set existence axioms                   which arise in this way is rather small.  This is the theme of                  Reverse Mathematics, which has been developed by Simpson and                    others and will be further developed under the current project."

Two related issues involved in this research are (i)   the existence of automorphisms for such structures (yielding   nondefinability results) and (ii) the decidability of fragments of their   first-order theories.  Computability in group theory involves the existence  of algorithms for deciding certain properties of finitely presented groups.

Lempp will investigate   the existence of transformations which preserve this content, and the  related question of deciding certain elementary properties of these sets.   In group theory the goal is to investigate the transfer of undecidable   problems from the infinite to the finite.

The one-day conference will be the second in the series. The first NYWIMN Conference was held on December 9th, 2006 at the CUNY Graduate Center. The conference is being organized by Delaram Kahrobaei and Victoria Gitman of the NYCCT, who successfully organized the 2006 meeting. The conference will consist of invited talks by women mathematicians, a poster session by graduate and undergraduate women students, and a panel discussion of issues affecting women in mathematics. <br/><br/>The meeting will be in the fields of algebra, combinatorics, and logic, with added emphasis on interdisciplinary research and establishing connections between mathematics and computer science. The organizers will focus on the areas of combinatorial, geometric, and computational group theory, applications of model theory to algebra and combinatorics, computational complexity, and set theory. All these areas are relatively new to mathematics. They have developed in response to the deep interconnections discovered in the last century between theoretical mathematics, algorithmic processes, and formalizing our notions of information. Because these areas are so young and so wide in scope and application, the most fascinating questions still remain to be answered. These questions will determine how theoretical mathematics and the world of modern technology will reinforce each other in the near future.  The first objective of the conference is to advance our knowledge in these areas by supporting women mathematicians who work in them and promoting research collaboration among them. The second more global aim of the conference is to increase the participation of women in the mathematical sciences. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

It addresses                  the problem of automatically generating proofs of individual                    lemmas, and also sets forth a general framework for verifying                   large fragments of mathematics through a development of axiomatic               set theory.                                                                          In logic programming, the project considers Prolog-style                   languages.  These derive from logic, but there are serious                      questions about their semantics, and there are several divergent                points of view on what a logic program ""should"" mean.  The goal                 is to clean up the semantics, while still maintaining Prolog's                  efficiency as a programming language.                                                In set theory and topology, three topics of research are                   planned.  (1) Homogeneity properties of compact spaces. (2)                     Real-valued measurable cardinals; recent advances by Gitik and                  Shelah make it reasonable to reconsider some old questions in                   this area. (3) Martin's Axiom (MA) and uncountable cardinals                    below the continuum.  Specifically, the investigator would like                 to find models where MA first fails at a singular cardinal of                   cofinality greater than omega-one and would like to discover                    consistent PFA-style axioms which allow the continuum to be                     greater than omega-two.

This conference is the 13th in a series of conferences run as Computability, Complexity and Randomness (CCR), which deal with problems at the interface of mathematics and computer science where the notion of randomness plays a central role. Although randomness is a primitive notion in probability theory, this alone does not help to determine when an individual mathematical object can be considered as random for a given application. It does not help either to understand how applications will behave on individual random inputs. Also one may require the notion of randomness relative to different models of computation, and possibly consider randomness in a grey scale down to notions of anti-randomness. Another main question is how to define, and perhaps construct, explicit instances of random objects. These problems meet at classical computability theory, computational complexity theory, probability theory, information theory and the theory of dynamical systems.<br/><br/>This CCR conference will continue to disseminate the expertise that has been rapidly developing in the area and foster new collaborations.

This object might be a single algebraic structure or a class of structures that share a common description (theory). In this project, the PI will study the phenomenon of pseudo-finiteness, in which every (finite) fragment of the description of an infinite object also describes a finite object -- even while the full description captures only infinite structures. In recent years, pseudo-finiteness has been exploited to prove theorems in finitary discrete mathematics and additive combinatorics. On the other hand, pseudo-finiteness has only been completely characterized in a small number of settings. Ax's characterization of pseudo-finite fields is probably the best known. Here, the PI intends to give such a characterization of pseudo-finiteness for theories that are ""purely non-algebraic"" -- theories that arise from classes of structures that are specifically of interest in discrete mathematics, such as classes of graphs and regular hypergraphs. In the very long term, one might expect to see applications of this research in network analysis, treating very large networks (i.e. graphs) like the internet and the human brain.<br/><br/>Here are some more technical details. The project provides a detailed study of the phenomenon of pseudo-finiteness in what is called ""combinatorial theories"" -- countably-categorical theories with quantifier elimination and trivial algebraic closure operation. Such theories correspond immediately to commonly studied classes of finite structures from discrete mathematics, such as graphs (directed and undirected) and regular hypergraphs. In practice, it is quite difficult, if not impossible, to construct pseudo-finite combinatorial theories without appealing to probability theory in apparently essential ways: either the constructed theory is itself obtained from a 0,1-law or it is some sort of limit of such theories. Upon determining exactly what the appropriate limit processes are, the PI plans to show that this is, in fact, the only way to construct pseudo-finite combinatorial theories. A proof of this sort of claim will require a more or less complete understanding of 0,1-laws in this setting -- especially, connections and equivalences between conditional independence and higher amalgamation properties in classes of finite structures. In turn, this analysis seems to require deep exploration of connections between model theory, on one hand, and (for example) functional analysis and measure-theoretic probability on the other. Capturing pseudo-finite theories as limits of almost-sure theories will require development of an extensive technology for selecting/extracting well-behaved sub-classes inside of a given class of finite structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One central question in this investigation is to give necessary and suffcient conditions on an infinite binary sequence X which ensure that there is a continuous measure m such that X is effectively or arithmetically random relative to m.  This is a classic mathematical problem, given an individual data set determine a distribution which would generate it.  By results of Reimann and Slaman, for all but countably many X there is such an m. The argument is highly meta-mathematical. Necessarily so, as Reimann and Slaman have also shown that this co-countability theorem cannot be proven without invoking infinitely many iterations of the power set of the reals. In the emerging picture, there is a close interaction between a sequence's failure to have a random ingredient and it's being structurally definable, which should be studied more deeply.<br/><br/>Slaman's proposal can be viewed in the context of the continuing investigation of computability and mathematical definability. With quantitative mathematical analysis of these phenomena, one can answer questions of the form ``Is there an algorithm to solve all problems of a this type?'', ``Is there a simple example with specific properties'', ``Is there a concrete classification of all structures with these properties?''. One can also address questions of the sort ``Are these techniques adequate to resolve this question?'' or ``How random must a sequence be in order to exhibit a particular typical behavior?''  One must develop a detailed theory of computation to show that there is no algorithm of a certain type. Similarly, one must develop a detailed theory of definability to show that there is no simple example with certain properties or to show that certain phenomena do not have concrete classifications."

Jointly with Veronica Becher and Pablo Heiber, both at the University of Buenos Aires, Slaman will apply methods from Computability and Descriptive Set Theory to normality of real numbers, the property that the digits in their representations occur with equal asymptotic frequency, especially considering representations in varying bases.  Will also collaborate with Laurent Bienvenu, University of Paris Diderot-Paris 7, and Kelty Allen, an advanced graduate student working with Slaman, on the effective theory of<br/>Brownian motion.  In parallel, Slaman will investigate the more foundational question, ""What are the number theoretic consequences of familiar infinitary principles?"" as formalized in first and second order arithmetic.  The phrase ""first order arithmetic"" refers to the structure of the natural numbers N={0,1,2,...} with the operations of addition and multiplication.  ``Second order arithmetic'' refers to the expansion of N to include all of the subsets of N and allowing for reference to and quantification over infinite sets.  Stated more precisely, Slaman will investigate the extent to which second order principles, such as the existence of a random sequence or the assertion of a frequently applied infinitary combinatorial principle such as Ramsey's Theorem, have non-trivial consequences in first order arithmetic.<br/><br/>This project comes from the perspective of Mathematical Logic, that understanding the means by which one can work with mathematical objects can be as important as, or even equivalent to, understanding those objects themselves.  In one of the more interdisciplinary parts of the proposal, this point of view will be invoked to study the problem of constructing real numbers so as to control the behaviors of their representations relative to all integer bases.  One goal is to exhibit a fast-running algorithm to output an absolutely normal number, which means that for any integer base b the digits in the base b representation of this number occur with equal frequency over time.  Absolute normality is often interpreted as an indicator of randomness, but such an accessible and predictable example would refute that view.  Another part of the project puts Mathematical Logic in the foreground by asking for exact information concerning the extent that the properties of the real numbers, in the form of combinatorics seen within infinite subsets of the natural numbers, have consequences among the finite sets."

This is accomplished through a series of mini-courses taught by leading researchers, who aim their lectures at the appropriate level.  The second goal is to broadly disseminate current advances in these areas by hosting a conference in the final week of the program.   The Center also seeks to increase the diversity of the mathematical work force by actively recruiting underrepresented groups to attend the activities.  This grant supports the programs planned at the Center for the next three summers.<br/><br/>The program in 2014 will be dedicated to Nonlinear PDEs in Geometry and Physics. Many physical principles are an expression of an underlying variational principle; at the same time, physical laws often have a purely geometric description. The goal of the Program in Nonlinear PDEs in Geometry and Physics is to bring together researchers who are working on PDEs with connections to differential geometry and mathematical physics.  The program in 2015 will be dedicated to Boundaries and Dynamics.  In recent years a number of problems and techniques have used statistical properties of a group action on an object at infinity which can be considered as a boundary. The goal of the Program on Boundaries and Dynamics is to explore themes involving a notion of boundaries in geometry and ergodic theory.  The program in 2016 will be dedicated to Generalized Stability, Pseudo-finite Combinatorics and Related Topics.  The last few years have also seen a remarkable convergence of ideas in model theory, combinatorics, Lie groups, number theory, and dynamics. The main goal of the Program on Generalized Stability, Pseudo-finite Combinatorics and Related Topics is to facilitate interactions between mathematicians working in these related areas."

The main goal is to understand infinitary combinatorics through the lens of forcing and large cardinals. Second, the project will investigate the connections between set theory and an abstract view of model theory. Many assertions in model theory turn out to have set theoretic content, and the investigator will pursue the question of when there is such a connection and when there is not. Third, the project will explore the relatively recent field of descriptive graph combinatorics and its connections with classical questions in geometry and measure theory. <br/><br/>From infinitary combinatorics, the project will focus on the tree property, which is a compactness principle that abstracts the Konig infinity lemma to higher cardinals. A specific goal of the project is to explore the conjecture that modulo the consistency of large cardinals the least uncountable cardinal is the only cardinal which provably carries a counterexample to the tree property. The project will also pursue other similar questions. From model theory, the investigator will study model theoretic notions connected to the classification theory of abstract elementary classes and their set theoretic content. Particular properties of interest are tameness and locality, categoricity, and Hanf numbers. From descriptive graph combinatorics, the investigator will explore matchings and colorings in definable graphs. This study has already been shown to have interesting connections with questions in geometry, for example Marczewski's question about whether the Banach-Tarski paradox is possible using Baire measurable pieces."

The objective of this project is to draw connections between complexity issues and structural issues to improve understanding of what shapes and forms complexity can take. <br/><br/>This project is part of an ongoing study of the structure that emerges when considering computability theoretic properties on a cone, that is, properties that hold relative to almost every oracle with respect to Martin's measure. In particular, the project will explore the connections between Vaught's conjecture and computability theory, and the generalizations of the uniform Martin's conjecture. A few years ago, connections between computable structure theory and Vaught's conjecture emerged unexpectedly. While it may take many years to see Vaught's conjecture settled, this project pursues a particular aspect: its connections to computability theory."

Since inception, the SLALM's have been organized in the form of a working conference preceded by a series of training tutorials aimed at students. The tutorials, the plenary talks, and the special sessions aim to represent major areas of mathematical logic. The SLALM has a strong tradition of being a student-focused event. The tutorials that precede the conference are attended by students from Latin America, the United States, and Canada. For the US students, the SLALM is a unique opportunity to attend lectures and tutorials given by some of the world's top logicians. The meeting is sponsored by the Association for Symbolic Logic.

He intends to do this by applying techniques from descriptive set theory and geometric measure theory in addition to the model-theoretic and analytic-geometric techniques usually associated with o-minimality. In turn, Miller hopes to apply model-theoretic techniques to obtain results in control theory (specifically, classifying expansions of structures on the real field by trajectories of definable vector fields), descriptive set theory, and geometric measure theory.<br/><br/>Many results of classical mathematics are very general: They apply to a wide range of input, so to speak, and thus tend to produce a wide range of output. But one could hope that if the input is particularly well behaved in some respect, then the output would be similarly well behaved. This turns out to be true in many important cases, but usually requires new, more constructive, proofs of classical results, as well as a deeper understanding of which inputs should be regarded as well behaved. The theory of o-minimal structures on the real field, a sub-discipline of mathematical logic, has been developed in large part to deal with this issue. This has been a rapidly-developing area for the last twenty-five years, with many contributions from, and cooperation between, researchers from several branches of mathematics and logic. Applications have been found in areas as diverse as theoretical economics, neural-net learning theory, and hybrid control systems, as well as in pure mathematics. <br/>However, o-minimality has a drawback: It allows only for the modelling of locally finitely connected behavior, and thus has rather limited use in understanding noisy or oscillatory settings. Miller proposes to develop extensions of o-minimality that can deal with at least some of these non-o-minimal phenomena."

Short, conceptual proofs can avoid complicated calculations, but sometimes cannot provide the detailed quantitative information those calculations would reveal.  A recent insight is that, sometimes, mathematics can have it both ways.  By studying the structure of mathematical proof itself, techniques from the field known as proof theory make it possible to take abstract proofs and to extract detailed calculations from them.  Used in the opposite direction, these techniques can take certain kinds of lengthy calculations and replace them with short, abstract arguments which can then be generalized to prove new results.  The focus of this project is to both further extend these techniques to new areas, particularly recently discovered applications in statistics, as well as continue the application of known techniques to new problems, especially in areas where probability and randomness play a central role.<br/><br/>In this project, Towsner will build on previous applications of ultraproducts to studying the way mathematical objects can be separated into structured and random parts.  An explicit quantitative approach to such dichotomies has long been central to extremal graph theory, but recent work has shown that these can also be viewed in measure-theoretic terms by using ultraproducts to mediate between the finitary and infinitary perspectives, leading to new results in the area.  Towsner will study this connection systematically, both developing new tools in the infinitary setting and using the proof-theoretic functional interpretation to translate these tools back to the classical setting, extracting explicit calculations from these infinitary arguments."

Even fairly simple properties of these sets, for example whether they admit a robust notion of length, are now known to be dependent on strong axioms of set theory. But much still remains unknown about the connection between strong axioms of set theory and the continuum. The motivating goal for the project is to deepen our understanding of this connection. This requires a deeper understanding of the axioms themselves, and of intermediary principles between these axioms and properties of the continuum: principles that can be obtained (provably or consistently) granted the axioms, and directly affect the continuum. The project seeks to extend work on both fronts, with research into models for the axioms, combinatorial principles on infinite sets, and saturation principles of the universe of sets that affect properties of the continuum."

The conference is organized with financial  support of the European Mathematical Society and Warsaw Center of Mathematics and Computer Science, Clay Mathematics Institute, and is endorsed by the Polish Mathematical Society.  The present application is not intended to provide any funding for the conference itself, only for funding for travel. There are several scientific themes of the conference, each represented by leading specialists. Professor Mostowski  made contributions to several areas of Mathematical Logic.  His most important work was in Set Theory, and the selection of topics reflects that.  Some of Mostowski's ideas have found their application in Foundations Computer Science. The program of the conference will include a lecture  and a tutorial on some recent  and rather unexpected developments in this area. Many can benefit from participation in the conference. In case this application is successful,  the opportunity to apply for travel grants will be advertised at the conference website, in the  Association for Symbolic Logic newsletter, and on popular logic-related websites. Travel grant applications will be reviewed by a committee set up and chaired by  Sergei Artemov of the Graduate Center  of City University of New York.  There are several faculty and graduate students at CUNY who are interested in going to the conference, but the committee will make every effort to make sure that the selection process is fair and open to everyone, with particular attention paid to applicants from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of the conference: In the sciences generally, disciplines and workers become increasingly specialized with the progression of generations.  This has certainly been the case with mathematical logic and foundational studies.  While this is not surprising, it is unfortunate for those whose concern is the foundations of mathematics itself.  A broad, informed, and unified outlook is important.  In 2013 there is a unique opportunity to have a conference aimed at bringing together and affecting researchers across the various sub-disciplines of foundational studies, encouraging interaction.  This year is the 100th anniversary of the birth of Andrzej Mostowski.  It will not be a commemoration meeting, but rather the organizers plan to use Mostowski  and his ideas  as a central organizing device, that will allow them to bring together researchers in all the basic areas of foundational studies. The expectation is that the speakers will present not only the panorama of results directly stemming from Professor Mostowski's research, but also proposals for research directions, unsolved problems, and possibilities for new applications.<br/><br/>The conference website is at http://mostowski100.mimuw.edu.pl/doku.php"

Fifty years ago Paul Cohen developed the method of forcing to solve Hilbert's first problem: the truth of the Continuum Hypothesis.  Today this method is more relevant than ever.  While it was originally developed as a meta-mathematical tool, it has been also used to solve problems arising in combinatorics, functional analysis, and topology.  As the method matured and became even more powerful, its scope and reach has been significantly broadened. New directions in forcing are ever more influenced by fundamental questions in a broadening range of fields.  Stunning breakthroughs in these related fields are being propelled by the equally exciting advances in the forcing method.  Still, the method has largely remained a tool used internally by set theory.  The program aims to further develop the method and its applicability analysis, combinatorics, operator theory, set theory, and topology.<br/><br/>The Fields Institute is one of the premier mathematical institutes in the world.  Each semester it sponsors a thematic program in a focused sub-discipline of mathematics, bringing senior leaders in the field together with graduate students and junior researchers, all under one roof.  In fall 2012, the focus of the thematic program is Cohen's method of forcing.  The semester will feature three focused workshops and two semester long graduate courses, all attracting an international audience.  One of the primary goals of the program is to make this important technique accessible to a broader cross section of the mathematical community."

These areas include field theory, commutative and differential algebra, model theory, and number theory, as well as the possibility of describing uncountable structures and studying them effectively.  Traditional computability theory examines the capabilities of digital computers and the limits on the problems which can be solved using such computers.  Since the pioneering work of Alan Turing, it has been known that many problems cannot be solved by any digital computer running any program whatsoever.  Even these ""noncomputable"" problems can be ranked by difficulty, however: problem A is easier (or at least, no more difficult) than problem B if we can show how a hypothetical program solving B would allow us to solve A as well.  Indeed, in certain cases we can learn whether a particular problem is computable or not by determining where related noncomputable problems sit in this hierarchy.  Recently, the PI has made contributions ranging from solutions to concrete problems about deciding whether certain polynomial equations can be satisfied using rational numbers, to more abstract questions about the difficulty of solving algebraic differential equations and the relative difficulty of considering structures from different areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>The PI recently collaborated with several number theorists to produce new evidence for the undecidability of Hilbert's Tenth Problem for the rational numbers, the problem which asks for an algorithm to decide which Diophantine equations have rational solutions.  He plans to continue this work, considering the specific question of subrings of the rationals of density 0 (i.e., ""very close"" to the integers).  In field theory, he has made substantial progress, both by asking and answering natural computable-model-theoretic questions about the difficulty of computing isomorphisms between fields, and also by using computability theory to answer general questions about the complexity of fields in relation to the complexity of other mathematical structures. He hopes to address a key question in differential algebra, whose solution would help mathematicians better understand differentially closed fields and solutions to differential equations. (These are analogous to algebraically closed fields, but are much less well understood at present.)  For some years now he has taken the lead in introducing computability techniques to researchers throughout mathematics, and has often been able to interest such people in his questions and his methods.  With this grant, those efforts will most certainly continue."

The special sessions proposed cover the classical scientific focus of the conference as well as established and emerging research interests of the various groups of topologists in North America.   In addition to plenary talks connected to these research areas, and usually to more than one area, there will be two workshops:  (1) Coarse Topology, with an emphasis on connections to geometric group theory, dimension theory, and geometric topology, and (2) Homogeneous Compact Spaces, one of the most important classes of spaces, for instance, containing the class of compact topological groups.  Each workshop will consist of a series of lectures intended to enable participants to begin research in these areas.  Although the workshops will be tied to General Topology and Geometric Topology, each will focus on new theory and techniques, will have broad appeal to attendees in other sessions, and will feature connections to areas both inside and outside topology. The conference proceedings will be published in the fully refereed journal Topology Proceedings (http://topology.auburn.edu/tp/).<br/><br/><br/>There are two major conference series on Topology in North America: the Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference and the Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications.  The summer conference brings together mathematicians who have research interests in general topology, set-theoretic topology, topological algebras, topological groups, functional analysis, geometric topology, topological dynamics, and continuum theory as well as applied areas such as  computer science and computational topology/geometry, and other areas where topology has  applications and connections.  The scheduled workshops, one on Coarse Topology and the other on Homogeneous Compact Spaces, will acquaint younger researchers, including recent PhDs and graduate students, with active research areas in topology and its applications.  Major speakers with international reputations have been selected who are active in these research areas and others.  Students and junior researchers, whose focus has necessarily often been narrow, will be exposed to research techniques and results that draw from multiple sources.

The first measures the information content of finite binary strings, while the second captures the intuition that a random infinite binary sequence has no ""distinguishing features"". Both notions are rooted in computability theory, so it is not surprising that the study of randomness draws methods and ideas from computability theory, as well as core mathematical subjects like measure theory and information theory.<br/>However, the theory of effective randomness has proved to be a rich field of study in its own right. Miller proposes to study the strength of non-monotonic betting strategies, the computable power of sequences with positive effective Hausdorff dimension, degrees of randomness, and K-triviality.<br/><br/>A sequence of zeros and ones is considered random if the shortest<br/>(binary) computer program that generates the sequence has essentially the same length as the sequence itself. Intuitively, a random sequence has no patterns that can be exploited to give a compressed description. For example, the sequence consisting of a million zeros can be generated easily by a short program, so it is not random. On the other hand, there is a high probability that a sequence generated by flipping a coin a million times (tails is zero, heads is one) will be random. The length of the shortest program for a sequence is called the Kolmogorov complexity of the sequence; this notion was introduced in the 1960s. An infinite sequence is considered random if all of its finite initial segments are sufficiently random. This is equivalent to saying that no (semi-)computable betting strategy can win money trying to predict the digits of the sequence. The proposed research will address fundamental questions about randomness, including: (1) How powerful are computable betting strategies that are allowed to bet on the digits of a sequence in any order; (2) Is it possible to distill information out of a semi-random source to produce a random sequence or, at least, a sequence that has higher information density; (3) What does it mean to say that one infinite sequence is more random that another (4) How computationally weak are the infinite?<br/><br/>"

Besides being an interesting subject in its own right, model theory has had major impacts on almost every other branch of mathematics.  In this project, we focus on applications of model theory to operator algebras, that is, various subalgebras of the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that are closed under adjoint and are closed in various topologies.  The union of model theory and operator algebras has already proven to be fruitful and we plan on continuing the emerging evolution of model-theoretic methods in operator algebras.  We also plan to continue our work in using nonstandard analysis to solve questions in diverse areas of mathematics, including infinite-dimensional Lie theory, topological graph theory, and combinatorial number theory.  Nonstandard analysis takes advantage of idealized elements to replace limiting processes and offers new insights into difficult problems.<br/><br/>The study of operator algebras originally began as a rigorous mathematical formulation for studying various phenomena in quantum physics.  A Hilbert space is a space consisting of vectors that can be added and multiplied by scalars and for which a notion of angle makes sense.  An operator on a Hilbert space is a continuous transformation of the Hilbert space that respects the addition and scalar multiplication; operators can themselves be added and multiplied and there is also a notion of an adjoint of an operator, which in some sense is akin to taking a matrix and taking its transpose.  An operator algebra is a collection of operators on a Hilbert space that is closed under addition, scalar multiplication and adjoint and is closed under taking limits in a suitable sense.  Understanding the properties of various kinds of operator algebras and attempting to classify them has been an important venture in functional analysis for over half a century.  In this project, we propose to continue the use of techniques from logic to study operator algebras and their model-theoretic properties, that is, the properties they possess that can be expressed in logical terms."

Our knowledge of the mathematical universe comes through deduction from axioms. This knowledge is inherently incomplete, and there is a wide range of questions that cannot be decided from the standard axioms. Set theorists have developed and studied additional axioms that allow settling some of these questions. Some of these axioms are purposely applicable outside set theory; others are of a nature that is, at face value, largely internal to set theory, but turn out to have effects on basic mathematical objects, for example on sets of real numbers. This project deals with axioms of both types, and with methods that compare their relative strengths. It involves the development of new axioms of the first type that should have applications in contexts that were previously out of reach, the construction of minimal models for axioms of the second type within set theory, and applications of both the axioms and their minimal models, within set theory and to the real numbers.<br/><br/>This project deals with several central areas in set theory: (i) forcing axioms and their applications; (ii) inner models theory; (iii) applications of inner models theory to descriptive set theory; and (iv) infinitary combinatorics. Forcing axioms are strengthenings of the Baire category theorem that allow meeting a prescribed number of dense sets with filters in prescribed classes of partial orders. In connection with (i) this project is particularly concerned with higher analogues of the proper forcing axiom (PFA). PFA, developed in the early 1980s, allows meeting $\aleph_1$ dense sets in proper partial orders. It has proved incredibly useful both as a starting point for consistency proofs and as an axiom leading to set theoretic structure theorems. Recent work of the PI shows that there are analogues of PFA which involve meeting more than $\aleph_1$ dense sets. It is one of the goals of this project to develop these analogues further, and to use them in extending applications of PFA to new contexts. The inner models program has as its main goal the construction of models for large cardinal axioms from assumptions that do not directly involve large cardinals (for example from forcing axioms). In connection with (ii), this project is primarily concerned with the construction, nature, and combinatorial properties of inner models at the level of supercompact cardinals. This is a long-standing project in the area and one that saw a great deal of recent progress. In connections with (iii) this project is concerned with applications of inner models theory at the level of Woodin cardinals to questions in descriptive set theory. The structure of inner models at this level is well understood, and there are well known connections to descriptive set theory. These connections already yielded solutions to several previously intractable questions in descriptive set theory. Finally, in connection with (iv) this project is primarily concerned with the tree property, a remnant of large cardinal strength that can consistently hold at small cardinals."

Many theorems in Ramsey theory can be proven using infinitary methods, in the form of ultraproducts, nonstandard analysis, topological dynamics, and ergodic theory.  Proof mining extracts finite information from these infinite arguments.  The proposed research will apply the methods of proof mining in order to investigate: 1) explicit bounds on numerical quantities which are not made apparent by infinite proofs, 2) approximations of infinitary Ramsey theoretic statements which ""quantify"" (typically, with a countable ordinal) how transfinite a given construction is, and 3) new finitary analogs of infinitary methods.  Where necessary, the proposed research will also expand the repertoire of proof mining tools by investigating how to interpret higher order notions, particularly the topological structure of the ultrafilters, in finitary terms.<br/><br/>Questions in mathematics about concrete, finite properties of the integers often turn out to have answers that make use of abstract, infinite notions.  The goal of the area of proof theory known as ""proof mining"" is to develop tools for explaining this phenomenon.  Often, we discover that there are finite methods which can replace the infinite ones, at the price of making the argument much more difficult to understand.  Some of these arguments are so unwieldy that it is difficult to imagine that they could be discovered directly.  By ""unwinding"" the infinite argument into finite arguments, however, we often discover new information.  For example, infinite proofs often prove that a number with some property exists while providing no information about which number it is; the corresponding finite argument, however, typically gives an upper bound on the size of that number."

Among the historically important applications of set theory are independence results, which are theorems which assert that certain statements can neither be proved nor disproved from the axioms of mathematics, or equivalently, that certain statements together with their negations are both consistent with such axioms. As an example, the continuum problem, which was posed by the founder of set theory Georg Cantor, asks how the size of the real number line compares with the infinite cardinalities. This problem was shown to be independent by the work of Gödel and Cohen. In the process, Cohen introduced forcing, which is a powerful technique for creating models of set theory which can be analyzed in terms of the combinatorial properties of partially ordered sets. The goals of the project are to make advances in the theory of forcing, and to prove consistency results in combinatorial set theory.<br/><br/>The main topics of the project are side condition forcing and its application to proving independence results. For several decades, elementary substructures have been an indispensable tool in many combinatorial arguments in set theory. The method of side conditions involves including elementary substructures in the conditions of a forcing poset, in order to ensure cardinal preservation or stronger properties, such as properness and the approximation property. The project will build on previous work of Krueger in the theory of adequate sets, which is a style of side condition forcing which has resulted in a number of advances in the area. For example, adequate sets were used to construct a forcing poset for adding a club subset of the second uncountable cardinal with finite conditions, while preserving CH, solving an open problem of Friedman. We aim to develop general techniques in side condition forcing, and to apply these techniques to solve problems in combinatorial set theory, especially problems related to the square principle, the approachability ideal, forcing axioms, the theory of trees, ideals and filters, and stationary sets."

Looking for solutions to such equations over the integers or rational numbers is one of the fundamental problems in number theory. It has a long history that goes back to ancient Greece. For the first project the investigator will study the fundamental question of whether it is possible to find a procedure that determines whether an arbitrary multivariable polynomial equation has a solution in a given number system. The second project focuses on computational aspects of certain special classes of equations that have applications to cryptography. This area of mathematics is very well-suited for motivating young students to study mathematics. The investigator will teach middle school and high school girls about cryptography and its mathematical background. There will be two yearly workshops which will involve hands-on experiments in the computer lab. There will also be professional development workshops for local mathematics teachers."

Suppose an  algebraic-geometric object, such as  a variety or a coherent sheaf,  is presented to us by means of some polynomials over an algebraically closed field. From this object other objects or invariants can be derived by applying some algebraic-geometric process. The question posed is now when can this  construction be carried out by using only polynomials of degree bounded by the degree of the initial polynomials? In particular, when is an invariant associated to this object uniformly bounded by the initial degrees only? Provided such uniform bounds exist, the following transfer principle can be applied. Encode, allowing negations and quantification, the construction or some of its properties in the field by means of the coefficients of the polynomials involved--the existence of uniform bounds is certainly a necessary, but often even a sufficient condition for this to hold. Then use the Lefschetz Principle to carry over results from positive characteristic to zero characteristic, or, conversely, from zero characteristic  to almost all positive characteristics. The investigator has already successfully applied this method to the following non-trivial facts: the Bass Conjecture, the Zariski-Lipman Conjecture and the New Intersection Theorem. In this proposal, he is especially interested in applications to tight closure in characteristic zero. Moreover, he proposes to infer from the existence of uniform bounds, the constructible nature of certain algebraic-geometric constructions.

The first measures the information content of finite binary strings, while the second captures the intuition that a random infinite binary sequence has no ""distinguishing features"". Both notions are rooted in computability theory, so it is natural that the study of randomness draws methods and ideas from computability theory, as well as classical mathematical subjects like measure theory and information theory. On the other hand, ideas from effective randomness have fed back into computability theory and even reverse mathematics, so there is cross-fertilization between effective randomness and other fields. Moreover, the theory of effective randomness has proved to be a rich field of study in its own right. Miller proposes to study the interaction between effective dimension and computational power, the interaction between degrees of randomness and computational power, triviality and lowness notions, and the strength of non-monotonic betting strategies.<br/><br/>A sequence of zeros and ones is considered random if the shortest<br/>(binary) computer program that generates the sequence has essentially the same length as the sequence itself. Intuitively, a random sequence has no patterns that can be exploited to give a compressed description. For example, the sequence consisting of a million zeros can be generated easily by a short program, so it is not random. On the other hand, there is a high probability that a sequence generated by flipping a coin a million times (tails is zero, heads is one) will be random. The length of the shortest program for a sequence is called the Kolmogorov complexity of the sequence; this notion was introduced in the 1960s. An infinite sequence is considered random if all of its finite initial segments are sufficiently random. This is equivalent to saying that no (semi-)computable betting strategy can win money trying to predict the digits of the sequence. The proposed research will address fundamental questions about randomness. Some are speculative, such as: ""What does it mean to say that one sequence is more random that another?"" This question has lead to difficult technical problems.<br/>It has motivated much of Miller's work on the initial segment complexity of Martin-Löf randoms and has recently led to the formulation of a notion that seems to come closer to providing a satisfactory answer. On the other hand, technical work often reveals higher level patterns. For example, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the assertion: ""More random sequences are less useful as oracles and computationally useless random sequences are automatically more random."" This ties back into the question about what it means to be ""more random"". Other basic questions, such as ""To what extent can we distill information out of a semi-random source?""<br/>have lead to interesting work but have not been exhausted on a technical level. Still others, like ""How powerful are betting strategies that are allowed to bet on the digits of a sequence in any order?"" remain largely open, despite concentrated effort. These are all fundamental questions that have proved to have interesting technical aspects."

The issues of the long-term behavior of an infinite sequence of processes or systems (however abstract) is at the core of many mathematical or physical questions. The universal setting for this investigation is known as the study of compact topological spaces. The ""points"" in the ambient space can represent any mathematical object in applications ranging from turbulent dynamical systems to a quantum mechanics setting. It has emerged that many natural questions are sensitive to the very foundational principles of mathematics itself. This research project pursues the resolution of such topological questions armed with the modern methods of uncovering possible dependence on the foundational axioms of mathematics. <br/><br/>The investigator will  study the influence of well-known countability properties on the structure of compact (Hausdorff)  spaces. Some spaces are determined by the behavior of their converging   sequences, while one of the most fundamental  spaces, henceforth  BetaN, the Stone-Cech compactification of the integers N,  are at the opposite extreme in that it has no converging sequences whatsoever. The behavior of BetaN is heavily influenced by extra axioms of set-theory  and  many natural questions about spaces of functions and measures and the like,  are as well. Additionally, the Banach spaces of continuous real-valued functions with domain some compact subset of BetaN  will be investigated. Again set-theoretic hypotheses, mixed with additional topological properties, lead to varying behavior in the important class of compact spaces. Our study is the  analysis of the interplay between the various  countable convergence conditions and the axioms of set-theory that influence them.  We are expecting to have to develop new techniques of constructing topological spaces as well as the refinement of forcing techniques to uncover basic combinatorial structures involved. These specific problems of longstanding will  be of central focus. (1) If an infinite compact space has no converging sequence, does it contain a copy of BetaN? (2) Are the metrizable compact spaces the only ones whose diagonal is uncountably-inaccessible? (3) Is the Banach space of continuous functions on the remainder BetaN - N, like  BetaN - N itself, essentially unique in certain models of set theory? (4) If the topology of a compact space is determined by converging countable sequences, is there a finite or countable bound on how many times one must iterate taking limits to capture all such limits?"

Moore<br/><br/>The proposed research concerns applying new techniques in set<br/>theory and infinite combinatorics to basis problems in topology,<br/>graph theory, and order theory.  In each case, the goal is to<br/>prove a classification theorem for the uncountable objects in a<br/>certain category.  Three such categories are topological spaces,<br/>bipartite graphs, and linear orders.  The goal is to use forcing<br/>axioms to prove that the category has a finite basis of classical<br/>examples. The techniques employed in analyzing such problems are<br/>often Ramsey theoretic and frequently draw upon results and<br/>motivation which arise in analyzing Cantor's continuum problem<br/>and Suslin's classification problem for the real line.  The<br/>proposed research seeks to expand our understanding of forcing<br/>axioms and their impact upon basis problems and the continuum<br/>problem.  The PI has already proved that the Proper Forcing Axiom<br/>implies that the uncountable linear orders have a five element<br/>basis, answering one of the central problems of the proposal.<br/>The proof involved new techniques in infinite combinatorics which<br/>are likely relevant to completing the rest of the proposal.  At<br/>the crux is the PI's notion of set mapping reflection which was<br/>formulated in relation to his results on the Proper Forcing Axiom<br/>and the size of the continuum.  Conspicuous in the solution is<br/>the need for a strong axiom of infinity to obtain the consistency<br/>of a five element basis.  This was quite unexpected and may serve<br/>both to explain past difficulties and fuel future research on the<br/>relationship between very large sets and combinatorics associated<br/>with the smallest uncountable cardinal.<br/><br/>The proposed research represents an analysis of fundamental<br/>mathematical objects - graphs, orders, and topologies - using a<br/>generalized version of the probabilistic method which Paul Erdos<br/>pioneered in his study of networks, packings, prime numbers, and<br/>circuit complexity.  The apothegm of the probabilistic method is:<br/>""If an object occurs with positive probability, it exists.""  For<br/>finite probability spaces, this is a fact.  For infinite spaces<br/>and their generalizations - known as forcing notions - it<br/>requires additional axiomatic assumptions - known as forcing<br/>axioms.  The PI has recently shown, for instance, under such<br/>assumptions that any linear order which cannot be represented as<br/>a collection of rational numbers must contain one of five<br/>critical orders.  While at the present this would seem to<br/>represent a theoretical accomplishment with little practical<br/>significance, the style of argument may inspire real world<br/>applications in the future.  A recent example of such a success<br/>in set theory is Laver's algorithm for comparing braids.  An<br/>important question which arises in a number of areas of<br/>mathematics and science - from particle physics to genetics - is<br/>when two braids can be made to look the same without cutting or<br/>breaking the strands.  Laver used ideas from the theory of large<br/>infinite sets to devise a fast algorithm for comparing braids.<br/>The previous algorithm was exponentially slow.  Current<br/>algorithms based on Laver's idea run in quadratic time (fast).<br/>Hence the study of infinite sets can provide practical<br/>applications to much more down to earth objects.  The proposed<br/>research may some day have applications in the traditional<br/>finitary probabilistic method or less foreseeable impact as with<br/>with Laver's work.<br/>"

The part of mathematical logic which is relevant to the proposed research is model theory,  which is about the ways in which mathematical objects or classes of objects are defined linguistically.  Although mathematical logic has traditional connections with the philosophy and foundations of mathematics, there have been many recent applications to core areas of mathematics, and the proposed research is in the latter tradition.  Among key problems to be studied are: (i) classifying the ways in which a ""group"" (collection of symmetries) can act as symmetries of a nice space, sometimes under some model theoretic assumptions, and (ii) what are the equations satisfied by some very special functions, such as exponential functions.<br/><br/>Here are some more details, written for mathematicians. The proposed research has two main parts. A central theme of the first part is the  classification of groups definable in models of a first order theory without the independence property.  This belongs to the ""tame"" model theory of groups, generalizing ""stable group theory"" which itself generalizes part of the theory of algebraic groups.  Although the motivation belongs largely to ""pure"" model theory, this part of the proposal touches also on topological dynamics and Lie groups. For example we expect to  produce ""new"" invariants of a discrete group, with many questions raised. The second part of the proposal deals with applications of model theory to diophantine geometry over function fields, building on earlier work of the PI and others. One problem is the extension of Ax-Schanuel-type theorems, on exponentiation and transcendence, to families of semiabelian varieties.  Another problem is to obtain a ""transparent"" account of the positive characteristic Mordell-Lang conjecture (due originally to Hrushovski)."

Meeks, University of Massachusetts (Amherst)<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Proposed Research Project Abstract<br/><br/>In this proposal the researcher will study the geometry, asymptotic<br/>behavior, conformal structure and topology of properly embedded<br/>minimal surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space.  One of the main<br/>goals of the proposal is to classify all of the properly embedded minimal <br/>surfaces which can be parametrized by domains in the Euclidean plane and<br/>to describe the asymptotic geometry of all finite genus examples.<br/>Related theoretical techniques concerning compactness, regularity and<br/>convergence of minimal surfaces of locally bounded genus will be<br/>investigated as well.  One hoped for application of this research is<br/>to classify all smooth finite group actions on the three-dimensional<br/>sphere.  As an outgrowth of his recent joint manuscript with Charles<br/>Frohman on the topological classification for minimal surfaces, the<br/>researcher proposes to prove that Bryant surfaces in hyperbolic <br/>three-space are unknotted.<br/><br/>Classical minimal surface theory has its roots in 18-th and 19-th<br/>century mathematics. Minimal surfaces are the first<br/>important examples of what is called the calculus of variations, first<br/>described by Euler around 1735.  Physically minimal surfaces can be<br/>modeled locally as soap films on wires or by surfaces of least-area <br/>relative to their local boundaries.  Minimal surfaces play an important<br/>role as a tool in the study of three-dimensional topology and<br/>Riemannian geometry. The subject of minimal surfaces has a broad impact in mathematics and<br/>physical sciences.  Minimal surfaces are stationary fluid interfaces,so<br/>their shapes arise in many physical problems.  The work in this<br/>proposal would classify the possible physical shapes which could occur<br/>as infinite interfaces.  Many of the known examples of minimal surfaces<br/>are observed physically, so it is of interest to have a rigorous<br/>theorem which predicts the shapes which can occur.<br/>The research proposed here strongly impacts the area of classical<br/>differential geometry of surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean<br/>space.  As is well known to geometers, minimal surface theory has been<br/>and continues to be one of the principal tools for proving theorems in<br/>general relativity and three-dimensional topology.  One well-known<br/>such application is Schoen and Yau's proof of the Positive Mass<br/>Conjecture.  Recent work of Gabai on the Generalized Smale Conjecture<br/>shows the continued importance of minimal surfaces in<br/>three-dimensional topology. Most of the research proposed here is related to and<br/>motivated by the hope that it will lead to a positive solution of the<br/>Pitts-Rubenstein Conjecture and to the classification of<br/>three-manifolds with finite fundamental group.  This hoped for<br/>topological application to one of the outstanding classification<br/>problems in mathematics has its roots in previous joint research by<br/>the researcher, Peter Scott, Charles Frohman and S. T. Yau.  In part<br/>because of the important connections with other areas of mathematics<br/>and the ease in which it is possible to make computer graphics<br/>pictures of beautiful classical examples, minimal surfaces continue to<br/>be one of the principal topics for popular science articles and public<br/>science exhibits.  Thus, indirectly, the exciting research problems<br/>outlined in this proposal help bring many young scientists and<br/>mathematicians to the frontiers of research. <br/><br/>"

One topic is the so-called universally measurable sets, where the fundamental open question is whether all such sets can have the property of Baire. One topic concerns the fragment of the Axiom of Choice which holds when a model of determinacy is expanded by adding a Ramsey ultrafilter. Another concerns lifting to the third uncountable cardinal Woodin's results on getting forcing axioms at the second uncountable cardinal by forcing over a determinacy model. The fourth concerns application of techniques from set theory to Shelah's study of Abstract Elementary Classes. Finally, Larson proposes to study ideals on the first uncountable cardinal from the point of view of certain inner models satisfying a small fragment of Choice. <br/><br/>The standard axioms for set theory, the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, serve as the commonly accepted foundations for mathematics, though as mathematics becomes more abstract, more and more issues arise which are not resolved by these axioms. Many of these issues are studied by set theorists, in hope of finding the right extension of these axioms. Developments in the study of such possible extensions have had a dramatic foundational impact in the last thirty years, affecting many areas of mathematics, and even philosophy.  The PI works on the border between some of the more technical, inward-directed areas of set theory and more classical areas with connections to other fields. Much of his work consists of finding applications of these more technical areas, and exposing them to a wider audience."

There are many interesting theorems about Shnirel'man density or lower density in additive number theory and a few interesting theorems about upper density or upper Banach density in combinatorial number theory. However, dealing with upper density or upper Banach density in additive number theory is still an uncharted area. One of the major untouched problems in this area is finding the growth and structure of sums of sets of positive upper density or positive upper Banach density. The principal investigator has been investigating the problem using nonstandard analysis and has obtained many interesting new results. The first part of the proposal describes a topological approach to the problem. Using U-topologies on a hyperfinite Loeb space, the principal investigator proves a powerful theorem in nonstandard analysis, which implies several new theorems in some standard mathematical fields including additive number theory. These theorems reveal a general phenomenon, which says that if two sets A and B are large in terms of ``measure'', then A plus B is not small in terms of ``order-topology''. The second part of the proposal describes a measure-theoretical approach. This approach allows one to derive a parallel theorem about upper Banach density to an existing theorem about Shnirel'man density or lower density in a very efficient way.<br/><br/>Additive number theory is classical and studies the properties of addition of natural numbers like 1,2,3,4... which people use every day. Nonstandard analysis is relatively new and more abstract. It adds infinitely large numbers into our number system. A non-expert may be surprised that the study of the elusive infinitely large numbers has an interesting impact on the study of ordinary numbers. The principal investigator has already achieved some success in this direction. By furthering his efforts, the principal investigator will contribute more innovative ideas and results to additive number theory.<br/>"

A basic question in Foundations of Mathematics is: Which set-existence axioms are needed to prove specific theorems of core mathematics?  Here ``core mathematics'' comprises standard topics in analysis, algebra, topology/geometry, etc.  The investigator and his colleagues study this question in terms of Subsystems of Second Order Arithmetic, as exposited in the investigator's recently published research monograph of that title.  An extensive series of case studies reveals that (i) many core mathematical theorems are logically equivalent to the set-existence axioms needed to prove them, (ii) only a handful of set-existence axioms arise in this way, (iii) the corresponding subsystems are linearly ordered by logical implication.  This gives a far-reaching classification of hundreds of core mathematical theorems into a small number of classes, the classes being defined in terms of logical equivalence over a weak base system.  This ongoing classification project is known as Reverse Mathematics.  It has many implications for philosophically motivated foundational programs such as constructivism (Bishop), computable mathematics (Pour-El/Richards), finitistic reductionism (Hilbert), predicativism (Weyl/Feferman), and predicative reductionism.  The Reverse Mathematics classification project is also a rich source of challenging technical problems.  The investigator and his colleagues are pursuing several of these, with emphasis on analysis, geometry, and countable combinatorics.  A direction for the future is to weaken the base system, in order to greatly broaden the scope of the classification project, providing significant points of contact with other parts of mathematics such as number theory and computational complexity.<br/><br/>Foundations of Mathematics is the study of the most basic concepts and logical structure of mathematics, with an eye to the unity of human knowledge.  This line of research deals fruitfully with fundamental questions such as: What is the nature of mathematical proof?  What is the logical structure of mathematics?  What are the appropriate axioms for mathematics?  Foundations of Mathematics is a rich subject with a long history, going back to Aristotle and Euclid and continuing in the hands of outstanding modern figures such Frege, Russell, Hilbert, Turing, and G del.  The investigator and his colleagues continue in this foundational tradition by pursuing a far-reaching classification project known as Reverse Mathematics.  Specific mathematical theorems are classified according to the axioms needed to prove them.  This reveals a remarkably simple logical structure within mathematics.  The existence of such a structure has many profound implications.  The ongoing research contributes to clarification of the role of the infinite in mathematics, the nature of mathematical constructions, the role of impredicative definitions in mathematics, and related issues. <br/>"

In particular, given a one-parametric monotone (increasing) definable family of subsets of a definable compact K, the goal is to construct a definable triangulation of K such that, inside each simplex of the triangulation, the family is equivalent to one of the ""standard"" families, classified by lex-monotone Boolean functions. Other classical geometric constructions that can be extended to definable families include cylindrical cell decomposition and Whitney stratification. Existence of such geometric constructions would allow one to investigate the ""fine structure"" of a definable family, and to compute its topological invariants, such as vanishing homology, intersection homology and the homotopy type of its Hausdorff limit. A monotone one-parametric definable family can be alternatively viewed as the family of sub-level sets of a definable function, so the proposed research can be viewed as a topological resolution of singularities of definable functions. The original motivation for the proposed research comes from the theory of approximation of definable sets by homotopy equivalent definable families of compact sets developed by Gabrielov and Vorobjov. Triangulation of a definable family would provide a crucial tool for the proof of the main conjecture of that theory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The proposed research would substantially enhance our understanding of geometry, topology and combinatorics of the sets definable in an o-minimal structure, and of the families of such sets. It suggests a new approach to the resolution of singularities of definable functions. The expected results would be new even for real semi-algebraic sets, the most basic (and the most important in applications) of all o-minimal structures. The proposed research will have impact in several different areas of pure and applied mathematics. Firstly, it will introduce fundamental new tools in the areas of real algebraic and o-minimal geometry, which will have direct impact in the the study of geometric and topological properties of definable sets in arbitrary o-minimal structure, including topological resolution of singularities in this context. It will also potentially have impact in certain areas of currently active interest in algebraic geometry and topological combinatorics. Finally, it is very likely the theory of semi-monotone sets and monotone maps will find applications in the extremely active areas of discrete and computational geometry (around the theory of persistent homology), as well as in control theory and dynamical systems.  One such application  to ""toric cubes"" emerged recently. These semi-algebraic sets which are related to edge-product sets in phylogenetics  are closures of graphs of monotone maps, thus they are topologically closed balls. At a higher level, the proposed research will bring ideas and techniques developed originally in the context of o-minimal geometry, to currently important problems in several other areas - in particular, algebraic geometry, discrete and computational geometry and control theory."

The traditional view of this program has been that of an increment program with progress measured by a progression up the hierarchy of large cardinals. It is now known that this view is not correct. A critical transition occurs at the level of exactly one supercompact cardinal, and in solving the Inner Model Problem for this specific large cardinal axiom, one solves the Inner Model Problem for essentially all known large cardinal axioms. The solution must necessarily yield an ultimate enlargement of Godel's inner model L. This  Ultimate-L must closely approximate the parent universe V within which it is constructed. Though the detailed construction of Ultimate-L is open, the axiom, ``V = Ultimate-L'',  can be precisely formulated and its consequences explored even now. One can also precisely specify a conjecture which would be the final outcome of the construction of Ultimate-L. This is the Ultimate-L Conjecture. This conjecture is closely related to several other conjectures and these collectively are the focus of this research proposal.<br/><br/>The mathematical study of Infinity is the focus of Set Theory. This subject began on the basis of principles isolated by Cantor and then elaborated on by others. By the early part of the 20th century the basic Zermelo-Frankel Axioms had been isolated and these axioms together with the Axiom of Choice are the ZFC axioms. The ZFC axioms define the current conception of (mathematical) Infinity. The seminal discoveries of the latter half of the 20th century showed that most of the fundamental questions asked about infinite sets are unsolvable on the basis of the ZFC axioms. Famous among these unsolvable questions is that of Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis which by the middle of the 20th century was widely regarded as one of the most important questions of mathematics.  This proposal focuses on the Ultimate-L Project. This project if successful will isolate (for the first time) an extension of the ZFC axioms that will resolve essentially all of these otherwise unsolvable questions (including that of the Continuum Hypothesis) and provide a framework for reducing all questions of Set Theory to questions of the existence of large infinite sets--these are the so called Axioms of Strong Infinity.  The new approach arises from a series of recent results which show that such an extension of the ZFC axioms might actually exist."

Its twenty-first meeting will be held on the campus of the University of California, Riverside, during June 17 - 20, 2014 as a symposium of the 95th annual meeting of the Pacific Division of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS-PD). Likewise, BEST's twenty-second meeting will be held on the campus of San Francisco State University during June 16-19, 2015, as a symposium of the 96th annual meeting of the AAAS-PD. BEST provides the western region of the United States with a conference in Set Theory that emphasizes diversity. The conference actively seeks to recruit and integrate student and early career dissemination of research in Set Theory and its affiliated mathematical disciplines into the conference agenda. The conference promotes interaction between different career stages in the field by also recruiting four plenary speakers. BEST also promotes broader understanding between mathematics and the sciences through opportunities arising from integration with the annual meeting of the AAAS-PD. BEST seeks to increase participation by underrepresented groups in Set Theory and Mathematics. <br/><br/>Set Theory is the foundation of Mathematics, and as such, of modeling and deductive reasoning in the natural sciences. Offering BEST at the Annual Meeting of the Pacific division of the AAAS thus provides potential for significant broader impact. Mathematics has always benefited from an influx of ideas and problems in other sciences, and conversely. It benefits the natural sciences, and also Set Theory, when opportunities for such cross fertilization are nurtured and facilitated. For each of the 2014 and 2015 meeting of BEST, the conference provides travel support for up to 10 student speakers, 4 postdoc speakers, 2 pre-tenure faculty speakers and 4 invited speakers.<br/><br/>Conference web site:  http://diamond.boisestate.edu/~best/"

The current line of research has its origins in Hilbert's Tenth Problem and its solution by Davis, Putnam, Robinson and Matiyasevich. When Yurii Matiyasevich showed that over rational integers, Diophantine sets were the same as computably enumerable sets, he showed that objects originating in two different branches of Mathematics were the same. This result initiated a search for common roots of algebra and logic, a search centered on the two most important objects: integers and rational numbers. While the methods employed in the search are for the most part algebraic or geometric, the questions asked originate in Model Theory or Computability Theory. Mazur's conjectures, their extensions and their consequences for existence of Diophantine definitions and Diophantine models are a fine example of a question in Computability Theory/ Model Theory generating a question in Algebraic Geometry which in turn produces a consequence in Computability Theory/Model Theory. Another example of interaction between the fields spurred by this line of research are the recent results by Mazur and Rubin concerning ranks of elliptic curves over number fields which were produced to answer some questions of Diophantine definability. In this proposal the author plans to continue her investigation of definability and decidability over algebraic extensions of rational numbers and rational function fields of all characteristics. In particular, we plan to explore first-order definability over infinite algebraic extensions of global fields and existential undefinability of a large class of function fields of positive characteristic. <br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>This proposal investigates questions of the following sort: given a polynomial equation in several variables, is there an algorithm (or a computer program) that can tell us if this equation has solutions in a particular set. These kinds of questions go back to a German Mathematician David Hilbert who asked at the beginning of the XX century whether we could algorithmically decide when a polynomial equation in several variables with integer coefficients has integer solutions. It turned out that such an algorithm does not exist and the solution by Davis, Putnam, Robinson and Matiyasevich took quite a few years. Unfortunately, we still don't know whether there is an algorithm to determine existence of solutions in rational numbers (fractions) as opposed to integers. That problem turned out to be even harder than the original one. As it is often the case with difficult problems, in order to solve it or even just to understand better the difficulties, an area of Mathematics has been created. This area considers polynomials as a part of a special Mathematical language (used by many areas of Mathematics and many sciences) and tries to determine what one can say in this language and whether one can decide algorithmically whether a sentence in this language is true. The current project considers these questions in various settings such as ``big rings'' (subsets of all rational numbers (fractions)) and function fields (objects formed by considering ratios of polynomials)."

It also investigates the close connections between computability, definability, and provability, and thus the roles of language and proof in mathematical research, two of the central topics of logic overall. Classical computability theory studies the information content of sets of integers (considered as coding natural mathematical problems), while applied computability theory investigates the question to what extent constructions, mainly from algebra and model theory, can be carried out effectively. In addition, computability theory gives insight into questions from other parts of mathematical logic, in particular in proof theory and in model theory.<br/>  Lempp proposes to investigate in particular the following aspects:<br/>  1. What can methods from computability theory tell us about quantifier bounds for axiomatizations of uncountably categorical theories?<br/>  2. How can one characterize computable models in terms of classical invariants, in particular Ketonen invariants for Boolean algebras and Ulm invariants for reduced abelian p-groups?<br/>  3. What is the proof-theoretic strength of principles from infinitary combinatorics, e.g., variants of Ramsey's Theorem, where new proof-theoretic principles seem to be most prevalent?<br/>  4. What is the algebraic structure of various degree structures, coding noncomputable sets of integers by relative computability?<br/><br/>Computability theory is the area of mathematical logic studying effectiveness in mathematics; it can be viewed as an attempt to bridge and clarify the gap between ""classical"" mathematics and ""effective"" mathematics, given that the former has moved away more and more from an algorithmic to a more abstract ""axiomatic"" point of view. At the same time, computability theory compares effectiveness with how well mathematical objects can be described in a formal mathematical language, and how easily mathematical statements can be proved in a formal mathematical system, two of the central topics of mathematical logic overall.<br/>  Lempp proposes to study these notions for a number of examples, particularly from modern algebra (e.g. groups and Boolean algebras) and from combinatorics. <br/>At the same time, Lempp plans to continue his investigation in degree theory, studying relative notions of computability and noncomputability and thus exploring the theoretical limitations of physical computing devices.<br/>"

The overall goal is to deepen understanding about how to recognize the complexity of certain types of computational problems. The project focuses on a suite of mathematical problems whose solutions will yield new information about the complexity of Constraint Satisfaction Problems. These problems (CSP's) include scheduling problems, resource allocation problems, and problems reducible to solving systems of linear equations. CSP's are theoretically solvable, but some are not solvable efficiently. The research will be aimed at identifying a clear boundary between the tractable and intractable cases, and at providing efficient algorithms for solutions in the tractable cases. Many fundamental problems in mathematics and computer science can be formulated as CSP's, and progress here would have both practical and theoretical significance. A second component of the project investigates classical computational problems in algebra in order to determine whether they are algorithmically solvable. A third component of the project is the further development of the software UACalc, which is a proof assistant developed to handle computations involving algebraic structures.<br/><br/>The researchers shall work to decide the truth of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture of Feder and Vardi, which states that every Constraint Satisfaction Problem with a finite template is solvable in polynomial time or is NP complete. They will further develop the algebraic approach to CSP's by refining knowledge about relations compatible with weak idempotent Maltsev conditions and about algebras with finitely related clones. A second goal of the project concerns the computable recognition of properties of finite algebras connected with the varieties they generate, such as whether a finite algebra with a finite residual bound is finitely axiomatizable, or whether a finite algebra can serve as the algebra of character values for a natural duality. One of the more tangible accomplishments of this project will be a broadening and strengthening of the applicability of the UACalc software. The agenda for this part of the project includes parallelizing the important subroutines, building in conjecture-testing and search features, adding further algorithms, and further developing the community of users and contributors."

The ""pure"" mathematics topics include investigations into set theopy, topology, and measure theory.  The properties of the standard (Lebesgue) measure on the real numbers are well understood, but various generalizations of Lebesgue measure lead to interesting open questions.  The proposer plans further work on measure extension axioms, which involve extending Lebesgue measure to measure additional (non-measurable) sets of real numbers.  He also plans to consider measures on other topological spaces.  The ""pure"" AR topics include improving the technology for linked resolution and automatic lemma generation.  In addition, a number of topics involve integrating AR and mathematics by using AR to derive mathematical theorems.  In particular, it is proposed to continue work on algebraic systems such as quasigroups and loops; one specific project here is to find a structure theory for G-loops.  It is also proposed to work on single axioms for groups.  Besides these specific questions in algebra, it is planned to look at the general problem of transcribing machine-generated proofs into meaningful form.  Work is also proposed on verification systems, which are designed to use a computer to check the correctness of existing mathematics.   There are three distinct, but related, threads to this research.  The first thread involves the expansion of our knowledge of traditional pure mathematics, without any specific practical application in mind.  The other two involve automated peasoning (AR) tools.   AR allows the computer to derive logical conclusions from given knowledge.  This subject has been in existence since the 1960s, but it is only in recent years that the tools have become powerful enough to discover conclusions which could not have been discovered without human assistance.  The second thread involves a continuation of the proposer's work in impr oving the AR tools and using these tools to create new results in mathematics.  This is of interest not only for the mathematics itself, but because it demonstrates the power of the tools, which can then be applied to reasoning tasks in other areas of science and engineering, as well as to autonomous decision making by robotic agents.  The third thread involves verification systems; these systems do not discover new mathematics, but rather are used as an automated database to collect and verify existing mathematics.  One potential application to advanced mathematics is the use of the computer as a referee to validate new mathematical results.  On the more elementary level, these tools can provide an accessible intelligent database of mathematical knowledge, which can be accessed by users of mathematics.  The difference between this and traditional database methods in cataloging mathematics is that the computer has ""understood"" and verified the knowledge it has, so that the the knowledge may be accessed by idea or concept, rather than by keywords."

Revived in the beginning of the twentieth century to deal with some foundational issues, mathematical logic turned out to also be useful for obtaining new results in mathematics. The recent applications of the model theory of difference and differential algebra to algebraic number theory are some of the most exciting examples of this. Difference equations, like differential equations, model real-world processes that change over time. Differential equations describe quantities that vary continuously with time, such as the positions of planets in space, while difference equations describe quantities that are only measured at discrete time intervals, such as the annual GDP of a country. Difference algebra is the abstract setting for studying difference equations; it also has applications to the kind of algebraic number theory that underpins modern cryptography and internet security.  Medvedev proposes to study the fine structure of solution sets of difference equations: to find algorithms for computing their dimensions and for identifying the very special cases where it is possible to define some kind of addition and/or multiplication on these sets.<br/><br/>A difference field is a field with a distinguished automorphism. The theory of difference closed fields is supersimple, meaning that Lascar rank is a good notion of dimension for complete types. Furthermore, the complete types of Lascar rank 1 satisfy the Zilber Trichotomy: each is nonorthogonal to a definable field, or nonorthogonal to a definable one-based group, or is disintegrated. While the fieldlike case of the trichotomy is relatively easy to identify in explicit examples, the dividing line between the grouplike and the disintegrated cases is much less clear. Similarly, even in the relatively nice case of groups, it is not always easy to determine the Lascar rank of a particular type. Beginning with her PhD thesis, Medvedev has worked on these sorts of problems, and on applications to algebraic dynamics. She is confident that she can generalize the main theorem of her PhD thesis from curves to higher-dimensional algebraic varieties. She has already accomplished the first part of this in far greater generality; the last part of the original proof should generalize easily; and the middle piece is supplied by an observation in a paper by Chatzidakis and Hrushovski. She expects to also obtain concrete results on the Lascar rank of certain groups G defined by systems of polynomial difference equations. This question can be translated to the language of linear algebra over the quasiendomorphism ring of the underlying algebraic group. For example, when G is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field in characteristic zero, this question reduces to linear algebra over the field of rational numbers. In addition, Medvedev proposes to continue expanding her foundational notes about difference schemes defined by Hrushovski in his work on the model theory of Frobenius automorphisms, filling in many missing detail, adding enlightening examples, and reorganizing the presentation to make it (more) understandable. Medvedev expects to continue involving students in this work, encouraging logicians and algebraic geometers to learn each other's languages when they are still young."

Primarily, but not totally, he<br/>will focus on the collection of all computably enumerable sets.<br/>The principal investigator will also consider the collection of<br/>all Pi01 classes and the computably enumerable degrees.  A long<br/>range goal is to provide a complete understanding of these<br/>structures and their automorphisms and definable orbits.  Some<br/>related projects in computable structure theory and models of<br/>second order arithmetic are also planned.<br/><br/>The main focus of these projects is on definability and<br/>computability.  These notions are both important in measuring the<br/>complexity of an answer to a mathematical problem.  Problems such<br/>as ""Is there a computer program which can solve all questions of<br/>this type?""  One develops an intertwined hierarchy of<br/>definability and computability.  Only answers which lay on the<br/>lowest level are computable and even then they are not always<br/>feasibly computable given today's computers.  Answers of higher<br/>complexity provide useful mathematical information, allow one to<br/>test the limits of mathematical techniques, reveal whether the<br/>wrong techniques are being used, and, in some very rare cases,<br/>can be useful for encoding/decoding information.<br/>"

Because the notion of a set is among the most primitive in mathematics, it was used as the basic fabric with which to build the more complicated objects of mathematics. Since that time, it has been realized that the properties of infinite sets are themselves quite subtle and defy a complete axiomatization. Moreover, these set-theoretic complexities sometimes manifest themselves in more complex mathematical structures, such as those studied in algebra, analysis, and geometry. The aim of this project is to further develop both our understanding of set-theoretic methods and also how they can be applied to problems arising in fields of mathematics such as algebra, analysis, and topology. While the project involves several lines of investigation, a central theme will be to develop a deeper understanding of the structure of the algebra of all piece-wise linear functions from the unit interval to itself using the lens of transfinite ordinal numbers.<br/><br/>The first part of the research project involves attempting to prove the following conjecture of Matthew Brin and Mark Sapir: if G is a group of piece-wise linear homeomorphims of the unit interval, then either G is elementary amenable or else G contains an isomorphic copy of Richard Thompson's group F. It is the PI's thesis that not only is this conjecture true, but that it will be a consequence of a much finer analysis of subgroup structure of PLoI, the group of piece-wise linear homeomophisms of the unit interval. This analysis is expected to have a number of other consequences: that the finitely generated subgroups of F are well quasi-ordered by embeddability; that any finitely presented subgroup of PLoI is either abelian or contains a copy of F; that Peano Arithmetic does not prove that F is amenable. Central to the analysis will be the countable transfinite ordinals. The second part of the research project concerns further developing techniques in pure set theory: methods for studying the combinatorics of the second uncountable cardinal via forcing axioms; the role that Jensen's diamond principle plays in the theory of the sets of hereditary cardinality at most aleph1. The project also supports graduate students working in other fields of logic, including computability theory and model theory."

One component of the research is foundational: it aims to better understand the relationship between classification problems (such as the basis problem for the uncountable linear orders and the metrization problem for compact convex sets) and the value of the cardinality of the continuum.  Currently we have an acceptable understanding of how to produce models of set theory in which the continuum is the second uncountable cardinal; the methods for producing models of set theory in which the continuum has some other value is considerably more limited.  Part of the present proposal aims to develop better techniques for producing models of set theory in which the continuum is larger than the second uncountable cardinal, while maintaining the ability to control other combinatorial properties of sets in the model.  Additionally, the proposal aims to further develop techniques in Ramsey theory needed to solve problems arising in other fields and in particular arising in the study of the amenability of groups.  Specifically the amenability of Thompson's group F - the subject of a longstanding problem in the field - is equivalent to a new type of Ramsey-theoretic statement relating to generalizations of Hindman's theorem to nonassociative operations.<br/><br/>Frequently in mathematics it is necessary to find a guiding heuristic in order to gain intuition in a setting where our own human experience falls short.  Two examples of this need are provided by the study of the combinatorial properties of infinite sets and the geometry of high dimensional spaces.  In both cases, guiding intuition is provided by a classical piece of mathematics known as Ramsey's theorem, concerning colorings of edges in a graph, a mathematical abstraction relating to networks.  The proposal aims to develop new techniques in Ramsey theory in order to improve our understanding of foundational issues relating to infinite sets and high dimensional geometric objects."

The first part of the project studies the integration theory of real constructible functions, which by definition are sums of products of real globally subanalytic functions and their logarithms.  The significance of the constructible functions is that they form the smallest class of functions that extends the globally subanalytic functions and is stable under integration.  Properties of Lebesgue spaces and also multivariate harmonic analysis will be studied in the context of constructible functions, including asymptotic estimates of oscillatory integrals and possibly questions concerning the integrability of Fourier transforms of constructible functions.  The main tool employed to study integration of constructible functions is the subanalytic preparation theorem.  The second part of the project aims to show through a purely analytic proof that the subanalytic preparation theorem holds in a more general quasianalytic setting.  An important motivation for doing so is to obtain a more informative proof of the preparation theorem that could be used to study the decidability of expansions of the real field by functions from quasianalytic classes and power functions in order to combine the principal investigator's previous work on decidability, which dealt only with functions from quasianalytic classes, and the work of Jones and Servi on decidability, which dealt only with power functions.<br/><br/>The origins of this project stem from two very classical questions which are pervasive throughout much of mathematics and its applications to science and engineering: 1) how to solve equations and inequalities, and related to this, how to determine the truth or falsity of statements built up through the use of equations and inequalities and also logical operations; 2) how to compute and study properties of functions defined by integral formulas.  The subanalytic preparation theorem shows that, at least in theory, a wide class of equations (which includes all polynomial equations) can be solved by radicals in a more liberal sense that allows the use of locally defined analytic functions in addition to arithmetic operations and radicals.  One aim of this project is to obtain a new algorithmic proof of the preparation theorem which, incidentally, would also generalize the theorem to wider classes of functions.  In addition to studying equations, the preparation theorem is an important tool for studying the asymptotic behavior and integrals of constructible functions, which is a class of functions that contains, in particular, all algebraic functions.   The Fourier transform is an important operation used in many areas of mathematics and its applications, and it is defined by an integral formula.  Another aim of the project is to the lay groundwork for a theory of integration that could be used to show that Fourier transforms of constructible functions have simple properties."

A basic goal is to determine how well this ""continuous"" model theory distinguishes analytic structures, and which properties it captures.  Among the applications is new information about isomorphisms and embeddings between structures and their ultrapowers, as these can be readily reinterpreted using continuous model theory. The project also develops the continuous version of many model theoretic concepts, such as stability, primeness, quantifier elimination, model companions, and existential closedness, both for general logical theorems and new paradigms in functional analysis. Up to this point the emphasis has been on tracial von Neumann algebras, but the approach is expected to be fruitful for C*-algebras, subfactors, algebras equipped with an automorphism, etc. <br/> <br/>The past few years have seen several surprising applications of logical techniques in functional analysis, mostly coming from combinatorial and descriptive set theory. This project aims to import concepts from model theory, the study of the relation between mathematical objects and their logical properties. Given an object, suppose one knows the answer to all the questions that can be formulated in a specific way (first-order syntax) -- how well does one understand the object?  In general one cannot recover the object itself, but this ""logical information"" is relevant to many lines of research, and only recently has an appropriate version of model theory been applied to operator algebras. This project will continue to develop the ties between logic and functional analysis, in particular supporting travel for researchers and training for graduate students. The results should offer insights into active topics with applications to other branches of mathematics, for instance  the Connes Embedding Problem and logical stability."

The definition of AECs and the basic theorems were introduced by Shelah in the seventies. An AEC can be thought of as a semantic generalization of the class of models of a first order theory and has roots in work of Jonsson in universal algebra.  Toward the end of 2001 activity in and attention to classification theory of Abstract Elementary Classes grew substantially. <br/>The most influential event leading to the fast-growing interest in non-elementary model theory was Zilber's attempt to understand Schanuel's conjecture over the complex numbers.  Zilber introduced a natural class of models containing the complex numbers with an exponentiation-like function that satisfies Schanuel's conjecture. <br/>While this class was not manageable by first order logic, the class is an AEC which is categorical in all uncountable cardinals and shares properties with Shelah's excellent classes.<br/>In a parallel development,  Rami Grossberg and the PI  introduced the notion of tameness and studied Galois-stable AECs under this assumption.  A weaker notion than tameness appeared implicitly in Shelah's work as an internal property of categorical AECs. Grossberg and VanDieren went on to prove a special case for tame classes of the main test question in the classification theory for AECs, namely Shelah's Categoricity Conjecture.  The purpose of this investigation is to expand this program of non-elementary model theory with the effects of improving the body of knowledge of first order stability theory and developing a natural framework within which problems outside of logic, for instance in algebraic geometry, can be interpreted and better understood. <br/><br/><br/>The research proposed is in model theory, a branch of mathematical logic. A model theorist typically starts with a set of axioms (a theory) and studies the different interpretations or models of these axioms.  The ultimate goal is to classify the theories to predict the underlying structure of the models.<br/>This involves introducing new machinery such as abstract independence relations which can then be used to answer problems in other branches of mathematics. <br/>Most work in model theory has been confined to examining sets of axioms which can be expressed using first-order logic.  <br/>Since there are many natural theories in mathematics that do not admit an appropriate treatment in first-order logic, the application field of the classification theory for first-order logic has  limits.  Recent interest in non-first-order (non-elementary) examples from algebraic geometry and number theory has triggered increased involvement in Shelah's program of classification theory for non-elementary classes. The proposed research involves (1) proving an important case of the main test-question in the classification theory for non-elementary classes (Shelah's Categoricity Conjecture) and (2) developing a stability theory for the general non-elementary context of tame AECs, while (3) facilitating under-represented group participation in mathematics.<br/><br/><br/>"

The orthodox view (e.g. Bourbaki)  holds that the ultimate axiomatic foundation for mathematics is  set-theoretical.  However, it is also clear that set theory  itself is concerned mainly with objects (pathological subsets of  the real line, large cardinals, etc.) which are rather far  removed from ordinary mathematics (analysis, algebra,  combinatorics, etc.).  The question which drives this project is:   Which set existence axioms are actually needed to prove specific  theorems of ordinary mathematics?  This question has been  investigated in the context of subsystems of second order  arithmetic, because:  (1) the language of second order arithmetic  is just rich enough to accommodate the bulk of ordinary  mathematical practice; and (2) subsystems of second order  arithmetic embody a detailed classification of set existence  axioms according to ""logical strength"" as measured by proof  theoretic ordinals.  It turns out that, for many specific  theorems of ordinary mathematics, one can precisely determine the  weakest subsystem of second order arithmetic in which the  given theorem is provable.  Furthermore, the subsystems which  arise in this way are few in number and correspond to certain  alternative foundational programs such as recursive analysis  (Myhill-Specker), predicativity (Weyl), predicative reductionism  (Kreisel-Feferman-Friedman), and finitisic reductionism  (Hilbert).  The study of subsystems of second order arithmetic  and their role in the foundations of mathematics has been  vigorously pursued by Stephen G. Simpson, the Principal  Investigator in this project, who is also in the final stages of  writing a book which covers the entire subject.  Some specific  questions which Simpson is currently investigating are: Which set  existence axioms are needed to prove basic theorems in countable  combinatorics (e.g. the dual Ramsey theorem of Carlson and  Simpson, and Laver's th eorem on embeddability of countable linear  orderings) and in Borel combinatorics?  Which set existence  axioms are needed to prove basic theorems of dynamical systems  theory?  Which set existence axioms are needed to prove Lebesgue  measurability of analytic sets?      This project is concerned  with the foundations and logical structure of mathematics.  The  orthodox view, promulgated by the Bourbaki school among others,  is that the ultimate foundation of mathematics is set  theoretical.  This view was basic to the ""New Math"" experiment of  the 1960's.  The research in this project tends to show that, in  certain respects, the orthodox view is incorrect and the  foundational claims of set theory are unwarranted.   Through systematic investigation of the relationships between  axioms and theorems, it emerges that carefully chosen systems of  second order arithmetic provide a logically more appropriate  foundation for mathematics.  ***"

The conference is centered on the topic of arithmetic and algebraic differentiation, with a special emphasis on the role of the Witt vectors. This is a rich and exotic algebraic construction that originated in the early 20th century in algebraic number theory and which, in recent decades, has played a key part in some of the most important advances in arithmetic algebraic geometry. The subject has attracted the attention of mathematical researchers from disparate fields who have traditionally worked in parallel.  A principal goal of this conference is to bring together these researchers from number theory, algebraic topology, and applied model theory to propel the study of the Witt vectors in all of these fields through this intellectual cross-fertilization.<br/> <br/>The conference will concentrate on topics related to  Witt vectors. The Witt vectors have been especially crucial in the arithmetic geometry, notably in p-adic Hodge theory.  Even more recently, in the form of the de Rham--Witt complex, the Witt vectors have had important applications in algebraic topology, especially in the work of Hesselholt-Madsen and their followers on algebraic K-theory. In the meantime, Witt vectors have grown further in number theory and arithmetic algebraic geometry, perhaps most importantly in Buium's work. His key insight was that Witt vectors are closely related to certain arithmetic analogues of differential operators, and he was then able to extend large parts of classical differential algebraic geometry to an ""arithmetic differential"" algebraic geometry. Here, we take seriously the analogy that ordinary differentiation is to formal power series as arithmetic differentiation is to the Witt vectors. This program includes, most notably, extending applications in Diophantine questions over function fields to such questions over number fields. This aspect of the theory was then picked up and carried further by applied model theorists especially in the work of Bélair-Macintyre-Scanlon in which Ax-Kochen-Ershov-style theorems are proven for the Witt vectors considered as a first-order structure in the language of rings augmented by the Witt-Frobenius operator and then in the work of Scanlon (and the recent extensions by Rideau) putting Buium's p-differential operators into a model theoretic context.  The work of Chatzidakis-Hrushovski on the model theory of difference fields brought out the fine structure of the algebraic part of the theory of arithmetic differential equations.  The subsequent applications of this theory to diophantine geometry by Hrushovski and Scanlon demonstrated its power and the reworking of the theory by Pink-Rössler and then by Rössler alone returned the ideas to algebraic geometry proper. As number theory, algebraic topology, and applied model theory have traditionally been quite separate fields, and it has not been easy for experts on Witt vectors and arithmetic differentiation in one of these fields to keep on top of developments in the others, even though they are working with largely the same mathematical objects. The purpose of the conference, then, is to remedy this. It will bring together researchers in these fields who study Witt vectors and arithmetic differentiation from their own points of view and for their own purposes.

One of the fundamental results of ergodic theory is the Mean Ergodic Theorem of von Neumann (1932), which amounts to an abstract statement about the limiting average state of a conservative system. In this project we seek to apply concepts and techniques of model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, to establish results on ergodic averages and ergodic recurrence by reinterpreting and extending research results discovered in the decades following von Neumann. The model-theoretic viewpoint should help illuminate and potentially unveil connections between ergodic theory and other branches of mathematics.<br/><br/>One of the project's goals is casting recent results on convergence of multiple ergodic averages into a suitable model-theoretic framework that allows combining analytic arguments with the theory of types, forking calculus, and ordinal ranks. An important concept in the proposed research is a ranking of the complexity of ""polynomial actions"" of a group G on some measure space X, or rather of the induced (polynomial) actions of G on various topological spaces (say, of functions on X). This requires developing an abstract algebraic framework that extends Leibman's theory of polynomial mappings between groups. Ancillary anticipated products of the model-theoretic approach include results on metastable convergence (akin to a weak form of uniformity in situations in which uniform convergence is absent), on convergence of averages on ultraproducts of polynomial-ergodic systems, and on polynomial-ergodic actions of ordinal (transfinite) rank (generalized Leibman degree).Connections and applications to combinatorics, Ramsey theory, and number theory will also be studied."

In inner model theory, he has focussed on questions related to the fundamental iterability problem, and on questions concerning how to construct inner models in various situations so as to obtain consistency-strength lower bounds. He is particularly interested in  obtaining large cardinal strength from the Proper Forcing Axiom,  from the failure of Jensen's square principle at a singular cardinal, and from the failure of the Unique Branches Hypothesis. In descriptive set theory, Steel is working on various questions related to the structure of models satisfying strong forms of determinacy.<br/><br/>    Strong axioms of infinity, or as they are more often called, large cardinal hypotheses, have been a focal point of work in set theory and the foundations of mathematics for thirty or forty years, for at least two reasons.  First, large cardinal hypotheses can be used to decide in a natural way many questions which cannot be decided on the basis of the commonly accepted system of axioms for mathematics, and second, large cardinal hypotheses provide a way of organizing and surveying all possible natural extensions of this commonly accepted system.   One important way to study large cardinal hypotheses is to construct canonical minimal inner models in which these hypotheses are true. Such models admit a systematic, detailed analysis of their internal structure which makes them an invaluable  technical tool in both sorts of application of large cardinal hypotheses.   At the moment, we have a good theory of canonical inner models satisfying ``There is a Woodin cardinal"", and even slightly stronger large cardinal hypotheses.  A fundamental open problem, one of the most important open problems in set theory, is to extend this theory to models satisfying ``There is a supercompact cardinal"".

Reimann intends to use concepts from dynamical systems and fractal geometry to study computability theoretic structures, in particular, the set MIN of reals of minimal Turing degree. Being a central object in the study of degrees of unsolvability, minimal degrees have recently exhibited interesting properties with respect to geometric measure theory. An open problem is the determination of the Hausdorff dimension of MIN. This problem is related to questions concerning extraction of randomness, diagonally non-computable functions, and Sacks forcing. It also motivates questions about algorithmic independence of reals, and how effective randomness (with respect to arbitrary measures) behaves under splits and joins. In a second area of investigation, Reimann proposes to study algorithmic reducibilities from the point of view of Borel equivalence relations. In a remarkable confluence of methods from descriptive set theory, ergodic theory, topological dynamics, and other areas, researchers have successfully classified many equivalence relations. Yet most equivalence relations arising from computability theoretic reducibilities have so far resisted complete classification. Reimann intends to investigate LR-equivalence, an equivalence relation of fundamental importance in effective randomness, and also the role uniformity plays in the classification of Borel equivalence relations.<br/><br/>Computability and randomness are two of the fundamental ideas that drove the scientific revolutions of the 20th century and changed the way we think about the world. Computability theory concerns itself with trying to understand which problems are solvable by computers. It was developed as a rigorous mathematical discipline in the 1930s through the work of Gödel, Church, Turing and others. Around the same time, Kolmogorov provided the notion of randomness with a solid mathematical foundation in the form of measure theoretic probability. The theory of effective randomness, which brings together probability theory and computability theory, has made it possible to qualitatively and quantitatively study the ways in which the two notions, computability and randomness, delimit and condition each other. It gives a mathematically precise meaning to questions like ""Are random processes necessarily uncomputable?"" or ""If we have access to randomness, can we facilitate computation?"" The major objective of the proposed project is to further the study of the interaction between randomness and computability. In one part of the project, this interaction is to be studied with the help of concepts from two other areas of mathematics - geometric measure theory and ergodic theory. In another part, Reimann plans to explore the role computability and randomness play in certain areas of dynamical systems. The latter objective can be seen as a first step of a long-term project - to help pave the way for a better, more exact understanding of the forms in which randomness does occur in this world, through the theory of effective randomness."

Baldwin will continue to investigate the the construction of homogeneous universal models with respect to a notion of strong submodel. One application of this method links stability theory with probability on finite models by providing a technique for not only proving 0-1 laws but obtaining model theoretic properties of the almost sure theory.  These model theoretic properties of the almost sure theory can be applied to problems in finite model theory. Baldwin has been a leader in the application of stability theory to the development of logic with finitely many variables. This work has, for the first time, provided serious links between the deep work of Cherlin, Harrington, Lachlan, and Zilber on homogeneous structures and the mainstream of finite model theory. Baldwin and Baizhanov are studying expansions of stable structures by arbitrary predicates; this is motivated by the earlier work with Benedikt on embedded finite model theory. Baldwin's earlier work with Holland has included applications in the area of algebra, specifically group theory, and in expansions of the complex numbers by an arbitrary subset. The present project will try to find some specific new structures which expand the complex numbers by subgroups of the multiplicative group.<br/><br/>Most of Baldwin's work has been in model theory, a branch of mathematical logic.  The general aim of this work is to understand `ordinary mathematics' at a higher level of abstraction.  This abstraction allows the discovery of common features in widely different areas of mathematics, ranging from probability theory to combinatorics to algebraic geometry.  This kind of work has been fruitful both in a better understanding of algebraic structures and in providing a background for investigations in database theory. In particular, Baldwin's work with his co-author Michael Benedikt of Lucent Technologies on `embedded finite model theory' has found limits on the expressibility of database queries. Baldwin will continue his educational work - primarily focusing on developing innovative and effective ways to prepare mathematics teachers.  The educational work is connected with two other NSF sponsored programs.<br/>"

A step towards the objective was taken in the forthcoming                  paper, ""From Discrete to Continuous Time"".  In that paper, a                    concept of forcing was introduced, and it was proved that a wide                class of statements about continuous-time stochastic processes                  are true if and only if forced by a sequence of discrete-time                   stochastic processes.  This forcing theorem can be used to prove                a variety of existence theorems.  For example, the method gives                 proofs of the existence of solutions of many stochastic                         differential equations.  The discrete-time statement is often                   easy to prove, and the forcing theorem does most of the work                    required to get from there to the continuous-time statement.                         The forcing theorem is presently formulated in a way which                 is natural from the point of view of mathematical logic but is                  often more difficult to apply than one would hope.  One reason                  for this is that one must first show that the statement to be                   proved is expressible in terms of ""liftable functions"", which are               defined in a technical way using nonstandard analysis.  The                     investigator is working toward a more general and more convenient               forcing theorem which would use nonstandard notions in its proof                but not in its application.  To complement this effort, the scope               of the method will be tested by developing a wider variety of                   applications to particular problems in probability theory.                           It is surprising that deep methods from mathematical logic                 can be used to obtain alternative and often simpler proofs in the               theory of probability.  However, the investigator has been very                 successful in demonstrating this by example over a period of many               years."

The classification of such representations is classical, but only offers a local theory, giving criteria for when two finite-dimensional representations are isomorphic. By considering the theory of finite-dimensional representations, the project seeks to study the representations called pseudo-finite dimensional representations, because they satisfy in the formal language all the theorems of finite-dimensional representations. These nonstandard representations will be used to study varieties of finite-dimensional representations, and thus lead to a global theory of finite-dimensional representations. The second activity of the project is to study the precise nature of the relationship between the Model Theory of Modules over a ring and the K-theory} of that ring. One hopes to establish a precise relationship between these two areas in terms of a theory of homology introduced to study formulae in the formal language of representations.

In the spring of 1967, the first conference was held at Arizona State University, and it was primarily a conference on general topology and continuum theory. In the past 45 years, the conference has grown in size and scope. It has continued to be the most important conference of the year in set-theoretic topology and continuum theory, while expanding to include the areas of dynamical systems, geometric group theory, and geometric topology. Over the years, the conference has made special efforts to broaden participation by women, underrepresented groups, graduate students, and young researchers, while expanding to cover a broader section of topology. Many of the most famous results of the last 45 years have been first announced at this conference.

Recent progress in the area of large cardinals indicates that it should be possible to prove the determinacy of such games using large cardinals in the region of Woodin cardinals.  The principal investigator has already proved results in this direction which introduce a basic technique for converting a general long game to an iteration game on a given model M, provided that M has enough large cardinals.  (The precise large cardinal needed of course depends on the length of the game in question.)  If M is an iterable model then the iteration game is determined, implying the determinacy of the original long game. The particular result proved is that continuously coded games with Pi 1-1 payoff are determined, assuming the existence of an iterable inner model with a cardinal which is `strong past a Woodin cardinal.' Using the techniques of this proof,  as a main building block we propose to study more closely the correlations between large cardinals and the determinacy of long games.    Games of infinite length play a major rule in current study of Descriptive Set Theory. Typically such games are played as follows: Fix a set A contained in the interval of reals between 0 and 1. We view those reals as written in binary base, so that a real has the form 0. a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5 ......  where a0, a1, etc. are ""digits"" namely either a 0 or a 1. Consider now a game played between two players (player I and player II) who take turns playing digits. I begins playing the digit a0, II follows playing the digit a1, then I plays the digit a2, II plays a3, etc. The two players continue playing ad-infinitum eventually producing the real number x = 0. a0, a1, a2, a3, .....  We call x a ""run"" of the game G(A), and say that the run x is won by player I in the case that x is in the set A. We say that the game G(A) is ""determined"" if one of the players has a winning strategy, or a set of instructions telling this play er precisely what to do in each round, and as long as these instructions are followed, the player is guaranteed to win.  For a general set A, the game G(A) need not be determined. However, it turns out that G(A) is determined if the set A is definable in certain ways. For example, Martin showed in 1970 that if A is the projection of a closed set then G(A) is determined. Recent progress in the study of large cardinals allows us to prove determinacy of longer games, and the purpose of this project is to study further the relationships between large cardinal axioms and the determinacy of several long games.  We expect this to help our understanding of large cardinals, since long games occur naturally in the study of large cardinals."

The long term goal of the project is to gain insight into  Diophantine (un)decidability of  Q and rings of algebraic integers of number fields.  The immediate goal is to study  Diophantine definability over some subrings of number fields and function fields.  In particular, if one thinks of the field as a ring where all the primes are allowed to occur in the ""denominators"" of the elements, then integers and rings of integral functions and numbers, where we understand the problem relatively well, can be considered as rings where no primes or only finitely many primes are allowed in the denominator.  Thus a natural intermediate step for the project is to understand what happens in the rings where infinitely many primes are allowed to appear in the denominator of the divisors of the elements.  These rings constitute the main focus of study by the Principal Investigator.  A related issue is the problem of defining of integrality at sets of primes using polynomial equations.  This problem has been solved for many fields for the case when the prime sets are finite.  However, even for the finite sets the question is open for the primes whose residue fields are algebraically closed.  The investigator also plans to study this problem with the goal of identifying situations where this kind of integrality is not definable in Diophantine terms.<br/><br/>In 1900, during an International Congress of  Mathematicians, a great German Mathematician David Hilbert presented a list of problems which had great influence on the development of Mathematics in the XX century and whose influnce is likely to extend to the XXI century.  The tenth problem on the list asked a question which, if rephrased in modern terms, can be stated as follows.  Is there a computer program which can determine whether an arbitrary polynomial equation in several variables has solutions in integers (whole numbers) ?  The answer turned out to be ""no"".  It took many years to obtain and it finally emerged in the late sixties in the work of Yurii Matyasevich building on results of Julia Robinson, Martin Davis and David Putnam.  There has been speculation that Hilbert did not expect this answer.  He hoped for an algorithm to ""solve"" all polynomial equations.  Such an algorithm would also solve all polynomial equations where the answers are allowed to be fractions.  The absence of the computer program for integer solutions left the question wide open for the case when we allow rational numbers (fractions) as solutions.  The answer to the question of what happens when we allow solutions to polynomial equations to be fractions is the long term goal of the project.  However, this problem currently seems too hard to approach directly.  As in many other situations in Mathematics, a gradual assault is probably necessary.  As a first step in our program we plan to move from integers to fractions in stages. If one thinks of rational numbers as a collection of numbers where any non-zero number is allowed in the denominator, and integers as a collection of numbers where no number is allowed in the denominator, one can visualize an intermediate step as a the study of collections of numbers where some but not all numbers are allowed in the denominator.  The investigator's immediate goal is to study such sets of numbers.  <br/><br/>Finally we should note that polynomial equations over rational numbers are present in virtually every part of Mathematics and its applications.  Thus understanding their logic properties is likely to shed light on many other problems.<br/><br/><br/>"

The geometric problems to be studied arise in<br/>algebraic, complex analytic, rigid analytic, and differential<br/>algebraic geometry.  Specific projects include the extension of<br/>the model theory of compact complex manifolds to nonstandard<br/>analytic spaces and rigid analytic spaces.  Some of this work<br/>investigates the extent to which Kaehler manifolds are free from<br/>model theoretic pathologies.  In diophantine geometry new<br/>uniformity and finiteness principles are being sought as<br/>reflections of similar results for enriched fields.  In<br/>particular, a program based on the model theory of separably<br/>closed fields aims to resolve a function field variant of Denis'<br/>analogue of the Mordell-Lang conjecture for Drinfeld modules.<br/>The fine structure of definable sets over D-fields will be<br/>investigated, aiming to extend relative completeness and<br/>quantifier elimination theorems to valued D-fields with richer<br/>analytic structure and to produce effective versions of<br/>quantifier elimination theorems in this setting.

To be more precise, model theory<br/>studies mathematical structures by considering the first-order<br/>sentences true in those structures, and the family of alternate<br/>structures that also satisfy all of those first-order sentences.<br/>(Sentences in logic are built out of a small repertoire of<br/>elements and constructions.

Topology and analysis<br/>are integrated in this research, especially in the area of Bohr topologies,<br/>since the subject involves the standard cardinal functions of general<br/>topology (such as weight, character, etc.), but is studied via the<br/>theory of group representations, which is part of harmonic analysis.<br/>Also, compact homogeneous spaces are often constructed with the aid<br/>of measures on the spaces.  Logic and set theory are relevant because<br/>statements about topology and measure theory are frequently independent<br/>of the usual axioms of set theory; when a result is proved independent,<br/>the methods used are those of formal logic.  For example, the notion of<br/>the Cantor-Bendixson sequence and scattered spaces is 100 years old,<br/>but there are still questions about the cardinals which can arise<br/>in the sequence of Cantor-Bendixson derivatives; part of the<br/>investigator's research studies how this sequence varies in different<br/>models of set theory.

Frequently in this area, one wants to know<br/>whether one equation implies another.  A proof of such an implication<br/>involves symbolic manipulation which can be performed by a computer program.<br/>In recent years, the hardware and software have become powerful enough<br/>to discover new implications and to solve problems which had been<br/>intractable without computer assistance.

In the discretely valued cases, the analytic  structure is<br/>provided by affinoid power series and in the non-discretely valued case by<br/>quasi-affinoid power series.

Pas's algebraic cell<br/>decomposition theorem gives results uniform in the prime p about the<br/>rationality of p-adic zeta-functions. This investigation will extend that<br/>theory to the analytic category and will also have applications to motivic<br/>integration. The methods to be used in the investigation come from model<br/>theory, rigid analytic function theory, commutative algebra and algebraic<br/>geometry.<br/><br/><br/>The Archimedean property of the real numbers is the fact that any two<br/>nonzero real numbers are commensurate; that is, there is an integer multiple<br/>of the first the magnitude of which exceeds the magnitude of the other.  In<br/>various branches of mathematics, e.g., number theory and algebraic geometry,<br/>non-Archimedean fields arise. These are fields with a notion of magnitude<br/>that does not satisfy the Archimedean property: the magnitude of a sum of<br/>elements is no larger than the largest term of the sum. A natural example of<br/>such a field is the field of Laurent series (power series in one variable<br/>with at most finitely many negative exponents) with coefficients in a field<br/>K. The nonzero elements of the coefficient field all have unit magnitude,<br/>and the magnitude of the variable is considered to be small (1/2, say.)<br/>Power series satisfy the implicit function theorem, a central property<br/>linking the magnitude and the algebraic structure. Other non-Archimedean<br/>fields satisfy Hensel's Lemma, a generalization of the implicit function<br/>theorem. A great deal of the algebraic structure of such fields is coded in<br/>the structures of the residue field (the ring of elements of unit magnitude<br/>modulo the ideal of smaller elements; in the example, K) and the value group<br/>(the set of magnitudes that occur; in the example, all integer powers of 2.)<br/>Definable subsets over such fields can often be decomposed into finitely<br/>many particularly simple pieces, called cells. This decomposition is very<br/>useful in the evaluation of various integrals that arise in number-theoretic<br/>and geometric contexts. Lipshitz and Robinson propose to extend<br/>non-Archimedean cell decomposition results and applications, which are known<br/>in the algebraic category, to the analytic category; i.e. to non-Archimedean<br/>fields satisfying Hensel's Lemma on which, in addition to the polynomial<br/>functions, a natural class of analytic functions is defined.<br/>"

Major problem is to know when the simple structure has generic stable reduct. A generic stable reduct of a simple structure is the definitional stable reduct preserving forking independence. If a stable reduct of a simple structure is found, then every problem is reduced to the stable context from the simple context. Hence then stationarity can be used, which will resolve many open problems such as definable infinite group existence in 1-based structures, and group configuration problems. Unlike the well-known  opposite process of constructing simple structures from stable structures, questions on finding stable fragments in simple structures seem to be rather difficult.<br/><br/>Over the last 3 to 4 decades, model theorists have worked on stable structures. Kim's thesis in 1996 opened new research areas in model theory enlarging the scope of  study of stable structures. Namely he proved the fundamental notion of independence in stable structures also exists in the wider class of structures, called simple. After then the study of simple structures takes place one of the major research area in model theory, and grows rapidly. Kim's continued work on simple structures will deepen and strengthen the model theoretic understanding of mathematical structures more.<br/>"

The fundamental question is to estimate the topological complexity of a definable set in terms of the structural complexity of its defining formula.  Recent developments in algorithmic real algebraic geometry and topological o-minimality suggest that an answer to that question can be obtained for a wide class of sets definable in o-minimal structures with the Bezout-type finiteness property. Notably, a combinatorial-geometric construction suggested by A. Gabrielov and N. Vorobjov allows one to approximate arbitrary definable sets by homotopy equivalent definably compact sets, simplifying considerably the study of their topology. Furthermore, homotopy colimit construction allows one to approximate a set defined by a formula with existential quantifiers by a homotopy equivalent simplicial object defined by a quantifier-free formula, and to employ the descent spectral sequence to compute topological invariants of the original set.  The proposed research will advance our understanding of the topological properties of the sets definable in o-minimal structures, and of the algorithmic complexity of operations with such sets and their families. It will provide new tools for the o-minimal algebraic topology.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to develop new upper bounds on the topological complexity of semialgebraic sets (defined by formulas with equations and inequalities between polynomials in several real variables)and their generalizations known as definable sets in o-minimal structures.  Given an appropriate measure of complexity, such as Bezout theorem bounding the number of zeros of a polynomial, the topological complexity of a definable set depends on the structural complexity of its defining formula.  Recently A. Gabrielov and N. Vorobjov suggested a construction replacing a general definable set with a homotopy equivalent compact set, applying a simple combinatorial procedure to the defining formula of the original set.  Thus the problem of the topological complexity of the general definable sets can be reduced to the more tractable problem for the compact sets.  The proposed research will establish new connections between o-minimal theory, topology, combinatorics, and real algebraic geometry.  It will provide new combinatorial and topological tools for development of faster computational algorithms in real algebraic and analytic geometry and its applications in control theory, visualization, and computer-aided design."

All of the Cholak's projects are motivated by the goal of understanding the relationship between computability and definability.  For example, Cholak studies automorphisms of the computably enumerable sets.  Take two computably enumerable sets A and B; if they are in the same orbit then A and B satisfy the same infinitary formulas.  Conversely, if A and B satisfy the same infinitary formulas then A and B are in the same orbit.  One of the structures that Cholak will continue to explore is the collection of all computably enumerable sets with the inclusion relation. In addition, Cholak will study what is definable in the collection of all effective closed classes of reals under inclusion and also under Medvedev reducibility which is defined via Turing reducibility.  Cholak is also in engaged in other projects involving reverse mathematics and various models of second-order arithmetic, computable structure theory, and effective measure theory and randomness.<br/><br/>Cholak works in the area of mathematical logic called computability theory. The central theme in computability theory is the relationship between Turing machines and definability.  Informally, a Turing machine is a computer with unlimited time and memory.  We say a natural number x is accepted by a Turing machine if the Turing machine halts with input x. We say a subset A of the natural numbers is computably enumerable iff there is a Turing machine that accepts x iff x is in A.  A set R is computable iff A and its complement are computably enumerable.  For Cholak, definability or expressibility means formulas, mainly in first-order logic, although many times we will have to move to stronger logics.  The classical result of Post in arithmetic relating computability and definability is that the computably enumerable sets are the sets that can be defined by a formula of the form ""there exists a number x such that some computable relation hold of x."

Issues to be studied during the project include relationships between Martin-Lof random sets and Hausdorff dimension or other measures of dimension, methods for extracting randomness from a semi-random source of data, dimensions and other properties of complexity classes of strings, distinctive properties of sets with low Kolmogorov complexity, and relationships between algorithmic randomness and reverse mathematics, which seeks to understand the axiomatic strength required by particular theories.<br/><br/>The forms of randomness studied by this group of researchers are based on some appealing ideas regarding infinite strings, such as the record of an infinitely repeated series of coin tosses.  Intuitively, the Kolmogorov complexity of a binary string like the record of heads and tails from coin tosses is the length of the shortest definitive description of the string.  Digitization methods for voice and picture transmission take advantage of the regularity and repetition in typical voice signals or digitized images, using much less space or time to record the sound or image data than might seem necessary.<br/>From the point of view of Kolmogorov complexity, a genuinely random binary string is probably its own shortest description, or nearly so.<br/>Some of the problems studied by this research group seek to establish properties of subsets of strings that have the same complexity, such as their dimension.  Activities of the group will include workshops, summer schools for graduate students, and travel for collaboration.<br/>"

This is equivalent to understanding sets of homomorphisms between a pair of discrete groups (the domain representing the equations and the target the group of interest).  The first half of this project is motivated by the theory of S-bundles, where S is a compact orientable surface.  Surface bundles arise throughout pure mathematics.  If B is a manifold (or other reasonable space), then there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of isomorphism classes  (oriented) of S-bundles over B and the set of (conjugacy classes of) homomorphisms from the fundamental group of B to the mapping class group of S.  The PI intends to develop a general structure theory for this set when the fundamental group of B is finitely  generated (which will always happen when B is compact, for example).  In the second half of this project (joint work with H, Wilton), we study homomorphisms to free (and more generally torsion-free hyperbolic) groups.  Broadly speaking, this is the class of `negatively-curved' groups.  This study is motivated by the first-order logic of these groups.  It is quite remarkable that the geometry of negative curvature has profound implications for first-order logic.  We intend to study these first-order theories from an algorithmic point of view, and find general decision processes which determine if a logical sentence is true or false.      Groups form a natural language for studying symmetries of mathematical objects.  As such, they arise throughout mathematics, and their study is informed by many branches of mathematics.  There are very few basic properties of a `symmetry', the most important of which is that it doesn't lose any information about the space, so it can be undone.  In this project, we treat the groups as objects of intrinsic interest, although the questions that we ask take their motivation from topology, geometry, logic and computer science as well as from within group theory.  Broadly speaking, we take a collection of equations over a group G, and try to understand the set of all solutions to these equations.  In the first half of the project, the group G is the mapping class group of a surface, which captures much of the symmetry of a surface (a space which looks like the plane in small sets).  Studying equations over the mapping class group is of fundamental interest in geometry and topology, through the study of surface bundles (a space which nearby any point decomposes into a pair of smaller sets, one of which is a surface).  The study of equations over the mapping class group gives a general theory parametrizing surface bundles.  The second half of this project studies equations over groups from the point of view of logic, and looks for general algorithms which decide if logical sentences are true of false.

In many theories of enriched fields, for example differential, difference and valued D-fields, the definable sets are known to enjoy strong regularity properties, but in most cases the determination of the full induced structure on even one-dimensional sets has proved elusive. Scanlon seeks to determine this structure on minimal sets in differentially closed and difference closed fields and to resolve foundational issues for the theory of valued D-fields in preparation to study the fine structure of their definable sets. The main trichotomy theorem on Zariski geometries, or more exactly the locally modular versus non-orthogonal to an infinite field dichotomy for Zariski groups, implies finiteness and uniformity theorems for certain subgroups and subvarieties of algebraic groups. Scanlon exploits this connection, especially by studying extensions of the Drinfeld module analogue of the Manin-Mumford conjecture to higher dimensional T-modules and of the Tate-Voloch conjecture in the case of p-adically transcendental moduli. Scanlon searches for mathematically meaningful interpretations of the triviality of  certain definable sets in differential or difference fields by  concentrating on certain subsets of moduli spaces of Shimura  varieties definable in some difference closed fields. Scanlon  studies inverse problems in model theoretic algebra. Specifically, Scanlon addresses the questions of which fields are stable and  which fields are supersimple.  <br/><br/>Scanlon undertakes this project to exhibit how the  deep, though apparently abstract, theorems of stability theory  manifest themselves in concrete mathematical practice.  Some such phenomena have already been discovered.  Given the strength of these abstract theorems, a systematic search  to interpret them can only lead to strong uniformity results on the number and properties of solutions to algebraic,  differential, and difference equations not readily perceived from an elementary perspective.<br/>"

The first of these directions relates to the treeable<br/>equivalence relations.  Following work of Adams and Kechris, we<br/>know that there is a mass of countable Borel equivalence<br/>relations which are mutually incomparable.  No such result is<br/>known for the treeable Borel equivalence relations. We do not<br/>know whether there are infinitely many distinct examples, and we<br/>basically have only one established example which is not<br/>hyperfinite. More generally we do not know whether the implicit<br/>involvement of measure theoretic examples involving free actions<br/>of the free group is the sole obstruction to hyperfiniteness. The<br/>second direction of Hjorth's project concerns issues in the fine<br/>study of Borel complexities of countable isomorphism types in the<br/>topology of quantifier free logic, and may be connected with a<br/>translation of some basic concepts from first order logic into a<br/>quantifier free context. The third direction of the proposal is<br/>to investigate some combinatorial questions, such as having a<br/>model with a certain partition property for definable partitions,<br/>for infinitary sentences, especially those arising as the Scott<br/>sentence of some countable structure; this may be related to a<br/>still open problem posed by Shelah in the 1970's on the Hanf<br/>number up to the continuum for countably infinitary logic.<br/><br/>In very general terms, this project can be located inside the<br/>branch of mathematics known as ""descriptive set theory"". This<br/>area arose around the end of 19th century as part of an effort to<br/>better understand the basic objects -- such as the real number<br/>line, real valued functions, subsets of the reals, subsets or<br/>regions of two dimensional and three dimensional space, the area<br/>or volume of such subsets -- which appear in calculus, and which<br/>are needed for applications in engineering, physics, and<br/>differential equations. Descriptive set theory does not itself<br/>actually address any of these eventual applications, but is<br/>rather preoccupied with purely foundational issues. Following<br/>Silver's theorem in the 1970's, many descriptive set theorists<br/>have become interested in equivalence relations on spaces such as<br/>the real number line, or two dimensional space, or similar<br/>classes of ""topological spaces"". The study of such equivalence<br/>relations leads to quotient objects which arise by considering<br/>the collection of all equivalence classes.  For instance if we<br/>set two real numbers to be equivalent when the result of<br/>subtracting one from the other is an integer (i.e. a ""whole<br/>number""), then the collection of equivalence classes may be<br/>naturally identified with the result of basically wrapping the<br/>real number line around itself, to obtain circle of circumference<br/>one. In this simple example the quotient object is easily<br/>understood, and has a geometrical representation.  Most of the<br/>work in Hjorth's area deals with the so called ""non-smooth""<br/>equivalence relations whose quotient objects do not admit such a<br/>representation, and the study of these quotient spaces is known<br/>to have connections with a variety of mathematical disciplines,<br/>such as ""dynamics"", and ""ergodic theory"", and some of the more<br/>abstract branches of ""analysis"", such as ""infinite dimensional<br/>group representations"".<br/>"

Constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory (CZF) provides a<br/>standard set theoretical framework for the development of constructive<br/>mathematics in the style of Errett Bishop. One of the hallmarks of<br/>constructive set theory is that it possesses a canonical<br/>interpretation in Martin-Lof's intuitionistic type theory which is<br/>considered to be the most acceptable foundational framework of ideas<br/>that make precise the constructive approach to mathematics. The<br/>interpretation employs the Curry-Howard `propositions as types' idea<br/>in that the axioms of constructive set theory get interpreted as<br/>provable propositions.  There are central questions that have guided<br/>researchers in classical Cantorian set theory over the last 50<br/>years. The objective of the research to be undertaken is to pursue<br/>similarly central questions for constructive set theory. Roughly<br/>speaking, these are questions addressing the independence of<br/>set-theoretic principles (via realizability notions and forcing over<br/>Kripke models), the role of large set axioms, and the formalization of<br/>mathematics within such a framework. The method of forcing featured<br/>prominently in Cohen's famous independence results regarding the axiom<br/>of choice and the continuum hypothesis. In a similar vein, forcing<br/>methods germane to the intuitionistic context, as well as<br/>realizability structures, will be employed to tackle problems of<br/>independence on the basis of CZF. The theory of large cardinals has<br/>dominated research in classical set theory for the last 40 years. In<br/>the context of intuitionistic set theories large cardinal axioms have<br/>to be replaced by large set axioms. A central part of the proposed<br/>research will be concerned with studying notions of largeness couched<br/>in terms of elementary embeddings. It is hoped that this project will<br/>also shed light on the role of large cardinals in devising strong<br/>ordinal representation systems in the area of proof theory called<br/>ordinal analysis.<br/><br/>Constructive mathematics distinguishes itself from its traditional<br/>counterpart, classical mathematics, by insisting that proofs of<br/>existential theorems in mathematics respect constructive existence:<br/>that an existential claim must afford means for constructing an<br/>instance of it. The foundations of a systematic approach to<br/>constructive mathematics, known as intuitionism, were laid in<br/>Brouwer's response to the foundational crisis in mathematics at the<br/>beginning of the 20th century.  Nowadays, in computer science,<br/>constructive formal systems based on type theory, or on the<br/>Curry-Howard isomorphism have become increasingly widespread for<br/>program development and language design. The concepts of program and<br/>constructive proof are connected in a deep way. Via this connection<br/>proofs are used to support the development of reliable software<br/>systems.  The axioms of so-called Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory provide<br/>an accepted framework for formalizing classical mathematics whereas<br/>Constructive Set Theory (briefly CST) is a universal framework for<br/>developing mathematics from a constructive viewpoint.  This project is<br/>motivated by the desire to answer central questions regarding CST,<br/>questions that have shaped the research activity in classical<br/>Cantorian set theory for more than half a century. The work is<br/>expected to substantially enhance our understanding of models of<br/>constructive set theory and thereby enlarge the realm of<br/>constructivism.<br/>"

This is the least level in the large cardinal hierarchy which cannot be captured by games of countable length.<br/>The present project aims to extend and study this connection between levels of the large cardinal hierarchy and games of uncountable length. 2 -- Using inner models for large cardinals it is possible to identify ultrafilters on specific sets of countable sequences in the smallest model of set theory containing all the reals. These ultrafilters give rise to interesting forcing extensions of the model. The PI is investigating the constructions of ultrafilters from large cardinals with the aim of generalizing them to the case of uncountable sequences, and studying the resulting forcing extensions. 3 --- The PI is studying the expressive power of the monadic second order language in the structure of the ordinals, both under the axiom of choice (for ordinals above the second uncountable cardinal) and under the axiom of determinacy.<br/><br/><br/>Large cardinal axioms state the existence of functions which act on the entire universe of sets, and preserve the structure of set membership. It is one of the most amazing discoveries of modern set theory that these functions, which at face value should only affect extremely large sets (large enough to not be definable from smaller sets using the structure of set membership), concretely affect the properties of real numbers. The intermediary connecting large cardinals to real numbers is the axiom of determinacy, stating the existence of winning strategies in infinite games of perfect information. The present project is part of the study of the ties between large cardinals and determinacy. It addresses games of uncountable infinite length, two-valued measures on sequences of uncountable length under the axiom of determinacy, and the expressive power of statements involving sets, but not functions, over wellordered structures.<br/>"

The existence of<br/>iterable models for specific large cardinals can be used to yield the<br/>determinacy of games of specific lengths, with increasing length<br/>corresponding to increasing large cardinal strength. These games in turn<br/>can be used to decide statements over minimal inner models for large<br/>cardinals. The PI is attempting to extend this correspondence, the first<br/>main test case being open games of length omega one. 2 - The study of<br/>Woodin cardinals leads naturally to a transfinite game known as the<br/>iteration game. Winning strategies (""iteration strategies"") for the good<br/>player in this game are essential to the comparison process that lies at<br/>the heart of inner model theory.

Extensive work, much of it done during the '70s and<br/>'80s, provides a detailed analysis of definable sets of reals assuming<br/>determinacy. Later work obtained determinacy from large cardinals. The PI<br/>is working to emulate the existing analysis of definable sets of reals,<br/>working directly from large cardinals. The point here is to try to convert<br/>methods used in the study of definable sets of reals, into methods which<br/>can be used in inner model theory and the study of large cardinals.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Set Theory is a branch of Mathematics which attempts to understand the<br/>universe of Mathematics, that is the collection of all objects studied by<br/>Mathematicians, or more precisely the collection of all _sets_.

Set Theorists<br/>view this universe as a structure in its own right, a structure which can<br/>itself be analyzed using mathematical reasoning. For example, a Set<br/>Theorist may ask ""is there an embedding of the universe into a similar,<br/>yet not identical, structure?"" Set Theorists work with such embeddings<br/>(""elementary embeddings"") in much the same way that one would work with<br/>functions on numbers, asking ""how similar is the target structure to the<br/>original structure?"" and ""what's the smallest size of a set actually moved<br/>by the embedding?"" Such questions about embeddings of the universe form a<br/>subfield of Set Theory known as the study of large cardinals. The<br/>terminology here hints at the answer to the last question mentioned.<br/>Indeed, the sets actually moved by elementary embeddings are substantially<br/>larger than any object studied in other branches of Mathematics<br/>(substantially larger than the set of real numbers for example). Yet it<br/>turns out that the existence of elementary embeddings has concrete effects<br/>on lower level objects, including concrete effects on real numbers. This<br/>project is part of the on-going effort to better understand large<br/>cardinals, and better understand their effects on the line of real<br/>numbers.

One of the problems considered is an old one from harmonic analysis, which asks whether the space of square integrable functions has a basis formed by translates of the same element. It is intended to attack this problem with tools from the theory of Banach spaces.  Another prominent question deals with the structure of the (complemented) subspaces of the space of p-integrable functions. The PI intends to bring to bear here the method of infinite asymptotic games, which he has developed in collaboration with E. Odell.  Several parts of this proposal deal with other issues originating from signal processing and data compression.

These logics are now used to model issues in program verification and computer security. The second area includes the study of structures representable by finite automata, decision procedures, the analysis and development of nonmonotonic logic, concurrent programming models, and applications of linear programming ideas and algorithms to data structures and logic programming. A primary focus here will be the logical and mathematical foundations of hybrid (continuous and discrete) control theory as well as the practical implementation of algorithms for these subjects based on the theoretical work being done. An important tool to be developed in this area is that of infinitary automata.<br/><br/>The research proposed is of two types. The first is directed at a better understanding of the fundamental notions of computability and relative difficulty of computation for different tasks. The theoretical work deals both with the abstract notion of computability as well as with applications to specific branches of, and questions in, other areas of mathematics. One important application (within mathematics) concerns the general question of what starting information is needed to be able to compute various aspects of many important classes of mathematical structures. In practical terms, the results at times indicate that there are no algorithms for certain important tasks or that more information than might have been expected is needed to write programs calculating the desired results. Another aspect of this work stresses the impact that the specific concrete choice of representation of an abstract mathematical structure has on one's ability to compute specific functions and relations. The second type deals more directly with developing the mathematical (and especially logical) tools needed for the crucial areas of program verification, data management and automated control of real-world complex systems. Commercial applications are expected for some of this work and there has already been a spin off to a start-up company developing several applications including data compression and network management algorithms. Other applications of these techniques to be investigated include multimedia applications and distributed continuous systems.<br/>"

Many important problems in complex and algebraic<br/>geometry concern the construction of holomorphic objects such as<br/>holomorphic sections of line bundles or maps between spaces.  It often<br/>happens that the construction problem simplifies as the degree of the<br/>line bundles or maps increases.  A classical example is the Kodaira<br/>embedding theorem, which says that there are enough sections of a high<br/>power of a positive line bundle to embed a Kahler manifold into<br/>projective space. Asymptotic results in general concern the properties<br/>of maps or sections of very high degree, where constructions often<br/>simplify. Effective results ask for the smallest power or degree where <br/>a desired effect takes place, e.g. the smallest power of a line bundle <br/>so that sections embed.  Many such results will be surveyed in our<br/>conference, with techniques ranging from partial differential equations<br/>to geometric and algebraic methods.<br/><br/>Our conference consists of seven days of lectures, with six to eight<br/>lectures a day. There will be lectures surveying past results and others which present new results.  The topics include complexity of<br/>zero-finding algorithms, moduli spaces, holomorphic maps, ground states<br/>of superconductors, and the vacuum selection problem in string theory.<br/>The lectures will expose the field to graduate students, postdoctoral<br/>researchers and junior faculty members, as well as to senior<br/>mathematicians.  Two graduate students and at least five postdocs are<br/>giving lectures.  A significant portion of our funding will go towards<br/>paying travel expenses of graduate students, young mathematicians and<br/>members of under-represented groups.<br/><br/>"

The interest in the questions of polynomial definability and decidability dates back to the time of the solution of Hilbert's Tenth Problem (HTP). At the beginning of the XX century a famous German mathematician David Hilbert asked the following question (among others): is there an algorithm that can determine whether an arbitrary polynomial equation in several variables and with integer coefficients has integer solutions? In the early 1970's, Yurii Matiyasevich, building on the work by Martin Davis, Hilary Putnam and Julia Robinson showed that the sets of integers which can be defined using polynomial equations and the sets of integers that can be listed by a computer program were the same, and thus showed that an algorithm sought by Hilbert did not exist. Matiyasevich's result immediately raised another question which proved to be even more vexing:<br/>is there an algorithm as described above but for the solutions in rational numbers? This problem is unsolved to this day.<br/>As is often the case with difficult problems in Mathematics, HTP for rational numbers as well as its sister problem, HTP for the rings of integers of number fields, generated many new questions such as Mazur's conjectures and various conjectures for elliptic curves. Many of these questions turned out to be questions of Number Theory or Algebraic Geometry, but they in turn generated quite interesting consequences in Logic. The author of this proposal believes that this line of research will continue to reveal new areas of interaction between Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry and Logic, enriching all the fields involved.<br/><br/><br/>The language of rings or the language of polynomial equations is widely used in almost all branches of Mathematics, sciences and social sciences, and therefore understanding what can be expressed by this language and whether we can determine algorithmically which sentences in this language are true is of importance to many areas of Mathematics and beyond. <br/><br/>"

In the case of function fields of characteristic 0 we also look at first-order definability problems since the corresponding existential definability problems seem out of reach at the moment.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>The interest in the questions of Diophantine definability and decidability dates back to the time of the solution of Hilbert's Tenth Problem (HTP).  At the beginning of the XX century Hilbert asked the following question (among others): is there an algorithm that can determine whether an arbitrary polynomial equation in several variables and with integer coefficients has integer solutions? In the early 1970's, Yurii Matijasevich, building on the work by Martin Davis, Hilary Putnam and Julia Robinson showed that Diophantine sets and computably enumerable sets of integers were the same and thus showed that an algorithm sought by Hilbert did not exist. Matijasevich's result immediately raised another question which proved to be even more vexing: is there an algorithm as described above but for the solutions in rational numbers?  This problem is unsolved to this day. As is often the case with difficult problems in Mathematics, HTP for rational numbers as well as its sister problem, HTP for the rings of integers of number fields, generated many new questions, quite interesting on their own, which the author of this proposal plans to investigate.  Some of these questions turned out to be questions of Number Theory or Algebraic Geometry, but they in turn generated quite interesting consequences in Logic.  The expectations are that questions originating in HTP will generate many new areas of interaction between Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry and Logic.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/>"

The SLALM was established in 1970 to strengthen working relations between researchers in the United States and Latin America. Thanks in no small part to the success of these relations, today, mathematical logic thrives in Latin America. The region has become a significant source of graduate students and postdocs to logic programs in the United States and elsewhere.  While the amount of research activity and the number of specialized conferences that are held in the region continues to grow, the SLALM remains the largest Pan-American logic conference. <br/><br/>The first SLALM was held in Santiago, Chile, under the leadership of Abraham Robinson, who at the time was President of the Association for Symbolic Logic. The meeting included two-week minicourses followed by a week-long conference. The minicourses were taught by A. Levi (The Hebrew University), R. Sikorski (Warsaw), and J. R. Schoenfield (Duke). Subsequent SLALM's were held in Brasilia, Brazil (1972), Campinas, Brazil (1974), Santiago, Chile (1978), Bogota, Colombia (1981), Caracas, Venezuela (1983), Campinas, Brazil (1985), Paraiba, Brazil (1989), Bahia Blanca, Argentina (1992), Bogota, Colombia (1995), Caracas, Venezuela (1998), San Jose, Costa Rica (2004), and Oaxaca, Mexico (2006). <br/><br/>The meeting is sponsored by the Association for Symbolic Logic.  It is expected that the proceedings of the 14th SLALM will be published by a major scientific publisher. Proceedings of past symposia have been published by North-Holland (in the series Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics) and Kluwer Academic Publishers. <br/>"

Several related problems in set theory will also be                    considered.                                                                          Set theory provides the popular way to lay the foundations                 for all of mathematics, the best known systematic attempt to do                 this being Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica.                       Important foundational questions concern the independence and the               consistency of the axioms used to establish set theory.  Zermelo                and Fraenkel's axioms (ZF for short) are one of the most                        convenient sets of basic axioms.  However, it has been known                    since the work of Kurt Goedel in the 1930's that no axioms for                  set theory can be complete as well as consistent.  This means                   that no set of axioms can be powerful enough to prove every                     possible proposition or else its negation, but not both.  Upon                  this startling theorem has been erected a rich theory, treating                 possible propositions P such that either P or Not P can be added                to ZF without resulting in a contradiction.  Any such proposition               P is said to be independent of ZF and can be taken as an                        additional axiom of set theory.  The principal technique for                    finding such independent propositions is Paul J. Cohen's so-                    called method of forcing and its offspring.  This is the circle                 of ideas involved in and motivating the investigator's research."

This target has resisted 40 years of effort by set theorists, despite major advances in the late 60's, in 1974-1980, and in 1985-1994.  That earlier work gave us a good understanding of canonical inner models satisfying ``There is a Woodin cardinal"", and even slightly stronger hypotheses, but it fell well short of superstrong cardinals. Since 1994, progress in this interval has been slow and incremental, but Steel believes it has opened up a promising line of attack. This line builds on concepts and methods derived from the evolving merger of inner model theory and pure descriptive set theory. It centers on the Core Model Induction technique, and the Mouse Set Conjecture.  Steel proposes to work in this direction.<br/><br/><br/>    Work on the set-theoretic foundations of mathematics has revealed a remarkable phenomenon. It appears that all natural mathematical theories fall into a single hierarchy, calibrated by the degree to which a commitment to the existence of large infinite sets is implicit in the theory. Moreover, this degree of commitment corresponds exactly to the power of the theory to decide questions about concrete objects, like natural numbers, real numbers, or sets of real numbers. Set theorists have developed two complementary methods for locating theories in this hierarchy of logical strength, namely Forcing and Inner Model Theory. <br/>While the basics of Forcing are understood in full generality, the basics of Inner Model Theory are not, and consequently many problems concerning the logical strengths of particular foundational theories remain open. <br/>Steel will work to further develop the basics of Inner Model Theory.<br/><br/>"

The central open problem here is whether every countable elementary submodel of V is appropriately iterable. Steel will work on this question, its fragments, and related issues. This effort is closely connected to pure descriptive set theory, the general study of definability for sets of real numbers. Steel plans to work in this area too, and in particular on questions related to the determinacy of infinite games. One very nice question here is whether all closed (in the countable-initial-segment topology) games of length aleph-one with projectively definable payoff are determined.    Many questions of mathematical interest are left undecided by ZFC, the commonly accepted system of axioms for mathematics. The most natural and successful way to extend ZFC so as to decide such questions is to add ""large cardinal hypotheses"" to ZFC. Such hypotheses play a central role in the foundations of mathematics, and because of this have been studied intensively over the last 30 to 40 years. One way to understand and use large cardinal hypotheses is by constructing canonical minimal universes, or ""inner models"", in which these hypotheses hold true. Inner model theory began with work of Kurt Godel in the 1930's, and from the late 1960's to the present the theory has undergone more or less continuous development. Set theorists have constructed and analyzed in detail canonical inner models for many large cardinal hypotheses, and these models have proved quite useful. Nevertheless, there are important large cardinal hypotheses which are beyond the reach of current inner model theory.  Steel will attempt to extend the theory so that it applies to these hypotheses."

Steel has some results on this connection,<br/>and plans to investigate the area further.<br/><br/><br/>    Much of set theory is motivated by the simple question<br/>``What are the proper axioms for mathematics?"".<br/>Mathematicians<br/>prove things for a living; what should they take as their<br/>common assumptions in these proofs? In the period 1905-1927, Russell,<br/>Zermelo, Fraenkel, and Skolem<br/>isolated an elegant list of basic statements about sets, expressed<br/>in the language of set theory, and showed that from these axioms<br/>one could derive all of the mathematics of the time. This system of<br/>axioms is now known as Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with Choice,<br/>or ZFC. While there is still no hint of a mathematical statement which<br/>cannot be expressed in the language of set theory, we have<br/>discovered that  ZFC is incomplete in important ways. A<br/>surprising number of quite basic questions about sets in general<br/>are not decided by the axioms of ZFC; moreover, many of the<br/>more abstract questions of analysis, algebra, and topology are<br/>similarly left undecided. This leads to Godel's Program, first formulated<br/>by Kurt Godel in the late 1940's:<br/>Decide<br/>mathematically interesting questions<br/>which are independent of ZFC in well-justified extensions of<br/>ZFC. There have been great successes in this direction obtained<br/>by adding ``large cardinal hypotheses"" to ZFC.<br/>Such hypotheses<br/>assert the existence of sets whose  cardinality, or size, is<br/>inaccessible from below in ever stronger senses. Possibly our deepest<br/>understanding of large cardinal hypotheses<br/>comes from the inner model program. This program attempts to<br/>associate to each large cardinal hypothesis H a canonical minimal<br/>universe of sets (or ``inner model"") in which H is true. The stronger<br/>H is, the largere this universe must be.<br/>The inner models<br/>we have so far constructed have internal structures which<br/>admit a systematic, detailed analysis, a  ``fine structure theory""<br/>which  gives us a very good idea as to what these universes<br/>look like.

The first measures the information content of finite binary strings, while the second captures the intuition that a random infinite binary sequence has no ""distinguishing features"". Both notions are rooted in computability theory, so it is not surprising that the study of randomness draws methods and ideas from computability theory, as well as core mathematical subjects like measure theory and information theory.<br/>However, the theory of effective randomness has proved to be a rich field of study in its own right. Miller proposes to study the strength of non-monotonic betting strategies, the computable power of sequences with positive effective Hausdorff dimension, degrees of randomness, and K-triviality.<br/><br/>A sequence of zeros and ones is considered random if the shortest<br/>(binary) computer program that generates the sequence has essentially the same length as the sequence itself. Intuitively, a random sequence has no patterns that can be exploited to give a compressed description. For example, the sequence consisting of a million zeros can be generated easily by a short program, so it is not random. On the other hand, there is a high probability that a sequence generated by flipping a coin a million times (tails is zero, heads is one) will be random. The length of the shortest program for a sequence is called the Kolmogorov complexity of the sequence; this notion was introduced in the 1960s. An infinite sequence is considered random if all of its finite initial segments are sufficiently random. This is equivalent to saying that no (semi-)computable betting strategy can win money trying to predict the digits of the sequence. The proposed research will address fundamental questions about randomness, including: (1) How powerful are computable betting strategies that are allowed to bet on the digits of a sequence in any order; (2) Is it possible to distill information out of a semi-random source to produce a random sequence or, at least, a sequence that has higher information density; (3) What does it mean to say that one infinite sequence is more random that another (4) How computationally weak are the infinite?<br/><br/>"

In                   particular, he will focus on definability questions in expansions               with extra analytic structure.  Most of his work over the past                  five years has been concentrated in this area.  He will attempt                 to prove further results of the following character.  (1) Marker,               Macintyre, and van den Dries have shown that the structure of the               real numbers with exponentiation and restricted analytic                        functions is O-minimal and admits elimination of quantifiers.                   O-minimality implies that there is a rich structure theory for                  the definable sets.  (2) Marker and Pillay have shown that any                  non-trivial reduct of an algebraically closed field that contains               addition is strong enough to recover the full field structure.                  (3) Marker has shown that if any non-trivial real structure is                  added to the complex numbers, then the real numbers are                         definable.  These latter two results can be thought of as                       attempts to examine the boundary of algebraic geometry.  The                    first says that weakening algebraic geometry leads to little more               than linear geometry.  The second says that extending algebraic                 geometry leads to the full complications of real algebraic                      geometry.                                                                            While ""definability"" is a logical notion, often it turns out               that the definable sets are ones which arise naturally and are of               great importance.  Model theoretic methods provide a new tool for               their study.  For example, the sets definable in the structure of               the real numbers with exponentiation and restricted analytic                    functions arise naturally in studying analytic geometry,                        dynamical systems, statistics, and control theory."

This has been a rapidly-developing area for the last several years, with many contributions from---and cooperation between---model theorists and analytic geometers. Miller hopes to build further interdisciplinary links by investigating possible connections and applications of o-minimality to control theory and variational calculus.   Many results of so-called classical mathematical analysis and geometry are very general; they apply to a wide variety of 'input', so one must expect to have to deal with a correspondingly wide variety of 'output'.  However, one could hope that if the input is, in some respect, particularly well behaved, then the output would be similarly well behaved.  This turns out to be true in many important cases, but to see this usually requires new, more constructive, proofs of classical results, as well as a deeper understanding of the 'good' properties of the input.  Before such projects can be begun, though, it is necessary to have some way of deciding which mathematical objects (inputs) should be considered as well behaved, and those which should be considered as troublesome. (This can be a difficult matter.) The theory of o-minimal structures on the real field, a sub-discipline of mathematical logic, has been developed in large part to deal with this issue. Recent years have seen rapid growth of the subject.  Applications and connections have been found in neural-net learning theory and theoretical economics, as well as several areas of pure mathematics."

Issues to be studied during the project include relationships between Martin-Lof random sets and Hausdorff dimension or other measures of dimension, methods for extracting randomness from a semi-random source of data, dimensions and other properties of complexity classes of strings, distinctive properties of sets with low Kolmogorov complexity, and relationships between algorithmic randomness and reverse mathematics, which seeks to understand the axiomatic strength required by particular theories.<br/><br/>The forms of randomness studied by this group of researchers are based on some appealing ideas regarding infinite strings, such as the record of an infinitely repeated series of coin tosses.  Intuitively, the Kolmogorov complexity of a binary string like the record of heads and tails from coin tosses is the length of the shortest definitive description of the string.  Digitization methods for voice and picture transmission take advantage of the regularity and repetition in typical voice signals or digitized images, using much less space or time to record the sound or image data than might seem necessary.<br/>From the point of view of Kolmogorov complexity, a genuinely random binary string is probably its own shortest description, or nearly so.<br/>Some of the problems studied by this research group seek to establish properties of subsets of strings that have the same complexity, such as their dimension.  Activities of the group will include workshops, summer schools for graduate students, and travel for collaboration.<br/>"

On the theoretical side the PI proposes to study the structures of Polish groups and the dynamics of their actions. The scope of the groups ranges from countable nilpotent groups to the full unitary group. On the application side the PI proposes to study the major open problems concerning classification of mathematical structures arising in analysis, topology and geometry. The main focus, though, will be classification problems that are comparable to the orbit equivalence relations induced by actions of the unitary group. One example of such a problem is the classification of bounded linear operators on a separable complex Hilbert space.<br/><br/>Many important open problems in various fields of mathematics ask for satisfactory classification of mathematical objects studied in the fields. These classification problems can often be formalized as definable equivalence relations, sometimes even orbit equivalence relations induced by Polish group actions. A striking theory of definable equivalence relations has been developed in the past 15 years or so and complete understanding of the complexity of many classification problems has thus been obtained. This project seeks further development of the descriptive set theory of definable equivalence relations. It is anticipated that mathematics of different fields be brought together in this foundational framework. For many of the old classification problems the descriptive set theoretic perspective is new and worth investigating.<br/>"

I guess this is fine, being general, and  better satisfies the purpose of the abstract??        Thanks in advance for any comments,           Derrick    ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                DMS-9626212  Derrick DuBose/Douglas Burke      Douglas Burke and Derrick DuBose are involved in this project.  The  research of Douglas Burke is primarily concerned with generic embeddings  in set theory.  These embeddings have been instrumental in using new  axioms (large cardinals) to prove statements that are undecidable in the  usual, basic axioms of set theory.  In particular, they have many  applications in descriptive set theory and combinatorial set theory. Burke  has two long term goals in his research program: (i) to apply large  cardinals and generic embeddings to combinatorial questions (and apply  combinatorial results to questions about generic embeddings), and (ii) to  extend the connection between large cardinals and definable well-orderings  of the real numbers to larger classes of definable sets. Derrick DuBose  has been engaged in establishing correspondences between inner models  closed under sharp functions and the determinacy of classe s near the  bottom of the analytic hierarchy.  He intends to establish similar  correspondences involving classes higher up in the analytic hierarchy.  He  will also continue to investigate moderate determinacy assumptions and the  determinacy strength of small ""mice"" and of mild large cardinal properties.    During the last fifty years, many natural mathematical questions have been  shown to be independent of the usual axioms of set theory.  In order to  decide such questions, new axioms have been introduced.  Of particular  importance are Large Cardinal Axioms and Determinacy Hypotheses. The Large  Cardinal Axioms are axioms of infinity, whereas determinacy hypotheses  state that certain definable infinite games have winning strategies.  Surprisingly, a strong connection exists between these two groups of  axioms. Also both are important in that they decide many properties about  sets of real numbers and other ``small'' sets."

Algebra is a rich source of algorithms,  many of which easily exceed the capabilities of modern computers.   In fact, some of the deepest results of modern mathematics are  centered on algorithmic problems in algebra, and this continues  to be a lively area of research.

A common theme of many of the questions to be explored is               the notion of the consistency strength of formal systems.  Among                the questions to be considered are the following:  Did Godel have               a proof of the independence of the axiom of choice from the                     axioms of type-theory prior to Cohen's discovery of forcing?  Is                the non-orthodox system of set-theory proposed by Quine                         consistent?  Can one get significantly more precise estimates on                the ""consistency strength"" of subsystems of second order number                 theory?                                                                              One of the important discoveries of twentieth century logic                is that the kinds of reasoning carried out by mathematicians can                be codified into axiom systems.  The most popular such system, by               far, is the axiom system proposed by Zermelo (and later modified                and corrected by Fraenkel and Skolem), but there are interesting                extensions that have been extensively studied by set theorists as               well as some significantly weaker ones beloved by the                           mathematically cautious.  It has become clear that the study                    of such weak subsystems of set-theory is intimately related to                  large cardinals (a research specialty of Solovay's).  Solovay                   hopes to apply his expertise in large cardinals to achieve a more               precise calibration of the strength of these weak subsystems.

Cal-Berkeley            This project studies the recursively enumerable (re) sets of  integers, in a way which is independent of their enumeration and  independent of how integers are viewed as coding information. It is  the study of re sets purely in relation to each other. The main  ingredients of this study are: automorphisms of the collection of re  sets - the symmetries that exist among re sets; and invariant sets -  the walls that prevent symmetries. These two ingredients naturally go  hand-in-hand.  The main method used in this field is called `priority  arguments'. This is a technique for performing computable  constructions that ensure appropriate non-computable properties. A  current guiding problem is: if an invariant set has non-trivial  minimum information content then each of its members must have maximum  information content. It is known that settling this would involve an  extension of current automorphism techniques.             A set is ""re"" (recursively enumerable) if it can be  computably listed. For example, the set of all possible theorems of  mathematics (deduced from the usual axioms) is re. This project  studies the re sets themselves. Penrose, in his book The Emperor's New  Mind, suggests an analogy between computing and consciousness. This  projects seeks possibilities in the more strained analogy between re  sets (independent of their enumeration) and the timeless aspects of  consciousness. There are existing results which can be seen as  indicative of this direction. The main method used in this field is  called ""priority arguments"". This is a method whereby a common purpose  can be achieved by establishing an extensive field of ""world views"",  all working towards the common goal in their own separate ways, most  of which are conflicting. One interesting feature of the method is  that all reasonable world views must be allowed, including those that  deny the common purpose (those world views do their jobs by working  towards their own ne gations). Success in this project would strengthen  the potentially profound implications of the analogy linking  consciousness with a priority argument -like universe."

The strength of a randomness notion can be increased by allowing more complicated tests, where the complexity of a test is measured in terms of the aforementioned hierarchies. A basic result due to Reimann and Slaman established that for any natural number there are only countably many reals not random for any continuous probability measure. One goal of the project is to find a topological or measure-theoretic characterization of these countable sets. Furthermore, Reimann will try to extend the results obtained for arithmetical randomness to higher notions of randomness, i.e. to tests having access to projective parameters, proving co-countability and correlating it with large cardinals in set theory. An essential tool for realizing these objectives is the construction of a measure relative to which a given real is random. The project aims at finding new ways to do this, in particular it investigates how methods from measure theory and analysis can be used. Finally, the principal investigator will study the relation between randomness for probability measures and non-finite measures, most prominently Hausdorff measures. Previous results indicate an intriguing difference between the two concepts with respect to computability theoretic hierarchies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Randomness is a fundamental mathematical phenomenon whose understanding and investigation is one of the prime achievements of mathematics, and science in general, in the 20th century. Classical measure and probability theory do not allow for considering individual random objects, such as the outcome of a sequence (finite or infinite) of coin tosses. The theory of algorithmic randomness, as developed by Kolmogorov, Martin-Loef, Levin, and others, provides a uniform framework for defining such individual random content in a spectrum that spans from finite words to transfinite cardinals. It is inherent in our understanding of randomness that random objects should exhibit a rather high complexity, usually phrased as unpredictability or presence of chaos. Twentieth century logic, on the other hand, has put forth numerous hierarchies that capture the complexity of an object such as an infinite binary sequence with respect to its descriptive complexity, i.e. how hard it is to define or compute this object in a given mathematical theory such as first or second order arithmetic.  <br/>Reimann's main goal is to study<br/>how logical complexity and randomness are intertwined. Previous research has shown that certain levels of logical complexity imply the presence of random content. The understanding of this relation, however, is far from complete. Among the principal questions Reimann tries to answer are: How is the the presence of randomness related to the definability strength of large cardinals? Are there other ways to capture the presence of random content within the hierarchies of logical complexity? Can in turn the logical complexity help to distinguish between randomness for different kinds of measures?<br/>"

In this case, X's being effectively random has<br/>been equivalently characterized by Martin-Lof in terms of X's having the properties<br/>of almost all infinite sequences and by Kolmogorov and others in terms of X's being<br/>unpredictable and indescribable. Slaman proposes to study the non-uniform case, its<br/>associated criteria for effective randomness, and its possibilities for the sets of random<br/>sequences. Even the most basic questions are open. For example, for a given infi-<br/>nite binary sequence X, under what conditions does there exist a measure relative to<br/>which X is random? This is a classic mathematical problem, given an individual data<br/>set determine a distribution which would generate it. Qualitatively, a measure relative<br/>to which X is random concentrates on the nonrandom aspects of X and thereby separates<br/>those from the random ones. Other ways to quantify X's random content include<br/>the complexity of X's initial segments and X's ability to compute uniformly random<br/>sequences. The proposal is to investigate all of these and the relationships between<br/>them.<br/> <br/>"

The traditional view of this program has been that of an increment program with progress measured by a  progression up the hierarchy of large cardinals. <br/>It is now known that this view is not correct. A critical transition occurs at the level of exactly one supercompact cardinal, and in solving the Inner Model Program for this specific large cardinal axiom, one solves the Inner Model Program for essentially all known large cardinal axioms. The solution must necessarily yield an ultimate enlargement of Goedel's inner model L. This ultimate-L must closely approximate the parent universe within which it is constructed. The ramifications for Set Theory will be profound, ranging from new inconsistency results in ZF to combinatorial theorems of ZFC proved by exploiting the closeness of ultimate-L to V. Ultimate-L will also provide a key setting for resolving the hierarchy of large cardinals beyond the level of omega-huge cardinals which constitute essentially the strongest large cardinals axioms which are not known to be inconsistent. The point is that ultimate-L inherits large cardinals from V exactly as L inherits large cardinals from V if 0-sharp does not exist. Therefore the analysis of what is possible in ultimate-L is in effect the analysis of what is possible in V.<br/><br/>The mathematical study of Infinity in its modern incarnation dates from the<br/>work of Cantor in the late 19th century, this area of mathematics<br/>is Set Theory. With the results of Goedel and then<br/>Cohen from the middle of the 20th century it was established that many of the<br/>fundamental problems could not be solved on the basis of the current ZFC axioms for  Set Theory. The most famous example is the problem of Cantor's Continuum<br/>Hypothesis which was placed first by Hilbert on his list of 20 questions<br/>in 1900. The solution to this question and the numerous other questions now known to be unsolvable requires the discovery of new axioms beyond the current axioms. Over the last few years a new approach to this problem has emerged based on generalizations of Goedel's axiom of constructibility. There is now convincing evidence that this approach will lead to new axioms which settle all the problems of Set Theory currently known to be unsolvable, are compatible with all known strong axioms of infinity, and which themselves are immune to kind of unsolvable problems that are ubiquitous in Set Theory. These examples will be the first examples of such axioms ever discovered and therefore show great promise for at long last finding the correct axioms for Set Theory and thereby solving in particular the problem of the Continuum Hypothesis."

Since set theory lies at the very foundation of                         mathematics, this enterprise has important consequences for the                 soundness of many accepted mathematical practices, although it is               customary for most working mathematicians to take this on faith."

Issues to be studied during the project include relationships between Martin-Lof random sets and Hausdorff dimension or other measures of dimension, methods for extracting randomness from a semi-random source of data, dimensions and other properties of complexity classes of strings, distinctive properties of sets with low Kolmogorov complexity, and relationships between algorithmic randomness and reverse mathematics, which seeks to understand the axiomatic strength required by particular theories.<br/><br/>The forms of randomness studied by this group of researchers are based on some appealing ideas regarding infinite strings, such as the record of an infinitely repeated series of coin tosses.

One of the fundamental               ideas of geometric stability theory is a trichotomy between                     geometries of combinatorial, linear, and geometric type.  A                     satisfying structure theory exists in the linear domain, for the                geometries themselves and the structures they coordinatize.  The                regular types of the third type are very poorly understood; until               recently they were believed to consist entirely of algebraic                    geometry objects (in finite rank), but a series of constructions                has shown the class to be much larger.  The research undertaken                 here will attempt to create a map of the nonlinear strongly                     minimal sets.  One goal is Cherlin's conjecture, that aleph-one-                categorical groups are simple algebraic groups over algebraically               closed fields.  In another direction, there are indications that                the geometric trichotomy is valid beyond the existing borders of                stability theory.  The investigator hopes to extend these                       borders, creating a theory of forking, regular types, and the                   parallel of the linear theory, for a class of structures that                   includes all the classical geometries (projective, unitary,                     orthogonal, symplectic) among its (linear) regular types.  This                 would have applications to pseudo-finite structures and possible                interactions with finite group theory.                                               One of the remarkable things about this research area is                   that it shows that a great deal of information about algebraic                  structures can be obtained from intensive study of the                          mathematical language in which one deals with them.  Shelah,                    Hrushovski, and others have pushed this model-theoretic approach                much further in recent years than most people previously thought                possible."

Finite-state automata are Turing machines with fixed finite bounds on resource use.  Continuing a tradition of studying that part of mathematics which can be performed effectively, the field of automatic structures explores mathematical objects which can be represented by automata.  Questions about automatic structures may be grouped into two themes: developing structural characterizations and studying algorithmic consequences of such characterizations. Dr. Minnes has worked in both of these areas, including proving both positive and negative results about the existence of such characterizations. Through this NSF grant, she will work towards answering these guiding questions in the context of less understood classes of structures.  For example, the fundamental groups associated with certain manifolds have intimate connections with automata and some sequences arising in symbolic dynamics and combinatorics may be seen as generated by automata.  The tools developed by the automatic structures community may lead to a better structural understanding of these objects.  In parallel,  Dr. Minnes seeks to develop the area of automatic model theory.   Much work has been done in understanding how the standard results of model theory change when restricted to the framework of computable or polynomial-time objects.  Preliminary work shows interesting analogies in the automatic structures world and suggests the promise of fruitful results.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>With the increasing reliance of the modern world on computerized and networked systems, the theoretical underpinnings of computational feasibility have gained more immediate relevance.  Starting in the 1950s, the Turing machine, an idealized model of a computer with no bounds on memory use or computation time, led to astonishing and foundational insight into what problems can or cannot be solved by any algorithm.  This NSF project focusses on a different model for the computer, the finite automaton, which more closely captures online computation and resource bounds.  Dr. Minnes will study questions which relate finite automata both to traditional topics of mathematical logic  and to new interactions with other fields of mathematics and computer science."

This work has already started, on two  fronts.  On the one hand, he formulated a conjecture analogous to  the Lang-Weil estimates, but more general, that would determine  the first order theory of the Frobenius.  On the other hand,  together with several coworkers, he is in the process of carrying  out the fundamental model theoretic analysis of the theory of  difference fields in question, along the lines of Shelah and  Zilber.  Put together, these should throw considerable light on  the issue; there will be applications to finite simple groups and  perhaps to finite groups in general.       The work described in the above paragraph forms part of a  general trend in the area of mathematical logic known as model  theory.  For several decades, this subject developed  autonomously.  The lack of external pressure allowed it to refine  distinct points of view on algebraic structures, and to reach a  degree of technical maturity.  However, this was done as it were  in laboratory conditions, under assumptions (""stability"") that  are too restrictive in practical applications.  The time seems  ripe to test the ideas developed in this period against more  complex structures, in particular, number theoretic and geometric  ones.  This requires identifying structures appropriate for model  theoretic analysis and performing an algebro-geometric analysis  needed to prepare for the model theoretic tools.  It also  requires generalizing the model theoretic ideas beyond the  ""stable"" context in which they were conceived.  Some success has  been had with these methods, including the investigation of  finite structures with a high degree of symmetry, and the proof  of certain conjectures in number theory.  One hopes that this is  only the beginning of the road.  ***"

Friedman      Friedman intends to work in four directions, all aimed at an understanding of the structure of the set-theoretic universe through the techniques of fine structure and forcing.  First, he intends to complete his book, entitled, ""Fine Structure and Class Forcing"".  Second, Friedman will pursue a number of questions in the area of class forcing over L through the use of the coding method and his method of iterated class forcing.  Third, Friedman intends to lay the foundation for an analogous theory relative to K=the core model for a strong cardinal, by first developing an improved fine structure theory for this model, and then adapting the coding method to this new context.  This work will be carried out jointly with his collaborators Jensen, Koepke and Wylie.  Lastly, Friedman will investigate a number of other forcing problems, related to 0# (with Velickovic), involving large cardinals (with Cummings) and in definability theory (with Bagaria).    Early this century, mathematicians developed the system ZFC of axioms for set theory, adequate to express and prove the theorems of mathematics.  However ZFC is incomplete:  there are statements that can neither be proved nor refuted in this theory.  An important task for the set theorist is to uncover new axioms to adjoin to ZFC so as to alleviate this incompleteness.  This will provide powerful new tools for the working mathematician, which may in addition have exciting applications for science in general.  Friedman's work is focused on the deepest possible understanding of the structure of models of ZFC, as a way of discovering the right axioms to add to this theory."

(The latter should help make the many significant applications of               this method accessible to a wider audience of set-theorists.)  (1)              With his former student, Dorshka Wylie (now an NSF fellow and an                instructor at M.I.T.), he is engaged in a radically new approach to             the core model K for a strong cardinal, which should provide a                  powerful new tool for establishing combinatorial principles in K.               (2) A second goal is to enable coding methods to lift smoothly to               K, permitting extension of results such as his proof of the Pi-1-2-             Singleton Conjecture to the core model context.  (3) A long-                    standing open question in the theory of iterated forcing concerns               the problem of extending the method of countable support iteration              beyond omega-2 without collapsing cardinals.  A number of important             consistency problems could be solved by such a technique.  With his             student, Dimitiros Tzimas, Friedman will attempt to develop such a              method through the use of morasses.  (4) Friedman will also explore             questions in descriptive set theory as to whether the full                      structure theory for projective sets can be developed directly from             the existence of large cardinals, without the use of infinite game              theory.                                                                              Set theory provides the popular way to lay the foundations for             all of mathematics, the best known systematic attempt to do this                being Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, dating from                the early part of the 20th Century.  Important foundational                     questions concern the independence and the consistency of the                   axioms used to establish set theory.  Zermelo and Fraenkel's axioms             (ZF for short) are one of the most convenient sets of basic axioms.             However, it has been known since the work of Kurt Goedel in the                 1930's that no axioms for set theory can be complete as well as                 consistent.  This means that no set of axioms can be powerful                   enough to prove every possible proposition or else its negation,                but not both.  Upon this startling theorem has been erected a rich              theory, treating possible propositions P such that either P or Not              P can be added to ZF without resulting in a contradiction.  Any                 such proposition P is said to be independent of ZF and can be taken             as an additional axiom of set theory.  The principal technique for              finding such independent propositions is Paul J. Cohen's so-called              method of forcing and its offspring.  This is the circle of ideas               involved in and motivating the investigator's research."

Various problems and their relationship to the constructible                    universe of Godel and to certain other models of set theory                     will be considered.

A highly                        developed axiomatic set theory exists, however, driven by the                   desire to make the foundations of mathematics absolutely secure                 and free from paradox of any kind.

It was shown that they               are all built around projective spaces over finite fields.  It                  was expected that a similar but much deeper theory exists for                   aleph-one categorical theories; here the corresponding geometries               would include algebraically closed fields.  Recently a non-                     classical geometry controlling an aleph-one categorical structure               has been constructed.  The proposed research would proceed in two               directions.  The first would directly investigate the limits of                 such constructions and attempt to create a new picture of the                   subject.  The most important test-question here is whether                      Cherlin's conjecture that every simple group of finite Morley                   rank is an algebraic group over an algebraically closed field is                still viable.  The second direction involves a given geometry                   inside an ambient structure; in the simplest case the structure                 is obtained from a strongly minimal set by blowing up each point                to a finite set; the question is how the structure may be                       expanded without disturbing the base.  This would have                          applications both to the classification of the totally                          categorical theories and to the general theory.  The immediate                  results of such a project in abstract model theory are likely to                be mainly of foundational interest, but the refined                             combinatorical techniques developed in order to prove them may                  have much wider appeal and utility."

In recent years this connection has been developed with an eye to algebraic applications of first order methods to modules, and in particular to artin algebras.  The present project will expand this approach to include the model theory of modules with an endomorphism, or equivalently - the model theory of modules over the ring of polynomials.  Also to be considered are (1) first-order variants of the Brauer-Thrall conjectures for an artin algebra, and (2) a theory of homology for positive-primitive formulas.    This research involves the connection between logic and algebra.  Logic provides the context in which one can study the expressive power of mathematical language; as such it is an essential tool in computing.  Algebra provides a vehicle for understanding notions such as symmetry and mappings, and finds application in sciences and manufacturing.  Professor Herzog's research takes place in a part of algebra called module theory, which is akin to, but broader than, linear algebra.  The problems which arise are similar to solving systems of linear equations.  By forging the relationships between logic and algebra, his research will provide new understanding of modules."

How does adding structure (such as an ordering) to the <br/>members of a class effect the computational properties?  These <br/>questions aim toward a deeper understanding of the connection between <br/>computation and algebraic behavior in mathematics.   <br/> <br/><br/>Many theorems in mathematics state that given certain conditions, a <br/>particular mathematical object must exist.  There are numerous ways to <br/>study the effectiveness of such a theorem.  One method, called <br/>computable or recursive mathematics, uses an idealized model of a <br/>computer in which computations are allowed to run for arbitrarily long <br/>(but finite) amounts of time and to use arbitrarily large (but finite) <br/>amounts of memory.  The fundamental question is whether such an <br/>idealized computer can construct the desired mathematical object from <br/>the theorem.  If the answer to this question is no, then the theorem <br/>uses a method of construction that cannot be performed on an actual <br/>computer no matter how much technology increases computer speed and <br/>memory size.  Because this question requires that mathematical objects <br/>be coded into the binary language of computers, the answer sometimes  <br/>depends on the type of coding used.  Solomon proposes to study a number <br/>of algebraic constructions from this point of view and in particular to <br/>study when ineffectiveness is caused by a poor choice of coding (and <br/>hence can be fixed by a better choice of coding) and when it is caused <br/>by inherent conflicts between mathematical structure and computation <br/>(and hence cannot be removed by clever coding).  Solomon also proposes <br/>to use a second method, called reverse mathematics, to study the <br/>effectiveness of numerous mathematical theorems.  In this approach, one <br/>isolates the mathematical axioms required to prove the theorem.  <br/>Reverse mathematics and computable mathematics are closely related.

Another is to complete our project of determining if there is a small upper bound to the natural notion called the sequential order of a compact (sequential) space. The structure of the remainder of the Stone-Cech compactification of the integers, known as N*, and continuing an important line of investigation following Shelah's breakthrough result on self-homeomorphisms, the behavior of continuous maps with that as the domain, will be investigated.

This induces an orbit equivalence  relation : for the group G we have that the orbit of a point is the set of  all gx where g is in G . This in turn cues mathematicians to the abstract  study of the orbit equivalence relation, now isolated from the original  investigation of the action.  While work of some researchers on the edge of  ergodic theory illuminates the case when G is locally compact, the branch  of logic known as model theory is intimately concerned with the orbit  equivalence relations induced by the infinite symmetric group S of all  permutations of the countable set N, equipped with the topology of  pointwise convergence.  Hjorth's project is directed towards unifying these  very diverse areas under the study of continuous actions of separable  metrizable topological groups, commonly known as Polish groups.  This class  of groups includes some familiar topological groups which fail to be  locally compact, such as:  S,  the homeomorphism group of the unit  interval,  and the group of automorphisms of Hilbert space.      The notion of a group action can be understood by the following simple  analogy. Suppose  a fleck of sand is travelling through space, and we know  its position and velocity at a given time, call it t. In principle it  should be possible to calculate the position and velocity of the same fleck  at a later time, call it t + s. In this sense we can say that the real  number s ""acts"" on the collection of all possible positions and velocities.  From any position and velocity at time t, the number s produces the  position and velocity at time t+s.  All possible states reachable from a  specified starting point is what is called an orbit. The terminology  suggests an analogy: rather than looking at the position of a planet at one  fixed time, we look instead at the collection of all positions it can  occupy throughout its year: in  other words, its orbit. Hjorth's project  considers group actions and orbits in a very general context, with  particular focus on complicated groups which arise from logical  considerations.  Certain classifications are provided these group actions  and orbits, to give an understanding of when one is more complicated than  another. This research is foundational. A central goal  is  a deepened  understanding  of the subtle nature of  many  mathematical objects, such  as orbits of points in space."

Recent work of the PI discusses versions that assert that in every collection of finite functions satisfying a certain coherence condition, some element has a very strong combinatorial property related to Ramsey theory.  He proposes to relate these examples to the fast growing numerical functions associated with the relevant large cardinal axioms.  In addition, he has discovered a family of transfer principles which establish a  new kind of formal relationship between finite set theory and transfinite set theory. In particular, he has shown that certain large cardinal axioms are equivalent to transfer principles asserting that any statement of a simple kind that is true about the functions on the natural numbers is true about the functions on the ordinals. The PI proposes to extend this work to stronger large cardinal axioms, and also to formulate and investigate related transfer principles from the hereditarily finite sets to arbitrary sets.  An independent statement is a mathematical assertion which cannot be proved true or false within the usual axioms for mathematics. The previously known independent statements have certain unsatisfactory features which make them very  atypical of normal everyday mathematical assertions. Friedman has discovered some examples which are much closer to normal mathematics in terms of both concreteness and naturality and proposes to continue the search for more concrete and natural examples. His examples also have the positive feature that the assertions can be proved using certain well studied new axioms for mathematics (so called large cardinal axioms), but not otherwise. The PI also has established an entirely new way in which these new axioms arise - they can be thought of as the natural extension of known facts in the context of the inte gers. He proposes to extend this new way of looking at these new axioms for mathematics to yet stronger new axioms for mathematics."

The set theories to be studied initially go up to and include Zermelo-Frankel set theory with the power set axiom removed but there is some likelihood that the methods will extend much farther. The notation systems lay bare a fundamental part of the structures for the corresponding set theories.   The proposed research is motivated by questions which arise naturally from Godel's incompleteness theorems. These theorems imply that no reasonable mathematical system is strong enough to provide solutions to all concrete mathematical problems, e.g., determining the existence of solutions in the natural numbers to polynomial equations or verifying the correctness of computer programs. There will always be questions whose solution will hinge on the discovery of new axioms- new axioms whose acceptance will be determined by intuition. The possible new axioms which have emerged all fall into the class of ""axioms of infinity"" which assert the existence of larger and larger nonconcrete mathematical objects. That axioms of this sort are the only new axioms amenable to our intuition seems possible, even probable. The ultimate goal of the proposed research would be to provide convincing answers to the following questions: 1. Can the notion of axiom of infinity be given a precise definition? 2. Can all meaningful concrete mathematical problems be resolved by axioms of infinity? 3. Which axioms of infinity are necessary for the solution of  meaningful concrete mathematical questions? While answers to these questions seem unlikely in the near future, especially for the first two, the successful completion of the program proposed here would be a significant step forward."

The research will focus on the constructive theory of real closed fields and on the various topological models of the reals. Particular emphasis will be placed on the complexity of the theories under investigation and on the decidable fragments of these theories including the questions of definability and axiomatizations. Results about the models help to find fragments of the language whose truth in the real number system (as defined by  Bishop) can be decided, and this fact is provable constructively, or in an  intuitionistic metatheory. Using the decidability results, the next step is to look for first order axioms for the decidable fragments of the constructive and/or intuitionistic theory of real closed ordered fields and to analyze the structure of elements and sets definable in  these  fragments. The work then would turn to the direction initiated by Scowcroft: towards the model-theoretic study of the relative strength of axiomatizations of a constructive first order theory of the reals.  Connections to recent developments about the decision procedure of S2S and to related game-theoretic approach to concurrent programming are to be  investigated, as well as the relationship between the theory of a Heyting algebra and the properties of the corresponding model for intuitionistic analysis.     In most cases computations involve real numbers. The proposal's aim is to look at the structure of reals - for instance, (maybe infinite) decimal fractions with addition and multiplication - from a constructive point of view. This means, for example, that it is not enough to show that a real number, or a function from reals to reals with particular properties exists, a method is required to find arbitrary approximations of the number or of the values of the function in question. The first step in this practical approach is to find constructive proofs that questions like ""is there a number/funct ion with such and such properties?"" can be answered. Then from the proof itself, if the answer is yes, one may obtain the method mentioned above. One way to approach this problem is by looking at various models of the constructive/intuitionistic theory of the reals, and this is the starting point of the present proposal. The results then help to find the method when there is such, and also to find the problems where in general there is no such method."

Included in the first area are investigations of the structures of sets and functions ordered by different notions of relative complexity of computation.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the complexity structures of sets which are effectively enumerable and on the most general notion of relative computability as defined by unrestricted Turing machine computations.  Computation procedures that place effective bounds on the access to oracle information or the run time of the computations will also be investigated, as well as reductions between real numbers based on the relative rates of convergence of effective approximations to the real numbers. Applications of the methods of pure computability theory will be made in the areas of computable algebra and model theory. The second area includes the study of structures representable by finite automata, decision procedures, the analysis and development of nonmonotonic logic, concurrent programming models, and applications of linear programming ideas and algorithms to data structures and logic programming. A primary focus here will be the logical and mathematical foundations of hybrid (continuous and discrete) control theory as well as the practical implementation of algorithms for these subjects based on the theoretical work being done.<br/><br/>The work proposed in the first area is directed at a better understanding of the fundamental notions of computability and relative difficulty of computation for different tasks. The theoretical work deals both with the abstract notions of computability as well as with applications to specific branches of, and questions in, other areas of mathematics. One important application (within mathematics) concerns the general question of what starting information is needed to be able to compute other aspects of many important classes of mathematical structures. In practical terms, the results at times indicate that there are no algorithms for certain important tasks or that more information than might have been expected is needed to write programs calculating the desired results. The second area deals more directly with developing the mathematical (and especially logical) tools needed for the crucial areas of program verification, data management, and automated control of real-world complex systems. Commercial applications are expected for some of this work and there has already been a spin off to a start-up company developing several applications including data compression and network management algorithms.<br/>"

In the second area, of cotorsion theories, the investigators intend to establish and apply the interplay with the Ziegler spectrum in order to describe the flat cover and the realm of cotorsion modules that are not pure-injective. The third part is about calculation of Ziegler spectra of string algebras as a contribution to representation-theoretic classification and to decidability theory and about the related issue of super-decomposable pure-injectives. As a fourth, more general model-theoretic topic of study, the investigators propose to apply classical model-theoretic constructions to pairs of structures endowed with an epimorphism in order to obtain existence results in `dual' or `projective' model theory (dual in the sense that monomorphisms are replaced by epimorphisms). <br/><br/><br/><br/>The model-theoretic study of mathematical structures is unique in that one restricts to a certain formal language, similar to a computer language. The loss of richness of expression allows for a gain on the side of the structures under investigation: more structures come into play, because the language cannot distinguish between them. (To persue the analogy with computers: a computer may not be able to distinguish between an infinite object and a large finite chunk of it.) The advantage of this approach is that one discovers new structures (models of the formal statements describing the initial structure) that may be very similar to the original structure at hand when the statements mentioned are chosen as to force them to be. It has found striking applications in various parts of mathematics over the last decades. <br/>"

Many results of so-called classical mathematics are very general: They apply to a wide range of input, so to speak, and thus tend to produce a wide range of output. But one could hope that if the input is particularly well behaved in some respect, then the output would be similarly well behaved. This turns out to be true in many important cases, but usually requires new, more constructive, proofs of classical results, as well as a deeper understanding of which inputs should be regarded as well behaved. The theory of o-minimal structures on the real field, a sub-discipline of mathematical logic, has been developed in large part to deal with this issue. This has been a rapidly developing area for the last two and a half decades, with many contributions from, and cooperation between, researchers from several branches of mathematics and logic, in particular, model theory and real analytic geometry. Applications have been found in areas as diverse as theoretical economics, neural-net learning theory, and hybrid control systems, as well as in pure mathematics.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the project arises primarily as follows. It is an important goal of the program to introduce or elaborate the main themes of the program to U.S. mathematicians, and mathematicians in training, as the combination of o-minimality and real-analytic geometry is not currently widely practiced in the U.S. The direct impact of NSF funding will be the training and advancement of research of a significant number of U.S. researchers---especially junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students---who will gain the opportunity to participate in the program.<br/><br/>"

One line of work concerns settling some further<br/>cases. Another line of work concerns a more fundamental question. Can this<br/>phenomenon can be mitigated by working relative to some reasonable extension<br/>of ZFC, for example, one that is consistent with all large cardinal axioms.<br/>The logically most simple case of incompleteness of the third kind lies<br/>(necessarily) just beyond the scope of Woodin's celebrated generic<br/>absoluteness theorem: Assume CH. Consider Sigma-2-1 sentences of analysis<br/>with sets of reals as parameters. In general the set of such sentences that<br/>are satisfiable in some outer model having the same reals is not first-order<br/>definable. Does there exist an extension of ZFC that is consistent with all<br/>large cardinal axioms and relative to which this set is (lightface) Delta-2-2<br/>definable? Finally, the PI is interested in several questions regarding class<br/>forcing.<br/><br/>The proposed work centers on incompleteness of a ""third kind"" in set theory.<br/>Incompleteness in set theory is important because all mathematics can be<br/>formalized in set theory. Propositions that are neither provable nor<br/>refutable from the axioms of set theory cannot be settled<br/>mathematically, at least in our current understanding. Goedel's famous<br/>Incompleteness Theorems show that such propositions exist. Sentences<br/>demonstrating this first kind of incompleteness formalize metamathematical<br/>statements. For example, the formalization of ""ZFC is consistent"" is neither<br/>provable nor refutable from the axioms of set theory (ZFC), provided those<br/>axioms are, in fact, consistent. Even though ""ZFC is consistent"" is not<br/>provable from ZFC, there is an obvious reason to favor it over its<br/>negation---studying mathematics within ZFC presupposes that ZFC is consistent.<br/>Incompleteness results proved using Cohen's method of (set) forcing represent<br/>a second kind of incompleteness. Typically, given a ""standard"" model of ZFC,<br/>one constructs an outer model in which a given statement is true and one in<br/>which it is false. In the case of this<br/>second kind of incompleteness, there is often no reason to favor a statement<br/>or its negation. Deep work by Woodin, Steel, Martin, Foreman,<br/>and a number of others has suggested reasons to favor certain statements up<br/>through a certain level of logical complexity. Just beyond this level of<br/>logical complexity lies incompleteness of a third kind. Here it is not<br/>possible even to say which statements are satisfiable in some outer model.<br/>""Characterization problems"" are the combinatorial form of this phenomenon.<br/>Past work of the PI has highlighted that, in general, it is not<br/>possible to characterize in set theory the ""satiable objects"" of certain<br/>sorts. Precise statements are technical, but an analogy gives the general<br/>idea. In this analogy, the ""objects"" correspond to equations. An object is<br/>""sated"" if the corresponding equation is solvable. An object is ""satiable"" if<br/>the corresponding equation is potentially solvable, that is, either solvable<br/>or solvable in some larger number system. In elementary mathematics, there is<br/>no reason to distinguish solvable and potentially solvable equations because<br/>typically there exist maximal number systems in which every potentially<br/>solvable equation of a particular sort is actually solvable. Such ""maximal<br/>standard models"" do not exist in set theory. The analog of an<br/>anticharacterization result in set theory would be a type of equation for<br/>which there cannot be a good criterion for potential solvability.<br/>Anticharacterization is troubling for two reasons. First, in mathematics one<br/>expects that anything that is true is true for a good reason---so there ought<br/>to be a criterion for insatiability. Secondly, in their strongest form, these<br/>anticharacterization results hold only if the universe fails to be<br/>""sufficiently non-minimal"". To some extent this threatens the well established<br/>thesis that all of mathematics is formalizable in first-order set theory,<br/>because non-minimality cannot be expressed in this language. The PI<br/>seeks to explore three aspects of anticharacterization. First, he seeks to<br/>determine whether some specific cases of characterization problems are<br/>solvable. Secondly, he seeks to discover whether adding auxiliary axioms to<br/>the usual axioms of set theory might allow satiable objects to be<br/>characterized. This could be construed as evidence in favor of these axioms.<br/>Finally, he seeks to continue work on abstract class forcing with an eye<br/>towards understanding general outer models, at least in the presence of<br/>conditions that render models highly non-minimal."

Set theory contains classical mathematics in the sense that every theorem of classical mathematics can be formulated as a statement about sets, and then formally derived from the standard collection ZFC of axioms for set theory. Beginning with the work of Godel (1936) and Cohen (1963), set theorists have shown that some problems on which mathematicians have worked are independent, i.e. neither provable nor disprovable from ZFC. Some of these independent statements are nevertheless known to be provable when ZFC is augmented by axioms asserting the existence of large infinite cardinal numbers. The instant project has three parts: first, to continue the study of a class of very large cardinals; second, to continue the study of the relation of these cardinals to problems in groups and finite combinatorics; and third, to study some unrelated open questions in forcing and infinite combinatorics. The main subject of this project is connected both to set theory and to algebra and topology. On the algebra/topology side, one of the topics to be studied is the classical braid groups, which arise in many contexts, including statistical mechanics (see for instance Kauffman, New invariants in the theory of knots, AMS Monthly, March 1988, 195-241). The connection of this area with the algebras studied in this project has led to new results about the braid groups. Moreover, results on the set theory side of the project have opened the question whether some properties of knots and braids will require the large cardinal tools of set theory for their solution."

In recent years, methods developed in the context of stability theory have been used to analyze structures such as pseudo-finite fields, pseudo-algebraically closed fields, difference fields, and quadratic forms over finite fields. This research has yielded applications to arithmetic number theory (due largely to Hrushovski). Model-theorists now have a good understanding of how these dependence relations fit in a general framework. Buechler proposes to generalize techniques from the geometrical stability theory of superstable theories to this broader class. This research is likely to give insight into the model-theoretic properties of bilinear forms and groups definable in structures such as those mentioned above. Buechler also intends to set a more general framework for arguments based on ranks and dependence relations. Much of mathematics involves the classification of an abstract collection of objects in terms of concrete, well-understood objects. The classification of finite simple groups is one instance of this principle. Model theorists study classification results in an abstract setting, addressing questions such as: When can we prove that a classification theorem exists, even when the particular theorem is unknown? How can we tell when a particular classification theorem is the best possible result for a given collection of objects? When are two classification theorems special cases of a more general result? In the past twenty years model theorists have gone a long way towards answering these questions for collections of objects axiomatized in a relatively simple manner. While this research is carried out in abstract setting, it has spawned concrete results in differential algebra and arithmetic number theory. Buechler proposes to expand the mathematical context in which these results apply. He will also find a more abstract notion of classification theorem which encompasses several existing examples. This may lead to a greater understanding of results related to Fermat's Last Theorem."

The investigator intends to work on three topics in applied descriptive set theory, that is, on some connections which exist between descriptive set theory and some other parts of mathematics, specifically (1) classification of pointsets in the projective hierarchy, (2) descriptive set theory and finer topologies, (3) descriptive set theory and Polish group actions. All three topics are related to analysis and topology. The third topic is also related to other parts of mathematical logic, such as Vaught's Conjecture and the theory of definable cardinality. Some of the problems in the project will be considered under the assumption of strong set theoretic axioms such as the axiom of determinacy. Considering that the real numbers can be thought of as the ordinary number line of grade school arithmetic, it is surprising how much structure can be imposed upon them and how intricate the questions that can be asked about this structure. Descriptive set theory is the theory that addresses these questions with all the machinery of modern mathematical logic. For example, a standard construct of this theory is the Borel hierarchy of sets, consisting of two infinite sequences of families of sets, the Pi sets and the Sigma sets, defined inductively, and hence of increasing complexity. One of the obvious applications of the theory is to locate precisely in this hierarchy a particular set which arises in analysis, say the set of points at which a function is differentiable. In fact, it is a typical and classical theorem of descriptive set theory (due to Mazurkiewicz) that any such set of differentiability belongs to the family Pi-one-one in the Borel hierarchy. The investigator is focussed on questions such as these, which make logic relevant to the wider world of mathematics."

There are now several such methods: the method of ""workers"", developed by Harrington, two versions of ""alpha-systems"", both developed by Ash, and a method of Lemmp and Lerman. The method of workers and the original alpha-systems have each yielded quite a number of results in recursive model theory. Knight has a metatheorem for workers, similar to the one Ash proved for his original alpha-systems, except that not so much is assumed to be r.e., and the conditions are more complicated. Knight hopes both to simplify and to improve the metatheorem for workers. In Knight's metatheorem, as in Ash's original metatheorem, the object produced on the bottom is recursive. Ash's new alpha-systems (simpler than the old), and the method of Lemmp and Lerman, are designed to produce an r.e. object on the bottom. There are many problems in recursive model theory (existence of recursive presentations of groups, etc.), as well as in recursion theory, on which these new methods ought to yield results. Recursion theory as a topic in the foundations of mathematics is motivated by a desire to formalize the property of being computable by an algorithm. The algorithm need not be a practical one, but it must exist and terminate in principal after some finite number of steps."

The principal investigator aims to prove an analogous result for the Kochen representation of an integral-definite rational function. This requires finding an appropriate p-adic analogue to the real notion of a pre-ordering. By studying the universal theory of p-adic fields, the principal investigator and her collaborator Luc Belair think that a successful definition of ""pre-valuation"" can be found. A further goal is to study the ""fine"" p-adic spectrum, in which the structure of the sets of nth powers is added. The second project is also related to the structure of nth power sets in a p-adic field. The principal investigator and her collaborator D. Macpherson have recently defined the notion of ""P-minimality"" and have shown that a field with this property must be p-adically closed. Important further questions are to show that expansions of p-adically closed fields by analytic functions are P-minimal, and to study the differentiability of definable functions in P-minimal structures. Model theory is concerned with the study of mathematical objects which are defined by axioms. Model-theoretic algebra applies the theory to particular algebraic objects, in this case to p-adic fields. P-adic fields are number systems in which a notion of distance exists, in a way similar to that for the real number system, but in which the prime integer p plays a special role. The first problem in this research concerns a representation of certain functions of p-adic fields which reveals some of their essential properties; the question is whether this representation varies in a predictable way. The second problem, also at the heart of understanding the nature of the p-adics, asks whether the geometry of sets definable in the p-adics in first order logic has important features in com mon with the corresponding sets of real numbers. ***"

Such questions are within the scope of this project. The major tool of proof in recursion theory is the priority argument. A general framework for priority arguments at all levels is being sought, in the hope that a better understanding of priority arguments will assist in finding applications of this powerful combinatorial technique to real world problems.

One group of combinatorial problems concerns characterizing which stationary sets can contain closed unbounded subsets in cardinal and GCH preserving outer models. Every stationary subset of aleph-one has this property. Previous work has shown that in general there is no such first-order characterization for subsets of aleph-two. On the other hand, for a restricted class of subsets of the successor of aleph-omega, such a characterization is possible. Some interesting cases remain open. Similar characterization questions can be asked regarding partitions and trees. Another area for continued work is the study of outer models and class forcing. Notwithstanding some technical qualifications, essentially only one method is known for constructing outer models, namely, Cohen's forcing method. Work to this point has shown that this is not an accident: Granted a technical assumption, every outer model is a class forcing extension, in one sense of the notion. An open problem is to characterize outer models that are class forcing extensions in a certain stronger sense. One point of this work is reducing certain set theoretical questions to more concrete combinatorial questions. All mathematical statements can be translated into statements about sets. If a given statement is mathematically provable, then the corresponding statement about sets is derivable from the axioms of set theory. Thus statements whose translations are neither provable nor refutable from the axioms of set theory are themselves neither provable nor refutable mathematically. Such statements are said to be ""independent"". In some cases, a given mathematical object may have a certain property for provable reasons; in others, for independent reasons. One subject of this research is, for a certain class of objects, to determine whether it is possible to characterize those objects which have certain properties for pr ovable reasons. Surprisingly, it can be shown that in some cases this is not possible---which objects have the specified property depends on global features of the entire universe of sets. Another subject of this research is class forcing. Essentially, only one method is known for proving that statements are independent, namely, Cohen's forcing method. Recent work has shown that there is a good reason for this. In many cases, any independence result that can be obtained can be obtained by class forcing, in one sense of the term. However, this sort of class forcing is combinatorially far removed from the sort that is typically used to establish independence results. It is a goal to close this gap (or to explore why it is not possible to close it). A hope is that this will provide a means of reducing certain problems to tractable questions regarding forcing."

Becker's reqearch concerns the actions of Polish groups, in connection with -- or from the point of view of -- descriptive set theory. The basic classes of definable sets are the classes of Borel, analytic and coanalytic sets. These constitute the main topic of the project, although other classes of definable sets are also considered. A major theme of the project is discovery of dichotomies of the orbit space, i.e. theorems stating that either the orbit space is ""small"" or else it contains a copy of some specific ""large"" set. The Vaught Conjecture, a famous open problem in logic concerning the number of countable models of a first order theory, asserts such a dichotomy (either this number is countable or of size the continuum). Much of the project is related to that conjecture. Becker's project employs the standard methods of descriptive set theory together with one new method, whereby the underlying topology is changed.

In other words, there is a desire to determine whether oracles with different information content look different algebraically, or- if not- whether this inability to differentiate between two oracles is reflected in the algebraic structure in some more subtle way. The main tool for the study of the algebraic model of information content is the ""priority method"". Lerman is a co-developer of a framework which allows one to apply this technique in very general situations. The technique has not only been applied to study structural questions about information content, but has found applications to other areas of mathematical logic and computer science. Modern computing is interactive; programs pause frequently to ask for input from an oracle (the user) before continuing. Thus the true universal model for computing is one in which an oracle is appended to the computer. This project concerns the analysis of situations in which one oracle has the knowledge to predict how other specified oracles will act. Lerman is a co-developer of a framework which is used to analyze such programs, and is currently refining this framework to more easily determine whether such programs can be combined without producing conflicts.

More generally a structure theory aims to describe how each member of the class is built from smaller objects in the same class, or even from simpler objects belonging to a second, well understood class. Shelah has isolated certain properties of a countable, complete first order theory which are necessary and sufficient for the class models of T to admit a structure theory. One key property is that of being superstable, a guarantee that certain subsets of the models of T can be viewed as pregeometries, and thus carry the desired dimensions. Investigating the precise nature of the aforementioned pregeometries, and the way in which they interact, can yield very deep information about the fine structure of the models; such investigation has become known as geometric stability theory. Chowdhuiy will apply the methods of geometric stability theory to gain further information about superstable theories. In particular, his work is aimed at extending Shelah's classification results to uncountable theories. This should result in new structural information regarding the models of superstable theories, countable or not. In addition, Chowdhury plans to examine which properties of superstable theories can be generalised to a broader class, called supersimple theories. Supersimple theories, though not necessarily stable, exhibit some of the important characteristics of superstable theories. In model theory one studies those mathematical objects (called 'models"") which satisfy a given collection of axioms. While one may think of a group as the set of transformations , or symmetries, of a particular object - such as an organic molecule, the general class of objects known as groups are precisely the models of the three group axioms. In algebra, one attempts to understand complicated objects (e.g., groups) in terms of how they are built from well-understood objects; when this succeeds, this is called a ""structure theory"". In model theory, one considers a general set of axioms and the collection of models, and asks whether there are properties inherent in the set of axioms which guarantee the existence of a structure theory. Rather remarkably, it turns out that certain abstract properties of a set of axioms do indeed imply certain structural features for the corresponding objects; one such property is called ""superstability"". The principal investigator proposes to continue the study of superstability (and its variations) and of its structural implications for a broader array of objects, one which includes interesting and important mathematical classes."

Set theory may be viewed as containing mathematics, that is, every theorem of classical mathematics may be formulated as a statement about sets, and then formally derived from the standard collection ZFC of axioms for set theory. Beginning with the work of Godel (1936) and Cohen (1963), set theorists have shown that certain problems, on which mathematicians have worked, are independent, i.e. neither provable nor disprovable from ZFC. The first and most well known example of this is the Godel-Cohen result that Cantor's continuum hypothesis is independent. Some statements, independent of ZFC, are nevertheless known to be provable when ZFC is augmented by axioms asserting the existence of large infinite cardinal numbers. This project has two parts: firstly, to continue the study of a class of very large cardinals, and secondly, to study the consistency and independence of von Neumann's conjecture and a collection of related problems. Such studies deepen our understanding of the limits of mathematical proof."

In recent years several general model-theoretic problems have been systematically approached via the stability-theoretic hierarchy. Even though a problem itself may not involve stability-theoretic notions, considering separately the cases: totally transcendental, superstable, etc., brings into play a mass of technical machinery. Such is the case for Vaught's conjecture, which was proved by Shelah for totally transcendental theories and (over the past 5 years) by Buechler for the superstable theories of finite rank. Buechler intends to continue using the methods of geometrical stability theory to gain insight into Vaught's conjecture for all superstable theories. The geometrical methods bring modules into the picture, allowing for the use of representation theory and other algebra to pin down further the models of these theories. This research lies in the general setting of abstract ""Classification Theory."" In many diverse branches of mathematics researchers attempt to code each element of a class of structures with an element of a ""simpler"" class of structures. The original class is then more easily analyzed, using the more detailed information that one can obtain for this simpler class. Classification Theory is the abstract study of such codings. Researchers have shown that it is possible to determine when such a simplification exists by using only rather basic information about the original class. Buechler intends to study when an abstract class can be simplified down to a very precise class of objects called ""modules,"" which have been studied in great detail by algebraists."

On the other hand, it is asked whether a differential field which supports a model-theoretic dimension theory must be differentially closed (namely contain solutions to all algebraic differential equations over the field). Other components of the project involve (1) more traditional questions in model theory such as determining the number of models of complete theories, and (2) studying groups definable in O-minimal theories, which amounts to trying to develop a reasonable theory of Lie groups over arbitrary real closed fields. The understanding of collections of symmetries (also called groups) is an important part of mathematics and of its applications. Pillay's project concerns symmetries arising from various situations: differential equations, algebraic equations, and more abstract contexts.

He also wants to learn whether first-order real algebra in Dana Scott's model for intuitionistic analysis is recursively undecidable. Scowcroft's new model for intuitionistic analysis may permit him to develop a new model for first-order real algebra, and recent work on subanalytic sets may allow him to extend his effective test for constructive truth to propositions involving certain transcendental functions. In the model-theory of p-adic fields, Scowcroft plans to study the properties of definable equivalence relations, the differences in expressive power between the first-order languages commonly used to describe a p-adic field, and the efficiency of quantifier-elimination procedures for Macintyre's first-order theory of the p-adics.

Namely, a game theoretic version of the conjecture has been proved under that assumption. It will be investigated whether these techniques can be applied to prove the entire conjecture. Also, the necessity of the measurable will be studied. In other work involving large cardinals, it has been proved that a very large cardinal assumption implies a combinatorial statement about a tower of finite left distributive algebras (algebras satisfying the law a(bc) = (ab)(ac)). It will be studied whether the large cardinals are needed. Also the possibility of implications of the combinatorial result for the classical braid groups will be investigated. This research links large cardinal theory with some classical mathematics. A ""cardinal"" is the mathematical notion of size as it applies to finite and infinite sets. A ""large cardinal"" is an extremely large such size, with additional technical features. It is known that large cardinals are so large that their existence can't be proved by the usual methods of proof. This makes it very surprising that large cardinals have implications for the finite world, but they do. Indeed, there are mathematical assertions about finite structures which, surprisingly, need a large cardinal for their proof. Recently some finite statements which are in the vein of classical mathematics have been proved using large cardinals. One of the statements is related to the ""braid groups"" (a subject which as been studied by mathematicians, with very intensive investigations since the mid-1980's upon discovery of its connections with physics). The research in this project is twofold: to determine if the large cardinal is necessary, and to pursue the fascinating possibility of implications of large cardinal theory for the braid groups and beyond."

The seminar is of great value not only to the participating faculty, but to their graduate students."

The first goal is to develop a O(n) -priority argument for all n: Lerman will try to do so in the context of deciding the existential theory of the recursively enumerable degrees with Steffen Lempp. He will then try, with Lempp and Kucera, to find a priority-free proof of this theory. The second goal will be pursued by studying automorphisms of sets of degrees, primarily the recursively enumerable degrees.

Since then many mathematicians have applied this notion to algebraic structures and obtained an analogue of ""finite dimensional algebras."" Given a structure M of finite Morley rank, one associates to each definable subset of n-tuples from M, two integers, called the rank and degree of the subset. These definable subsets and their associated integers satisfy some number of axioms which may be thought of as an ""abstract dimension theory."" Making an analogy with algebraic geometry: definable subsets correspond to constructible subsets; the rank corresponds to the dimension; the degree corresponds to the number of irreducible components (if the given set is closed). If M is an algebraically closed field, the above correspondences become equalities. From these correspondences one may guess that groups of finite Morley rank must look like geometrical groups, but Macintyre's result, that infinite fields of Morley rank are algebraically closed, reduces the possibilities. Cherlin's conjecture: An infinite simple group G of finite Morley rank is an algebraic group over some algebraically closed field, and the set G, its multiplication, and its inverse function are defined by polynomials. On the other hand, Pillay and Steinhorn defined the concept of o-minimal structures, and Pillay began studying groups G defined in an o-minimal structure M. This new class of groups includes many real Lie groups (e.g. algebraic ones). They behave like groups of finite Morley rank: one has a notion of dimension and connectedness. The principal investigator of this project, Huseyin Ali Nesin, intends to work on these two classes of groups for at least the next two years. Many problems remain to be solved before their relation to the classical groups is fully understood."
