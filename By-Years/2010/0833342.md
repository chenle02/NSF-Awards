The University of Houston is awarding twelve $10,000 scholarships each year to
STEM majors and professionals seeking secondary teacher certification in Science
and Mathematics, resulting in 60 new teachers for Houston area school districts.
Undergraduate Noyce Scholars are enrolled in the teachHouston program while mid-
career STEM professionals receiving Noyce stipends are enrolled in the ten-month
Transition to Teaching certification program. A rigorous and innovative process
is used to select scholars who demonstrate a passion for teaching, possess
sufficient content knowledge and skill, and represent the diversity of
University of Houston campus and the city of Houston. The objective is to
recruit, prepare, and retain individuals with in depth STEM content knowledge as
STEM teachers in underserved areas. By combining the evaluation of the Noyce
candidates with the larger base provided by their teachHOUSTON and Transition to
Teaching (TtT) cohorts, this program utilizes a mixed methods evaluation
approach including both qualitative and sophisticated statistical
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholarships awarded through this project
have the potential to benefit as many as 23 school districts in the Houston area
as participants are assigned their field experiences in high need school
districts. The project is providing additional opportunities for University of
Houston researchers to design and evaluate instructional strategies for use in
maintaining qualified teachers in STEM disciplines, conduct research on the
effectiveness of these strategies, and disseminate research-based instructional
products and findings to a national audience of educators, school
administrators, service centers, business partners and political leaders. The
instructional strategies allow STEM teachers to conduct research on the
effectiveness of the instructional strategies that will be used for all levels
of learners in urban, suburban, and rural schools.
