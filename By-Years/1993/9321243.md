9321243 Hellberg Closely related species of marine invertebrates commonly occur
together and often spawn simultaneously, yet hybrids between these species
rarely form. Proteins on the surface of the gametes control species-specific
fertilization. Three lines of evidence suggest that changes in these gamete
recognition proteins may be involved in the evolution of reproductive isolation:
1) non-fertile heterospecific crosses usually result from the failure of sperm
to attach to heterospecific eggs, 2) closely related, reproductively isolated
species often show little overall genetic divergence, and 3) selection promotes
the divergence of sperm-borne gamete recognition proteins found in different
species of abalone. This project will examine two critical questions which
remain unanswered: 1) Are interspecific differences in gamete recognition
proteins greatest in geographical areas of species overlap, and 2) How variable
are gamete recognition proteins within species? These two questions will be
addresses by documenting nucleotide sequence variation of the sperm borne gamete
recognition protein bindin from both co-occurring and isolated populations of
Pacific sand dollars. The project will focus on members of the genus Dendraster,
whose geographical distribution (both overlapping and non- overlapping regions)
and very recent origins (1 May) should facilitate discrimination between
alternative evolutionary mechanisms driving bindin divergence. Finally, the
functional significance of both inter-and intraspecific variation in bindin will
be examined using pairwise fertilization assays. This research project should
produce novel insights into the role of the potential for interspecific
hybridization in promoting the divergence of gamete recognition proteins. ***
