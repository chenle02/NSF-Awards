A systematic computational study of elastic, inelastic and ionization processes
involving the impact of electrons and photons with atoms will be undertaken
using accurate and reliable computational techniques such as the R-matrix plus
pseudostates. The research is of great importance for the fundamental
understanding of the collisions dynamics in these problems as well as fulfilling
an urgent need for accurate atomic data in modeling stars, plasmas, lasers and
planetary atmospheres.
