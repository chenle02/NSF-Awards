The main goals of the project are to improve the quality of geometry
instruction in secondary schools by developing inservice leaders throughout the
state of Iowa. There are to be intensive summer workshops offered for 68
prospective leaders during the summers 1988 and 1989. Some of the topics to be
emphasized in these courses deal with geometric transformations and vector
analytic geometry applied to computer graphics. The workshops also deal with
didactical issues such as new directions in the geometry curriculum and methods
of presentation of the new topics. Three or four master teachers are to be
chosen to contribute to the instructional staff by demonstrating modern methods
and materials. They are to serve as associates in the workshops. Mathematics
supervisors from the State Department of Education and the regional education
agencies in the state are to assist the project by helping to select the leaders
as well as providing assistance in planning and implementing the inservice
network that is to develop as a product of the project.
