This NYI award will support the research of a promising and accomplished young
investigator. His research will include a program of experimental quantum optics
and precision measurement with laser-cooled atoms. Zero-point confinement of
neutral atoms will be demonstrated, and the coherence of spontaneous emission
investigated. A new technique for mass and g-factor measurements will also be
explored.
