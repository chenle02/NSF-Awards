9351094 Krause The project will purchase a polarizing microscope with hot stage
and camera, a gel permeation chromatograph with appropriate software and
computer, and a differential scanning calorimeter with controlled cooling,
subambient capability, and appropriate software. The equipment will be used for
a Polymer laboratory course and will allow polymer chemistry experiments to also
be integrated into other upper division laboratory courses. The later
improvements will ensure that students who, in general, do not take the Polymer
Laboratory course will be exposed to this very important part of modern
chemistry. These instruments will also be used in the very successful summer
course in Polymer Chemistry for Chemistry Faculty in Undergraduate Colleges.
