The NRCs Board on Science Education requests co-funding from NSF (other funders
are The College Board and Burroughs Wellcome Fund) to convene an expert meeting
that will be a first step toward creating a systems-level evaluation and
implementation plan for the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).
Specifically, through short commissioned papers and a day-long meeting, a
roadmap for implemention of the NGSS that identifies barriers and opportunities
will be developed. It is anticipated that this will provide the backdrop for a
more extensive NRC Roundtable activity.
