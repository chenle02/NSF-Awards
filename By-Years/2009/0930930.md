CPS Small: Control of Surgical Robots: Network Layer to Tissue Contact

Research Objectives: This proposed CPS project aims to enable intelligent
telesurgery in which a surgeon, or a distributed team of surgeons, can work on
tiny regions in the body with minimal access. The University of Washington will
expand an existing open surgical robot testbed, and create a robust
infrastructure for cyber-physical systems with which to extend traditional real-
time control and teleoperation concepts by adding three new interfaces to the
system: networking, intelligent robotics, and novel non-linear controllers.

Intellectual Merit: This project aims to break new ground beyond teleoperation
by adding advanced robotic functions. Equally robust and flexible networking,
high-level interfaces, and novel controllers will be added to the existing
sytsem. The resulting system will be an open architecture and a substrate upon
which many cyber-physical system ideas and algorithms will be tested under
realistic conditions. The platforms proven physical robustness will permit
rigorous evaluation of results and the open interfaces will encourage
collaboration and sharing of results.

Broader Impacts: We expect the results to enable new research in multiple ways.
First, the collaborators such as Johns Hopkins, U.C. Santa Cruz, and several
foreign institutions will be able to remotely connect to new high level
interfaces provided by this project. Second, for the first time a robust and
completely open surgical telerobot will be available for research so that CPS
researchers do not need to be limited to isolated toy problems but instead be
able to prototype advanced surgical robotics techniques and evaluate them in
realistic contexts including animal procedures.
