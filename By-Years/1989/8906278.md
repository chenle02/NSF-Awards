Long-term Research: Cyclizations via the Palladium Catalyzed Tandem Ene-Olefin
Insertion Reactions. This award recommendation is made under the Program for
Long and Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence. The program is
designed to enable young U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term
research abroad at research institutions of proven excellence. Awards provide
opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or
complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign
countries. The award will support a 15-month research visit by Dr. Robert
DeVita, University of Rochester, with Prof. Wolfgang Oppulzer, University of
Geneva, Switzerland. The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as
appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents
allowance, if applicable, and a flat administrative allowance of $250.00 for the
