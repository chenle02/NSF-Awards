The International Conference of the Learning Sciences (ICLS) is a bi-annual
conference sponsored by the International Society of the Learning Sciences that
will next take place June 28 to July 2, 2010 in Chicago with the theme "Learning
in the Disciplines." This award provides support for two day and one-half pre-
conference workshops: a Doctoral Consortium hosting 15 PhD students at the
dissertation stage and an Early Career Workshop for 20 young researchers in the
field. The primary purpose is to enhance the capacity of researchers in the
young Learning Sciences field to conduct interdisicplinary work.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will interact prior to the conference through
workshop web portals so they can become familiar with one another's work and
help organizers identify possible thematic groups for presentation and
discussion. Participants will present their research and receive feedback from
peers and faculty mentors, discuss issues surrounding the establishment of
research programs, career planning, and professional
networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop effectiveness will be evaluated
through two surveys. One will be conducted at the conclusion of the workshops
and the other one near the end of the subsequent academic term.
