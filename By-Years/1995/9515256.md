The major part of this research is concerned with the further development and
use of the Diaz-Gimenez, Prescott, et al applied general-equilibrium framework
to evaluate monetary and fiscal policy rules. The thesis underlying this
research program is that the standard assumption that financial markets are
costless to operate is not a reasonable one when it comes to evaluating monetary
and fiscal stabilization policies. In the framework being developed, young
households borrow to finance houses and businesses. The old, who have saved for
their retirement, lend to the intermediaries. Borrowing and lending rates differ
by a large amount as in fact on average they do. Preliminary results are that
the effects of public consumption shocks are much larger in such worlds than in
the standard real business cycle model. Another dimension where the behavior of
this model differs from that of the standard real business cycle model with
money introduced via the cash-credit good constraint is that there can be large
and highly persistent deviations from the empirical demand for money
relationship. The other part of the research proposal is to determine whether
corporate takeovers, or some takeover like arrangement, are necessary for
economic efficiency.
