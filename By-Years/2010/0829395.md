The University of Florida is awarded a grant to carry out strategic planning for
the Ordway Swisher Biological Station (OSBS), a 3,700 ha field research station
in Putnam County, north-central Florida, approximately 50 km east of the
University of Florida. OSBS is primarily comprised of the Katharine Ordway
Preserve (2,468 ha) and the Swisher Memorial Sanctuary (1,214 ha). The
activities supported by this award will lead to the development of: 1) a
strategy to enhance the quality of the teaching and research programs at OSBS,
2) a site plan for future educational and research infrastructure at OSBS, 3) a
strategy to increase use of the site by under-represented groups and minorities,
4) an outreach strategy to create a conduit for information generated at OSBS to
be used by K-12 programs and the public, and to increase involvement of citizen
science programs, community colleges, and K-12 programs, 5) a strategy to
enhance linkages between OSBS and other key field stations and institutions, 6)
a strategy for optimizing linkages between OSBS and NEON, and 7) an economic
development strategy to generate additional resources.
