This project will investigate and quantify the importance of nocturnal
atmospheric dynamics and chemistry in an urban environment, with emphasis on the
chemistry of reactive oxidized oxides of nitrogen, oxidizing radicals and
heterogeneous reaction processes. During two field studies differential optical
absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) along with ancillary measurements provided by in
situ instruments (including an aerosol mass spectrometer), GPS radiosondes, and
a light detection and ranging (lidar) will be used to characterize nighttime
chemistry and mixing. One- and three-dimensional modeling experiments will place
those observations in a policy-relevant context by defining the role of
nocturnal vertical mixing processes in controlling chemical reactions and air
quality in urban areas. The broader science impact of this research will be an
improved understanding of nighttime chemical reactions and mixing processes so
that they can be emulated in a more representative fashion within urban and
regional air quality models. Such improvements will lead to more effective
control strategies and informed policy decisions in the future. In addition to
direct mentoring of graduate and undergraduate student research the P.I. will
integrate his research into a number of education and community outreach
initiatives. Support is requested for one graduate student and this project will
contribute substantially to their professional training.
