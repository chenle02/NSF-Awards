PhysPort (http://physport.org) is a leading online professional development tool
that supports physics faculty in implementing research-based teaching and
assessment in their classrooms through expert recommendations about teaching,
assessment, and results from physics education research. Physics education
researchers have produced a variety of tools that vastly improve student
learning of physics, and that have been adopted and adapted for other STEM
fields. However, even educators who are aware of education research and highly
motivated to improve their teaching have trouble getting necessary support to
implement research-based teaching effectively. This project will study the
impact of this tool for physics faculty teaching practice, conduct research to
increase the tool's effectiveness, and advance understanding of how online
resources can support faculty teaching practices across STEM disciplines.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are to measure the impact of
PhysPort on faculty teaching practice through multiple methods, including web
analytics, website feedback, usability testing, and interviews about teaching
practice. These measurements will determine whether the site is achieving its
goals and how it can be improved to reach its full potential. Additionally, they
provide information on how faculty use online professional development tools in
general, which can be applied to the development of similar tools for all STEM
disciplines. This project couples phenomenographic analyses of faculty
perceptions of PhysPort's impact with quantitative analysis of their usage of
the site. Interviews with faculty who are planning to or have recently changed
their teaching practice will use the transtheoretical model to track faculty
attitudes and behaviors through the change process. The results of this research
will be used to implement changes to PhysPort's resources and disseminated to
other researchers in faculty change.
