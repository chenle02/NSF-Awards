This project involves the use of surgery theory to study symmetries of
manifolds, with emphasis on finite groups of symmetries of the sphere. The
project includes three parts. The first part is the interaction of the
fundamental group and the homology of a manifold. The goal is to have a good
understanding of the topology of a manifold with finite fundamental group,
concentrating on the cases where the universal cover is particularly simple. The
methods are surgery theory, representation theory, and quadratic forms. A second
part of the project is the study of group actions on spheres. For example there
are well-known actions on 3- dimensional algebraic varieties, and the connection
of these actions with high dimensional surgery theory could lead to an
interesting synthesis. The third part of the project is algebraic considerations
in L-theory and Galois cohomology. The interaction between algebra and topology
has been quite fruitful in the past.
