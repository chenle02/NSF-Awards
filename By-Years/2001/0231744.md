This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project, will develop a liquid
lens for nanomachining materials with pulsed laser beams. The project team will
design and fabricate a liquid lens capable of producing laser beam spot sizes on
the order of nanometers (20-100 nm) through its nonlinear effects, including
self-focusing, self-trapping, and harmonic generation obtained through intense
laser beam propagation in liquid. The end product will be a fiber optic cable
assembly in which the nonlinear optical liquid will be filled in hollow glass
waveguides with a core diameter of one millimeter and the end faces will be
fastened with two standard SMA 905 connectors. Upon interfacing with a high
energy, Q-switched Nd: YAG laser, this unique liquid lens will facilitate
obtaining various nanometer spot sizes and wavelengths by simply changing the
liquid medium. The project team will demonstrate the feasibility of a liquid
lens for nanomachining of medical devices such as catheters in a vibration-
isolation work environment.

Commercially, the proposed liquid lens and nanomachining are intended to fill
the miniaturization needs of high-technology industries. Possible commercial
applications include medical devices (pacemakers, implants,stents,catheters),
electronic and photonic devices, magnetic disks, instrumentation,
telecommunication devices, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The liquid
lens will offer new capabilities for modern laser systems, flexible processing
with single wavelength laser, and ultra-precision machining.
