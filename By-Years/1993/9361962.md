9361962 Savage To meet existing and future casting manufacturing needs, the
development of an automated rapid metrology (ARM) capability for investment
casting layout is needed. The suggested approach is based on the extraction of
dimensional information from computed tomography (CT) images of a part. A key
advantage of ARM is that it relies upon a radiographic method to
nondestructively obtain both exterior and interior views of the object,
eliminating the need for sectioning. A second advantage is that CT is a
densitometric modality, both dimensional and defect information can be obtained
simultaneously. However, the most important advantage of the ARM concept is that
CT systems are orders of magnitude faster than alternate methods. A single CT
scan set can be obtained in a few hours, providing complete dimensional
information and 100% screening for porosity and microshrink defects, even in
inaccessible regions of complex multiple-wall superalloy castings. Corrections
for partial-volume and scattered-radiation artifacts and algorithms for thin-
wall porosity detection will be researched. The efficacy of these methods will
be evaluated on high-energy CT data of a large structural superalloy component.
Development of an automated rapid metrology system will result in significant
cost reductions and throughput improvements during process development and
production of large investment castings.
