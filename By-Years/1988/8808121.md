This project investigates a variety of topics in dynamic macroeconomics. The
topics basically fall into two categories: (1) linear time series analyses of
rational expectations models and (2) the micro foundations of monetary theory.
Anyone who has dealt with aggregate U.S. time series data understands the
potential for measurement error to bias the analysis in quantitatively
significant ways. This is obviously true in structural linear rational
expectations models where the sources of error terms in reduced form
representations of the data are critical to the analysis. It is also central to
innovation accounting exercises of the type undertaken by Sims, as well as
analyses of the Blanchard-Watson type which focus on exactly identified VAR
systems. The proposed work on interpreting seasonality, alternative models of
measurement error, and least-squares learning in multi-agent settings is
motivated by a desire to increase the econometric applicability of dynamic
economic models and improve their interpretation, absent a more fundamental
solution which would generate better measured data. The two studies on monetary
theory, similarly, aim to deepen the understanding of different policy
predictions given by alternative monetary models. The particular focus of this
research is on the impact of timing conventions and communications technologies.
Although each of the several sub-projects deals with different aspects of
dynamic macroeconomics and is independent of the others, in combination their
results should contribute to strengthening the general underlying theory. At the
same time, the findings on seasonality and measurement error will have
substantial implications for the way econometricians use seasonally adjusted
data and interpret empirical results derived from that data.
