During the first phase of this NSF sponsored Small Business Innovation Research
project, Giner, Inc. demonstrated increased corrosion resistance of uniformly
deposited, boron-doped conductive diamond coatings on graphite substrates (fuel
cell bipolar separator plate materials) and a reduction in acid absorption (in a
phosphoric acid fuel cell environment) as compared to the uncoated or non-
uniformly coated graphite. Very little is known regarding the relationship
between growth initiation conditions on the substrate and the resulting
microstructure of thin diamond coatings, and the adherence of the coatings to
substrates. Hence, the research plan for Phase II focuses on: (1) effect of
pretreatment process of nucleating surfaces (graphite and silicon) on nucleation
density and on the nature and properties of the transition layer; (2) growth
experiments for determining the variables that affect the microstructure of the
diamond films; (3) determination of corrosion behavior and correlation with
phase purity and crystallite size; (4) development of a process model to
describe the parameters and relationships that control: (i) the formation of
reproducible dense and corrosion-resistant, very thin boron-doped diamond films;
and (ii) the properties of the transition layer interfaces between the films and
the substrates. The diamond coating process will be done by another small
business firm, Epion Corporation, under the guidance of Giner, Inc. It is
expected the knowledge gained from this research will facilitate the development
of advanced electrochemical cells and constitute an important contribution to
diamond films technology.
