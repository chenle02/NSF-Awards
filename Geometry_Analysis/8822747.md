The principal investigator will study several difficult problems in complex
geometry. Having proved a fundamental preliminary result, the PI will now find a
complete set of continuous invariants for families of complex hypersurfaces.
This problem may be reduced to studing the lower dimensional case by algebraic
means. The PI will also study the diffeomorphism classes of complex submanifolds
with real codimension greater than three. He will use his understanding of the
Kohn-Rossi cohomology to solve the complex Plateau problem. The proposed work
will shed light on the difficult complex Plateau problem and on our
understanding of hypersurfaces which are contained in high dimensional complex
spaces. Such problems have their origins in Gauss's original studies of
imaginary numbers such as the square root of -1.
