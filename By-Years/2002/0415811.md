The focus of this research involves the development of synthetic methodology
using chiral, bidentate and monodentate ligands to produce chiral proton
complexes as catalysts. Bisamidine and beta-diketimine ligands will be produced;
new Bronsted acid-catalyzed aza-Darzens reactions, aziridinations and
heteroannulations will be studied. An enantioselective aza-Henry reaction, a
chiral proton-catalyzed and a series of chiral proton-catalyzed Mannich
transformations will be carried out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Jeffrey Johnston in the Department of Chemistry at Indiana University. Dr.
Johnston will focus his work on producing methodology using the concept of
chiral proton catalysis. The research will examine the coordination chemistry of
the proton and will develop mild and selective protic acid-catalyzed organic
reactions. The research could have a broader impact on the pharmaceutical and
commodity chemicals industries and the project will be an excellent arena for
the training of graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
