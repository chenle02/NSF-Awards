Leguminosae (Fabaceae) is the third largest family of flowering plants and
includes many ecologically and economically important species. The primary goal
of the PI's research program has been a unified summary of the family of the
U.S. Only the genus Lupinus, the widespread and complex lupines, has not been
completed. This proposal is to examine herbarium holdings to complete a
monographic revision of the genus. The monograph will have widespread use by
range managers, foresters, and conservationists.
