This award supports the participation of US-based researchers in the
conference"Recent Developments and Future Directions in Nonlinear Dispersive and
Wave Equations" which will be held December 10-16, 2023 at Monash University, in
Melbourne Australia. The conference will convene researchers from around the
world in the general area of dispersive and wave equations, and will include
plenary talks from leading experts, along with shorter talks from earlier-career
mathematicians working in these areas. The award gives early-career researchers,
researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without
other sources of funding a chance to attend and participate in this conference.

The objective of the conference is to bring together researchers working in the
area of nonlinear dispersive and wave equations. This is a topic of much current
activity and research, with important applications to physics and engineering.
Furthermore, this conference aims to bring together physically disparate
research communities, which should help advance scientific understanding and
create future opportunities for collaboration. More information about the
conference is available at: https://sites.google.com/view/dispersive-pde

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
