The principal investigator will study the solubility of minerals at pressures
ranging from 5 to 20 kilobars and temperatures ranging from 500 to 1000 C using
piston cylinder apparatus. The resulting data will provide a basis for
quantitative analysis of mass transfer by fluids in high pressure metamorphic
environments within the Earth.
