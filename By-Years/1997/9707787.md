McPeek 9707787 Almost all organisms must find enough food for themselves while
trying not to become food for another organism. These are also often conflicting
objectives; the properties that make an organism better at finding food often
makes it worse at avoiding predators. Although this tradeoff in abilities is
commonly observed in many taxa, the underlying phenotypic architecture that
generates this fundamental trade-off is poorly understood. In this proposal the
PI will describe research to explore the properties of organisms generating such
a trade-off between growth and predator avoidance in larval damselflies
(Insecta), and to reconstruct how these properties have evolved as this taxon
has shifted between habitats with different predators and different resource
availabilities. The PI will conduct studies of four different organismal
properties to explore the underlying causes of this trade-off, including
differences in (1) movement and activity, (2) burst swimming ability and
anaerobic physiological capacities, (3) digestive efficiency, and (4) aerobic
metabolic capacity. Analyses will test hypotheses about the functional couplings
among characters and the evolution of these functional couplings. Examining how
these functional couplings have evolved provides valuable insights into the
constraints affecting taxa as they adapt to natural and anthropogenically-
induced environmental change (e.g., natural habitat shifts, climate change,
habitat degradation).
