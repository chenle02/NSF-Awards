e propose to hold a symposium on memristor and memristive systems in fall 2008
by inviting experts to discuss scientific principles, experimental findings, and
potential exploration of related topics. The importance of this field initially
pioneered by Leon O. Chua in 1971 and by Leon Chua and Sung-Mo Kang in 1976 was
reaffirmed recently by unveiling of a two-terminal nanoscale device presented in
Nature by Stanley Williams and his collaborators at HP Labs.&lt;br/&gt;Potential
development of more compact low power memory chips and realization of
neuromorphic computing hardware among other possibilities has been suggested by
the most recent experimental results. This workshop will potentially help
accelerate significant progresses in this newly emerging field.&lt;br/&gt;
