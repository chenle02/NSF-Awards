9400676 Heitsch Professor Heitsch will continue research on Bismut
superconnections and the Chern character for operators defined along leaves of a
foliation. Further collaboration with C.Lazarov will be done on the extension of
analytic invariants for compact manifolds to invariants of foliations and of
open manifolds, with special emphasis on torsion invariants. A development will
be made of coarse cohomology and coarse invariants for maps of topological
spaces. The geometry of foliations will also be investigated through the indices
of transversally ellipticoperators. Geometric objects are often classified by
determining whether they can be mapped or deformed into standard geometric
objects. Certain geometric invariants, for example, the number of "holes" are
preserved under such maps. This project involves invariants for geometric
objects called foliations that have a "leaf" structure. Cohomology produces
these invariants by considering the global object as patched together from
pieces. The successful completion of this project will help complete
theclassification problem in geometry. ***
