Because risk communication research has extrapolated largely from psychological
theory, advancement of the field requires application of theories that encompass
other social variables, such as organizations. This study applies to risk
communication a theoretical framework that goes beyond the individual unit of
analysis to explore contextual and organizational variables. The proposed
research explores the question: To what extent can risk communication be
explained as a quest for organizational legitimacy in an uncertain social
environment? Using case studies of communication about anthrax in six geographic
locations of New Jersey, the research seeks to 1) advance understanding of the
effects of organizational dynamics on risk communication, particularly as the
communication relates to the social amplification of risk (SAR); 2) extend
institutional theory to communication issues (specifically, risk communication
as symbolic action to preserve legitimacy); and, 3) explore the usefulness of
event-structure analysis (ESA), a method for analysis of historical events, to
the study of organizations' risk communication. Summaries of practical "lessons-
learned" will be developed for practitioners to improve communication about
bioterrorism.
