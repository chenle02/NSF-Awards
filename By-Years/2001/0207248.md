This project will improve current models of the Earth's magnetic field at high
latitudes and at larger distances from the Earth than current models. The new
model will include a model of the location of the magnetopause that depends on
solar wind pressure and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The twisting of
the cross-tail current sheet in response to the By-component of the IMF will be
included in the model as will the deep depression of the magnetic field in the
magnetospheric cusp due to the diamagnetic effect of magnetosheath plasma. The
model will be distributed to the scientific community via the National Space
Science Data Center (NSSDC) web site.
