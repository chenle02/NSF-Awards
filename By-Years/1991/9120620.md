Armstrong This research is on methods to create behavior models that accurately
represent the functionality and timing of complex devices. The work is on
developing a "Modeler's Assistant" as a base for structured development of
behavioral models. Specific problems being solved are: developing a process
primitive set for the Modeler's Assistant, developing and evaluating performance
measures for structured behavioral model development, developing a natural
language interface for the Modeler's Assistant, and building into the Modeler's
Assistant the capability to automatically generate tests for any behavioral
model which has been constructed by the system. Behavioral models are being
expressed in the high-level language, VHDL.
