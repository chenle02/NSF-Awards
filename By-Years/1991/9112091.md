This project is an equipment grant request for upgrading the existing universal
panel testing machine at the University of Houston for use in the study of the
earthquake resistance of reinforced concrete walls and the utilization of high-
performance concrete in wall-type and shell-type structures. In these types of
testing (including cyclic loadings), a servo control system to control the
strain or deformation of the specimen is required. Funds will be needed for the
purchase and installation of such an automated servo control systems. When
upgraded, this universal panel tester will become one of the most versatile in
the world and will open up new areas for research on specimens subjected to
complex stress states. In addition to reinforced concrete, the universal panel
tester can also be used to test panels made of steel, aluminum, wood or other
composite materials.
