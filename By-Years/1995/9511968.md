Student Pugwash USA , a national, educational, non-profit organization based in
Washington DC is dedicated to building a commitment among young people to
integrate social concerns into their academic, professional, and personal lives.
The Pugwash organization, through a variety of interdisciplinary activities,
focuses on leadership development and interactive learning, educating young
people on the relevance of science and technology to their own lives, and on its
ability to shape the future of the global community. This award is in partial
support of three important components of these activities: 1) the coordination
of an international conference on science and technology themes, 2) the
publication of a resultant Science, Technology, and Society (STS) Guidebook for
use by university students and high school teachers, and 3) the support of a
Chapter Program which coordinates nearly 150 local campus-based events each
year. More specifically, under this award, Pugwash will coordinate an
international conference on `Science, Technology, and Ethical Priorities` with
working groups in International Weapons Trade; Emerging Infectious Diseases;
Alternative Energy Sources; Access and the Internet; Water Quality and
Availability; and Public Participation in Scientific Decision-making. Second, it
will edit and produce the resulting Global Issues Guidebook, which will be
authored by the International Conference Participants and other students. Third,
Pugwash will disseminate and implement the Global Issues Guidebook among high
school teachers, national student organizations, and over 22 Student Pugwash USA
chapters/contacts on high school, college, and university campuses nationwide.
