9361417 Dean This project is to determine the feasibility of developing a
dynamic, socket-fitting system for lower-limb prosthesis. An important objective
of the investigation is to develop a quantitative method for establishing socket
geometry to provide a precise fit to the amputee's stump. A precise socket-
fitting system for making the initial socket and to compensate for stump volume
change over time would reduce tissue trauma, pain and the expenses of numerous
fittings. An ancillary result would be the development of a scientific data-base
for the profession to serve as guidelines for fitting the prosthesis to the
patient. ***
