9624353 Gao This CAREER award will investigate the research issues associated
with "smart" bearings that embed and integrate transducers and microelectronics
for data processing for diagnostics and predictive maintenance. The educational
plan will produce globally oriented engineers that understand competitive
pressures and have experienced cross-disciplinary teaming. The research plan
starts with quantifying bearing failure signatures, considers microelectronics
and miniaturization of sensors and data processing into a prototype smart
bearing, and bench scale and cooperative industrial experiments for optimization
reliability. The educational program has components of percolate outreach
through the University of Massachusetts-Amherst's K-12 Outreach Committee, and
undergraduate course in mechatronic system design, and a graduate course on
random data analysis and measurement. The impact of this innovative research
plan is that it is a key component of predictive maintenance, with implications
for productivity, availability and most importantly, safety, of manufacturing
machines and transportation systems. The educational plan will enable the
students to think critically and communicate better in a team environment,
making the nations human resources more competitive in a global environment.
