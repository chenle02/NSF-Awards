Prop #: 0423771&lt;br/&gt;PI: Bates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will supply
shipboard scientific support equipment for the Research Vessel (R/V) Weatherbird
operated by Bermuda Biological Station for Research (BBSR) and dedicated to use
in support of marine research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment
Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and
safe conduct of ocean science research. The Program provides support for such
items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval
of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
sites. The Project Director (PD), Nicholas Bates and Co-PD Lee Black are fully
qualified to direct the project, both having had considerable experience in
overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment. This project
will allow the institution to acquire a Markey winch display system and a Markey
2 sheave fairlead retrofit. ***&lt;br/&gt;
