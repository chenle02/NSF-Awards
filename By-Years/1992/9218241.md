This award supports a two-year collaborative research project between Professor
Richard Boyd of Ohio State University and Dr. Isao Tanihata of the Institute of
Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Japan. The project is designed to
measure cross sections using the radioactive beam facility at RIKEN, which are
of interest to predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis. These predictions are
crucial in testing the veracity of such models. The specific cross sections to
be measured are aimed at improving our understanding of the primordial
nucleosynthesis of nuclides somewhat heavier than those usually discussed in
this context, but which are readily observable by astronomers, even at very low
abundance levels. Also involved in the project are Professor James Kolata of the
University of Notre Dame, and two postdoctoral fellows and one graduate student
in Dr. Boyd's laboratory. All five scientists will undertake visits to RIKEN to
carry out the project.
