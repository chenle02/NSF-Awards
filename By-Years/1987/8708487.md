The purpose of this project is to estimate the value of agricultural land in the
Soviet Union and to integrate this price information into the analysis of Soviet
agricultural productivity. While collectivization of agriculture has been widely
studied, much less attention has been focused on the impact of national land-
ownership on economic efficiency in the agricultural sector. The Soviet Union,
with widely different agricultural regions, has moved cautiously in recent years
to re-establish, not private land ownership, but market-like prices for land to
rationalize land-use planning and, thereby, improve agricultural efficiency.
This project involves analyzing the new land-pricing schemes, incorporating them
into regional cost and production functions, and using them to simulate an
optimal cropping pattern. This project has an immediate significance for U.S.
agriculture. In order to satisfy consumer demands, the Soviets have turned away
from attempts at self sufficiency and have become dependent on the international
agricultural market to meet their domestic needs. The consequences for the U.S.
grain market is just one example of how Soviet agricultural performance can have
a major impact. A better understanding of the Soviet potential for increased
agricultural output because of a more efficient allocation of land and other
inputs will improve our own long term agricultural forecasts and policies.
