The proposed research involves the catalytic mechanism of bovine liver glutamate
dehydrogenase. The timing of bond-making and bond- breaking processes as well as
proton transfers will be determined for both the forward and reverse reactions
catalyzed by the enzyme. The catalytic reaction coordinate will be correlated
with enzyme conformation changes which are known to alter solvent access to the
active site. Mechanistic results will be correlated with available protein three
dimensional structural information to arrive at a unified description of the
catalytic process as a function of time. %%% Enzyme mechanism studies
characterize the step by step processes involving the enzyme, solvent, and
substrate(s) which occur during catalysis. Developing a self-consistent picture
of an enzyme mechanism is difficult and laborious, requiring application of
structural, chemical, as well as kinetic information. It is the most difficult
and potentially most rewarding study that can be undertaken with enzymes, which
are in their very essence active and time-dependent entities. Knowledge of
mechanism allows manipulation of the enzyme's catalytic machinery to carry out
chemistry and permits design of inhibitors of the enzyme which often turn out to
be potent drugs.
