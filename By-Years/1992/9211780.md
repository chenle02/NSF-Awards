The workshop's goal is to highlight new developments in the area of structural
optimization, particularly those involving topology optimization methods. The
main topics are: Optimal design of trusses and layout theory Discrete
optimization methods for topology optimization Relaxation methods for topology
optimization The role of composite materials Topology optimization in a
computer-aided-design environment. The workshop is highly interdisciplinary: it
involves both mathematicians and engineers, including specialists in
mathematical programming, computer aided design, sensitivity analysis, composite
materials, and the calculus of variations.
