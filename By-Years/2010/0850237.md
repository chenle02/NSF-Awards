"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Kentucky has
received a grant to build cyberinfrastructure to help researchers understand the
messenger RNA (mRNA) generated using new high throughput sequencing methods.
Next generation deep sequencing technologies applied to complementary DNA (cDNA)
have the potential to identify and differentiate all mRNA variants in a sample's
transcriptome, while concurrently providing a direct quantitative measurement of
their steady state levels. The research team will record, analyze, and compare
mRNA transcriptomes directly from high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data.
This team will build a data-driven processing pipeline applicable to any mRNA
transcriptome, requiring only a reference genome, and without dependence on a
priori gene structure annotations. Identification and analysis of both known and
uncharacterized splicing patterns through the unbiased assessment of splice
junction tags will be a major advance. This project will bridge the gap between
biological science and the analytical/computational challenges faced with the
massive datasets generated using RNA-seq protocols. The suite of bioinformatics
tools that will be provided has the potential to turn individual laboratories
into small genome centers and to allow individual scientists to assess the mRNA
transcriptome in a matter of days using samples from any organisms with a
reference genome (which are themselves becoming much easier to resequence using
high throughput sequencing technologies applied to genomic DNA). The impact of
these analytical resources, therefore, will be transformative as to how
biologists and biomedical investigators are doing science every day. Additional
