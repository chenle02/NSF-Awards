In this project, Avigad proposes to explore applications of proof theory to
three different domains: proof mining in ergodic theory and additive
combinatorics; formal verification of mathematical proofs; and the history and
philosophy of mathematics. The first involves the use of proof-theoretic methods
to extract explicit information, like rates of convergence and bounds, from
nonconstructive mathematical proofs. Avigad will build on past work to obtain
better combinatorial and quantitative information from recent applications of
ergodic theory to additive combinatorics. The second involves using
computational methods, such as interactive proof assistants, to verify the
correctness of mathematical proofs. Avigad has formally verified a proof of the
prime number theorem and has contributed to an ambitious project, directed by
Georges Gonthier, to verify the Feit-Thompson theorem. Building on these
experiences, Avigad will develop logical infrastructure to support such efforts.
Finally, Avigad will rely on a syntactic, proof-theoretic understanding of
mathematical methods to address important issues in the history and philosophy
of mathematics.

Some of the most important advances in mathematical logic in the twentieth
century are based on the realization that the language of mathematics and the
rules of mathematical reasoning can be described in very precise terms. This
project involves applying this idea in three distinct ways. The first involves
the use of logical methods to analyze and extract useful information from
mathematical proofs in different domains. The second involves the use of
computers to verify the correctness of mathematical arguments and calculations,
and to assist in mathematical reasoning. The third involves obtaining a better
historical and philosophical understanding of the methods of mathematical
reasoning.
