Equipment purchased through this award is being used to enable students to
investigate principles of molecular biology through the development of
laboratory experiments and independent research projects. Specific objectives
are to include the basic theoretical principles of molecular genetics, gene
fusions and molecular biochemistry in the Department's Genetics course and also
in Biochemistry -- a course offered jointly by the Biology and Chemistry
departments. The need is to provide a "hands- on" laboratory experience in these
courses in order to directly illustrate important theoretical principles, while
greatly expanding opportunities for students who enroll in the undergraduate
research program. The project will enable Roberts Wesleyan students for the
first time to participate in the development of reproducible experiments in
molecular biology. One feature of the effort is the introduction it provides
advanced majors to the rapidly expanding field of recombinant DNA technology.
