9634354 Moore A Conference/Workshop on the "Dynamics of a Disaster: Hurricane
Impact, Recovery and Mitigation in the United States Virgin Islands", will be
held in late Fall 1996, St. Thomas, U. S. Virgin Islands. The objective of this
conference is to bring together experts in wing engineering, meteorology, public
policy and economics with leading representatives from government, insurance,
banking and human services to discuss the impact from Hurricane Marilyn on the
Virgin Islands, the recovery process and the effectiveness of mitigation
measures taken after Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. Areas of future research
will be identified based on these experiences and the recommendations will be
disseminated to the research community. ***
