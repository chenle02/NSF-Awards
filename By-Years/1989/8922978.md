The investigators intend to obtain mineral, glass and whole rock geochemical
and glass isotopic data on a selected suite of samples from superfast spreading
segments of the East Pacific Rise in order to continue their investigation of,
the petrological and geochemical process involved in rift failure at superfast
spreading; the fine-scale temporal and spatial variability of some well-sampled
axial segments and associated near-ridge seamounts, the processes contributing
to the variability across segment boundaries with little structural
manifestation, and the origin and evolution of silicic lavas associated with
devals and propagating rifts at superfast spreading.
