The Adelphi University Science Education Advancement (SEA) Noyce Scholarship
Program is providing scholarships to 26 students majoring in the sciences as
they prepare to enter a science teaching career in a high-need public school.
This program includes: 1) two field-based marine science courses that explore
marine environments of Long Island, 2) a three-week internship with Nassau Board
Of Cooperative Education Services Summer Marine Biology (BOCES), 3) a strong
mentoring/induction program pairing scholars with an accomplished teacher-mentor
from high-need partner schools, 4) mentorship by a National Board of
Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) certified teacher, and 5) assessments
using the NBPTS Take One! program. The scope of educational reach of the
partners in this project, Adelphi University and Nassau BOCES, makes this
project an important contribution to the much needed effort to increase the
quality and quantity of highly-qualified science teachers. The project's focus
on 1) using marine sciences as a vehicle for the teaching and learning of all
science disciplines and 2) preparing teachers to use marine environments in
their own curriculum holds significant promise for the improvement of science
education in a region spanning from New York City to the far reaches of Long
Island, a region comprising some of the most important yet over-used coastal
environments found along the Atlantic seaboard.
