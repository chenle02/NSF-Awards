This Minority Research Center of Excellence (MRCE) project at Hampton
University represents the establishment of an internationally competitive
nuclear physics program. This is the first program of this quality in nuclear
and high energy physics to be located at a historically Black university. More
specifically, this project will: (a) expand and enhance the physics faculty at
Hampton; (b) strengthen collaborative activities with accelerator facilities
that are located at other universities and national laboratories; and (c)
provide support to develop a Ph.D. program in nuclear physics at Hampton
University. Hampton University will serve as a Center for promoting interest in
nuclear and high energy physics by underrepresented minorities. This achievement
provides a focal point for the University to work with other historically Black
colleges and universities to strengthen nuclear and high energy physics by
underrepresented minorities. This achievement provides a focal point for the
University to work with other historically Black colleges and universities to
strengthen nuclear and high energy physics throughout the nation. The MRCE at
Hampton will continue collaborations with the Continuous Electron Beam
Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Hampton Roads and with the College of William
and Mary. The CEBAF facility will provide a better understanding of the basic
nature of matter. CEBAF's advances will continue the tradition of nuclear
physics to benefit other fields such as molecular biology, materials science,
geological prospecting, semiconductor fabrication, radiation medicine, and
energy technology. Hampton University plans to fulfill a dream in being an
integral part of CEBAF's overall development and to make that dream a reality
for minorities who choose careers in science and engineering. The nuclear and
high energy physics faculty members at Hampton are will respected in the
scientific community because of their publications in refereed journals and
their participation in national and international professional conferences.
