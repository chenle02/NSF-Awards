Genome sequencing projects are providing a wealth of knowledge about the genes
carried in plant genomes. The ultimate goal of these projects is to understand
the function of each of these genes. However, DNA sequence information typically
only hints at potential function, and laboratory experiments are needed to
characterize the details of gene action. The most powerful approach to
characterizing gene function involves the analysis of mutant organisms. Thus,
there is a pressing need for the development of methods that can use DNA
sequence information to make directed modifications of plant genomes. The most
desirable technique would give the ability to make a variety of directed
modifications, and not be limited to functional knockouts. One such technique is
gene targeting via homologous recombination, which is widely used in yeast and
the mouse. However, a widely usable method for targeted modification of higher
plant genes is not yet available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project
is to produce a gene targeting methodology based on homologous recombination for
higher plants. In this procedure, three constructs are introduced into the
genome. The first and second are chimeric gene constructs that enable regulated
expression of the Cre Recombinase and I-SceI genes. The third construct is a
modified target gene placed between two loxP sites. The modified target gene
contains an I-SceI recognition sequence inserted into the middle of the gene. In
plants harboring all three constructs, expression of the Cre Recombinase and
I-SceI genes is induced, these enzymes catalyze the formation of a broken-ended
extrachromosomal DNA molecule in the nucleus, and homologous recombination
between the extrachromosomal DNA molecule and the target gene generates two
tandem copies of the target gene. This gene targeting procedure can be used to
inactivate a target gene or to introduce modifications into a target gene.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To expedite development of a basic gene targeting
procedure, Arabidopsis will initially be used as the test system. Its short
generation time and small size will allow rapid technology development and
testing. Furthermore, its small genome may increase homologous recombination
frequency. The method to be used in these experiments provides the ability to
produce an almost unlimited variety of genetic changes. Because the enzymes that
carry out homologous recombination have been highly conserved throughout
evolution, the methods we develop in Arabidopsis are very likely to work in a
broad variety of species including commercially important crop plants. Thus, the
methodology developed by the proposed experiments should benefit future efforts
to improve crop yield and quality.&lt;br/&gt;
