In this project funded through the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER)
Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Susan Graul of the Department of
Chemistry of the Carnegie- Mellon University will study the thermochemistry,
kinetics, and dynamics of gas-phase ion-molecule reactions. Reaction cross
sections and product angular and energy distributions will be determined using
mass-analyzed ion kinetic energy spectrometry and guided ion-beam techniques.
Initial studies will focus on the exothermic bimolecular nucleophilic
substitution (SN2) reactions of methyl halides CH3X (X=Cl,Br,I) with F- and Cl-
ions. These studies will be extended to other systems such as the reactions of
F- and Cl- ions with chloroacetonitrile and bromoacetonitrile, and others.
Furthermore, bimolecular elimination reactions will also be investigated. These
experimental studies will be complemented by electronic structure calculations
for relevant reaction intermediates and transition states, and statistical
theoretical modeling of the reactions studied for comparison with experimental
results. Accompanying the research activity is a specified education effort
appropriate to the development of a full, balanced, academic career. The
chemistry of ion-molecule reactions is at the forefront of gas phase reaction
chemistry. As such it plays an important role in the chemistry of combustion
processes, the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, and other areas. This research
will contribute to our understanding of these processes by providing data
suitable for the development of advanced theoretical, molecular based models of
chemical reactions.
