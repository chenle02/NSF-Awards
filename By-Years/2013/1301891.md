The SuperMAG project obtains ground magnetic field observations from
approximately 300 observatories around the world. The SuperMAG team subtracts
baselines from the observed magnetic field vectors and then the data are
normalized to a common coordinate system and cadence. SuperMAG provides a
graphical interface and allows users to display the data. Registered users can
download digital data. This project will continue operation of SuperMAG and
enhance its capabilities. This grant provides one year of support for SuperMAG.

SuperMAG team has involved and will continue to involve students in SuperMAG.
SuperMAG also contributes to the broader scientific community by providing data
to scientific users.
