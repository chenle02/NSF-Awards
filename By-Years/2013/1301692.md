The overarching aim of this project is to expand the structural theory of
permutation classes, to unify the disparate strands coming together in this
theory, and to test the power of the emerging viewpoint and toolbox by bringing
them to bear on problems of exact enumeration and the characterization of growth
rates.

Historically, the study of permutation classes arose from two independent
streams in 1960s and 1970s. One was combinatorial in nature, and concentrated on
the enumeration problems for permutations with a small set (size 1 or 2,
typically) of short (length up to 4) forbidden patterns. The other was coming
from Theoretical Computer Science, and was concerned with sets arising from
common sorting mechanisms and their combinations. In the past 10 years or so
these two strands have come much closer together, and this interaction has
created a new, fast developing area of combinatorics, with significant
interactions with Theoretical Computer Science, the Theory of Computability and
Complexity, Algebra, and Computational Biology, to name only a few. Apart from
the continued interest in sorting mechanisms and enumeration problems, major new
strands of research have emerged including the structural theory of classes, the
asymptotic behavior of classes, generalized pattern avoidance, packing
densities, algorithmic and decidability problems, and geometrical methods.
