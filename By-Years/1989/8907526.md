This award will provide funds for two faculty, three senior physicists and two
graduate students from the University of California, Berkeley to continue their
research in elementary particle physics. At the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) collider, Positron-Electron-Project (PEP), they will participate
in the running of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and in the analysis of data
for the study of beauty and tau physics as well as for gamma-gamma interactions.
At Fermilab, they will participate in the preparation of an experiment (E771)
using electronic techniques for the study of beauty states produced in 0.8 - 0.9
TeV proton fixed target interaction and will continue to analyze the data from
pictures taken with the Fermilab 15 ft. bubble chamber in the definitive
experiment (E632) in high energy neutrinos interactions with matter. This
experiment is providing useful data on the properties of particles containing
heavy quarks.
