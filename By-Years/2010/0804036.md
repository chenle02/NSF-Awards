This proposal requests funds for shipboard scientific equipment and
instrumentation for the RV Endeavor. Funds are requested to purchase five items:
(1) Dell computers, (2) 10-L Niskin water bottles, (3) an ISUS nitrate sensor,
(4) laboratory refrigerators, and (5) a Magellan ADU5 GPS receiver system. The
integration of this equipment into RV Endeavor?s scientific inventory will
expand the sampling ability of researchers using the ship and will become part
of the shared-use equipment pool. The RV Endeavor is owned by the National
Science Foundation and operated by the University of Rhode Island under a
cooperative agreement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The
equipment and instrumentation that are requested will enhance the scientific
infrastructure of the University of Rhode Island and the scientific capabilities
of the RV Endeavor. Investments in the scientific infrastructure of the ship
benefit the science community and enhance the sea-going education and research
of undergraduate and graduate students and interns. The shared-use equipment
pool provides a cost-effective resource for researchers to access specialized
pieces of equipment that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive to include
in individual research proposals..&lt;br/&gt;
