Males often compete for the opportunity to mate; in promiscuous species, this
battle continues after mating, as sperm compete to fertilize eggs, thereby
driving the rapid evolution of male reproductive characteristics. This study
will use a genetic cross between two species of deer mouse, one promiscuous and
one monogamous species, to answer two critical questions: (a) which traits
contribute to sperm competition success? and (b) which genetic regions are
responsible for these traits? By competing mice with different reproductive
characteristics in fertilization contests, and by identifying associations
between these characteristics and specific genomic regions, this work will
identify the traits and genes molded by sperm competition. This novel study will
first ascertain which traits are subject to this critical evolutionary force,
and then determine their genetic basis.

In conjunction with the project will be public outreach efforts, including the
design and implement of an eight-week curriculum on adaptation for students in
grades four and five at a Boys & Girls Club in Somerville, Massachusetts. The
majority of students in this club come from low-income families in an
underserved community. The project will also include mentoring of undergraduate
students.
