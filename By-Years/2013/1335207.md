Funds are provided to reconstruct the history of hurricane landfalls in
southwest Florida over the past five thousand years. The proxy record will be
developed from hurricane overwash deposits preserved in backbarrier lagoons and
marshes, and correlated with a compilation of climatological, meteorological,
and oceanographic data for the region. The chronology of the overwash deposits
will be constrained by radiometric dating, and SLOSH model results will
facilitate the correlation of overwash deposits with the tropical cyclones that
created them. A site-specific hurricane database will be developed for southwest
Florida to better understand the characteristics of storms that produce overwash
deposits. Results of this research may have implications for coastal planning
and management in the region. The project will support an early-career female
investigator, and will involve high school, undergraduate, and graduate
students.
