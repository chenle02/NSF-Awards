9628045 Sofia This Americas Program award will support Drs. Sabatino Sofia and
three other astronomers from Yale University, Connecticut, to study the
technical feasibility of mounting a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) drift scan
camera on the 1m Schmidt telescope in Venezuela operated by the Centro de
Investigacion de Astronomia (CIDA) at Llano del Hato, Venezuela. Collaborating
with the group will be Dr. Gustavo Bruzual, Director of CIDA and his partners.
The combination of Schmidt optics, the equatorial site provided by the
Venezuelan Schmidt, and CCD drift scan techniques, should result in an uniquely
powerful astronomical survey machine. Potential scientific applications which
will be made possible by the CCD camera will cover the entire range of modern
observational astrophysics, from searches for nearby brown dwarfs, to studies of
the structure of our galaxy, to the cosmological implications of the
distribution of the most distant quasars. Several technical issues must be
resolved prior to the installation of the CCD. In particular, the geometry
required by the camera on the telescope, and the algorithms for handling the
large expected data rates must be considered. The objective of this proposal is
to conduct the necessary studies to resolve these issues. ***
