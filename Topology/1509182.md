Matrices -- arrays of numbers -- are ubiquitous in science, engineering, and
business. The study of the arithmetic governing the behavior of matrices has
benefited all these application areas and has also led to advances in several
branches of mathematics. This research project aims to advance work that is
underway to bundle the equations that represent the algebra of matrices into a
single geometric theory, thus allowing techniques from geometry to deepen our
understanding of algebra.

This research project aims to study the large-scale geometry, finiteness
properties, and cohomological behavior of function-field-arithmetic groups such
as the special linear groups SL(n,F[t]) where F is a finite field, and of
related groups such as SL(n,Z[t]). Specifically, the principal investigator
intends to investigate the cohomology with group ring coefficients of these
families of groups. One would also like to understand when groups such as these
special linear groups have projective resolutions or classifying complexes with
finite skeleta through dimension m, and to determine coefficient modules M and
natural numbers m for which the cohomology group of one of these special linear
groups in degree m with coefficients in M is infinitely generated.
