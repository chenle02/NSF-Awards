In their research they will, (1) compare low energy electron and positron
diffraction (LEED and LEPD) from Gallium Arsenic(110), (2) upgrade positron re-
emission microscope (PRM) from its 300 nm resolution to a resolution of 1nm, and
(3) observe thermally activated and radiation damage produced monovacancies in
metals. The sensitivity of the PRM to defects will be used. They will also test
whether LEPD is theoretically superior to LEED and incorporate a new method a
producing slow positron beams.
