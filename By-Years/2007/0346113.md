We are creating an automated processing framework for
EarthScope/USArray&lt;br/&gt;seismological data. This system aids in the
integration of USArray&lt;br/&gt;results into products of interest to a wide
range of seismologists,&lt;br/&gt;geoscientists, K-16 educators, and students at
all levels. The initial&lt;br/&gt;product estimates crustal thickness beneath
USArray stations.&lt;br/&gt;
