This action funds Peter Greene of University of California, Davis to conduct a
research project, entitled "Modifying magnetic nanostructures for high density
information storage," during the summer of 2012 at National Tsing Hua University
in Hsinchu. The host scientist is Prof. Chih-Huang Lai.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to determine the time
dependant coercivity of tailored magnetic nanostructures constructed of Cobalt
and Palladium super-lattices using magneto optical kerr effect (MOKE). This
study gives important, quantitative insight into the viability of graded
anisotropy magnetic media as the basis for future hard disk drive media.
Magnetic recording media form the backbone of large scale data storage. The need
for even higher density data storage media is ever increasing. No other
technology is as prevalent or as scalable as magnetic recording. However, the
point where the sizes of magnetic bits are measured in number of atoms is
quickly being approached. It is this issue that motivates the research: how to
create ultra dense yet stable and useable magnetic media.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
