Abstract ATM-9628843 Shah, Kathryn Columbia University Title: Climate Signals in
GCM Microwaves Maps: The 1980s- Early 1990s and the 21st Century The goal of
this proposal is to narrow the gap between the microwave observed and GCM
generated global temperature trends during the period of 1980s to early 1990s.
To this end series of coupled model experiments will be performed and utilized.
Understanding the trend differences is a fundamental problem in climate change
detection research. This twenty-four grant is to aid in achieving this
understanding.
