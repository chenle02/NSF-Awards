The proposed three year project will contribute to the long term research
programs of both Hampton University (HU) and NOAA National Marine Fisheries
Service, Northeast Fisheries Center (NEC), in zooplankton taxonomy and larval
fish trophodynamics and to their shared commitment to increasing the
participation of minorities in marine science. Copepod developmental stages that
are the preferred food of larval fish will be identified and enumerated in fine
mesh (.053 mm pore size) spring zooplankton samples taken in 1980-83 in the
Georges Bank and Gulf of Maine nursery areas for cod and haddock. One HU
graduate student will focus on 75 Georges Bank samples during project years one
and two, and a second will utilize 91 Gulf of Maine samples during years two and
three. They and undergraduate student assistants will interact with scientists
in the Plankton Ecology Investigation at the NEC Narragansett Laboratory. The
graduate students will develop masters theses that apply statistical analyses to
new data from the fine mesh samples and existing data from coarse mesh samples
to test hypotheses concerning the relative spatial and temporal distributions of
zooplankton and ichthyoplankton in the study area. Estimation of secondary
production of copepod nauplii, employing production/biomass ratios or cohort
analyses, will be attempted. The fine mesh data will be added to the MARMAP
Ecosystem Data Base at NEC, and the students will be advanced in their
preparation for marine science careers.
