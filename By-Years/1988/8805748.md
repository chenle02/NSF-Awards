Sheet metal forming is a basic manufacturing process for the mass production of
numerous commercial products. In sheet metal forming, wrinkling is a major type
of failure which has been recognized for a long time but remains to be solved.
Wrinkling may occur in any stage of a forming process including the springback
stage. The acceptance of a sheet metal product depends on the final physical
state which may be determined by a post-birfurcation analysis and a springback
analysis. A post-bifurcation analysis describes the growth or decay of wrinkles
after their initiation. This research will attempt to develop a general solution
of the wrinkling problem including the post-bifurcation behavior of wrinkles.
