A graphics-oriented courseware package is being developed which can act as an
intelligent computer-based tutor to assist mechanical engineering students
assess 'good' and 'bad' mechanism designs. The courseware incorporates a set of
rules and performance criteria that allow students more facility to study
kinematics and the kinetics of mechanisms and to design and analyze linkages,
cams, and gears. A mini- consortium of educators are assisting in the
development, implementation and evaluation of the instructional material.
