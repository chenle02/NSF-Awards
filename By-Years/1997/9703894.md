Two working conferences concerning the history of modern social and behavioral
science will be organized in preparation for Volume VII (Modern Social and
Behavioral Sciences) of the eight-volume Cambridge History of Science, which
will be published by the Cambridge University press in 1999-2000. One conference
will bring together authors working on pre-20` century issues, the second will
focus on 20th century. The Cambridge History of Science will serve as the
standard reference work for many years to come. The volume on social and
behavioral sciences will not only summarize what has been learned about the
origins of those disciplines, it will also examine their applications in the
polity, economy and elsewhere and will bring an international perspective to
discussion of their current circumstances.
