Moduli spaces of lattices, Riemann surfaces, rational maps and other algebraic
structures exhibit rich geometry, often accompanied by rigidity and a connection
with arithmetic. These spaces also have a dynamical nature -- they support
natural flows or group actions with complicated orbits, or they classify such
actions. This projects aims to investigate moduli spaces from a dynamical
perspective. In the setting of Riemann surfaces we study Teichmueller curves,
Jacobians with real multiplication, volumes of complex hyperbolic cone manifolds
and representations of the braid group developed by Picard, Deligne-Mostow and
Thurston. We also investigate dynamical systems of low entropy, ranging from
pseudo-Anosov maps to automorphism of K3 surfaces, via constructions adapted to
small Salem numbers and Coxeter groups. In the setting of lattices we aim to
investigate packing constants of ideals in number fields, and to demonstrate an
abundance of bounded orbits for rank one flows, to complement the dearth of such
orbits predicted in higher rank by conjectures of Littlewood and Margulis.
Finally, in the setting of iterated rational maps in one complex variable, we
study the natural bifurcation measure on moduli spaces attached to individual
critical points, and aim to show their independence and transversality, with an
eye towards arithmetic applications. We also intend to link the theory of
Berkovitch spaces to the degeneration of hyperbolic manifolds to trees.

From particle physics to finance, from evolution to climate change, the world is
full of dynamical systems. Simple algebraic transformations already exhibit many
of the features of these natural phenomena, such as phase transitions and
tipping points that signal the onset of new regimes. These universal patterns
may be revealed through the rigorous study of moduli spaces, their
compactifications and their stratifications by dynamical invariants. This
project appeals to a broad range of mathematical disciplines to both deepen our
understanding of dynamical systems and to sharpen our mathematical and
computational methods.
