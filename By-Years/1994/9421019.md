9421019 Brown The purpose of this U.S.-Hungary joint research project between
Dr. Stuart E. Brown of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Dr. Gyorgy
Kriza of the Hungarian Research Institute for Solid State Physics, Budapest, is
to investigate the effect of disorder on the spin-density-wave ground state and
the transport properties of a series of quasi-one-dimensional molecular salts.
Specifically, the researchers hope to interpret the crossover in the spin-
lattice relaxation which then think reflects a crossover in low-frequency
transport damping. They anticipate defining the importance of disorder and
thermal energies to such a crossover. Results are expected to contribute to our
fundamental knowledge of phason dynamics, with potential relevance to materials
research in a number of fields. This project in condensed matter physics
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary
talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence. ***
