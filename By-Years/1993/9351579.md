This project enhances current laboratory capabilities with spectrophotometric
instrumentation which feature rapid and efficient data acquisition and
processing (a computer interfaced scanning UV/Vis spectrophotometer and an
atomic absorption spectrophotometer). Experiments are designed to introduce
techniques widely used in the workplace and in graduate schools. Eleven Biology
Department laboratory courses have been substantially upgraded.
