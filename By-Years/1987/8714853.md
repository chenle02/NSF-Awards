The American Geophysical Union will fund travel of U.S. scientists to the Joint
Oceanographic Assembly (JOA) in August 1988 in Acapulco, Mexico. The AGU will
select and fund fifty U.S. scientists to participate in the JOA, with emphasis
on young scientists who do not have access to other travel funds. The AGU will
announce widely the availability of these awards and will set up, in conjunction
with the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, a committee to review
all applications and select the fifty most appropriate award recipients. The AGU
will also work with the Chairman of the JOA Organizing Committee and the
Chairman of the Scientific Program Committee, to improve the communications
system used for planning the JOA, especially the JOA's scientific program.
