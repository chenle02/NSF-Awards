Computer facilities have become extremely important in the function of a modern
society. An interruption of their function can result in serious hardship and
far-reaching economic and even national security consequences. Natural hazards
such as earthquakes may damage computer facilities if mitigative measures are
not taken; hence, there is a need to investigate the prior experience of
earthquake damage to and the current seismic resistant design for computer
facilities. This research project uses historical information gathered in the
U.S. and Japan to: assess and evaluate earthquake damage experience to computer
facilities; evaluate (based on damage data and those not damaged) various U.S.
and Japanese design practices; prepare a commentary which includes relative
merits, disadvantages, and cost of different approaches and design; and develop
technical recommendation for developing practical mitigative design procedures
for both new and existing computer facilities. The results of this research
project will also be applicable to the seismic design of other sensitive
elective operations.
