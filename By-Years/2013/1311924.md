This goal of this proposal is to develop advanced techniques designed to place
precise constraints on cosmological parameter estimates through weak
gravitational lensing analysis of ongoing and future galaxy surveys, in
particular the Dark Energy Survey. This will be achieved by improving weak
gravitational lensing shape measurement algorithms and data calibration
techniques.

Broader impacts of the work include training of a graduate student, and sharing
of lensing computer codes through the GalSim project. The work will contribute
to the future success of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).
