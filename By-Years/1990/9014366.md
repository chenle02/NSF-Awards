The statistical mechanics and dynamics of disordered systems will be
investigated using analytical and numerical methods. Three major areas will be
studied: 1) Self-avoiding walks in random environments, 2) The superfluid
transition for Helium in porous media and 3) Random resistor and elastic
networks. These topics will be investigated by a variety of modern methods of
statistical mechanics; including field theory and the renormalization group,
Lifshitz type arguments, and numerical simulation. This research is directly
relevant to understanding current experiments in the areas of superfluids in
porous glasses and polymers in gels. A second fundamental objective of this work
is to advance the development of theoretical tools for the study of disordered
systems.
