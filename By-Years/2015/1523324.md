The management of shared services such as parking and ride sharing can be
challenging in urban areas. However, the efficient management of shared
services, particularly parking, has been shown to dramatically reduce congestion
and pollution. In this proposal, the team proposes exploring the commercial
viability of a methodology to predict the demand for shared services found in
cities. The product being proposed is a predictive parking application with both
long and short term components. Not only will the product assist individuals in
finding a parking space but also it will influence their travel demand patterns.
Drivers will be able to proactively plan their trips and explore other options
available to them based on the information obtained from the predictive
model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The benefits of the predictive model go beyond the
demand side. On the supply side, garage operators could use the predictive
information to better manage their facilities. For example, a predicted higher
than normal demand for parking spots could allow a garage operator to
artificially increase the facility?s capacity by making provisions for valet
parking. Further downstream, the information provided by the predictive module
will be used to dynamically price parking spaces, a functionality that will help
address some of the rigidities in the automobile parking market. The proposed
innovation, if successful, will improve the management of shared services in
urban areas. Additionally, the proposed innovation has the potential increases
in small business activity and entrepreneurship in the areas of shared services
such as carsharing, homesharing, and ridesharing
