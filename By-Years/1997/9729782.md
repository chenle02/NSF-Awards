Abstract - Doyle - 9729782 The pulp and paper industry (PPI), a very capital
intensive component of the U.S. manufacturing sector, is a major source of the
total U.S. industrial output of hazardous wastes. In order to maintain and
enhance the global competitiveness of the U.S. PPI while ensuring a safe, clean,
and sustainable environment, waste minimization and processing measures need to
be integrated within the overall operation of existing (and proposed) paper
mills. The goal of this research is to develop and demonstrate computing based
modeling and optimization methodologies which will facilitate such integrated
operations. The technical work involves development of efficient methods for
solving highly structured mixed integer linear programming algorithms (MILP's),
development of hierarchical representations for describing noisy process trends,
the development of mathematical programming based approaches to large scale
model predictive control, and the investigation of formulations for
incorporating discrete choices of process models for transient operating
conditions. The developed operational methodology for environmentally conscious
paper mill operation will be benchmarked against an industrial case study in
cooperation with an industrial collaborator from the pulp and paper industry
(Weyerhaeuser).
