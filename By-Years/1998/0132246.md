AST 0132246 Balsara

This research program is aimed at understanding the generation and evolution of
astrophysical magnetic fields. Magnetic fields play decisive role in many
astrophysical processes from mediating star formation and transporting angular
momentum in ubiquitous accretion disks to influencing heating/cooling within
clusters of galaxies. In all these situations, the large magnetic Reynolds
numbers of the flows require that any changes of magnetic field topology be
implemented through fast reconnection, while magnetic field generation requires
fast dynamo.

The project makes use of recent advances in numerical capabilities to test
recently advanced theories of fast reconnection and fast dynamos. It also
proposes further development of reconnection theory, comparisons of theoretical
and numerical results with liquid sodium measurements, and simulations of the
galactic dynamo. Another very important outcome of this effort will be the
development of a parallel AMR MI-ID code, RIEMANN, for simulating MHD phenomena
in rotating astrophysical systems. This will be a general-purpose utility that
will be made widely available to the community. Funding for this project was
provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).
