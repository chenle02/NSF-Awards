This award provides funds to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI)/
Deep Submergence Facility, which operates the Human Occupied Vehicle (HOV)
Alvin, the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Jason II, and the Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Sentry as a National Facility (NDSF). The award is for
operational funds for the deep submergence science vehicles, listed above, in
support of NSF-sponsored research for calendar years 2016-2020. The National
Facility, of which the Alvin and Jason are the major vehicles, is supported
primarily by NSF, but also by awards from the Office of Naval Research (ONR),
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other federal and
non-federal sources. All users of the facility contribute equally to annual
operations through a consistent, vehicle-specific, day rate. NSF is the
cognizant agency with respect to developing NDSF vehicle day
rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vehicles plan a combined 434 operating days in
2016: Alvin 154; Jason 144; and, Sentry 136. NSF plans to support 352 of these
days: Alvin 120; Jason, 129; and, Sentry 103.
