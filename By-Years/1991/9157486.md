Dr. Schepartz has organized her research to encompass three areas of
concentration. Protein affinity cleavage will be probed by the synthesis of
molecules containing a protein ligand tethered to a reactive metal ion. Current
studies involve the synthesis of a synthetic peptide designed to affinity cleave
the FK-506 receptor FKBP. Affinity cleaving reagents will also be developed to
give entry into the realm of RNA:protein interactions. Studies on the molecular
recognition of RNA will be based upon the synthesis of linked oligonucleotide
probes which consist of two short DNA oligos linked by a tether of prescribed
length. The sequences of the two oligos are designed to complement unique and
remote single stranded regions in the RNA. Third, self-assembling molecules will
be prepared utilizing the assembly of dimeric receptors using a mechanism of
transition metal chelation. %%% Dr. Alanna Schepartz of the Chemistry Department
at Yale University is being supported by the Synthetic Organic Program as a
Preseidential Young Investigator. She will focus her research efforts in the
area of macromolecular bioorganic chemistry. By combining the techniques of
organic chemistry and molecular biology, Dr. Schepartz will study the molecular
basis of protein recognition, molecular recognition of RNA and how to turn
receptors on and off.
