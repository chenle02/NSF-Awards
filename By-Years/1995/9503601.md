This RUI research project is a companion project to CCR-9424154 (PI: Wang) of
UNC at Greensboro. The research project centers about the relations among
average- case complexity classes. Complexity theory began with the study of
hierarchies among worst-case complexity classes, and these have been thoroughly
investigated. Recently, a reasonable amount of work has been done investigating
average-case completeness, however very little work has been done looking into
separation and hierarchy results for average-case complexity classes. What
little work has been done has either used an unsatisfactory definition of
average-case complexity or has produced less than optimal results. The goal of
this research project is to more thoroughly investigate average-case complexity
classes and hierarchies among them.
