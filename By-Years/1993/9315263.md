9315263 Mills This awards supports the participation of 10 U.S. scholars in a
U.S.-Japan Seminar on The State of Teaching Japanese to Scientists and
Engineers, scheduled for May 1994 in Pittsburgh, PA. The co-organizers of the
seminar are Professor David Mills, Department of East Asian Language and
Literature, University of Pittsburgh, and Professor Kazuo Otsubo, Director of
Japanese Language Teaching, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan. The objective of
the seminar is to strengthen the infrastructure of science in the United States
by leading to improved methods of teaching technical Japanese to U.S. scientists
and engineers, thus enabling a greater level of collaboration with their
Japanese colleagues. The seminar will focus on a review of existing programs,
discussion of pedagogical issues, and consideration of what directions are the
most fruitful for the future. Also, the seminar will examine ways to foster
better cooperation between scientists and engineers on the one hand and Japanese
language specialists on the other. One further goal is to establish
relationships that may lead to enhanced opportunities for U.S. students to spend
time in Japan mastering the language in an appropriate scientific setting. ***
