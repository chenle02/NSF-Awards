This project addresses the task of automatically detecting the influence
structure and flow of ideas in document corpora that have grown over time (e.g.
scientific literature, political debates, news, email, wikis, blogs) in order to
trace the origin and development of ideas over time. The intellectual merit of
this project lies in the development of statistically well-founded methods for
discovering and analyzing the influence structure in evolving archives. In
particular, this project will focus on the development of statistical tests for
two relations that are central to understanding the structure of an archive and
how ideas developed - namely originality and influence. The ability to detect
influence and origin of ideas will be of substantial help in understanding,
exploring, interpreting, visualizing, and aggregating the rapidly growing body
of historical text available online. The project will also evaluate in how these
methods augment traditional citation analysis in hyperlinked collections, and
whether they allow similar functionality even in non-hyperlinked archives. The
new capability will benefit a number of widely used applications, including
search engines for internet content.
