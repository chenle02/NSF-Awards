This award will provide support for participants to attend the Workshop on
Hadronic Parity Non-Conservation, which will be hosted by the Kavili Institute
for Theoretical Physics and is being organized through the NSF Theory Hub
"Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Symmetries". The purpose of
the workshop is to convene experts in the field to plan a path forward that can
test a new model based on a large number of degrees of freedom and potentially
lead to a deeper understanding of hadronic parity non-conservation.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
