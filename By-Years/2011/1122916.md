In recent decades, the flow of legal ideas across continents and countries has
intensified to such an extent that some legal scholars write of the
"globalization of law." Digital forms of information storage and communication
have made it cheaper and easier than ever for attorneys and judges to acquire
and use legal materials from virtually anywhere in the world. Judges in numerous
countries increasingly draw upon foreign and international legal materials to
help them resolve questions that arise in their own national courts. This
project will collect, prepare, analyze, and disseminate information on the
globalization of law through national high courts. The current study will record
citations to foreign and international legal materials in the decisions of about
40 constitutional or supreme courts, covering a 20-year span of time. The
countries to be included represent all of the world's regions and major legal
traditions. The researchers will use statistical techniques to analyze the
patterns of judicial globalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this
research will be the first systematic, international, multi-year database of
citations to the full range of foreign and international legal materials. Both
the data and the analyses will be freely available to legal researchers, law
practitioners, and policy makers through an interactive web site.
