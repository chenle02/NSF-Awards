The team has developed a new method for ultrasensitive radiocarbon detection.
The laser-based technology allows the measurement of trace amounts, on the order
of one part per one trillion, of radioactive label in organic compounds. The
proposed analyzer has the potential to change the way the pharmaceutical
industry conducts metabolic and toxicity studies with radio-labeled carbon for
its drug discovery and development programs long before human clinical trials. A
commercialized version of this analyzer technology would enable scientists to
conduct ultrasensitive measurements more quickly on-site and with small samples
and thus less radioactivity.

Existing Accelerator Mass Spectrometer technology effectively counts atoms as
they are accelerated across a large equipment platform that takes up a large
room and is expensive to maintain. It is complex and expensive; only a few such
systems exist for the purposes of Biological Radiocarbon studies, and samples
must be outsourced to such facilities with long turnaround times. Existing
Liquid Scintillation Counter (LSC) technology must use samples 3-4 orders of
magnitude larger with much higher radiation because the beta-decay counting
technique lacks the sensitivity for many metabolic and toxicity studies. The
proposed laser based technology effectively tickles the CO2 molecules with a
laser millions of times per second in an electrical discharge and obtains an
electronic response (known as the Optogalvanic Effect). The proposed technology
has the potential to reduce the costs associated with new drug development by
enabling pharmacokinetic studies to be initiated in humans sooner than currently
possible and will thus accelerate the time to approval and market.
