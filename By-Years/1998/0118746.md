Six to seven speakers each have been invited from the United States of America,
Argentina and Brazil to cover topics on exploration of microbial diversity, uses
of biodiversity, plant-microbe interactions and genomics. The aim of this
workshop is to explore the possibilities of interaction between North and South
scientific groups of Brazil, Argentina and the United States in the fields of
microbial diversity and biocomplexity. The primary goals of the meeting consist
of exploring and using microbial diversity for biotechnological purposes;
starting studies of biocomplexity beginning at the level of interactions between
microorganisms and other biological, physical, and chemical systems and
proposing possible joint projects. This meeting promotes the participation of
not only senior investigators, but also graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows from Argentina and Brazil. This award provides funds to cover roundtrip
airfare costs from the USA to Buenos Aires, the site of the workshop, for the
seven participants from the United States. The final program, conclusions and
recommendations will be forwarded to the NSF and distributed to the
participants.
