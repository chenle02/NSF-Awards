This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Scott Kravis of
Texas A&amp;M University to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Yohko Awaya
for 24 months at the Institute for Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) in
Japan. They will apply Dr. Kravis' Time of Flight (TOF) spectrometer to measure
the photoionization cross-sections of ions using a collinear ion beam and
synchrotron radiation geometry. At present, the theory for inner-shell
photoionization of ions is far ahead of experimentation. The collaborative
experimentation between Dr. Kravis and Dr. Awaya is much needed to substantiate
the photoionization theory. Dr. Awaya and his expertise of the RILAC accelerator
and SPring 8 GeV synchrotron radiation facility at RIKEN will complement Dr.
Kravis' expertise in measuring transfer rate coefficients at low energies and
measuring ionic distribution after inner- shell ionization. Integral to their
accelerator based experiments, Dr. Kravis' TOF spectrometer will detect
scattered projectile in coincidence with a specific recoil ion charge state.
