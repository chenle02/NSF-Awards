9450895 McDonald Using closed laboratory sessions as the vehicle for
implementation, this project develops an active learning environment for
computer science instruction in the first two courses in the major. Other
institutions will be able to replicate this environment. The project
demonstrates that closed laboratories can be used effectively as the primary
means of instruction in the first two courses in the major and provides an
alternative teaching paradigm that is more student-centered than the traditional
lecture/listen method. This paradigm focusses on the student as performer,
rather than the professor as performer. The professors role is facilitator,
guide, and manager. There is much current interest in incorporating closed
laboratories into the computer science curriculum, but the investigators know of
no other institution that is committed to replacing most lecture/listen sessions
with a totally redesigned active learning environment based on the use of closed
laboratories. Formal studies have shown that students learn best in small
groups. The closed laboratory materials and the physical arrangement of the
equipment is designed to promote teamwork, and a major goal of the project is to
help students learn to work effectively in teams. Lifelong learning skills will
be developed as the focus of activity centers on the student and encourages
her/him to share responsibility for the learning process. The project can have a
positive effect on attracting and retaining women and minorities because of the
emphasis on human interaction and the de-emphasis on rote learning and
memorization.
