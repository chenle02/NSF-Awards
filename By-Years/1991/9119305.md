A three day symposium, entitled "Marine Bioinorganic Chemistry" will be held at
the National American Chemical Society Meeting/4th Chemical Congress of North
America, August 25-30, 1991 in New York City. The purpose of this symposium is
to bring together biochemists, inorganic chemists, bioinorganic chemists,
chemical and biological oceanographers and civil/environmental engineers to
discuss the recent developments in the emerging field of marine bioinorganic
chemistry. Many novel metalloenzymes, metal binding ligands, inorganic compounds
and biomolecules. Because the transition metal composition of the ocean is now
relatively well defined, the study of the bioinorganic chemistry of the oceans
has now become feasible. By bringing together scientists from the fields listed
above, this symposium is likely to stimulate new ideas, interests and
collaborations in this emerging field.
