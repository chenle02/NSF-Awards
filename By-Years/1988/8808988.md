This research considers natural and forced convection boiling heat transfer from
cylindrical and spherical bodies in both transition and film boiling. The
objective is to investigate the influence of surface roughness, fluid
subcooling, liquid velocity, and fluid chemistry on the stability of the thin
vapor films. The experimental approach seeks the conditions for instability and
the parameters that contribute to the transition region of the boiling curve.
Effective and efficient heat transfer is important in a wide variety of energy
systems, and convective boiling is often used in such systems. The transition
and film boiling regions of the boiling curve are generally viewed as regions
where equipment should not operate due to the instability of the flow in these
boiling regions. The design and stable operation of these systems will benefit
from the better understanding of the basic mechanisms involved.
