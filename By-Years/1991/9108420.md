A program of study of the solid/solution interface will be performed involving
the preparation of well defined colloidal dispersions, studies of chemical
reactions in aerosols, and particle-particle interactions. Special emphasis will
be placed on the preparation and characterization of particles consisting of
more than one cation. The relationship of the composition of the solid phase to
that of the solution will be examined. Coated particles having different
surfaces and cores will be examined with a view to developing particles with
surfaces containing high value components. The interaction between particles of
different composition, size and surface potential in media of varying ionic
strength will be examined both experimentally and theoretically. %%% The
research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses on
the study of chemical reactions at solid/solution interfaces and in aerosols.
The project promises to extend our understanding of colloidal particles. The
outcome of this research has considerable practical applications impacting on
several important technologies (e.g. ceramics, paints, catalysis).
