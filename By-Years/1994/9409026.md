9409026 Krassowska The research proposed in this application develops a model in
which a cell is treated as a unit and its macroscopic dynamics are governed by a
set of equations applicable to the whole cell. Previous results in this area
have been slowed because the response to a fully excitable cell to an external
field is governed by a boundary valued problem with nonlinear and dynamic
conditions on the membrane. This research will overcome the previous difficulty
by developing a model of the whole cell. Objectives of the proposed work include
developing a quantitative description of the macroscopic dynamics of a single
cell in an external field, study the influence of membrane folding and internal
structures of the cell on its macroscopic dynamics, and establish the
relationship between optical measurements of the transmembrane potential and the
macroscopic dynamics of a single cell. ***
