The goal of this project is to deepen and enhance our understanding of geometric
topology, that is, the homeomorphism classification of closed manifolds (of
dimension greater than three) within a given homotopy type. This project focuses
on splitting homotopy equivalences along a two-sided codimension-one
submanifold. The obstructions to this ideal situation are given by the
Waldhausen Nil-groups and the Cappell UNil-groups. Hence, from an algebraic
viewpoint, one theme of the project is the calculation and foundation of the
splitting obstruction groups in L-theory.

On the other hand, from a topological viewpoint, splitting is a special case of
the coarser decomposition into big, non-simply connected pieces. The principal
investigator proposes the use of these non-simply connected metablocks to study
the Four-dimensional Surgery Conjecture. These metablocks allow for the more
flexible notion of classifying space B<sub>F</sub>&Gamma; for families F of
small subgroups of &Gamma;. This approach would hybridize the techniques of
three isolated communities that have sprung up in the past 25 years: controlled
surgery, surgery on 4-manifolds with small fundamental group, and assembly maps
for families.

A manifold is a smooth shape, without any sharp edges or singularities. For
example, a one-dimensional manifold is a curve, and a two-dimensional manifold
is a surface. Three and four-dimensional manifolds occur in physics, such as
general relativity. Higher-dimensional manifolds occur in string theory and also
as configuration spaces for robot motion planning. The mathematical
classification of manifolds is fundamental to understanding both the global
structure of our universe and the hidden routes through which a closed physical
system is connected to itself.
