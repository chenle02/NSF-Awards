Existing 802.11n is inefficient whenever nodes with a different number of
antennas share the medium. This research aims to develop an advanced 802.11n
design that delivers as many concurrent transmissions as permitted by the MIMO
transmitter with the maximum number of antennas. Such a design delivers
performance gain while maintaining the fully distributed random access nature of
today's 802.11n, i.e., its ability to support bursty traffic, distributed
decisions, and ad hoc deployment. The research develops a novel carrier sense
mechanism that enables MIMO nodes to detect whether they can transmit in the
presence of an ongoing transmission without interfering with it. It then builds
on this mechanism to deliver a random access protocol where MIMO nodes contend
for both time and degrees of freedom, without any form of centralized
coordination. Finally, it implements its design and evaluates it in a wireless
testbed. By delivering a higher throughput for the same resource, this research
advances the design of MIMO 802.11 networks and the corresponding industry.
