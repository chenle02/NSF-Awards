It is proposed to address fundamental theoretical questions about the
generation of nonclassical optical fields, their interactions with matter, and
methods for conceptualizing and giving mathematical description to their
nonclassical properties. Here the electromagnetic field is viewed as an
essentially statistical quantity. The hope is to achieve a better understanding
of the conceptual and theoretical interface between the classical and quantum-
mechanical worlds. Areas of work will include (1) intracavity atom-field
interactions, (2) single-atom optical bi stability, (3) atomic interactions with
nonclassical light, and (4) the theory of nonlinear quantum dissipative systems
