This research, supported by a National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award, will continue the development of a non- linear analogue of the theory of
type and cotype by studying Markov chains in metric spaces. The research will
also study the 'reverse' geometric inequalities for solid bodies using methods
from harmonic analysis and probability theory. The National Science Foundation
Young Investigator award recognizes outstanding young faculty. This award
recognizes the recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as
a research mathematician and for significant development as a teacher and
academic leader.
