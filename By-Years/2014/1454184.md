Two endospore-forming bacterial strains (Clostridium botulinum and Bacillus
anthracis) are Category A bioterrorism agents. Their endospores are extremely
resistant to UV irradiation. This highly unusual UV resistance is ascribed to
the formation of a special DNA photo-lesion called the spore photoproduct (SP),
and the efficient repair of SP by the enzyme spore photoproduct lyase (SPL). The
pursuit of the reaction mechanism of SPL may allow the selective targeting of
the SP repair process to kill spore-forming bacteria via UV irradiation,
improving human health and national security. This pursuit will also permit
graduate, undergraduate, and high school students to acquire specialized
training in DNA photochemistry and mechanistic enzymology. Additionally, female
and underrepresented minority high school students will be targeted for enhanced
chemistry education by establishing the Hoosier High School Chemistry Olympiad
Training Camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Chemistry of Life
Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Lei Li from Indiana
University-Purdue University Indianapolis to establish the presence of a novel
radical transfer pathway in spore photoproduct lyase (SPL) and understand its
role in facilitating the regeneration of the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) cofactor
at the end of each catalytic cycle. Unnatural amino acids will be utilized to
help characterize the putative radical species along the pathway. Fluorescent
nucleotide analogs and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry will be
adopted to probe the respective DNA and protein conformational changes during
SPL catalysis. The proposed studies will provide the much-needed information to
reveal the requirements enabling SAM regeneration in SPL. As SAM regeneration is
indicated in many other enzymes in the so-called radical SAM superfamily (&gt;
56,000 members), the proposed studies are of great significance to our
understanding of not only SPL, but also the other enzymes in the superfamily.
