The S-STEM program, The High-Achievers Scholarship Program in Computer Science
and Mathematics, at Appalachian State University (ASU) increases the high
technology workforce and the number of Computer Science and Mathematic's
students pursuing graduate degrees by increasing educational opportunities for
economically disadvantaged students with the potential to succeed. The program
increases academic opportunities for students from the Appalachia region in
multiple ways, by improving the support infrastructure for all Computer Science
and Mathematics students, establishing connections with regional high technology
industry, providing leadership training opportunities, and engaging students in
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of this program include:
1) It enables on average 21 academically talented, financially disadvantaged
scholars per year to make progress toward gaining undergraduate or graduate
degrees in two STEM fields; 2) It includes a STEM seminar that initiates
community building, mentoring, and research activities, supplemented with value-
added components such as leadership workshops and mentoring relationships with
previous ASU S-STEM scholars who have graduated; 3) It supports scholar
participation in faculty mentored research projects and the dissemination of
results, including conference publications and
presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this program include:
1) Enhancing educational opportunities for disadvantaged students from the
Appalachian region; 2) Increasing student support services for all STEM students
at ASU; 3) Contributing to the economic development of the Appalachian region
and North Carolina through increasing STEM workforce capacity.
