This project permits undergraduate students in this institution's engineering
program to study digital design in a state-of-the-art environment. The
laboratory that supports this project consists of four digital design
workstations. Using these workstations, students are exposed to a broad range of
simulation capabilities, including standard component modeling, modeling using a
high-level language and physical modeling employing actual very large scale
integrated circuits. Using such computer-assisted tools, students obtain
practical exposure to complex digital design and analysis techniques. This award
is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
