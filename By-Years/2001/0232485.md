0232485&lt;br/&gt;Adhami&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is pleased to submit this grant proposal. The 2003
IEEE Radar Conference (RadarCon03), next in the long-running series of IEEE
national and international radar conferences, will be held in Huntsville,
Alabama from May 5 to May 8, 2003. The theme for the conference is "Radar --
Exploring the Universe" in keeping with expanding our vision to include ways
that radar technology can impact our society, planet Earth, our solar system,
and the universe in the 21st century through new, creative, and exciting
applications. RadarCon03 is co-sponsored by three sub-entities of the IEEE: the
Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society (AESS), IEEE Region 3, and the
Huntsville Section. The RadarCon03 organizing committee is continuing the highly
successful Student Paper Program. This proposal requests that the National
Science Foundation provide financial support in the amount of $5,000 for the
student paper program, specifically for students from U.S. institutions travel
expenses.&lt;br/&gt;
