Computer Graphics is a new discipline that has profoundly changed traditional
approaches to Engineering Design. This project will present Computer Graphics as
a new discipline in engineering curricula and as a significant new tool for
Engineering Design and Drafting. The format of the project is a Seminar/Workshop
with a group of 16 carefully selected participants during a three week period.
It will include presentations, discussions, demonstrations and other forms of
interaction between participants and faculty that are active in teaching and
research in the area of Engineering and Computer Graphics. The project will
attract, interest, and enlighten experienced and promising undergraduate
instructors teaching Engineering Graphics who need motivation, background, and
know-how to develop new Computer Graphics laboratories and to apply leading-edge
technology to the teaching of modern, computer aided design and drafting
(CADD)-based Engineering Graphics courses. It also promises to prepare
participants for and to help them in their efforts to introduce new courses in
Engineering Computer Graphics, and to motivate them to become self- reliant in
making and publishing their own contributions to this field of Engineering
Education. In addition to NSF support, participants will provide about 10% in
travel costs, and the University is contributing an additional 15%.
