This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will take the first steps
toward creating a long term working relationship between American and Thai
scholars studying the village-level impact of constitutional change and free
trade agreements in the Mekong trade zone of Northern Thailand. The latest
constitutional changes in Thailand have introduced important democratic reforms,
including decentralization of power. These changes, motivated in part by a
desire to control rampant government corruption, promote devolution of power to
local units of government. Devolution is intended to increase trust and
democratic participation. Inspiration for democratization and devolution is
partly international; the US constitution has provided one model but by no means
the only one. But as a philosophy guiding governmental organization and
participation, democracy plays a significantly different role in Thailand from
the US; as one scholar has put it, democracy is a philosophy of dissent, not a
philosophy of governance, and dissenting parties who advocate democratization
have tended to support oligarchy and patronage as a basis for governance once
they acquire power. The work proposed here will lead to the formation of a long-
term collaborative research relationship, articulation of a research plan, and
submission of a proposal to NSF for research funding.
