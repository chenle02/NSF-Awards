It is the aim of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research to fabricate optical
nanofibers and explore their use for optical sensing and imaging of surfaces.
The fibers are employed in two environmental modes: (1) the tips of cleaved
nanofibers are coated with metal films for examining their interaction with
aggressive environments through detection by internal reflectometry within the
fiber; (2) spectroscopy measurements are carried out with uncoated fiber tips to
sample small volumes of gases and liquids near reactive surfaces. In the first
mode, the optical fibers are used to conduct experiments inside an environmental
scanning electron microscope chamber in order to obtain concurrent surface
morphology and corrosion reaction rate measurements in a controlled atmosphere
(to 20 torr pressure). In the second mode of operation, the spectroscopic
detection of species near reactive surfaces is sensed in volumes whose size is
dependent on the diameter of the fiber and the wavelength of light. Reactive
surfaces themselves will be imaged to detect submicron heterogeneities and
defects. %%% This research has the potential to open new fields for optical
sensing and high resolution imaging. It may be possible as a result to follow
surface chemical interactions in difficult environments in situ in real time.
