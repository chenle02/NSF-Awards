Spatiotemporal data appears in many real-life applications (global change,
surveillance, transportation etc.) Together with regular attributes such data
contains topological as well as temporal attributes. This combination creates
novel interesting problems. Moreover, spatiotemporal data is usually presented
in "streams" which drastically affects the data processing methods. We propose
general exploratory techniques that will allow the user not only to verify
specific hyphotheses, but more importantly, to understand the underlying process
that controls the changes recorded in the spatiotemporal datasets. In
particular:&lt;br/&gt;1. We will first first address the problem of performing
on-line analysis on spatiotemporal streams. This part of the project will
provide the appropriate tools for the major effort of this proposal, i.e.,
understanding patterns of change.&lt;br/&gt;2. We will then address the problem
of understanding patterns of change in specific spatiotemporal applications,
namely: (i) epidemiological, (ii) environmental and (iii) surveillance
applications. In each application we will first define low-level analysis
primitives. Such primitives are simpler to identify in each application area. We
will then use combinations of such primitives to describe complex (high-level)
patterns of change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
