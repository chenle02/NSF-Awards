9304363 Banerjee This award provides funding for three years for the operation
and maintenance of the Institute for Rock Magnetism in the Department of Geology
and Geophysics at the University of Minnesota. The Institute was established in
1990 with funds from NSF, the W.M. Keck Foundation, and the University of
Minnesota. The Institute provides access to state-of-the-art instrumentation for
scientists engaged in research aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which
rocks become magnetized to reflect the ambient geomagnetic field. During the
last three years of its existence IRM facilities such as its high-field (5 T),
low-temperature (4 K) SQUID susceptometer and its magneto-optic Kerr effect
(MOKE) magnetic domain imager have been used by visitors in solving questions
about the composition, concentration, and grain-size of the magnetic carriers.
The Institute's policy of open access at no cost to qualifying scientists will
be continued during the tenure of this award. ***
