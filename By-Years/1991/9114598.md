Bosart proposes to continue his case study analyses of subsynoptic scale
midlatitude cyclones and fronts. Specifically, he proposes to complete a final
set of case studies using date from the GALE (1986) field experiment, to begin
collaborative research on the numerical prediction of coastal mesoscale weather
systems, and to participate in the STORM-FEST (1992) field experiment and the
post-experiment analysis phase. This experiment will produce data sets gathered
by next-generation observational systems (e.g. Profilers and Doppler radars).
Evaluation and systems testing of their capability to enhance operational
detection and forecasting of intense mesoscale weather events are among the
primary experimental objectives. In addition, there have been defined scientific
objectives for a set of frontal and mesoscale studies of cool-season weather
systems typical of the central US. Bosart's third line of proposed research is
focussed on this last set of objectives. He has contributed to the scientific
planning of the field experiment, by conducting background climatological
analyses and identifying specific research opportunities that should result. The
proposed work is expected to be a major contribution to STORM-FEST's scientific
objectives, based on Bosart's role in similar field experiments in the past. It
will augment the return from the significant investment in scientific resources
represented by the experiment.
