9709908 Sivaraman Description: This award supports the U.S.- India Cooperative
Research: Analysis of Kodikanal Solar Images, Award in U.S. and Indian Currency.
The collaborators are Robert Howard, National Solar Observatory, Tucson, Arizona
and K.R. Sivaraman, Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, India. The
researchers will use two unique data sets, the Kodaikanal and Mount Wilson
sunspot data. The Kodaikanal data go back to 1906. These data sets constitute a
particularly valuable set of fundamental data on solar surface motions. Using
the combined data, the investigators will study solar surface motions that are
important for answering many unsolved questions about the solar dynamo processes
within the sun. The use of complementary data will greatly improve the precision
with which to infer subsurface physical conditions related to the solar activity
cycle. Scope: This project supports a collaboration between two highly competent
solar astronomers and deals with a difficult but important scientific problem.
Solar astronomy is a field of Indian strength. This award supports the analysis
of data collected under a project previously supported by the Division of
International Programs (INT). The project is mutually beneficial and meets INT
criteria for support. ***
