9652599 Cane As natural habitats become increasingly isolated and fragmented,
species composition and abundance on these "islands' change. We presently lack
the biological information needed to predict which species will go extinct or
remain unaffected, and the influence that these changes have on other species
and their interactions in an ecosystem. This project examines whether common
features of life history and ecology of bee species can be used to predict their
persistence or extinction in habitat fragments of different sizes and degrees of
isolation. Most previous work in this area has been done with birds and mammals.
Bees are crucial pollinators in many plant communities. We focus on the bees
that visit creosote bush. No plant species attracts more bee species (120+) than
creosote bush. This bee fauna exhibits a diversity of ecological and life
history features. The plant dominates the southwestern deserts of the United
States; its 20,000 year advance with desertification is clearly documented by
the fossil record. These attributes together provide a model for other
communities that are less diverse, less understood, or more difficult to study.
Because of this shrub's broad distribution, the results of this habitat
fragmentation study for a desert basin in southern Arizona can be applied to
regional and subcontinental processes. Combined with its historic spread
throughout much of the western United States, the creosote bush and its bee
guild can be used as an exemplary model for ecosystem response to global change.
