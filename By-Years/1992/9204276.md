The research of Andreas Blass is in three areas: (1) combinatorial set theory,
particularly the study of cardinal characteristics of the continuum; (2) logic
of topoi, particularly connections between geometric morphisms of topoi, the
internal higher-order logic, and domains for denotational semantics; and (3)
game semantics for linear logic and related systems. Set theory provides the
popular way to lay the foundations for all of mathematics, the best known
systematic attempt to do this being Russell and Whitehead's Principia
Mathematica, dating from the early days of the 20th Century. Important
foundational questions concern the independence and the consistency of the
axioms used to establish set theory. Zermelo and Fraenkel's axioms (ZF for
short) are one of the most convenient sets of basic axioms. However, it has been
known since the work of Kurt Goedel in the 1930's that no axioms for set theory
can be complete as well as consistent. This means that no set of axioms can be
powerful enough to prove every possible proposition or else its negation, but
not both. Upon this startling theorem has been erected a rich theory, treating
possible propositions P such that either P or Not P can be added to ZF without
resulting in a contradiction. Any such proposition P is said to be independent
of ZF and can be taken as an additional axiom of set theory. The principal
technique for finding such independent propositions is Paul J. Cohen's so-called
method of forcing and its offspring. This is the circle of ideas involved in and
motivating a large part of the investigator's research.
