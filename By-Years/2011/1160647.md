This proposal is centered on new approaches to tackle problems concerning
analytic aspects of automorphic L-functions, and their intrinsic connnection to
various equidistribution problems in Number Theory, especially the quantitative
and effective results in the mass equidistribution properties of Hecke
eigenforms on arithmetic surfaces, as well as its higher dimensional
generalizations.

The equidistribution problems have their origin from mathematical physics and
quantum mechanics, and are well connected to other major areas in mathematics.
The rich interplay and interaction of ideas across different fields lie at the
heart of the current project. Because of these distinctive features the research
project proposed here are also ideal for training and engaging postdoctoral
researchers and Ph.D. students in a vibrant and important research area.
