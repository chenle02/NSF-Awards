This is an award to support conduct of a workshop/conference to assist in
structuring a program leading to an undergraduate degree in environmental
engineering that would prepare students for a productive role in professional
practice, provide opportunities for independent study, and prepare them for
graduate work. The workshop will be scheduled for a four-day period in the
summer of 1990 at the University of California's Arrowhead Conference Center.
The large growth in environmental issues has resulted in a demand for engineers
that is not now being adequately met. This is a result partially of the process
through which education in environmental engineering has evolved which, in
effect, requires students to obtain graduate degrees for entry-level positions.
This suggests a need to reconsider the process by which environmental engineers
are prepared for professional careers. Results of this workshop will provide
guidance in potential structuring of an environmental engineering program
including opportunities for conduct of research at institutions offering
primarily undergraduate degrees in engineering.
