The primary object of this research effort is the formulation of a theory of
sub-Doppler laser cooling that can be applied to a number of cases of
experimental interest. It is expected that considerable insight into laser
cooling can be gained by establishing a connection between the underlying
mechanisms responsible for both the very narrow resonances that can be observed
in nonlinear spectroscopy and laser cooling below the Doppler limit. It is hoped
that the theory will help to explain existing experimental data and will serve
as a guide for future experiments.
