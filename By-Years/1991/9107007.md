Black holes, compact stars and rapidly spinning stars,the structure of the
Universe, and quantum aspects of gravity will be studied analytically and
numerically. Important sources of gravity waves might include binarysystems of
two black holes that form in, say, galactic nuclei. Recently developed
techniques will be used to study the evolution and emission properties of such
binaries in order to assess their possible observational importance. Rapidly
rotating neutron stars will be studied, partly in order to understand better the
implications of rapid rotation for the behavior of nuclear matter. New
techniques will be employed to study the oscillations and stability of rapidly
rotating stellar models. Black-hole oscillations, another potentially important
gravity-wave source, will also be studied. Methods for estimating the
distribution of dark matter in galaxies will be used to assess the viability of
attempts to experimentally detect the dark matter locally. A variety ofanalytic
techniques will be employed to study how one correctly describes phenomena at
the fundamental quantum level in the presence of strong gravitational fields.
Particular emphasis will be placed on interactions of black holes with their
environment.
