This proposal describes a two-day conference on evolution education to be held
December 3 &amp; 4, 1992 at Louisiana State University. The purposes of the
conference include (a) the identification of areas of needed research on
evolution education, and (c) the development of a network of science educators
who have a keen interest in evolution education. The conference will include 10
scientists, 10 science educators and 10 high school and middle school biology
teachers, plus approximately 10 LSU faculty and graduate students. Professional
organizations (e.g., AAAS, NSTA, NABT, NARST) will be represented at the
conference with the intention of encouraging further debate on important issues
related to the learning of concepts important to an understanding of the overall
framework of evolution. The "products" of the conference will include, (a) 500
copies of proceedings to be distributed to organizations and individuals, (b)
video-taped highlights of the conference, (c) a network of individuals who will
communicate and work with conference participants, and (d) a summary of the
highlights of the conference to be published in a special issue of the Journal
of Research in Science Teaching devoted to evolution education research.
