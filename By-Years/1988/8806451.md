This project deals with the processing of high-temperature ceramic
superconducting material to overcome the current limitation of low current
density. The approach adopted is to produce selected solidification
microstructure that are free of grain boundaries or with grain boundaries or
phase boundaries aligned in the growth direction. The directional solidification
studies will be made using a) a laser heated floating zone apparatus, and b) a
high- temperature, high gradient directional solidification furnace. This work
will provide the fundamental basis of solidification to crystal growth of high-
temperature superconducting material.
