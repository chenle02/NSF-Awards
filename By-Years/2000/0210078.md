Charge depletion at semiconductor interfaces forms the foundation for modern
microelectronic devices. This award seeks to explore the analogy between charge
depletion in inorganic semiconductor devices and those based on conjugated
polymers. The central theme of the proposed work is the use of internally
compensated doped conjugated polymers to engineer charge depletion layers at
interfaces. Internally compensated polymers, unlike traditionally doped
conjugated polymers, do not contain any mobile counter-ions. In the presence of
mobile counter-ions, charge depletion layers cannot be supported and the
interfaces where they are most likely to be generated are not stable with
respect to redox reactions. The proposed work centers on polyacetylene ionomers
with a controlled density of functional groups and prepared by the ring-opening
metathesis copolymerization of functionalized cyclooctatetraenes. These
materials are to be used to conduct the first comprehensive study of charge
depletion at conjugated polymer interfaces as a function of dopant density and
to explore the possibility of all polymeric pn junctions. These studies will lay
the fundamental foundation for the design of a variety of devices based on doped
conjugated polymers.

As in the initial term of the project, new educational initiatives are proposed
to keep pace with the continued convergence of basic science and engineering. In
particular, continuing work on the development of summer undergraduate camps is
proposed. These camps continuing work on the development of summer undergraduate
camps is proposed. These camps (Chip Camp and Poly Camp) introduce chemistry
students to highly relevant topics in materials science that are often
overlooked in a traditional chemistry education.
