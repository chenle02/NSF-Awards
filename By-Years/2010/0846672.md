This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to
develop next-generation ultra-low-cost phased arrays for various applications
including radar, broadcasting, cellular communications, satellite
communications, and weather forecasting. The approach is to investigate an
innovative concept termed electronically steerable passive array radiator
(ESPAR) and develop BST varactors on organic
substrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed research is
expected to have a significant impact on the design of low-cost, simple yet
efficient phased array systems. The proposed novel BST varactor integration
technique will have a broad impact on a variety of applications which require
high-density integrated capacitors and varactors. Conformal designs of the
proposed ESPAR phased arrays help increase the function and reduce the power
consumption of wireless sensor nodes, with a significantly reduced
cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research will enable
next-generation ultra-low-cost phased arrays to be affordable in a variety of
applications. One important application that can take advantage of this
technology is automotive collision avoidance radar or adaptive cruise control
technology. Another application is in the rear seat entertainment and mobile
high-speed internet access. The ultra-low-cost phased arrays also help the much
wider deployment of inexpensive high-performance phased arrays for homeland
security to increase the communication success rate and save lives of personnel.
Biomedical and wireless sensor applications will also benefit from the ultra-
low-cost ESPAR phased arrays. The education plan includes a revitalization of
existing electromagnetics and microwave engineering curriculum, integration of
research and education, supervision of undergraduate research, outreach for K-12
and underrepresented groups, and university-industry collaborations.
