The April 22, 1991 earthquake in Costa Rica triggered widespread ground
failures: soil liquefaction and spreading; foundation failure of bridge
abutments due to soil liquefaction; and landslides. Liquefaction-induced ground
failures are poorly understood, and as a consequence, only crude criteria have
been developed for predicting their occurrence, and the destructive capability
of these events. This recent earthquake in Costa Rica provides an unexpected
opportunity to make detailed field observations and measurements, resulting in a
well-documented set of case histories. Such case histories aid in understanding
the ground failure process; they also provide benchmark events for verification
of analytical and empirical predictive models. The principal objective of this
research project is to make detailed topographic and ground displacement
measurements at several liquefaction-induced ground-failure sites in Costa Rica.
The ground surface effects to be measured are features that will soon disappear.
