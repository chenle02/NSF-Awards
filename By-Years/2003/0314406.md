This project investigates production, reproduction, and cooperation among the
Mardu, a hunter-gatherer society in the Western Desert of Australia. The
research focuses on the social and reproductive benefits men and women gain from
status as a good hunter or good seed collector, and the links these may have
with hunting and other cooperative behavior, asking why individuals often choose
to acquire food that goes to feed others, and why individuals cooperate in some
hunting and collecting tasks, but not others. The researchers will use
ethnographic interviews concerning social status, demography (household, marital
and reproductive, and grouping history, and observations on prey choice, time
allocation, food sharing, and cooperative hunting to understand how changes in
economy and mobility have changed Mardu resource selection, social status,
demography and marital patterns, food sharing, and cooperative labor over the
last 40 years. The broader impacts of the project include educational benefits
gained through training graduate and undergraduate students in field research
and analysis; and research benefits from data and models addressing current
debates and problems in social science, particularly the relationships between
gender differences in production, mating strategies, and collective action. The
results from this research will be relevant to collective action theory in
small-scale societies, and in understanding the role of acquired status (such as
that gained through hunting) in egalitarian society. In addition, this study
will provide the first detailed investigation of the social status of women
hunters in a foraging society.
