This action funds Hau Chan of Stony Brook University to conduct a research
project, entitled "Constructing social choice-based economic incentive for
identifying near-optimal social outcome," during the summer of 2012 at Nanyang
Technological University in Singapore. The host scientist is Ning Chen.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to facilitate the interaction
between game theory and computer science. This fusion allows researchers to
solve game-theoretical problems involving social choice using advanced computer
science techniques and algorithms more efficiently. The research seeks to
develop an economic system, with budget constraints, that produces a near-
optimal social outcome given the input of each individual in society.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
