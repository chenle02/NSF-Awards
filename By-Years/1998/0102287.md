With support of this planning grant, Russell Donnelly, Professor of Physics and
Director of the Cryogenic Helium Turbulence Laboratory at the University of
Oregon, Eugene, is developing a four-part television series on low-temperature
physics. Based on Tom Shachtman's 1999 book of the same title, the series will
explore the field's key concepts, the significant individuals and events in its
history, its impact on society through such technologies as air conditioning,
refrigeration and liquefied gases, and its promise for the future. Shachtman
will be the principal writer for the project, and Donnelly and Shachtman will
work closely with television producers Meredith Burch and Steve Lyons, formerly
a producer for NOVA. Barbara Flagg will conduct front-end evaluation during the
planning phase.

Activities to be conducted during the planning phase include:

Preliminary evaluation of audience knowledge Consultations and meetings with
advisors Development of detailed content outlines for the four programs
Exploration of means to enhance the impact of the project through ancillary
materials and outreach

Assessment will include an investigation of the potential for adapting the
content to other media such as design of a traveling exhibit, development of a
Spanish-language radio version, production of "mini-films' for use on children's
cable television, and publication of specialized print media.
