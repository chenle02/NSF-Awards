The focus of this research will be the development of the synthetic methodology
necessary to achieve the asymmetric total synthesis of the following
naturalproducts: (1) azomethine ylid dipolar cycloaddition reactions as applied
to the asymmetric total synthesis of spirotryprostatin A; (2) intramolecular
nitrone cycloadditions as applied to cylindrospermopsin; (3) Mannich-type
reactions to construct alpha, beta-diamino acids and application to the
asymmetric total synthesis of capreomycin 1B; (4) further development of peptide
isostere methodologies and application to the asymmetric total synthesis of
leuhistin; (5) lactone homologation methodology development as applied to the
asymmetric total synthesis of N-acetylneuraminic acid; (6) development of
stereoselective methods to construct peptide isosteres with three contiguous
stereogenic centers; (7) development of methodology to prepare alpha-alkyl-
isoserine derivatives; (8) development of novel intramolecular azomethine ylid
dipolar cycloaddition reactions for application to the asymmetric total
synthesis of palauamine; (9) diastereoselective aldol and lactone
functionalization methods for application to a short, asymmetric total synthesis
of quinine featuring a facially selective intramolecular SN2 cyclization
reaction.

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Robert M. Williams of the Department of Chemistry
at Colorado State University. Professor Williams will focus his work on the
asymmetric synthesis of complex, optically pure, densely functionalized amino
acids and amino acid derivatives. The methodology will be extended to the
preparation of natural products having interesting and important biological
properties. The research has broad impacts for the pharmaceutical industry and
for the training of graduate and postdoctoral students.
