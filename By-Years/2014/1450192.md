The GENI community has obtained significant value from the IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX)
infrastructure deployed at multiple campuses. Ongoing projects using the WiMAX
infrastructure include ones in public safety, the Mobility First Future Internet
Architecture project, a collaboration between Wayne State University and the
Ford Motor Corporation, and the Clemson Smart River project, to name a few.
However, with LTE technology becoming the 4G cellular standard, there is a need
to explore future wireless testbeds. This project will fund a workshop that will
provide community input into planning for possible next generation wireless
testbeds focused on wireless applications, and in particular concepts that are
being explored in the design of this infrastructure:&lt;br/&gt; - Streamlined
base station configurations that shift processing onto distributed cloud
computing resources, such as GENI racks, that are co-located with base
stations;&lt;br/&gt; - Ability to construct end-to-end "slices" that combine the
mobile and fixed network, computation, and storage resources required to provide
new and novel services; and&lt;br/&gt; - Simple, scalable wireless
infrastructure, ideally covering a few city-scale areas at high density and
providing direct access to the distributed cloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order
to ensure that workshop output includes the views and needs of other US
Government organizations which are currently exploring the use of LTE and
commercial cellular technologies, the workshop will be held in Washington, DC.
Tentative dates include either late September 2014 or early November 2014.
Participants will include academics, corporate researchers, officials from
agencies of the US Government such as the Department of Defense, and cellular
operators.
