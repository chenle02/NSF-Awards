The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve clinical outcomes associated with
preeclampsia, a potentially life-threatening condition of pregnancy occurring in
the second trimester through the postpartum period. It annually affects 1 in 20
births, or 150,000 women in the U.S.A., with disadvantaged women experiencing a
2-3x increase in mortality. In the US preeclampia triples the cost of care for
pregnant women, costing an estimated $2+ B per year; globally it costs 70,000
lives annually. Currently there is no way of predicting the onset of this
condition. This project proposes software to predict onset to improve clinical
outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project will research and develop a predictive model with 80%+ accuracy
using machine learning to detect preeclampsia in the earliest stages by
gathering patient-provided clinical data to inform a novel algorithm. It can be
used from earliest detection through the postpartum recovery period and can
provide models and alerts to both clinicians and
patients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
