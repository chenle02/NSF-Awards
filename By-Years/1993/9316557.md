9316557 Kirk This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Kirk's
Postdoctoral Reseaerch Fellowship in Chemistry. The main thrust of the research
is a combined experimental and theoretical study of oxygen transfer by Group VI
metals in both biological and inorganic systems. A combined spectroscopic
approach utilizing variable-temperature, variable-field magnetic circular
dichroism, single crystal polarized absorption, and resonance Raman
spectroscopies will probe the Mo(V) state of xanthine oxidase catalytic
intermediates. These enzyme studies will be complemented by parallel
investigations of relevant model compounds which display structural features
believed to be present at the enzyme active site. Excited state spectral studies
will be used in order to evaluate the results of detailed bonding calculations
including self-consistent field scattered wave calculations, transition-state
calculations, and density functional methods incorporating Slater or Gaussian-
type basis functions. %%% Group VI metals, specifically molybdenum and tungsten
are catalytically active towards oxygen transfer in both enzymatic and inorganic
systems. These studies will provide a wealth of information concerning the mode
of substrate binding to the metal and will directly probe the initial steps in
oxo transfer from metal to substrate. ***
