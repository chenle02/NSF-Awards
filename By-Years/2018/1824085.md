Title: Examining Case Outcomes in Housing
Court&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eviction can have
devastating economic, psychological, and social consequences for tenants. Yet,
many tenants facing eviction choose not to attend their hearing in Housing
Court, resulting in automatic loss of their case and a much greater likelihood
of being evicted. This occurs in part because many tenants are unaware of their
judicial options. This project will study whether providing tenants facing
eviction with timely informational reminders can overcome the barriers that keep
tenants from attending their hearing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will
explore the role of information in the judicial process of eviction, a context
in which the problems of informational asymmetry and litigant confusion about
tenants' legal rights are particularly pronounced. To do so, this project will
measure the influence of time pressures and information on tenants facing
eviction in Housing Court, by providing randomly assigned tenants facing
eviction with a self-help mailer that links to a website containing accessible,
actionable information. Case outcomes of those in the treatment group receiving
the information will be compared against those of the control group. In this
mixed methods study, quantitative data will be collected and qualitative
interviews will be conducted. Outcomes examined will include whether tenants in
the treatment group are more likely to show up to hearings, to file an answer-
type document, and to settle before trial, and whether tenants in the treatment
group are less likely to be evicted and to have a subsequent eviction action
filed against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
