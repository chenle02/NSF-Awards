Many of today's data-intensive application domains, including searches on social
networks and module searches in biological pathways, require complex queries on
large graph datasets. Their highly connected nature means graph operations tend
to "crawl" across many links, resulting in very large memory footprints that
strain resources on today's commodity servers. In addition, current application
platforms lack abstractions for graph operations, leaving developers to
implement a variety of complex standalone graph query components. The PIs of the
UCSB Massive Graphs In Clusters (MAGIC) project are developing a scalable
infrastructure to provide high level abstractions for graph primitives,
simplifying design of complex queries while addressing difficult challenges of
maximizing data parallelism and adaptive graph partitioning across clusters.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances from this project will include data partitioning
techniques, novel primitives for graph operations, and a software infrastructure
that together expand the applicability of scalable cluster infrastructures such
as MapReduce and Dryad to graph-oriented queries in social networks and
biological graphs.
