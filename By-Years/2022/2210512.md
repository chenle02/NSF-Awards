The Vermont State Committee, through a statewide, competitive, open call and
review process, selected the research theme centered around the “Study of
Online, Collective Knowledge, and Stories” (SOCKS) as best positioned to support
the growing technology sector and move forward the RII Track-1 proposal. SOCKS
is focusing in the topic of Computational Social Sciences which is properly
aligned with the Vermont's Science and Technology Plan. The planning grant
proposal offers an optimal opportunity to achieve the goals set forth by
Vermont’s State Committee. A series of workshops in team science and broader
impacts including an "all-hands" meeting that includes the participation of
experts in the area as well as diversity of attendees will serve to explore
ideas for the full proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
