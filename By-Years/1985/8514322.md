The current work studies the role of promoter materials with carbon monoxide-
hydrogen reactions. This work will also be extended to include bimetallic
clusters, support and dispersion effects. An infrared cell is used that permits
simultaneous infrared and kinetic measurements; simultaneous infrared,
temperature-programmed desorption; and temperature-programmed reaction studies,
surface composition measurements from experimental extinction coefficients, and
surface concentrations of catalytically active species under ;itin situ;ro
conditions.
