Zhu This project is a study of processor allocation and task scheduling for
mesh-connected multicomputers. Parallel applications submitted to a mesh system
need to be gang-scheduled on dedicated processors, which may be required to form
a special structure, such as a submesh. This project is investigating both
theoretical and practical aspects of mesh allocation and scheduling, using a
three-phase approach. The three phases are: 1. to develop strategies for
generalized processor allocation to satisfy various application specifications;
2. to devise and evaluate scheduling algorithms by adopting two- and three-
dimensional packing heuristics; and 3. to apply the algorithms to practical
systems.
