The development of optical means of computing depends upon the viability of
having materials and fibers which can interact in a useful manner with
lightwaves. Such functions as would serve to compute in various ways depends
upon not only this but equally important a nonlinear interaction. This implies
that the opÃ•ical beam emitted from the material or from the fiber is not simply
proportional to the strength of the beam at the input of the material or the
fiber. Of particular interest are those materials which allow an interaction
between optical beams without visible sign of other consequ>nces such as
electronic current flow. The present(proposal deals with such interactions and
their potential applications to various types of optical signal processing
schemes.
