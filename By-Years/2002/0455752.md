This research study involves collaboration between researchers at the University
of Maryland, College Park and Bowie State University, an HBCU, to examine a
multi-component pre-service model for preparing minority students to teach upper
elementary and middle level science. The treatment consists of (1) focused
recruitment efforts by the collaborating universities; (2) a pre-service science
content course emphasizing inquiry and the mathematics of data management; (3)
an internship in an after school program serving minority students; (4) field
placements in Prince Georges County minority-serving professional development
schools; and (5) mentoring support during the induction year. The research
agenda will examine each aspect of the intervention using quantitative and
qualitative methods and a small number of case studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
