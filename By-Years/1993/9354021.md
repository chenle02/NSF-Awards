9354021 Moloney A one week workshop is being offered at the Rose-Hulman
Institute of Technology in the summer of 1994 to disseminate knowledge and
expertise developed in the introductory physics laboratory at Rose-Hulman during
a recent NSF grant.The workshop involves eight to ten computer-interfaced
introductory physics experiments, software demonstrations, and discussions of
interfacing hardware. In the evenings each participant builds a versatile PC
interface box with A/D converter, instrumentation amplifier, strain gauge, and
magnetic field detector. Comprehensive software packages have been developed at
Rose-Hulman for all interface hardware. Participants get an overview of these
packages, and a look at recently developed classroom and demonstration software.
All of the source code for this software is provided to the participants.A $500
commitment is asked of each participant's institution for the purchase of
physics laboratory interface equipment. One potential gain is the 'recycling' of
older PCs to the physics laboratory where even 8088 machines can still be
useful. ***
