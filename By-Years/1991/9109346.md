This project is for Phase I of upgrades to the Structural and Geotechnical
Research laboratories at the University of Washington. The total cost is being
co-shared by NSF and University of Washington resources. The project covers two
parallel undertakings. Renovating the shaking table will enhance its performance
so that it is suitable for both structural and geotechnical work. The remainder
of the funds will provide a set of modular steel beams and columns with which to
construct demountable test rigs for use on the tie-down test floor. Upon
completion of the upgrading under this equipment grant, research teams
comprising faculty from two universities (University of Washington and
Washington State University) will be able to conduct experimental work on
structural and geotechnical systems and components. The study of structural
control of buildings under passive, active, and hybrid systems will also be
conducted to test the capacity of civil structures to sustain seismic loadings.
