9214087 Perger This award supports Professor Warren F. Perger of Michigan
Technological University for collaborative research in physics with Professor
Dirk Trautmann of the Institute of Theoretical Physics of the University of
Basel, Switzerland. The objective of their joint research is to accurately
calculate the relativistic ionization form factor. Their research plan
effectively exploits their complementary expertise. They will work with data
produced by the experimental group at Basel, testing a computer program
developed by Professor Trautmann, and using atomic continuum wave functions
generated by a program written by Professor Beers. This will give Professor
Beers valuable experience in applying his computational expertise to a realistic
atomic physics problem. The nature of relativistic effects on ionization cross-
sections is not well understood. Detailed knowledge of the ionization cross
section, which can be obtained from the ionization form factor, is of great
importance in many applications of atomic collision theory to plasma physics and
in studies of the physics of stellar atmospheres. ***
