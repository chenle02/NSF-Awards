Antarctic clouds constitute an important parameter of the surface radiation
budget and thus play a significant role in Antarctic climate and climate change.
The variability in, and long term trends of, cloud optical and microphysical
properties are therefore fundamental in parameterizing the mixed phase (water-
snow-ice) coastal Antarctic stratiform clouds experienced around the
continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a spectoradiometer that covers the
wavelength range of 350 to 2200nm, the downwelled spectral irradiance at the
earth surface (Ross Island) will be used to retrieve the optical depth,
thermodynamic phase, liquid water droplet effective radius, and ice-cloud
effective particle size of overhead clouds, at hourly intervals and for an
austral summer season (Oct-March). Based on the very limited data sets that
exist for the maritime Antarctic, expectations are that Ross Island (Lat 78 S)
should exhibit clouds with:&lt;br/&gt;a) An abundance of supercooled liquid
water, and related mixed-phase cloud processes&lt;br/&gt;b) Cloud nucleation
from year round biogenic and oceanic sources, in an otherwise pristine
environment&lt;br/&gt;c) Simple cloud geometries of predominantly stratiform
cloud decks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased understanding of the cloud properties
in the region of the main USAP base, McMurdo station is also relevant to
operational weather forecasting relevant to aviation. A range of educational and
outreach activities are associate with the project, including provision of
workshops for high school teachers will be carried out.
