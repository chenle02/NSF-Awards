The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is wide
reaching. It can potentially change the way drug discovery research is
conducted, improve clinical diagnostic analysis, improve the monitoring of
drinking water and waste water, as well as improve the monitoring of
food/beverage supply chains. This photonic sensor technology is a platform for
detecting many different types of chemicals and bio-agents. Modifying the
surface readily makes a sensor specialized for each chemical or biomolecule. The
cost of the sensor is low when mass-produced, yet the sensor boasts extremely
high sensitivity compared to other, competing sensing methods.

This I-Corps project is based on whispering gallery mode (WGM) sensor
technology. The WGM sensor's sensitivity exceeds that the current state-of-the-
art sensing methods such as surface plasmon resonance provides among different
label-free detection techniques. Existing designs of the WGM instrument
typically require a bulky alignment mechanism. The recent development of WGM dip
sensor with a pre-assembled sensor head has streamlined the sensor design into
essentially a thin, single-ended fiber device, and eliminated the need of
alignment. The I-Corps project may lead to a new design of the sensor and the
supporting instrument, a new architecture of the sensing method, and other areas
of application.
