This research will focus on the application of artificial neural systems to
decision problems involving pattern recognition, prediction and optimization;
the design of adaptive neural algorithms for these problems; and the application
of common operations research tools to the study of artificial neural networks.
Neural networks are being applied to problems from the operations research
domain, and this research is involved in the use of network and routing
problems. In addition, mathematical programming will be applied to the design
and modification of neural networks for decision problems involving pattern
recognition and prediction. Additional research will utilize concepts concerning
adaptive supervised and unsupervised neural networks and how to select,
construct, and train them. The use of neural networks in the area of tool wear
monitoring and prediction, product demand prediction, and quantification of
human driving comfort will be investigated.
