The language and ideas of dynamical systems theory that have been developed over
the last century have become ubiquitous in the applied sciences. While the
analytic language of differential equations and maps is still the basis for most
quantitative descriptions of scientific ideas, current scientific results are
often obtained based on models which are not derived from first principles, for
which many of the essential parameters have not been measured, and which often
involve stochastic terms. The key objective of this project is to develop
scalable computational techniques to provide correct robust information about
global dynamics over large ranges of parameter values. Bifurcation theory
implies that the cost for robustness is a coarse description. However, the fact
that scientists and engineers are using numerical simulations of
phenomenologically derived models to further their understanding of dynamic
processes indicates that the information these techniques provide must be both
quantitative and qualitative. Since the study of systems over broad ranges of
possible parameter values produces considerable information, to be of practical
use these methods must organize this information in an efficient, queriable
manner. We expect the work proposed in this project will produce (1) reliable
computational tools for global decompositions of dynamical systems by
constructing a database in which the global dynamics is encoded in combinatorial
and algebraic structures and (2) efficient methods for querying the database to
identify dynamical structures and bifurcations of interest.

This work will address the fundamental question of determining global
decompositions of dynamical systems over varying parameters. The global dynamics
is stored in the form of a database based on calculations for deterministic
systems, but within the framework of these computations we will also explore how
to predict the effects of noise on the observable dynamical behavior. These
computational techniques will be tested on and applied to a variety of problems
from mathematical biology. The biological models which will be considered are
used to address central questions in biology including the role of the spatial
environment in ecology and evolution and the robustness of the dynamics of
signal transduction/gene regulatory networks. These activities will produce
computational tools for global decompositions of dynamical systems, which will
be made available to scientists and engineers for potential applications in a
wide variety of disciplines.
