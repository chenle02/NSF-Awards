The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory/Latino Initiative Program (SAO/LIP)
offers year-long internship opportunities to undergraduate students belonging to
minority groups. The students are enrolled at local campuses of the University
of Massachusetts (primarily UMass/Lowell). Each intern is paired with a
scientific advisor; they work together on a research project in which the
student has expressed interest. Students are also given training in programming,
public speaking, and professional development. Peer mentors are also available
for support. The students present the results of their work at national
conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students are exposed to a wide range of
outreach activities, including a job fair for people with disabilities and panel
discussions on women and minorities in science. One of the most important
broader impacts of the project is the year-long exposure not only of the
students to SAO researchers but also vice versa.
