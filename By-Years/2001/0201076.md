ABSTRACT

Compact Value Functions for Value-Based Control of Distributed Systems

This project will extend the P1's work on a previous NSF grant on intelligent
control for distributed systems. That previous grant started from recent results
in value-based intelligent control, sometimes called approximate dynamic
programming (ADP) or reinforcement learning (RL). Older forms of control
typically guarantee stability, under certain theoretical assumptions, but do not
focus on optimal performance. The new methods focus on optimal performance,
without assuming linearity or perfect knowledge of system dynamics. By using new
model-based versions of ADP or RI, and by developing value approximation schemes
suitable for distributed systems, he was able to demonstrate new levels of
performance in test problems in distributed tasks such as fluid flow control and
missile interception. The new project is intended to be the first stage in
addressing larger and more general distributed control problems, such as
manufacturing processes, job scheduling, network traffic, etc. The first stage
will be to explore more powerful value approximation schemes, in order to
enhance the ability to control systems governed by partial differential
equations, such as fluid flows encountered in aerospace, plasma and industrial
applications, to the extent possible in a small-scale exploratory effort.
