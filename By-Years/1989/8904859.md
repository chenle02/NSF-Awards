In FY 1989-1990 this project will support a structured, first-cut assessment of
prior experience with projection of supply and demand for scientists and
engineers. A computerized literature search will be used to identify econometric
and other projection studies of science/engineering labor markets. The project
will assess the accuracy of past projections, reasons for error, how projections
have varied and why, and lessons for future model building. Accounts will be
given by field, degree, race/ethnicity, gender, and handicapped status to the
extent that these have been taken up in earlier studies and that subsequent data
for evaluation exist. This is the third of a series of structured literature
reviews and assessments planned by the Employment Studies Group to provide a
comprehensive assessment of what existing evidence says about the various
factors that determine the supply and demand of scientists and engineers.
Results will improve understanding of the science and engineering labor market
pipeline and operation, identify gaps in evidence, and inform further research
relevant to science and engineering personnel decision-makers.
