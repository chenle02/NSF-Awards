Problems in the interface of statistics, mathematics and computational science
will be studied, focusing on Fourier approximation and ridge estimation of
regression and density functions and, in a separate context, on filtered
Dirichlet distributions for local smoothing. In particular, preference orders
will be studied for the frequency weights in multiple Fourier expansions and for
the connection weights in single hidden-layer neural networks. Properties will
be derived and applications such as feature extraction and projection pursuit
will be considered in detail. This research will aid in automated learning from
large data sets such as those arising in robotics, medicine and artificial
intelligence. One aspect of the work will develop sophisticated mathematical
techniques for application to problems in statistics and electrical engineering.
A second aspect of the work will develop statistical methods to utilize an
expert's knowledge directly without restricting the form in which the expert
must express this information.
