Many of the environmental problems facing the world today involve inorganic
contaminants (heavy metals, acid rain, acid mine drainage, agricultural
pollutants). Undergraduate instruction in environmental science must provide a
means for investigating these problems. The use of an automated ion analyzer in
environmental laboratory courses and in student research projects enables
students to pursue questions that they were unable to investigate with previous
analytical techniques. The LACHAT flow injection automated ion analyzer has the
capability to analyze samples from different media for both cations and anions,
and is expandable to meet the needs of student research interests. The equipment
is widely used in the private and public sectors and provides students with
important training on equipment they will likely encounter upon graduation. In
addition, the quantity and quality of student research projects is improving,
with timely studies of environmental problems appropriate to the college setting
in Pennsylvania. The students have access to agriculturally and industrially
impacted streams, lakes receiving acidic deposition and excess nutrient loading,
and acidic mine drainage sites. The increase in research opportunities for
students can help them in their postgraduation plans, whether they be in
environmentally related employment, or in graduate programs.
