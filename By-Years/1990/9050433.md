This proposal makes the nuclear physics laboratory of WKU more functional by
augmenting the currently available equipment so that (a) the nuclear physics
laboratory is becoming a nuclear science laboratory; (b) students are being
taught not only principles, but current methodology; and (c) undergraduate
students are be involved in meaningful, productive and publishable research. //
