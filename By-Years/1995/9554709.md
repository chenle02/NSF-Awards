This project is holding summer workshops to introduce college mathematics
instructors to the reform of business calculus using materials developed by the
NSF Harvard Calculus Consortium. The workshops feature the use of graphing
calculators and computers, visits by professors from business, alternative
pedagogies such as group learning, and concrete lessons and strategies for
participants to take home. While the reform of engineering calculus for
scientists and engineers is making considerable progress, the traditional
business calculus has not gotten the same attention. A regional consortium of
faculty teaching these materials is being formed to help enhance the teaching of
busiless calculus throughout the area. Follow-up activities are occurring at
sectional MAA meetings. Two-year college faculty from Truckee Meadows Community
College are involved with the teaching and organizing of the workshops.
