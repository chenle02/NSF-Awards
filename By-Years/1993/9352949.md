9352949 Lipner University of California at Berkeley seeks to intimate a 4-week,
commuter Young Scholars project in mathematics with science related activities
for forty students entering grade 7. The project targets students from groups
that have been traditionally under-represented in the fields of science and
mathematics. In addition to structured classroom lectures and laboratory
activities, the program provides for role models and mentors, visitation to
research-oriented science centers, and participatory in research activities.
