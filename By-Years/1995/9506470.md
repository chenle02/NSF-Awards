9506470 Burgmann This project will characterize the important vertical motions
associated with the San Andreas transform fault system in the San Francisco Bay
area. Current estimates of the amount of shortening and uplift associated with
the fault in the San Francisco Bay area vary by up to an order of magnitude. An
integrated study of fission track, geomorphic, geodetic and fault system
modeling analysis will quantify the intense recent contraction and uplift. The
data will be used to assess the importance of zones of intense vertical motions
along faults and will be used to calibrate qualitative geomorphic indicators of
uplift and fault movement with quantitative uplift magnitudes derived from
fission track data and measured historic uplift patterns. The results will be of
importance to all tectonically active regions of the world.
