This research and teaching program involves the investigation of the
relationships between information technology (IT) investments and organizational
practices and the implications of these relationships for organizational
performance. Drawing on prior work on the economics of organizations and the
economic theory of production, formal empirical models are developed that
identify specific sets of work practices and organizational structures that are
complementary to IT investments. These models are then tested by combining
existing secondary data sources with an extensive program of data collection on
work organization, workforce characteristics and organizational structure from
individual firms. The results of this program will enable managers and
technologists to identify the appropriate organizational changes that should
accompany the implementation of computer systems, improve the general
understanding of how information technology influences economic performance, and
inform teaching of information technology management.
