Abstract ATM-9526663 Roger A. Pielke and Steven V. Finley Colorado State
University UNIDATA: Internet Data Distribution Fail-Over, Relay, and Archive
Site at Colorado State University. Funding will enable the Atmospheric Science
Department at Colorado State University (CSU) to participate in the Internet
Data Distribution (IDD) system, while continuing to receive data via the KU-band
system. The requested equipment will enable CSU to streamline data archive and
retrieval. This equipment may enable CSU to become an IDD relay site.
