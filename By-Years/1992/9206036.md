This award will provide one-half the funds needed to acquire six computer
workstations and increase data storage space for the geophysics computer network
in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Purdue University. The
University is committed to providing the remaining funds required. The upgraded
computer system will be used in geophysical research projects ranging from
seismic tomography, inversion of wide-angle seismic data, study of the Earth's
gravity field, analysis of laboratory determinations of the elastic properties
of rocks, and numerical modeling of mantle convection processes.
