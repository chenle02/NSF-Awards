9411974 Hayden The Virginia Coast Reserve (VCR) is a dynamic, frequently
disturbed landscape. The types of ecosystem changes that normally occur across
large distances (continents, biomes) and over long periods of time (e.g. glacial
and interglacial periods) happen on decadal time-scales. As a result, ecosystem
state changes are frequent. The central research theme of the VCR LTER project
is the understanding of the transitions among ecosystem states and succession
within these states. Our approach will be to continue to study succession within
several of the more prominent states (Myrica thickets, forests and salt marshes)
and the response of these states to disturbance. The parameters measured are
those in the NSF-defined LTER network core areas. In addition, we have
implemented manipulative experiments by altering inundation patterns in marshes
and altering the availability of fresh water to terrestrial vegetation on a
barrier island. The products of the proposed work will be the development of a
new theoretical base for maintenance and structuring of landscape, further
elucidation of controls on ecosystem processes, and new ecosystem and landscape
modeling approaches.
