*** 9417857 Ke This award supports collaborative work between Hengming Ke,
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and Fan Haifu, Institute of Physics,
Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, on application of direct methods in
determination of macromolecular structure. The importance of the proposed
research lies in its potential contribution to fields of structural biology,
where the ability to determine macromolecular structures quickly and routinely
would be very valuable. Current methods are time-consuming and cumbersome, as
noted in the reviews. The two PIs bring complementary expertise to the research:
Ke has experience and expertise in the determination of protein structures and
Fan is a recognized authority in direct methods. Thus, the joint project brings
together two groups with specialization in different fields of crystallography.
Support on the Chinese side will be provided by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
