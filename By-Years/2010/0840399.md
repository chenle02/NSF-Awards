This project explores the impact of geographically distributed 3D tele-immersive
environments on dancers' creativity and their perception of themselves and each
other. More specifically, the project will study the impact of digital options,
such as scale and multiply, on the dancers' creative expression and
improvisation. A formal notation, called a creativity graph, will be derived
from a Laban movement analysis of the dancers' movement. A dancer develops a
creative dance, a new sequence of phrases, when he/she generates a new
association between two movement states (e.g. a new association between two
Laban positions) based on some feedback from the immersive environment due to
either invoking digital options or due to some unexpected performance of the
system. This project will have a fundamental impact on our understanding of
dancers' creativity within tele-immersive dancing environments and computing and
will contribute a new concept of transformational movement graphs as a
computational representation of dance creativity in distributed multi-site 3D
tele-immersive spaces.
