Dinoflagellates are extremely important components of marine phytoplankton.
They are motile, but relatively little is known about their swimming behavior or
the physics of it. This project has three main objectives that address
dinoflagellate swimming. (1) To obtain observations using a video-based
computer-assisted motion analysis system that will aid in the development of
swimming velocity models in response to light, temperature, salinity and
nutrient concentrations. (2) To examine the time course of the biological terms
in Stokes Law for dinoflagellates grown under a variety of environmental
conditions using a variety of techniques. (3) To expand a newly developed random
walk turbulence model to include a broader range of eddy diffusivity
coefficients; water column stratification; various phase relationships between
turbulence initiation and diel vertical migration; and various dinoflagellate
swimming characteristics. The models developed will be very useful in
understanding and predicting factors that account for the distribution of
dinoflagellates in the water column.
