0419982 Neil Euliano&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic Signal Processing and Information
Extraction for E-noses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I research project focuses on the development and
implementation of the next generation of e-nose signal processing and dynamic
pattern recognition systems, specifically tuned to the properties of odors. We
will also implement proof of concept experiments for creating an exhaled-breath
propofol detector for non-invasive monitoring of anesthetic blood
levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will be
to improve the current e-nose selectivity by at least an order of magnitude
better, thus removing the last impediment to wide spread use of e-nose
technology.&lt;br/&gt;
