9530894 Lagunas-Solar This Americas Program award will support travel and
related expenses for a short-term visit by Dr. Manuel Lagunas-Solar, University
of California, Davis, to develop a collaborative research project with Dr. Juan
A. Canumir Veas, University of Concepcion, Chillan, Chile. They plan to
investigate the effect of high-power monochromatic ultra violet (UV) radiation
to control microbial DNA in fresh produce. The main objectives of the project
are to study the basic photochemistry induced on the surface of fresh foods,
determine the effectiveness of the treatment under a variety of physical,
chemical and physiological conditions of the treated products, and to evaluate
the application of the new process to fresh vegetables. The chemically-based
technologies in use for the past fifty years to aid in the preservation of food
have been subject to criticism because of the increased health risks, and the
residues they leave on the environment, our food and our water. The researchers
propose to decrease dependence on chemicals for these purposes throughout the
use of non- additive physical technologies. ***
