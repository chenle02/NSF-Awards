940774 Sandhu This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
will develop higher sensitivity of liquid-crystal based ultrasound (acoustic)
detectors. Low sensitivity has been a factor limiting industrial applications of
acousto-optical displays as well as limiting medical applications. Phase I new
liquid crystal systems were studied and found to improve detection sensitivity
by one order of magnitude and more. Phase II development is expected to add
another one or two orders-of-magnitude improvement and to build a prototype
system for further investigations of medical and industrial applications, e.g.,
breast imaging for cancer detection and nondestructive inspection of industrial
materials.
