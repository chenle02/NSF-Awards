9509139 Keeler This research involves investigation of a series of unusual
populations of the tallgrass prarie grass Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem).
This work focuses on understanding the function, and genetic variation in
natural populations, specifically intraspecific polypoidy (additional copies of
the entire genome). %%% This study combines population biology and ecological
genetics in understanding ploidy variation, a significant challenge for
botanists. Such a study also has more immediate importance to conservation since
this species is part of a threatened ecosystem. ***
