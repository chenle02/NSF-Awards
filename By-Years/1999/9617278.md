This project focuses on some important statistical issues relating to the
problem of estimating regressions curves that are known or required to satisfy
certain constraints such as monotonicity, convexity, periodicity, or range
bounds. These constraints arise in a variety of social, economic, biometric, and
behavioral applications. Despite a vast amount of literature on function
estimation, few algorithms are available for incorporating constraints. This
project starts with a simple and effective method based on L1 optimization in
the space of B-splines. The asymptotic properties, modeling flexibility, and
computational complexity of the method are about the same as those of the
unconstrained problems. The investigator will extend work on the method to
include adaptive choice of dimension for the spline space, hypothesis testing on
constraints, handling of binary response, semiparametric models and multivariate
functions, and computation of properly ordered percentile curves. In addition to
the methodological research, a user-friendly software for constrained B-spline
smoothing will be developed through collaborations.
