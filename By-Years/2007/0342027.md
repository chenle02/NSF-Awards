The Colleges of Engineering and Education at North Dakota State University,
together&lt;br/&gt;with four North Dakota Tribal Colleges, partner to design a
program that bridges the&lt;br/&gt;pathways to engineering careers for American
Indian students in the Tribal Colleges&lt;br/&gt;and in high schools. Five
workshops for the partner faculty include presentations by&lt;br/&gt;nationally
known figures and discussion on authentic assessment, science
and&lt;br/&gt;engineering pedagogy, cultural integration in education, best
evaluation practices, and&lt;br/&gt;proposal development. At a summer camp,
faculty engage in free exchange of ideas&lt;br/&gt;while designing items for
evaluation. The items are experiential activities for middle and&lt;br/&gt;high
school students to work on during four Sunday Academies. They include
lesson&lt;br/&gt;materials, assessment strategies, demonstrations and
opportunities for additional&lt;br/&gt;studies. The long-term goal is to develop
proposals to continue the collaboration to&lt;br/&gt;provide opportunities to
attract and retain American Indian students in STEM&lt;br/&gt;disciplines.
