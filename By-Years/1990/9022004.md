The Pacific Exploratory MIssion-West (PEM-WEST) is an international program
aimed at understanding tropospheric ozone production and nitrogen oxide and
hydrocarbon pre-cursors downstream of a major anthropogenic source region. This
mission will be conducted in the western Pacific region during the summer/fall
of 1991. Both ground-based and aircraft platforms are expected to make important
scientific contributions. The longer temporal scale of the ground-based
measurements will complement the short term, greater areal coverage of the
aircraft measurements. The PI proposes to conduct measurements of NO and NOy at
one of the PEM-WEST intensive ground based stations for a period of six weeks.
These measurements are proposed to contribute to the overall mission objectives
to evaluate ozone photochemical production and loss rates as a function of
altitude and geographic position, to examine transport fluxes and identify Asian
source regions of advected ozone and ozone precursors, and to conduct model
studies of OH mixing ratios over the western Pacific from observations of O3,
CH4, CO, NOx, and NMHC.
