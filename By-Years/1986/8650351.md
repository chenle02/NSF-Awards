This project is designed to improve the quality of learning in several
undergraduate analytical chemistry courses at Delta State University, and to
increase significantly the number of relevant research projects available to
undergraduate chemistry students. These improvements are built around the
acquisition of a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC), a modern, highly
sensitive analytical instrument. Experience with the computer-controlled
instrument operation and data analysis will enable students in analytical
chemistry courses to perform better in local industry and in graduate study. New
experiments performed by students in the teaching laboratories include the
analysis of analgesic tablets, and analysis of plant material for chlorophyll
and carotene. HPLC will complement and expand several undergraduate research
projects, including those of local environmental significance. Specific research
topics are related to the composition of acid rain, analysis of soil and water
for pesticides, the fate of herbicides in the environment, and the isolation of
rare inorganic species.
