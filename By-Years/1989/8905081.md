This is a continuation of an ongoing project, and the overall goals of the
research are two: 1) to characterize the processes that control the subduction
of sediments; and 2) to characterize the time scales of magma differentiation in
island-arcs. This will be accomplished by determining the concentrations of
10Be, 9Be, 226Ra, 230Th, K, Ba, and Rb in about 50 island-arc volcanic rocks and
their phenocryst separates. 10Be will be measured by accelerator mass
spectrometry at the University of Pennsylvania. 9Be will be determined by
electron-capture detection gas chromatography at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, 226Ra and 230Th activities will be determined ba gamma- and alpha-
spectrometry at the University of Chicago, K, Ba, and Rb will be determined by
atomic absorption/emission flame photometry at the University of Chicago. ***//
