The AAAI Doctoral Consortium (DC) brings together established researchers and
mid-career Ph.D. students for a two-day workshop where students and faculty
interact in a range of settings to provide both formal and informal career and
research mentoring. As a means of encouraging young and upcoming researchers in
Artificial Intelligence, the AAAI Doctoral Consortium has been proven to be a
relatively inexpensive and extremely effective model. Many of the current
reviewers, mentors, organizers, and panelists were once student participants in
prior AAAI DCs.

The Intellectual Merit of the AAAI Doctoral Consortium lies in the unique
opportunity for junior researchers to gain high quality feedback on academic and
social issues relevant to their career, from senior researchers within their
community. As part of the DC program, mentors and students interact in meetings,
panels, working lunches, and during oral presentations and discussions. For many
students, this is the only opportunity to receive focused input from researchers
other than members of their dissertation committee at their home institution.
Students not only gain the experience of giving a talk on their thesis research
and receiving specific feedback on their work, they also are given the
opportunity to discuss more personal issues, such as balancing work and family
when pursuing a research career after completion of their Ph.D. studies.
