This research project is directed to exploring the possibilities of implementing
large parallel generic neural network architectures using both silicon devices
and optical technology. The underlying principle of the new architectures is to
take advantage of the fact that signal processing in silicon ins an advanced and
mature technology and to incorporate optics where silicon fails, namely, the
interconnectivity problem. These new architectures make possible the
construction of fully integrated, alterable networks with 1000 neurons using
existing technologies. The next important breakthrough will be to implement a
complete learning structure with local memory on a single device. Large, fully
parallel architectures that incorporate a simple learning algorithm are
delineated and their initial design specified.
