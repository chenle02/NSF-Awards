This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in Plant Biology.
The applicant received his Ph.D. from Michigan State University working on the
molecular biology of the photosynthetic membrane proteins in Synechocystis. He
plans to carry out his postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr.
Allan Bennett at the University of California at Davis. The proposed research
entitled "Analysis of the molecular mechanisms controlling guard cell function"
will broaden the applicant's scientific training into plant cell biology,
physiology and biochemistry. The applicant plans a 6 month foreign experience in
the laboratory of Dr. Goffeau at Universite Catholique de Louvain, in Belgium.
