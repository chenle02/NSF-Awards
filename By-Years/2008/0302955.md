Our Alabama Automotive Manufacturing Technology Institute (AAMTI) is serving as
a one-stop training facility for the current and evolving technician-level
workforce in the automotive manufacturing field, in response to Hyundai Motor
Company's recent decision to locate its first U.S. auto manufacturing plant in
Montgomery, Alabama. Several other automobile manufacturers such as Mercedes-
Benz/Daimler Chrysler (Vance, Alabama-70 miles from Montgomery), Honda
(assembles Odyssey minivans and engines in Lincoln, Alabama facility) and Toyota
(Huntsville V-8 engines assembly plant) have announced larger manufacturing
operations in Alabama during the past few years.

Our efforts have involved the development of an effective multi-sector
collaboration among Alabama's two-year colleges and the many players in the
State's burgeoning automotive industry, and have promoted shared goals,
processes and resources. We have fostered relationships with organizations and
model programs locally as well as nationally and have incorporated lessons
learned from their respective experiences to our local efforts in automotive
education. We have coordinated the development of an interdisciplinary
collaborate among our technology programs in automotive manufacturing technology
that meets both academic and industrial standards. This collaborative effort
will lead to the development of a regional ATE center proposal aimed at
developing a highly competent and responsive technology workforce in automotive
manufacturing technology.
