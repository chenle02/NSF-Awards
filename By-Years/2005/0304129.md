In this exploratory research proposal, building upon our vertically aligned
CNTs, we aim to achieve growth of horizontally aligned CNTs through Al2O3 nano-
porous template, where arrays of cylindrical nano-pores are horizontally aligned
on silicon substrate. The eventual goal is to achieve a one-dimensional (1-D)
array of CNTs horizontally aligned on substrate. There are two thrusts in this
research. In the first thrust, fabrication of horizontal arrays of cylindrical
pores by anodic oxidation of aluminum will be carried out through geometric and
electric field modulation. In the second thrust of research, growth of CNTs can
be carried out using the horizontally aligned nano-pores as templates and
eventually a 1-D array of CNTs horizontally aligned on silicon substrate can be
achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed work include
improvement of the capability for basic and applied research, enhancement of
multidisciplinary research, education and training of tomorrow scientists and
engineers in nanotechnology through focused graduate seminars, graduate
research, and focused education outreach. The research proposed here would lay a
foundation for carbon nanotube-based nano- electromechanical system (NEMS) that
integrates the carbon nanotube-based devices with microcircuits and carbon
nanotube-based nanoelectronic devices. The outcome of this research may lead to
revolutionary fabrication technology for transistors, molecular electronic
devices, and quantum devices.&lt;br/&gt;
