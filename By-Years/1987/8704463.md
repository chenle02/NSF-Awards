This research program will be concerned with a number of theoretical and
practical topics concerning boundary element methods for the solution of 3
dimensional elliptic problems. These topics include: 1. Galerkin and collocation
methods. 2. Mesh refinement and singular elements. 3. Conjugate gradient
methods. 4. Multigrid methods. 5. Domain substructuring. 6. Vector processing.
Efficient numerical methods along with more powerful computers will enable us to
solve more complex and realistic technical problems in science and engineering.
The results from the present research will give better algorithms for a large
class of practical problems.
