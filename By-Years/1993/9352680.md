9352680 Nyhof In support of developing an investigative approach to the
physiology laboratory, the equipment requested in this project will permit
students to systematically study physiological phenomena by forming hypotheses,
devising the means to test these hypotheses, systematically collecting the data,
and mathematically analyzing the data for critical evaluation. In addition,
students will experience a greater degree of hands-on experimentation in the
laboratory activities using the independent data acquisition stations. The
equipment request is for computers using versatile recording and analysis
software. To interface with the computers are signal amplifiers, force
transducers, and respiratory volume measuring equipment. Related laboratory
equipment will provide temperature regulation for isolated tissue and
capabilities to measure metabolic activity in different types of isolated
tissue. This equipment will provide the opportunity for students to develop
detailed investigations into many aspects of both human and animal physiology
using state-of-the-art laboratory equipment. The versatility of the equipment
will encourage student experimentation by greatly expanding the range of
techniques currently possible and will foster more systematic evaluation of the
data collected. ***
