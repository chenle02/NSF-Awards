9223092 Brown During an earthquake, a structure must be provided with some
lateral restraint by the foundation because of the horizontal accelerations
involved. For piles embedded in liquefaction-susceptible soils, this lateral
support requirement can dominate the design of the foundation. The objective of
this project is to evaluate the lateral soil resistance exerted on a deep
foundation during a strong earthquake which causes the cohesionless soil to
liquefy. The aim is to improve the understanding, and provide a better estimate,
of the lateral support provided by liquefied soil: currently the lateral
resistance of liquefied soil is completely neglected in design, leading to a
conservative and therefore more expensive building foundation. Preliminary
studies show that even small amounts of soil resistance result in a more
economic design. Therefore the lateral soil resistance -- although it is
expected to be low -- should be quantified and included in the design. This
research project includes a large-scale (nearly full scale) experimental study
under laboratory controlled conditions. It consists of a large sand-filled
liquefaction tank, in which the sand in liquefied, and an instrumented shaft is
accelerated horizontally to measure the lateral resistance of the liquefied
soil. This experiment does not attempt to model the complete pile behavior. The
complete lateral behavior is modeled numerically once the correct lateral soil
resistance in the liquefied zone is measured and understood. ***
