This award is for support of a project to investigate the mechanics acting at
the margins of Ice Stream B, Antarctica. An analysis of existing temperature
data near the center of the ice stream and of surface shear strain rate at its
margins indicates that strain heating in the margins should be easily measurable
in holes of 300 to 400 m depth. Temperature will be measured in a line of hot
water drilled holes bracketing one of the margins, and interpreted in terms of
strain heating, possible strain softening of the marginal ice, the shear stress
acting on the ice stream, the history of the ice stream, and the stability of
the margins. A secondary objective is to confirm the existence of diurnal
variation in the vertical straining of the ice, which was previously observed on
Ice Stream B.
