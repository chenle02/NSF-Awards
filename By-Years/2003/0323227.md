Organizational Mechanisms for Supply Chain Integration during Product and
Process Development

The recent trend toward large-scale outsourcing of product design and
development is creating a new business challenge: How can firms effectively
create and subsequently manage engineering knowledge exchange within supplier
networks in environments characterized by rapid technological change and global
competition? In particular, as U.S. firms outsource much of their design work, a
new concern arises, similar to that raised over two decades ago when imports
from Asia became common. Namely, how might U.S. firms organize themselves to
survive and prosper even as they "hollow out" by becoming integrators of the
work performed by overseas suppliers?

Some leading firms have approached the problem by developing a new management
and engineering position, the supply chain integrator, to maintain product
coherence from concept to customer across often-numerous and fluid firm
boundaries. Other firms have attempted to "modularize" their products so that
individual suppliers can design their components in relative isolation. Still
other firms have pursued integration mechanisms such as relying on industry-wide
standards. We propose to investigate supply chain coordination practices across
multiple industries that are chosen to have widely varying integration needs. We
focus on outsourcing during product and process development because integration
needs during development work are likely to be especially high. We ask the
following questions: (1) For those elements of product and process development
that are outsourced, which practices, novel and otherwise, are employed to
support integration across firm boundaries? (2) Does the relative frequency of
these mechanisms differ across industries? (3) What are these mechanisms'
perceived effectiveness? (4) For those firms that employ dedicated supply chain
integration personnel, are there particular skills that appear to make these
personnel more effective?
