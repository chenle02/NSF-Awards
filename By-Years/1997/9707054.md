9707054 Wendlandt This grant provides $48,962 as one-half support of the costs
of upgrading the Cameca MBX electron microprobe (EMP) at the Colorado School of
Mines with a PC-based automated instrument interface, a digital imaging system
for analyses of backscattered electron images and crystals permitting light
element analyses (i.e. Li, B). This upgrade is a significant improvement over
the current and original (vintage 1980) DEC PDP-11 based computer control
system, which is no longer supported by the manufacturer. PC-automation and
digital image analysis will benefit a variety research programs currently
utilizing the EMP for quantitative geochemical analysis including studies of the
petrogenesis of continental rift volcanics, elucidation of the driving forces
behind dolomitization of reef carbonates, studies of the phase equilibria of
carbonate systems, and metallurgical studies. Furthermore, this upgrade will
provide students with training on software packages that are the current
standard at larger research institutions and laboratories. ***
