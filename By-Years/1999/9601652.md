This project will develop a field-deployable instrument system for
characterizing lightning discharges in thunderstorms. Different U.S. research
sites have an increasing need for such an instrument, and the system would bring
together several techniques which have successfully been used to study lightning
and thunderstorms. The system will determine the three-dimensional structure and
development of lightning within a storm, both of individual lightning discharges
and of the overall sequence of lightning activity. This is to be done using (1)
a time-of-arrival (TOA) system for locating the sources of radio frequency
radiation from the lightning discharges, revealing the structure and development
of the lightning channels, and (2) time-resolved electric field change
measurements, indicating the amounts of charge transfer along the channels, and
therefore the strength of the discharge. Additional measurements of the
atmospheric electrostatic field will characterize the overall electrical state
of the parent thunderstorm.
