0213441&lt;br/&gt;Herrero-Bervera&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding from this grant
supports the acquisition of equipment to measure fundamental magnetic properties
of rocks. Specifically, a Variable Field Translation Balance will be purchased
to allow for the determination of magnetic grain sizes and thermal parameters
(Curie points) to help screen desirable and undesirable magnetic materials in
paleomagnetic projects conducted at the University of Hawaii, Paleomagnetics and
Petrofabrics laboratory. Research that will benefit from the new instrument
centers on high-resolution examination of records of the earth's magnetic field
behavior including records of secular variation, polarity transitions and
intensity variations.&lt;br/&gt;
