In this research project within the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, Jack R. Norton of Colorado State University will develop
methods for determining the mechanisms of reactions of transition metal hydrides
which are a common class of organometallic compounds. These hydridic compounds
are important intermediates in many catalytic processes such as the OXO-process
in which aldehydes and alcohols are made from olefins and also in the
hydrogenation and isomerization of olefins. Specific projects include developing
methods for measuring the acidity of the metal hydrides which are weak acids;
measuring absolute rate constants for hydrogen atom transfer from a variety of
transition metal hydrides to trityl radicals; determining the strengths of
hydrogen-transition metal bonds; developing a stereospecific synthesis of alpha-
amino acids from coordinated aldimines; and investigating the possible hydride
transfer reaction from the metal hydride to protonated aldehydes and ketones.
