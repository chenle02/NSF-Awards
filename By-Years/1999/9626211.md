The investigator and his colleague use the technique of shadowing to devise
rigorous computational methods for chaotic dynamical systems. In particular,
they develop algorithms for the determination of periodic orbits and their
Lyapunov exponents. Given the significant role the stable and unstable manifolds
of periodic orbits play in determining the global dynamics, a method to compute
these manifolds reliably is developed. Moreover, they develop a method of
establishing chaotic behavior just from finite computed orbits and an algorithm
for measuring sensitivity to initial data, which is the hallmark of chaos. All
the computational algorithms are developed in the context of autonomous ordinary
differential equations. Despite the recent major advances in dynamical systems
theory, analysis of specific equations arising in applications must still
largely rely on numerical computations. Therefore, it is important to devise
computational techniques whose reliability can be verified. Indispensability of
rigor is particularly acute in the numerical studies of chaotic systems, which
naturally amplify even small computational errors. Chaotic systems possess, in
the mist of bewildering complexity, many unstable periodic orbits. The main goal
of the project is to develop computational methods for locating such periodic
orbits and their associated structures. Periodic orbits of chaotic systems,
although unstable, are of practical significance in, for example, designing
flight paths for spacecraft. The investigators are beginning to cooperate with
Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists on efficient and reliable computations of
suitable paths.
