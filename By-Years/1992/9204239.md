This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics research by a group
at the University of Cincinnati in collaboration with other NSF and DOE
supported scientists. The group will study quark and lepton interactions in a
series of experiments at Stanford, Fermilab, and other accelerator laboratories.
These studies have the potential for unique measurements in both electroweak and
heavy quark physics.
