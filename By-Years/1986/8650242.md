The objective of this project is to enhance the preparation of undergraduate
chemistry and other science majors at Bradley University by incorporating the
use of a 60-MHz NMR into the chemistry laboratories associated with a number of
courses. This instrument replaces and upgrades an obsolete NMR with limited
capabilities, allows the introduction of new experiments which illustrate
principles discussed in lectures, and expands and updates students' laboratory
experience to include new techniques and experimental capabilities. The
anticipated outcome of this project is the upgrading and updating of laboratory
courses in organic, analytical and physical chemistry, as well as the
enhancement of independent study projects. The NMR will enable students to
understand better the principles and practice of instrumental chemical analysis
and determination of molecular structure.
