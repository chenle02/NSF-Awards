The Center for Behavioral Neuroscience (CBN) is an NSF Science and Technology
Center with eight participating Atlanta-area institutions: Clark-Atlanta
University, Emory University, Georgia State University, Georgia Institute of
Technology, Morehouse College, Morehouse School of Medicine, Morris Brown
College, and Spelman College. These eight institutions have partnered to
investigate those brain mechanisms that are responsible for social behaviors
(e.g. fear, aggression, and reproduction) and to develop programs that expose
students at all levels to the latest findings and career opportunities in the
sciences. Funding from the NSF-REU program will allow participants to enjoy the
opportunity to partake in an inter-institutional, interdisciplinary research
environment. For ten summer weeks, ten undergraduate students will engage in
research focused on topics including fear, reproduction and aggression. In
addition, students will participate in weekly ethics and career seminars, a
poster session coordinated in conjunction with the Emory's Howard Hughes summer
research program, biweekly journal clubs and methods course, and professional
development training sessions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students at the freshman
and sophomore levels from minority serving institutions, women colleges, and
small colleges nationwide with limited research opportunities will be the
primary targets of our recruitment efforts. Also, students from Atlanta will be
invited to continue their research project throughout the academic year. In
order to ensure that freshmen and sophomores will acclimate to the demands of an
intense research environment, participants will be placed in CBN labs with
junior and senior summer research students, who will serve as peer mentors. NSF-
REU participants will receive a stipend of $3000, room and board, and a travel
award, which may be used to cover the costs of attending the summer program
and/or a national scientific meeting. &lt;br/&gt;
