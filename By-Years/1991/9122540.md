This award is for support of a program of high-resolution seismic reflection and
radio-echo sounding on the surge-type Black Rapids Glacier, Alaska.
Determination of changes in the structure of the glacier bed during seasonal
fluctuations in velocity will be made. The measurements will be made at a
location where a 100 to 400 % increase in speed is known to occur each year in
the early melt season. Geophysical sensing of the basal zone will be performed
before and during the speed-up. Surface motion and uplift, the discharge of
water, solutes and sediment in the terminal stream, meteorological conditions,
and water level in moulins will all be monitored. These measurements will allow
the morphology of the glacier bed to be determined at times of differing amounts
of basal motion, and thus provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of
glacier and ice stream motion and the role of basal water.
