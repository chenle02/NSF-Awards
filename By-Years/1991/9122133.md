How much and what kinds of inequality should a society have? This is one of the
most basic questions for comparative social stratification research. This
project will collect data on social inequality from respondents to the 1991
General Social Survey (the major data collection supported in the field of
sociology) as part of the International Social Science Program, a continuing
annual program of cross-national collaboration . The 1992 social inequality
module replicates and extends the 1987 social inequality module which was
fielded in 10 countries. In 1992, data collection is expected in 20 countries.
These data will form the basis of cross-national comparisons, cross-time
comparisons, and intra- individual comparisons. The social inequality module
measures beliefs and perceptions regarding social inequality in general and
income differences in particular. It examines 1) factors people believe
influence social mobility, such as parental background, education, personal
qualities, and fixed personal attributes; 2) reasons for social inequality, such
as a reward for occupations with greater responsibility or requiring more
education, elite domination, and exploitation; 3) beliefs as to what people earn
in selected occupations and what they should earn; 4) support for government
measures to provide for social welfare and promote income levelling; 5) the
degree of social conflict between classes and economic groups; 6) inter-
generational changes in occupation, education, and standard of living; 7) what
factors should determine wage differentials; and 8) whether a respondent would
personally benefit from a measure to equalize income. The project will
contribute high-quality data that will create an unprecedented opportunity in
the study of social stratification for linking knowledge of employment contexts,
asked as a part of the 1991 General Social Survey, with information about
inequality. The data collection will also make a contribution in the context of
the growing internationalization of sociological research.
