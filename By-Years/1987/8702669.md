Mass spectral techniques such as Electron Impact (EI), Fast Atom Bombardment
(FAB) and Field Desorption (FD) are used to probe intimate structural details
and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
and organometallic molecules. The acquisition of instrumentation capable of
carrying out these state-of-the-art techniques is essential for the prosecution
of frontier research in several fields of chemistry. The purchase of a high mass
high resolution mass spectrometer will be facilitated by support from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program and the Biological Instrumentation
Program of NSF and by an award from NIH. The areas of chemistry that will be
enhanced include: 1) Stereoselective Synthesis of Transition Metal Enolates and
Related Organometallic Compounds 2) Structural Analysis of Phycobiliproteins 3)
Structure and Function of Oligonucleotides 4) Structural Determination and
Studies of Protein-Bound Pigments 5) Oligonucleotide Directed Mutagenisis 6)
Transition Metal and Heat-Mediated Organic Transformations 7) Characterization
of Siderophore Complexes 8) Metallacaixarenes in Organic and Organometallic
Synthesis 9) Synthesis and Characterization of Model Compounds as Zeolite and
Polyphosphate Materials
