Kaveh This research builds on experience that has been gained during the
construction and calibration of a laboratory ultrasound-in-air array, in order
to establish a systematic approach for experimentation and theoretical analysis.
Optimizing functionals are being developed for a general class of estimators
with similar computational burden as the well-known method of MUSIC. These
estimators are expected to significantly reduce the threshold signal to noise
ratio, for a general calibrated array, over a method such as MUSIC. Analysis
techniques are being established within a probabilistic framework for comparing
the resolution thresholds of estimators in this class. Detection methods are
also being developed in conjunction with experimental measurements that make
optimum use of the array calibration data. The new algorithms are being
generalized to cases involving wideband signals and signals possessing special
characteristics such as cyclostationarity. The ongoing experimental work, which
includes the implementation of subspace estimation algorithms on DSP processors,
is intended to establish the level of practicality of many proposed methods.
