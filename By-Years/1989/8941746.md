Molecular data and detail are vital factors in understanding biochemical
phenomena related to enzymes. Dr. Banaszak is carrying out an X-ray
crystallographic study of L-3- hydroxyacyl CoA Dehydrogenase, cytoplasmic malate
dehydrogenase (sMDH) and fumarase. Although these structural studies are at
different stages, the long range objectives in each case are similar. Structural
investigations of the type proposed are fundamental to understanding the
mechanism of catalytic activity of enzymes which carry out essential steps in a
number of fundamental biochemical pathways. Dr. Gail Rhodes, of the University
of South Maine, will spend part of the summer in the laboratory in order to
continue model building and refinement studies of the proteins L-3- hydroxyacyl
Coenzyme A dehydrogenase and cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase. This opportunity
will enable him to develop a research program related to protein structure at
his University where his research interests focus on the molecular structure of
proteins, protein model building, structure refinement and the comparison of
protein structures.
