In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Cindy Samet of the Chemistry Department of Dickinson College will
engage in a study of the hydrogen bonding in hydrocarbon-base complexes in the
condensed phase. The goal of the work is to investigate the C-H hydrogen bonding
and its dependence on the hybridization of the s and p orbitals of the carbon,
and on the presence of electron withdrawing constituents. The principal
technique for carrying out this work is matrix isolation Fourier transform
spectroscopy. This research project will also enhance the research opportunities
for undergraduate students at Dickinson College. This project represents the
debut of a young woman faculty member as an independent research scientist.
Hydrogen bonding represents an interaction between strongly bound molecules
which form a weakly bound complex. The linking agent is a hydrogen atom proton
of one molecule, the proton donor, which forms a weak bond with the partner, the
proton acceptor molecule. Hydrogen bonding plays an important role in the
structure and bonding of organic materials, including those of biological
importance. The initial studies of this research will be followed up with work
on larger systems such as organic crystals and large biomolecules. The chemistry
curriculum of Dickinson College has recently been revised and now contains
research as a requirement for chemistry majors. This project will strengthen the
undergraduate chemistry curriculum and thereby contribute to an improved
education of the next generation of scientists.
