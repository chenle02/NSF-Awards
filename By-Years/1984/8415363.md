The objective of this research is to enhance the understanding of grain boundary
structure and deformation behavior in ice and related crystalline materials. The
study examines recrystallization, grain growth, grain boundary sliding, and
cracking. The results of the fundamental studies will help to explain the
morphology and plasticity of ice including recrystallization and grain growth.
The research on the sliding in ice also offers generic and fundamental insight
into the grain boundary sliding and flow such as the super-plastic flow o fine
grained two-phase alloys. The research evaluates the local atomic structure of
grain boundaries with computer modeling. The modeling includes the details of
the dislocation boundaries and will predict the sliding and mobility of various
grain boundaries. Experimental tests will be made on the grain boundary sliding
in ice bicrystals and polycrystals to verify the predictive results.
