This project is bringing together Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Computer
Sciences, Engineering, Mathematics, Earth and Planetary Sciences, Physics and
Astronomy education researchers from postsecondary institutions across New
Mexico, with the goal of promoting cross-disciplinary research in the emerging
fields of Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER). The meeting will be in a
workshop format and will be focused on current topics, emphasizing contextual
and cultural considerations important to New Mexico. New Mexico has a number of
active grants to which DBER work can contribute significantly and these grants,
in turn, will help to focus the research undertaken by DBER scholars in New
Mexico.
