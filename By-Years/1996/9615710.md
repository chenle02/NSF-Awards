ABSTRACT Proposal No: 9615710 Proposal Type: Investigator Initiated Principal
Investigator: Charles Pidgeon Affiliation: Purdue University This grant is
awarded through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the
Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport
Systems Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Charles Pidgeon of the
Illinois Institute of Technology. The investigator proposes to develop
immobilized artificial membranes (IAMs) as solid phase analogues to fluid
membranes, in particular phospholipid based biomembranes. The objective is to
quantify the environment a solute experiences in a lipid biomembrane, by using
an accurate structural mimic that is less fragile. The IAM can therefore be used
in a chromatographic mode, with technological implications to biomolecule
separations. Lipid membranes are fragile and this makes it hard to study the
partitioning and transport of molecules into and through the membrane. By
preparing a more structurally stable analog of lipid membranes, it becomes
possible to characterize the environment of biomolecules that partition into
these biologically very important, self-assembling systems. Furthermore, these
partitioning characteristics can be utilized in developing new chromatographic
separation techniques. Additionally, the IAMs can be used as drug delivery
vehicles. The project therefore, has the potential to contribute to both
fundamental science, and to technology advancement.
