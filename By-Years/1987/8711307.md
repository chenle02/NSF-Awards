The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for the determination
of the molecular structure of compounds as diverse as small polypeptides and
complex metal clusters. When combined with the latest computer software, the
technique is becoming remarkably easy to put into practice. The acquisition of
X-ray crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the ability of chemists
to carry out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry at New York
University will purchase an X-ray Diffractometer with support from the Chemistry
Shared Instrumentation Program. The instrumentation will be used to enhance
research in the following areas of chemistry: 1) Synthesis of natural products;
computer assisted design of new biologically active molecules 2) Application of
organometallic reagents in synthesis and catalysis; modeling of heterogeneous
processes 3) Molecular characterization of the receptor sites of
pharmacologically important molecules 4) Modeling of the active site of
metalloenzymes; synthesis of novel cluster compounds containing sulfur and
carbonyl ligands
