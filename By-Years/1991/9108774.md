The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) in the state
of Wyoming will enhance the research competitiveness of over 30 investigators
working in two research clusters: (1) Ground Water Contamination: Detection,
Prediction, Remediation; and (3) Basic Research in Fossil Energy Science. The
clusters will form the core of a new Center for Environment and Natural
Resources at the University of Wyoming. The Center will enhance Wyoming's human
resources in S&E, its technological and economic development, and its
fundamental science. In addition,innovative programs for teachers and for all
students, especially women and minorities, will enhance the development of
Wyoming's young people. Because Wyoming has no major federal or industrial
research facilities, the Wyoming EPSCoR improvement plan focuses primarily on
the University of Wyoming (UW). Interactions between UW, community colleges,
public schools, and technology/economic development organizations are
incorporated throughout the plan. Primary objectives include: (1) expansion of
UW's capacity to conduct S&E research through reallocation of UW funds and
positions and by enhanced state support; (2) an increased pool of S&E students
through development of appealing interdisciplinary programs; (3) increased
interactions between UW and the Western Research Institute through joint
research; and (5) increased state awareness of the role of S&E research in
Wyoming's economic development through enhanced interaction with established
state boards and the executive and legislative branches of state government.
Over the three- year award period the State of Wyoming will contribute $3.9
million to ensure the success of the EPSCoR effort.
