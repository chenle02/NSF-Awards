96-13613 Rambo Influence of forest fragmentation on watershed functions in
Northern Vietnam Forest patches are rarely taken into consideration in rural
development programs. This project aims to assess the management of forest
fragments, as opposed to monolithic forest cover, as a valid new paradigm for
sound watershed conservation. The investigators will test linked hypotheses
relating to the consequences of forest fragmentation on watershed functions and
socioeconomic forces and technological conditions that foster forest
fragmentation. The project, to be undertaken in northern Vietnam, is expected to
provide basic data for evaluating environmental changes and management actions,
and develop some of the indicators and basic understanding necessary to manage
ecosystems. Ecosystem experiments are the most direct method available for
improving predictions of environmental response to management. This information
is also urgently needed for the design of policies and programs that balance the
need for watershed protection, forest conservation, and landscape restoration
with the demands for socioeconomic development.
