Dilute peracetic acid (PAA) is a potent disinfectant for the food and beverage
industry and for medical facilities and equipment. The estimated global market
of peracetic acid in 2018 is &gt;US$600 million. The challenge with using PAA is
that manufacture creates concentrated PAA solutions. These are hazardous to
transport, to store and to dilute for use. The proposed solution is to make PAA
on-site, which eliminates transport, make PAA only when needed, which eliminates
storage, and make PAA only in the dilute less-hazardous form, which eliminates
handling steps by workers. The key to this solution is an enzyme catalyzed
reaction on-site from safer ingredients - acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide. To
reach this application goal, the enzymes need to be more stable than they are
now so they can be reused.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peracetic acid (PAA) is a
strong, reactive oxidant which allows PAA to kill a broad range of microbes.
This I-Corps team's goal is to produce PAA at end-user's on-site facility using
enzymes by the perhydrolysis reaction of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide.
Prior research identified efficient enzymes which creates ten molecule of PAA
per second for each molecule of enzyme. The fast enzyme catalyzed formation of
PAA created the opportunity to make it at the application location only on
demand and also in amounts needed. To make it commercially viable, the proposed
approach is to use enzyme in a packed-bed reactor, with acetic acid and hydrogen
peroxide fed in and produce PAA with the amounts needed. To achieve this
demonstration, it requires engineering of perhydrolase enzymes to be more
resistant for oxidation by PAA, immobilization of stabilized enzymes for the
reusability and optimize reaction conditions for a continuous flow reactor. The
current proposal seeks to commercialize the enzymatic production of PAA for
safer use and thereby tests the broader hypothesis that the biotechnology micro
factories can replace traditional chemical factories.
