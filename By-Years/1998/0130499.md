&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will lead to the creation of next-generation
Netlib (Netlib.ng). While preserving and strengthening Netlib's ability to
provide its traditional services: reliable, fast access to latest and best
computational software packages, we will explore technologies that adapt Netlib
repositories to the new challenges presented by today's computing environment.
We will first enhance Netlib's traditional services for both users and
developers, principally by using the Repository in a Box (RIB) toolkit to
upgrade Netlib's catalogue technology for improved usability and
interoperability. Applying RIB tools to Netlib will make it compliant with IEEE
metadata standards, substantially improve user interfaces, accelerate repository
updates, simplify and decentralize administration, and enable for Netlib.ng to
participate in larger virtual repositories without compromising its high
standards for quality control. The second part of research aims to automate the
full software deployment and management process, i.e. its compilation,
installation, configuration, and management. When this work is completed, we
believe Netlib.ng will leverage the power of this major community asset to
create a rich and scalable solution to some of the complex problems of software
deployment and management in the new era of high performance distributed
computing we have entered.
