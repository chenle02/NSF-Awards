This research focuses on developing statistical models, methods, and theory for
normalization and significance analysis of microarray data and similar
applications. Microarray technology has become an important tool for
quantitatively monitoring gene expression patterns and has been widely used in
functional genomics. The investigator and his collaborators have proposed and
developed a two-way semilinear model for normalization and analysis of cDNA
microarray data. The purpose of this research is to extend and further develop
this methodology and investigate its theoretical justifications. The project
covers a wide range of specific problems including multi-way semilinear models,
normalization and analysis of high-density oligonucleotide arrays, incorporation
of control/spike genes and biological pathway information, location-scale
normalization, estimation of noise level, incorporation of data quality
measurements, invertibility of information operator, asymptotic equivalence to
ideal/oracle estimators of gene effects, and more.

The multi-way semilinear model is an extension of widely used analysis of
variance and semilinear regression models. Its applications to microarray
experiments present challenging methodological and theoretical problems with
high-dimensional complex datasets. These datasets have the following features:
large number of unknown parameters for gene effects and small number of samples,
many nonparametric components, co-linearity between bases for the estimations of
nonparametric and parametric components, stochastically dependent covariates
with spatially inhomogeneous distributions, interactions between observed gene
expressions and possibly unobservable gene clusters and biological pathways,
inhomogeneous noise level, and more. This research is motivated and will be
directly applicable to functional genomic studies using microarray and similar
technologies. It will also be directly applicable to high-throughput screening
of chemical compounds in drug discovery experiments. This research will have
significant educational impact.
