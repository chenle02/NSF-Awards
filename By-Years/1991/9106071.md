Most studies of human coping strategies have been limited to the responses of a
population to cataclysmic events like droughts. Equally important is the
response of a population to gradual, human-induced degradation of the physical
resource base in an intrinsically verdant environment. This doctoral
dissertation project will examine agricultural responses of the population of
the Highland prefecture of Gikongoro in Rwanda, which is experiencing serious
declines in food production, to increasing population density. It will identify
and explain changes over time in land productivity as interpreted by farmers and
documented in the literature, and it will analyze the agricultural and non-
agricultural responses to changes in land productivity. National and Gikongoro
surveys of changing views towards land productivity and agricultural practices,
aerial photographs showing land uses in 1958, 1979, and 1990, data from existing
ministry surveys, and information from libraries and other sources will be use
to assess relationships among a variety of societal and environmental factors
over time and space. This project will contribute to geographical and social
scientific understandings of strategies for coping with food deficits, and more
broadly, with basic problems of food production in tropical Africa. It also will
test the validity of using a political ecology framework for analyzing questions
about human-environment interactions. This project also will provide an
excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop
independent research skills.
