A long-standing problem in the chemistry community has been to reliably compute
chemical reaction and isomerization rates from first principles. The traditional
technique for doing this, known as transition state theory, makes statistical
assumptions on the nature of the underlying dynamical processes. A detailed
examination of even relatively simple systems, such as the ionization of loosely
bound electrons, shows that this assumption is not valid, and it is now realized
that in order to solve these problems one must take into account the detailed
structure of the dynamics. Using recently developed techniques based on
geometric mechanics (especially the use of reduction theory and shape space
dynamics), together with a detailed knowledge of the dynamics (especially normal
form theory and invariant manifold tubes), as well as Monte Carlo sampling
methods (for computing volumes of intersecting reaction entrance and exit
regions in phase space), this problem will be solved first for relatively simple
molecules undergoing isomerization and then progressing to more complex
situations.

This research contributes to one of the grand challenges of the mathematical and
computational sciences -- namely the ability to accurately compute from first
principles (that is, using so-called ab initio calculations) important molecular
processes such as chemical reaction rates and the dynamical behavior of
biomolecules. The specific advances that make this possible are recent
developments in computational techniques for dynamical systems as well as
improved understanding of the complex geometry of the exit and entrance channels
(or tubes) that govern reactions and conformation changes. These are fundamental
advances that, when combined with dimension and model reduction techniques, will
provide a powerful tool for the study of more complex molecular systems.
