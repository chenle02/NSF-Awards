This award provides support for students to participate in the 22nd
International Symposium on Spin Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign, which will be held September 25 - 30, 2016. The conference covers a
broad range of physics related to spin-dependent observables in nuclear and
particle physics. Key features of the conference are recent results from
experiments using cutting edge techniques, talks on a future polarized electron
ion collider in the U.S., and new theoretical advances. Some of the technologies
developed for this area of physics have found interesting applications, such as
the use of polarized target technology for MR imaging of lungs and probing the
surface of solids with stopped polarized muon beams. The conference organizers
have actively recruited members of under-represented groups to give invited
talks and serve as session conveners.
