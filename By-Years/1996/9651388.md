This project represents a major revision and modernization of the laboratories
associated with the 2-semester General Physics course sequence. This sequence
serves 700 students each year and is required by 17 degree programs. These
programs include biology, chemistry, kinesiology, geosciences, and the
premedical and pre-physical-therapy curricula, with a combined enrollment of
1,200 majors, from a highly ethnically diverse student body. The project
addresses three curricular deficiencies: insufficient development of students'
quantitative skills, insufficient development of physical intuition, and
insufficient relevance for non-physics-majors. All three deficiencies stem from
the inadequate involvement of the students as active and involved participants
in the learning process. The computer data acquisition, analysis, and simulation
approach, coupled with more relevant new experiments, enables students to become
active, interested learners in the laboratory, not just recorders of data. The
department is equipping the existing nonmajor laboratories with computer
stations (one station/two students). Each station includes an interface unit and
sensors to allow direct computer acquisition of such quantities as position,
force, temperature, sound, light intensity, and magnetic field level. These
stations also include a simulation and visualization capability using the
Interactive Physics II software and CD-ROM based visualization materials.
Project experiences and laboratory manuals will be shared with the physics
community over the World Wide Web and in workshops at meetings, as well as
through publications and presentations.
