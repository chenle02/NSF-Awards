The Kepler space mission has found thousands of planets that pass in front of --
or transit -- the stars that they orbit, as seen from Earth. We can, however,
only learn about the properties of these exoplanets (such as size) as they are
compared to the stars that they orbit. It is therefore very important that we
measure and understand the properties of these stars correctly. The methods that
astronomers have used to study these properties of stars can lead to levels of
error that affect our information about the exoplanets. This project combines
data from the Gaia spacecraft mission with data taken from telescopes in Hawaii
to make the first uniform characterization of the stars like the Sun with
orbiting planets. The results of this study will then improve our studies of the
exoplanets themselves. This project serves the national interest by promoting
the progress of our understanding of exoplanets and the potential for life
beyond Earth. University students will work on this research. In addition, the
Principal Investigator will make public presentations about how the research
done on ground-based telescopes in Hawaii helps to study the data acquired from
space-based missions such as Kepler and Gaia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current
interpretation of the exoplanet population critically hinges on the ability to
characterize their host stars. Traditional techniques used to determine stellar
properties are uncertain for solar-type stars. The radius precision for over 99%
of all Kepler exoplanets is limited by the uncertainties in the radii of the
host stars, which are on average between 20-30%. This project will derive the
first homogeneous and accurate characterization of all Kepler exoplanet host
stars and the Kepler parent sample. These properties will be used to explore the
habitability and compositions of small Kepler exoplanets as well as provide
first insights into the occurrence rates of exoplanets as a function of stellar
evolution.
