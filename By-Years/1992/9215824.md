This award is to provide travel funds for 50 computer engineers and scientists
from the U.S.A. to attend the 12th. World Computer Congress in Madrid, Spain,
September 7-11, 1992. The International Federation for Information Processing
(IFIP) is a multinational federation of technical organizations concerned with
Information Processing. An important activity of IFIP is its biennial World
Computer Congress which provides an opportunity for the exchange of information
between engineers and scientists world wide. The Federation on Computing in the
U.S. (FOCUS), an unincorporated joint activity of the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
Computer Society, proposes to administer the travel grant program. FOCUS serves
