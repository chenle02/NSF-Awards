A significant commercial opportunity lies in providing software systems which
take real world engineering problems, expressed in engineering rather than
mathematical terms, and convert these problems into systems of mathematical
equations. These equations may then be analyzed using the symbolic and numerical
facilities of a general purpose mathematical mathematics package. This approach
separates application specific engineering knowledge from the application
independent capabilities of general purpose mathematical software. In the last
four years, Variational Geometry has emerged as natural and powerful language
for the expression of mechanical engineering problems; particularly problems in
the realm of engineering mechanics. The goal of this project is to develop an
engineering mechanics package which will serve to convert a variational geometry
based description of the engineering problem into a symbolic mathematical
description, which may then be analyzed inside a general purpose mathematical
package. The Phase I research will establish the feasiblity of taking this
approach and the performance gains which may be realized.
