The aim of this project is to develop modules that provide laboratory experience
in undergraduate biomedical engineering elective classes. Within the biomedical
engineering elective courses, nine modules are being developed: (1) experimental
stress analysis of orthopedic materials, (2) stress-strain analysis of soft
tissue, (3) study of hand tool vibration, (4) measurement of fluid mechanical
properties of cardiac valve prostheses, (5) study of transport properties in
hemodialysis, (6) use of indicator/dilution techniques for flow measurement, (7)
pressure measurement in a mock circulatory system, (8) electrical safety of
biomedical equipment, and (9) analysis of respiratory flow. Many of these
modules compare the data generated to industrial standards to introduce
realistic experiences into the curriculum. Equipment requested includes an
oscillograph recorder and IBM PC for data acquisition and signal conditioning;
strain gage instrumentation for stress analysis; accelerometers for
determination of hand tool vibration; pressure transducers and flowmeter probes
for instrumentation of two mock circulatory systems; a spectrophotometer to
measure concentration of solutes in hemodialysis; thermal and dye dilution
systems for measurement of cardiac output; an electrical safety analyzer for
determination of safety of medical equipment; and a pneumotachograph and animal
ventilator for the study of respiratory flow. These modules should be of
interest to biomedical and other engineering educators since they allow students
to learn methods of data collection and analysis while enhancing their
understanding of fundamental engineering science principles.
