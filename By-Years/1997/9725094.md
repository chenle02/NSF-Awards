9725094 Murhammer The overall goal of these collaborative proposals between the
Principal Investigators (PIs) at Iowa and Wyoming is to develop insect cell
culture as an alternative to mammalian cell culture by creating a more mammalian
glycosylation pattern on recombinant proteins. This will be accomplished in the
three main aims of the proposal: Spodoptera frugiperda Sf-9 cells will be
altered with genes for galactosyl transferase and sialyl transferase and the
effect on the model protein SEAP (secreted alkaline phosphatase) determined. The
effect of bioreactor environment on the SEAP glycosylation will be determined,
especially carbon dioxide and dissolved oxygen concentration. Similar studies
will be conducted on a much more complex protein model, C1INH, 3 which normally
contains six N-linked and seven O-linked glycosylation sites. ***
