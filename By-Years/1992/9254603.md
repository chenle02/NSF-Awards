The project will involve about 60% the 200 chemistry teachers of the state of
Montana in a series of intensive concept workshops over the next three years.
The concepts which will be studied are determined by looking at the performance
of the students on the ACS Chemistry Olympiad Examination items and coupling
this with the teachers expectation. Thirty 'lead' teachers will study the topics
in depth at Montana State during two week workshops in the summer for each of
three years. These teachers will then hold regional workshops for teachers in
their area (at least 30/year) over the course of the next academic year. During
the next summer, they may study different topics and repeat the process. At each
of these regional workshops will be a faculty member from the main campus to
assist in the teaching. They will be highly interactive using the best of modern
pedagogy to teach the students in the coming year. The cost share is 26% of the
awarded Foundation funds.
