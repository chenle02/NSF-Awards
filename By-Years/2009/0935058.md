This engineering education research award to Purdue University will employ
researchers to investigate the role of socioeconomic status in student decision
making, academic trajectory, and success using MIDFIELD, a longitudinal database
of information about undergraduate students at 9 institutions during the period
from 1987 to 2005. Significant barriers are faced by low-income students, and
this project will explore retention, performance, and time to graduation for
these students. The project also will determine the significant factors that
influence the choice of majors by students from low income backgrounds.
Investigating the influence of socioeconomic status on students' choices of
major and progress toward a degree addresses an important issue that is not
currently well understood, and this work will increase understanding of how
students enter and progress through engineering programs. Results of this
research will be valuable to universities in understanding and planning
strategies and interventions to improve recruitment and retention for
engineering students who are disadvantaged because of their low-income
background. This will increase the number of engineering students who can fill
engineering jobs.
