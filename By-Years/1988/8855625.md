This project has two goals: (1) to maintain and extend an existing database
containing longitudinal information on large numbers of mathematically
precocious youth; (2) to conduct several studies to identify characteristics of
young students, particularly female students, that correlate strongly - and
synergistically - with high achievement in mathematics and science in later
years. The extension of the database will include the following new information:
(1) After-college data on a particular early cohort; (2) After-high-school data
on a younger cohort; (3) Follow-up of nonrespondents to earlier surveys; (4)
Data on a new cohort of gifted students from culturally diverse backgrounds; (5)
Data on a new cohort of average ability students to serve as controls for
various studies; (6) Retrospective data on a high achieving graduate student
cohort. The new studies will explore: (1) Factors relating to persistence in
math/science career paths by mathematically talented females; (2) Factors that
relate to females lowering their aspirations in science and/or mathematics; (3)
Synergism among factors that cause high math achievers in high school to select
careers in science and/or mathematics; (4) The impact of extracurricular
activities on the math/ science achievements of precocious youth; (5) The impact
of personality characteristics on the math/ science achievements of precocious
youth; (6) The attitudes of mathematically gifted students toward mathematics
and science.
