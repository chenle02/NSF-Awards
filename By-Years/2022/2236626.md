With support from the Division of Chemistry (CHE), Dr. Anthony Boccanfuso of
University-Industry Demonstration Partnership is organizing a workshop to
convene a strategic set of academic, corporate, government, and non-profit
representatives to explore effective strategies to increase private sector
investments in federally funded, use-inspired research in the chemical sciences.
This workshop will bring together representatives from these companies and a
mosaic of educational institutions including leading R1 institutions,
historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and Hispanic-Serving
institutions (HSIs) to identify actionable ways for companies to engage in the
NSF solicitation development process earlier, large cross-sector research needs
(grand challenges), and the potential to form multisector consortia to catalyze
chemistry research in areas of societal-level need. The workshop is slated to
take place in Fall 2022 in the Washington, DC region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
