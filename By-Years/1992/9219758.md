Alkaline, saline brines in a late Cenozoic rift basin near Socorro, New Mexico,
caused pervasive potassium metasomatism of volcanic rocks beneath the basin
floor as well as of the synrift sediments. The objectives of this project are:
1) to determine the mobility of potential ore-forming elements during
K-metasomatism; 2) to determine where elements enriched in the altered rocks
occur in the alteration assemblage of adularia, hematite, -_ quartz, _ clay; 3)
to determine the temperature and composition of the fluids by analysis of fluid
inclusions; 4) to determine the stable isotope composition of the metasomatic
fluid; and 5) to determine the age and duration of the metasomatic event by
40Ar/39Ar dating of secondary K-feldspar. Preliminary analyses indicate that
arsenic may be a mobile element in the oxidizing hydrologic systems of rift
basins and may be a more common problem than is realized.
