This P.I. will conduct research on thermal convection in the Earth, which is
the driving force of plate tectonics and hence of earthquakes, volcanoes, and
other geological processes. This research will help in the understanding of the
mechanisms by which convection drives geological processes by using three
dimensional numerical models of mantle flow interacting with overlying plates.
The research is unique because she has the expertise to add geochemical
constraints to geophysical models for convective flow. She will model specific
fundamental surface features of the crust (rifts, hot spots, and subduction
zones), trying to find the limits of the mantle models required to produce them.
