This project addresses a number of mathematical problems of image reconstruction
in several emerging fields of imaging. Specific topics include single scattering
optical tomography and gamma-ray emission tomography, which are used in medicine
for diagnostics and treatment monitoring of various diseases. The project also
considers Compton camera imaging, which is used for detection of radiation
sources in homeland security and in radio astronomy. The outcomes of this
project have potential impact for modern healthcare technologies, national
security, exploration of space, and several industrial applications. A special
emphasis in this project is made on training students from groups historically
underrepresented in STEM fields, including women and minorities.

The project is devoted to the study of broken ray (BRT) and conical (CRT) Radon
transforms, and their applications to several modern imaging modalities. BRT is
a transform that maps a function defined on a plane to its integrals along a
certain family of broken rays. CRT maps a function defined in the 3D space to
its integrals over a family of conical surfaces. These quantities often
correspond to measurements of an imaging device, and the process of image
reconstruction depends on the possibility of stable inversion of these
transforms. The central problems addressed by the investigators include: the
description of injectivity sets of BRT/CRT and formulas for their inversion, the
study of the microlocal properties of these transforms, the description of their
range, and the investigation of incomplete data problems. The methodology to
attack such problems utilizes various combinations of techniques from Fourier
analysis, partial differential equations, integral equations and microlocal
analysis.
