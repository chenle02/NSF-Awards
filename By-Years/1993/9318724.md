9318724 Oguz Theoretical and experimental research is to be carried out on the
generation of bubbles in a liquid near the free surface of the liquid. The
investigator already has demonstrated that a particular bubble generator
configuration is able to produce much smaller bubbles than has been possible so
far. The scheme involves introduction of a gas cavity into the device.The
research is to further explore performance and explain, through modeling, the
mechanisms involved. Generation of microbubbles has useful implications in gas-
liquid reactors, floatation columns, waste water treatment plants, and aerators
in general. ***
