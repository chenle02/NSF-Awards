The Galapagos volcanoes Sierra Negra and Alcedo represent two extremes of
magmatic diversity. Sierra Negra is made up of compositionally similar, evolved
tholeiitic basalts, whereas Alcedo has erupted a remarkable bimodal suite of
tholeiitic basalts and oceanic rhyolites. It is believed that the difference in
the extents of differentiation of these two volcanoes is related to fundemental
differences in their magma chambers' histories, yet the two are so close that
their flanks overlap. This project will perform detailed field, petrologic and
geochemical studies of Alcedo volcano, in order to begin to elucidate these
differences. Particular emphasis will be placed on determining the origin of the
unique suite of oceanic rhyolites. Volumes of the different units, their
eruptive order, and the locations of eruptions will be determined. These in turn
will provide constraints on the petrologic processes that govern the evolution
of oceanic magmas. Eventually it is planned to study Sierra Negra for comparison
purposes, but such a study is not part of this project.
