9631546 Krupitskaya This Research Planning Grant focuses on doping of Aluminum
Nitride(AlN), a material with wide direct band gap (6.2 eV), and a promising
material for the development of unique UV optoelectronic, high temperature, high
power, and negative electron affinity (such as flat panel display emitters)
devices. In this project a preliminary investigation of in-situ doping of AlN
will be performed using a series of impurities, which are theoretically shallow
dopants, incorporated into epitaxial AlN thin films. Initial experiments will
study Mg as an acceptor and Si as a donor impurity. Under conditions of strong
self-compensation with native defects, other techniques such as temperature
annealing in different ambients and the use of other impurity species will be
considered. The properties of the doped AlN semiconductors will be investigated
using electrical and optical measurement techniques, X-ray diffraction, High
Resolution Transmission Electron Diffraction (HTEM), X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy (XPS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) an d Scanning Tunneling
Microscopy (STM). Further characterization and analysis will assess the
influence of impurities on electrical and structural properties of AlN films.
%%% While this project will focus primarily on the study of controlled
conductivity in a potentially advantageous optoelectronic material, aluminum
nitride, it will also be of general benefit to similar properties and desirable
features of group III nitrides, and will contribute to a greater understanding
of materials issues for these semiconductors. The planning grant will aid the PI
in accomplishing enough preliminary work to show the promise of ideas or to
modify them based on the data acquired. Thus, support during the planning period
will aid the PI in preparing a more competitive full proposal. *** _
