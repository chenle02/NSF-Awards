Proposal No.: 9732218 PI: Landis University: U of Maine ABSTRACT The aim of this
program is interdisciplinary research experience for undergraduate science and
engineering students. The focal point is the development of the next generation
of engineered wood composites for construction applications. The disciplines
involved include structural engineering, mechanics, composite materials, and
wood science. The educational paradigm will be one of combining hands-on
laboratory work with training in fundamental science and engineering principles.
Previous experience with REU sites indicates that many students become
interested in graduate research when they are able to see the fruits of their
work used in some application. Thus the basis of this REU site is to provide
students with projects and a research environment where they may, with
reasonable diligence, complete a small research project that is a clearly
defined piece of the greater research and development program. Ten students will
work at U Maine for a ten-week period during the summer. Prior to arrival on
site, the advisors will contact their students to discuss the nature of their
projects and to provide written background material. During the summer, each
student will be involved in four types of activities: their own individual
project, work with others in their sub discipline, weekly group seminars, and
group field trips. Faculty will work closely with their students, especially
during the early part of the summer. Weekly seminars will include discussions of
research techniques, ethics, graduate schools, as well as three presentations
made by the students. Group field trips include trips to major field test sites,
government agencies, industries, and social events. Follow-through after the
students leave the site will consist of advisors working with their students on
a technical paper based on the research and on applying to graduate school.
