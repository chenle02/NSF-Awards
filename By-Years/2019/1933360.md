The Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference (GSCC) will be held March 27-29,
2020 at the University of California, San Diego. This will be the 16th annual
edition of the GSCC, which is traditionally organized by graduate students and
has benefited greatly from NSF support in the past. The GSCC focuses on graduate
student research presentations and will include keynote addresses by Boris Bukh
(Carnegie Mellon University), Laura Escobar (Washington University in St.
Louis), Dana Randall (Georgia Institute of Technology), and Jozsef Solymosi
(University of British Columbia). The GSCC provides a unique and invaluable
opportunity for graduate students in combinatorics to experience the benefits of
taking part in a research conference. Giving their own presentations allows
graduate students to develop their teaching and presentation skills, helping
them further succeed as junior researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics
is a field of mathematics with applications to many disciplines. It is a vibrant
area for new, innovative research that can involve problems and techniques
within algebra, geometry, topology, probability, computer science, and analysis.
This conference will keep junior investigators aware of the advances that have
been made in this lively and exciting field. The GSCC provides a great
opportunity for graduate students to network by meeting other young
mathematicians with similar research topics, which can lead to potential joint
research projects and opportunities for future
collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Website:

NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
