9418848 Huskamp This Metacenter Regional Alliance (MRA), through its SEED
(Stimulating and Enhancing Entrepreneurial Development) program, will address
the following, identified as barriers to accelerating the transfer of
computational technology to individual small businesses: - the inherent risk in
devoting precious corporate energy to the adoption of new technology - the
amount of staff time that must be invested to explore applications of this
technology - the need for training, consultants, and computing time -
accessibility of these services. A model for small business outreach in North
Carolina will be implemented based on the academic allocation model currently in
use by the metacenter. Additional states will be recruited in the following
years, and will leverage expertise from existing partners, previous project
experience, and the resources already in place at the MRA. The Southern
Technology Council will take the lead in recruiting new states in the SEED
program. Participation form the metacenter is crucial to the success of this
program. With this linkage to the metacenter, the SEED program can connect small
businesses to national resources that are normally not accessible to them.
