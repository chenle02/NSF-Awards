The direct transfer of excitation energy among localized states via tunneling
(hopping) in semiconductors is to be investigated. This process has often been
neglected in the past. A study of the extent and of the mechanisms governing
this transfer related to donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) are necessary for a full
understanding of luminescence phenomena. The proper material parameters for the
luminescence processes will be re-evaluated using samples which have negligible
transfer or where the correction factors are known. The work will center on
Zinc-Selenium, for which a large number of samples are available. The study will
include a detailed examination of time decay, and of spectral and intensity
evolution as a function of excitation intensity and wavelength, temperature, and
impurity concentration.
