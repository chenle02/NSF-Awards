Web-based three-tier diagnostic tests to assess misconceptions held by
undergraduate biology students are being developed. Misconceptions hinder
students' understanding of complex, abstract scientific concepts, yet many
faculty and students themselves are unaware of these misconceptions. This
project is producing a web-based assessment tool for general biology courses to
provide rapid diagnosis and individualize feedback, which can be easily
adaptable for other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;As a result, science education is
being improved in two ways. Identification of&lt;br/&gt;misconceptions is the
first step in evoking conceptual change. Diagnosing misconceptions is critical
in helping students develop more scientifically accurate conceptual
understanding, which ultimately improves performance in undergraduate science
courses and reduces attrition. Second, results from this diagnostic instrument
help faculty to recognize the types of misconceptions that students hold,
thereby helping faculty to tailor instruction and laboratory activities to
confront the misconceptions. Assessment results are driving curricular
change.&lt;br/&gt;
