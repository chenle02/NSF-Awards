The focus of this research involves the development of chemical methods for the
functionalization of Buckyonions. Extreme oxidative processes and diazonium salt
electroreductive production of highly reactive phenyl radicals will be used and
size separation of products will be achieved using chromatographic procedures.
Subsequent removal of the functional groups should afford size-separated
multishell fullerenes for further studies.

With this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Luis
Echegoyan in the Department of Chemistry at Clemson University. Professor
Echegoyan will focus on developing methodology for extending the field of
nanomaterials beyond the fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. Concentric spherical
carbon structures, known as Buckyonions or multilayered fullerenes, will be
prepared, chemically functionalized, purified and characterized. There is
potential for broader impact of the work in the area of nanotechnology since
these structures should have interesting electronic, optical, photonic and
catalytic properties. Also, the project also presents an excellent arena for the
training underrepresented minority students.
