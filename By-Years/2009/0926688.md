This proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).

In this project, investigators propose to develop a programming environment for
easing the development of portable high-performance applications for GPUs and
accelerators ? by automatic generation of OpenCL code from annotated C programs
provided by the user. The proposed work is motivated by recent advances in
polyhedral based approaches for powerful transformations of affine computations
that have enabled the development of the Pluto automatic
parallelization/optimization system.

The developments will result in enhancement of the widely used gcc compiler
providing broad impact across the sciences. The education of students engaged in
the work will be central to the project.
