The project involves investigations in the analytic theory of automorphic forms.
The PI will work with Wilfried Schmid on creating L-functions from automorphic
boundary value distributions, and seeks to generalize their archimedean methods
to p-adic fields. The PI will also work with the string theorists Michael Green
and Pierre Vanhove on automorphic realizations of small real group
representations and their Fourier coefficients. Their goal is to produce
examples on exceptional groups which shed light on graviton scattering
amplitudes. Finally, the PI will work with the cryptographer Ramarathnam
Venkatesan on lattice approaches to cryptographic
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automorphic forms are a central topic
in modern number theory, and their L-functions relate them to an even wider
range of current investigations. The work with Green and Vanhove has used
automorphic forms to solve questions commonly studied in the string theory
literature. The project with Venkatesan studies the security of commonly used
commercial cryptographic algorithms.
