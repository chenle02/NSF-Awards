9700682 Aberbach This award supports work on several problems in commutative
algebra. These include studying Huneke's relation-type conjecture for parameter
ideals, localization of parameter test ideals, and localization of tight closure
in general. This research is concerned with a number of questions in commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry studies solutions of families
of polynomial equations. One can either study the geometry of the solution set
or approach problems algebraically by investigating certain functions on the
solution set that form what is called a commutative ring. This dual perspective
creates a close connection between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
