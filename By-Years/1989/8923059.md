Professor Kelly is being supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program in spectroscopic studies of small to intermediate size organic radicals.
The spectroscopic data will be used to characterize the structure and dynamics
of various radicals important as intermediates in combustion processes. The
radicals are formed in an atmospheric pressure flow by photodissociation of
precursor molecules and are characterized using time-resolved resonance Raman
spectroscopy using far ultraviolet radiation. Initial work will concentrate on
the spectroscopic characterization of vibrational structure and excited state
dynamics in simple radicals, such as the methyl, allyl, cyclopropyl, methylene,
cyanomethyl, ethyl, and tertiary butyl radicals.
