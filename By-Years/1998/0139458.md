This study examines how gender, education, and occupation affect science
reasoning, basic knowledge, and pseudoscience support. It will employ a unique,
underutilized, NSF archive: the Surveys of U.S. Public Attitudes Toward Science
and Technology 1979-1999. In earlier research, the principal investigator
discovered sex differences in knowledge and pseudoscience after controlling for
education and occupation. In this proposal, education and occupation will be
examined in more detail, and will include aspects of science reasoning, such as
understanding experiments or basic probability. It will examine how these
predictors interact with reasoning and knowledge over time, including causal
structural equation models that assess the effects of gender, dimensions of
education, and dimensions of occupation. It will also study relationships among
basic knowledge, reasoning, and pseudoscience support, controlling for gender,
education, and occupation. These results could prove useful to government
agencies, educators, concerned citizens, and scholars who study gender, public
opinion, and science, technology and society.
