Dwight Sweigart, Brown University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic
and Organometallic Chemistry Program for the synthesis and study of
supramolecular coordination networks generated by the self-assembly of metallic
and organometallic molecules. The networks will be based on pi-bonded quinone
complexes of transition metals such as manganese, iron, and ruthenium. These
networks are electrochemically active and feature a wide range of accessible
designs and architectures. Initial goals include the synthesis of materials that
incorporate large pores, nanotubes, and interdigitated pi-pi networks. This
project also includes the stabilization and study of quinone methides, which are
highly reactive molecules of enormous importance in the biosynthesis of melanin
and lignin, the action of anti-tumor drugs, and the metabolic oxidation of food
additives such as BHT. The stabilization of quinone methides will be attempted
by pi-coordination to transition metals.

The proposed quinonoid coordination networks and the stabilized quinone methides
have potential applications in magnetics, sensing, catalysis, detoxification and
drug delivery protocols. Students working on this project will gain broadly-
based expertise in synthetic and spectroscopic methods, X-ray crystallography
and in the application of electrochemical techniques to fundamental and
technologically important chemical processes.
