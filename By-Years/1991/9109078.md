The objective of this research is to devise formal methodologies for the design
and analysis of self-stabilizing, distributed systems. The ability to react to
unforeseen external perturbations is a fundamental stability criterion of any
intelligent distributed system. Transient failures affect the global state of a
system in an unpredictable manner. A distributed system is called self-
stabilizing when, regardless of its initial state, the system is guaranteed to
recover to a legitimate configuration in a finite number of steps. In the
context of fault-tolerance, the concept of self-stabilization is of fundamental
importance. However, many of the currently known self- stabilizing systems are
hand-crafted. Much work needs to be done in consolidating the design of self-
stabilization algorithms and devising formal methodologies, before these
principles can be applied to the design of non-trivial systems. The proposed
research will explore methods for the design of non-trivial, self-stabilizing
systems on different interconnection topologies and investigate potential
applications in the design of fault-tolerant distributed systems.
