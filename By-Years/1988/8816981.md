Dr. Wallace is determining the structure of the gramicidin A transmembrane ion
channel using X-ray crystallography and co- crystals of gramicidin and
phospholipids. The crystals currently available for study diffract to better
than 2.0 A resolution. Spectroscopic studies on these crystals have shown that
the lipid molecules are highly ordered within the co-crystals. The plasma
membrane is responsible for the interactions of a cell with its environment and
neighboring cells. Membrane proteins play a major role in transport processes,
cell-cell contact and signal reception. High resolution information concerning
the structure of proteins which are embedded in lipid bilayers may elucidate
their functional roles as channels and receptors and provide insight into the
folding of proteins in the hydrophobic environment of a lipid bilayer.***//
