Olfaction is an evolutionarily primitive sense critical for survival across the
animal kingdom - finding food, searching for mates, or avoiding predation all
depend on detecting, identifying, and discriminating odors. Although early steps
in olfactory processing are relatively well understood, significant gaps remain
in our understanding of higher-order odor representations and processing during
on-going behavior. Deciphering the operating principles of olfaction requires
the development of innovative and integrative approaches that combine novel
theoretical frameworks, improved mathematical models, and novel behavioral
paradigms across the phylogenetic spectrum, experimental methodologies, and
engineering principles. As part of the BRAIN Initiative, a 5-day focused Ideas
Lab workshop was organized in Summer 2015 to bring together researchers from
diverse scientific backgrounds to engender fresh thinking and innovative
approaches that will transform understanding of olfactory processing in
behavioral contexts while spawning new opportunities to elucidate the general
nature of sensory representations in the brain. The workshop resulted in three
awards to a total of 17 researchers in three project teams. This current
workshop brings together the awardees, trainees and experts in Physics,
Engineering and Neuroscience to share the exciting developments and findings
from the projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop features investigators at
all academic levels with a mix of quantitative researchers and neuroscientists.
An integral aspect of the workshop is extensive cross-disciplinary interaction.
Importantly, this workshop is part of a concerted effort to coordinate and align
interagency priorities to accomplish the goals of the BRAIN Initiative. The
workshop is anticipated to result in sharing of knowledge and development of
integrative team approaches to tackle the nature of olfactory processing and
sensory representations in the brain in general.
