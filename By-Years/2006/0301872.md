The Skidaway Institute of Oceanography will continue the scientific planning and
management activities of the Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) research initiative
by maintaining a CoOP planning office. The CoOP program seeks to promote
interdisciplinary research in the coastal ocean. Its goal is to obtain a new
level of quantitative understanding of the transports, transformations and fates
of biologically, chemically, and geologically important matter over the
continental margins. CoOP planning is being undertaken by a group of scientists
dedicated to organizing large-scale efforts in interdisciplinary coastal ocean
basic research. Through a series of workshops and the deliberations of a
scientific planning committee, activities are undertaken to define the actual
process studies and long-term measurements to be made. The office will
communicate information about the CoOP program and the scientific results from
CoOP projects by maintaining a CoOP web site and by regularly publishing a
newsletter.
