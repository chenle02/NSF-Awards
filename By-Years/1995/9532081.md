9532081 Walker The dynamics of dextrous manipulation involving contact
conditions is investigated in this research project. Typical examples of tasks
with a predominant contact include insertion, tapping and levering, etc. The
ability to use contact dynamics can often completely transform the nature of a
task, making its performance faster and simpler than under quasi-static
constraints. Specifically, this research project formulates new models of
dynamic dextrous grasping and manipulation, focusing on the question of dynamics
resulting from impact; identifies canonical dynamic grasping tasks involving
contact and impact, and develops effective algorithms for planning and
performing these tasks; and experimentally evaluates the developed algorithms
using multi fingered hardware hands.***
