Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0426777&lt;br/&gt;Dan Inman&lt;br/&gt;Virginia
Tech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic objective of this effort is to research an
active sensing system, including damage detection firmware, telemetry and a
power harvesting ability to produce a stand alone, active wireless sensor
technology. In addition it is proposed to generalize this sample device to
produce an analytical procedure to define the requisite physical properties of
such a sensing system (e.g. sensor type, number, sensitivity, bandwidth, power)
for general structural health monitoring and damage prognosis (SHM/DP) problems.
The tasks in performing this research are: (1) Determine the physical limits and
parameters for power harvesting of ambient vibration energy in terms of measures
such as frequency content, amplitude, transducer geometry, configuration and
placement. (2) Determine the physical limits and parameters for power harvesting
of ambient temperature in terms of measures such as gradient, minimum and
maximum temperature. (3) Determine the key parameters governing the energy
limits for transmitting information, for computing, and for exciting the
structure with a known input as related to a specific SHM/DP algorithm. (4)
Determine the key parameters for power consumption for computing such as analog
digital conversions and algorithm requirements. (5) Experimentally demonstrate
the proposed self-contained sensing system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a
project supported under the Sensors Initiative NSF 04-522.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
