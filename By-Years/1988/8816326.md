This work is directed toward the design of novel polyamides based on the
incorporation of sequential residues, similar to those found in proteins. One
expects to find new conformations, related to or different from those present in
standard nylons and proteins, which will result in new properties. For the
characterization of these polymers, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
circular dichroism (where applicable), solution and solid state nuclear magnetic
resonance, electron microscopy, and fiber-diffraction techniques will be
emphasized. The investigators will also utilize computer simulations to
determine the preferred structures of the new polymers. These polymers should
have potential uses as sutures, conformation, and properties, new classes of
peptidomimetic polyamides will be designed.
