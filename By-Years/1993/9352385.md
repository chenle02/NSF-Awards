Semiconductor characterization experiments are being introduced into the
undergraduate physics curriculum at Macalester College. These experiments are
part of an innovative upper division laboratory class for physics majors in thin
film and semiconductor physics. They also provide opportunities for student
independent study and faculty-student collaborative research. The experiments
being implemented as part of this activity are four-point probe measurements,
Hall effect, transient photoconductivity, and pn junction current-voltage and
capacitance measurements. These experiments complement existing experiments in
vacuum deposition science and technology, two-point conductivity measurements,
optical absorption spectroscopy, steady-state photoconductivity, and solar cell
spectral response. Together these experiments provide a comprehensive laboratory
experience in experimental physics, through the vehicle of stimulating and
topical experiments in materials physics.
