As the gate oxide thickness of a MOSFET transistor shrinks down to below 100 A,
there is strong evidence that the carrier mobility in the conduction channel is
reduced systematically with gate oxide thickness. The objective of this research
is to 91) experimentally establish the relationship between the channel mobility
and the gate oxide thickness for both p- and n- channel devices over a wide
range of thicknesses(30-200 A), with a goal toward the development of a set of
empirical equations useful for future device simulations; and (2) theoretically
model the thickness-dependent mobility behavior based on fundamental scattering
mechanisms. In addition, important issues pertinent to the processing of very
thin oxide MOSFET devices will be systematically investigated, and the results
should be relevant to practical down scaling of VLSI devices.
