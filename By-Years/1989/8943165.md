The focus of the Engineering Research Center for Net Shape Manufacturing at
Ohio State University is on cost-effective net- shape manufacturing of discrete
parts. Net shape manufacturing intends to produce discrete parts to finish
dimensions so that little or no machining is required prior to assembly. The
integration and optimization of product and process design offer great
opportunities for savings in time, cost, and resources. Moreover, net-shape
productions (molding, forging, sheet forming, casting) are major economic forms
of production, and advances in these technologies will make an important
contribution to national competitiveness. The goals of the Center are to develop
manufacturing knowledge and design tools and people trained in net shape design
and manufacturing. The strategic plan of the center is to create an integrated
design system offering a choice of materials, metals or plastics, and
manufacturing processes in the design and production of net-shape parts. There
are four principal thrust areas: billet forming, sheet forming, processing of
polymers and composites, and precision and die casting. However, the strategy
has been refined both as to the concepts and timing for integration. Knowledge
produced in these areas will be integrated as data bases and simulation tools on
(1) the behavior of materials, (2) interface phenomena, (3) mechanics of shape
change, and (4) characterizations of tooling and machines. Over the next five
years, the Center will create a prototype integrated design system for net shape
manufacturing, utilizing that data and simulations. The Engineering School has
established a graduate program in Manufacturing and Systems Engineering, of
which the Center Director is also the Program Director. The Center is a key
element in the Engineering School's building up of manufacturing education and
research at Ohio State University. The Center has also been innovative in
creating a special industrially-sponsored fellowship program to encourage
students with U.S. nationality into manufacturing. The Center has established a
strong working relationship with industrial firms, obtaining the sponsorship of
45 firms, from large to small, including support from the Society of Die Casting
Engineers.
