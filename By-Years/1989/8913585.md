This travel award provides partial support for Dr. Walter Spofford, Resources
for the Future, to consult with Chinese academic and government representatives
on China's environmental policies, and on particular, to start a cooperative
effort in the field of environmental economic. China will be one of the few
critical nations in determining how global environmental problems are managed
for decades to come. Early interaction with Chinese scientists in the relatively
new field of environmental economic promises to lay an important Foundation for
future Collaborative research.
