This project is a collaborative effort with scientists at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory to develop a real-time model for specifying and forecasting
the state of Earth's radiation belt. The project will utilize data assimilation
methods in conjunction with physical models and modern machine learning
techniques to examine the acceleration, transport and loss processes for
energetic electrons in the radiation belt. The resulting model will include
confidence limits on the system-wide forecasts, making the results useful for
operational space weather predicitions. The project will benefit society by
making improved radiation-belt predictions at reduced operational costs and the
forecasts will be made freely available online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
includes a strong educational and teaching component through the participation
of graduate students at the University of Colorado. In addition the research
will be integrated with the Los Alalmos Space Science Outreach (LASSO) program,
which offers teacher training to underrepresented groups and individuals with
disabilities.
