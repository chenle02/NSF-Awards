9602143 PI: Sur The long term objective of this project is to elucidate the
mechanisms by which the activity of developing nerve cells during embryonic
development influences the patterns of connections in the brain to generate a
functioning system. It is postulated that the mechanisms involved in development
may be similar to those known to play a part in regulating the plasticity of
connections of the mature brain. The proposed experiments address the role of
nitric oxide, a substance recently shown to play a part in the transfer of
signals from one nerve cell to another, in regulating the establishment of
synapses (the structures through which nerve cells in the brain communicate). It
has previously been demonstrated that substances that block the normal function
of the relevant synapses, also prevent the normal development of the visual
processing region of the brain. This may be effected through changes in the
permeability of the cells to calcium ions. The overall outcome of these
experimented will be to provide a fuller explanation of how orderly patterns of
nerve connections develop in the brain.
