The proposed research is a series of experiments that directly examine the
causes of adaptive radiation and its effects on populations and communities of
organisms over short and long time scales. Populations of the bacterium
Escherichia coli will be used as a model system. The rapid generation time and
the ability to viably store bacterial cells at -80C allow direct observation of
adaptive radiation and direct comparison of ancestral and descendent
individuals. Previous research has already demonstrated that adaptive radiation
can occur in experimental populations of bacteria, our studies will be the first
to systematically determine the effects of multiple factors (environmental and
genetic) on replicated populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adaptive radiation is a
fundamental process in the evolution of biodiversity. Many of the well-known
examples of evolution are of adaptive radiation, including Darwin's Finches,
Hawaiian Honeycreepers, and African cichlids. However, the factors causing and
shaping adaptive radiation are only partially understood, primarily since the
history of life can only be investigated indirectly. Because of this, essential
information on phylogenetic history and environmental conditions is often
imprecise. Species interactions are particularly difficult to study as they are
neither prone to fossilization nor do they appear to have systematic effects on
diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
