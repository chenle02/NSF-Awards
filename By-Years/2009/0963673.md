This project aims to advance the scientific study of filamentous fungi. These
eukaryotes serve as models for biology and are socially important as symbionts
(mutualists, parasites and pathogens) and in industry (food, chemical and
pharmaceutical manufacture, including enzymes important to conversion of plant
biomass to transportation fuels). The project will feature research on the key
programmatic areas of symbioses (mutualists and pathogens) and defense from
virus and horizontally transferred DNA, areas of research new to filamentous
fungi, fungal small RNA, fungal population genomics and systems biology, an area
of current social importance, fungal conversion of plant biomass to
transportation fuels, and the core areas of filamentous fungal cell and
molecular biology. The meeting that is the focus of this project, the Gordon
Research Conference on Cell and Molecular Fungal Biology, is unique among
regularly scheduled meetings on filamentous fungi in that it is small, that it
emphasizes discussions led by experienced researchers, that it consciously
avoids duplication of topics with other meetings, and that it has an unusually
large percentage of young scientists making oral presentations to the entire
group. Support for this project is directed at these young scientists to ensure
the future of biological research on these important microbes. The project aims
to help train these young scientists in making effective presentations of their
research, in networking with researchers globally, and in developing
collaborative research projects. The project is certain to accelerate scientific
progress by stimulating the transfer of information and the development of new
research programs in a field that impacts socially important areas such as
environmental quality, public health and food production.
