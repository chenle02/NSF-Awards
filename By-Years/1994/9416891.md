9416891 Vary This grant supports the participation by five young scientists from
Eastern Europe at the "Fundamental Particle and Nuclear Physics Summer School
and Workshop" in August 1994. The workshop, supported by a prior NSF grant, is
organized by the International Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physics of
Iowa State University, under the leadership of Dr. James P. Vary and Dr. Bing-
Lin Young, in cooperation with the Institute for Nuclear Research of the Russian
Academy of Sciences, under Director Victor A. Matveev. The CTEQ (Project on
Collaborative Theoretical and Experimental Studies in QCD) Collaboration is a
research group having the goal of advancing Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) theory,
experiment and phenomenology in a systematic manner. The CTEQ workshop will
cover topics in electroweak theory, not covered during the CTEQ summer school.
This proposed research in theoretical physics fulfills the program objectives of
advancing science by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence. ***
