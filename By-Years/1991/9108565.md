This research project will concentrate on continuing the Nitrogen additions in
both the hardwood and red pine stands, and measuring basic N cycling parameters
such as mineralization, nitrification, and plant uptake, including green foliar
content. The project will also estimate N return to the system in litter fall
and litter decay. As well, trace gas fluxes (CO2, N2O, CH4) will be measured. It
is hypothesized that trace gas fluxes are controlled to a significant degree by
short-term availability of carbon and nitrogen to soil microbes, and that these
availabilities are, in turn, constrained by feedbacks between soil availability
and plant demand. The effects of N additions on gross and net N immobilization
and mineralization, on the production and consumption of available carbon during
litter and soil organic matter decay, and on the available carbon and inorganic
nitrogen content of throughfall will be investigated.
