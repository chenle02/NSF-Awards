This is Expedited Award for Novel Research will initiate the development of a
class of computationally efficient, high-order adaptive numerical methods for
partial differential equations based on the use of splines. These methods will
be developed for, and applied to field problems in Electrical and Mechanical
Engineering. Box spline methods were recently developed numerical schemes which
provide a general framework for generating piecewise polynomial representation
to solutions with any desired smoothness and order of approximation. By
combining adaptive features with the advantages of box spline method, algorithms
for a number of numerically difficult problems such as the forced cavity flow
and the Landau-Lifschitz equations which describe the time evolution of
magnetization in ferromagnets. The Principle Investigator will work closely with
members of the Howard University Electrical Engineering Department.
