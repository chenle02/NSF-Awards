BIOGEOMON 2024 will be held January 7-11,2024. It is the 11th international
conference focused on understanding ecosystem biogeochemistry of soils, forests,
rivers, and wetlands with special attention given to anthropogenic effects
studied at the watershed, landscape, and global scale. BIOGEOMON 2024 will be
held at University of Puerto Rico at RÃ­o Piedras, a Hispanic-serving institution
in San Juan, Puerto Rico, marking the first time BIOGEOMON will be held in a
tropical landscape. While the BIOGEOMON conferences have always attracted a
diverse group of attendees, the 2024 organizing committee is emphasizing
diversity, equity, inclusion, justice, and accessibility (DEIJA) explicitly in
the conference design. Travel subsidies funded through this grant will open
attendance to many more students, early career scientists, and scientists from
under-represented groups from Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and
throughout the continental USA.

Incorporating changes to both the conference program and the support team for
attendees will help this conference serve as a model in how to broaden
participation and scope of inclusive small conferences. While most of the
requested funds will be used to provide travel grants to early career scientists
from underrepresented groups, the organizing committee has planned several
events that will educate all attendees on issues related to equity and diversity
in the field of biogeochemistry, including a DEIJA forum and a workshop on the
socioeconomic and sociocultural dimensions of biogeochemical research. The
committee will use recommendations gathered from peer-reviewed literature and
reports on running inclusive conferences to implement a variety of measures that
will make the conference more inclusive as well as enhance the scientific
program, including incorporating Universal Design principles into talks and
meeting rooms, providing extensive networking opportunities, designing a
conference code of conduct, and establishing a group of onsite Inclusivity
Liaisons who can assist attendees during the conference. The organizing
committee will gather data on the effectiveness of these measures before,
during, and after the conference which will be included in a report that can be
used by organizers when planning future conferences.
