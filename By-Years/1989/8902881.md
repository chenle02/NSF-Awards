The two principal investigators will use the theory of one- sided Bernoulli
shifts to understand the dynamics of maps on Cantor Julia sets for polynomials
of arbitrary degree. Using the conjugacy between these two maps, they will
relate the topology of the space of dynamical systems to the structure of the
automorphism group of the one-sided shift. In addition, Teichmuller theory for
punctured tori, classifications of dynamical systems which arise from iteration
of rational maps on the Riemann sphere, and Catalan numbers for branched
coverings by Riemann spheres will be the subjects of related investigations.
Computer-generated fractal images can be made by analyzing the dynamics of
polynomial maps of the complex plane. Pixels which continue to bounce about the
plane, but never fall into one of the periodic attractors, comprise invariant
fractals with exotic configurations. The mathematics behind these computer
images requires an amalgamation of several existing theories. The principal
investigators will continue their studies of these interrelationships.
