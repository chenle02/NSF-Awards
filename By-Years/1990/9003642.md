This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in
learning from this damaging event. This project addresses one specific problem -
the effectiveness of steel bracing in strengthening existing buildings.
Buildings strengthened with steel bracing will be selected to study the
effectiveness of currently used philosophy and design procedures. Improved
methods will be developed for strengthening existing buildings by using steel
bracing systems to enhance their safety during future earthquakes of greater
"design level" intensities. Information resulting from this study will be useful
for formulation of code requirements for evaluation and strengthening of
existing buildings.
