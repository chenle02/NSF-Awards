This award provides funding for the 19th International Workshop on
Electromagnetic (EM) Induction in the Earth. This workshop is sponsored every
two years by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA)
and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) and is the primary
forum for earth scientists in the world to share their EM research and plan
international cooperative experiments. The workshop will be held in Beijing,
China on October 23 ? 29, 2008 and will be hosted by the Institute of Geology,
China Earthquake Administration (CEA), and the Geo-electromagnetic Committee of
the China Geophysical Society.

EM measurements provide a unique view of the Earth because of the sensitivity of
electrical conductivity to temperature, fluids, ore minerals, and lithologic
variations. This sensitivity is important in monitoring environmental problems,
exploring for energy and mineral occurrences, studying the interior structure of
the Earth and other planets, and while investigating regions of potential
natural and man-made hazards (e.g., seismic, volcanic, unexploded ordinance).

Other Chinese institutions, universities, and organizations will contribute to
the operational expenses of the workshop. Support is also being sought by the
PIs Chinese colleagues from Chinese organizations and international companies to
help defray costs of the convention center rental, publication and publicity
expenses, materials for participants, local transportation, and audiovisual
equipment. The largest portion of the requested NSF funds will support travel
for students and young scientists. There will also be support for a few senior
scientists from developing countries. For many researchers, an assistance grant
will be pivotal for them to obtain additional support from their home country or
institution. The EM workshops in the past have fostered countless collaborations
between U.S. scientists and their foreign counterparts.
