Using newly available open-source technology, this program will design and build
a new digital signal processing platform (DSP) specifically for radio astronomy,
but with possible applications scientific experiments in other fields. Coupled
with existing radio telescopes, this instrument will lead to new approaches and
capabilities for observational astronomy. Students will gain hands-on experience
with all aspects of the project, including instrument design and development
through data reduction and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research
Instrumentation award will fund design and development of an ultra-wideband DSP.
This platform will be used for a 100 Gbps VLBI digital back end for the next
generation Event Horizon Telescope and for an ultra-wideband correlator and
phased array for the Submillimeter Array on Mauna Kea. It will increase the
sensitivity of the Event Horizon Telescope by a factor of 2, possibly enabling
direct imaging of a black hole event horizon.
