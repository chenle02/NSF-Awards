Contact fatigue is the cause of wear and pitting damage of bearings and many
other triboelements. The fatigue process consists of crack nucleation and crack
propagation, of which the latter process is reasonably well understood. In this
study the crack nucleation process will be modeled and the model validated by
experimental work. The model will be based on an energy concept associated with
repeated movement of dislocation dipoles in a homogeneous material in response
to cyclic stresses.
