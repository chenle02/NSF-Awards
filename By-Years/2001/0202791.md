Abstract 00202791, Philip Liu, Cornell University "The Third International
Workshop on Long Wave Runup Models"

This action is to provide support for The Third International Workshop on Long
Wave Runup Models, which will be held in July 2003 at Okushiri Island, Japan.
This island was severely damaged during the Hokkaido-Oki tsunami on 12 July
1993. The IUGG Tsunami Commission (IUGG/TC) biennial meeting will be held in
Sapporo, Japan, prior to this workshop, providing the opportunity for the
workshop participants to attend both meetings. Approximately 45 active
researchers (with a strong international component) will discuss the following
critical issues concerning the accuracy of tsunami runup models: 1 -D and 2-D
analytical solutions for shoreline movements Modeling of bathymetry and
topography data 2D and 3D landslide generated tsunamis Tsunami forces on a
coastal structure An in-depth examination on each topic will be presented.
Discussion sections will center on several benchmark problems designed
specifically for each topic. The workshop will have a dedicated WWW page, which
will include the benchmark problems as well as other workshop information. In
addition to the technical discussions mentioned above, the workshop will also
focus on the NSF sponsored NEES (National Earthquake Engineering Simulation)
project; in particular, the status and future plans for the large-scale tsunami
wave basin at Oregon State University. This will also provide a good opportunity
to discuss the international collaboration and linkage for the NEES facilities.
The organizing committee members are Dr. Philip Liu (Cornell University), Dr.
Harry Yeh (University of Washington), Dr. Costas Synolakis (University of
Southern California), and Dr. Nobuo Shuto of Iwate Prefectural University,
Japan. Drs. Liu, Synolakis, and Yeh organized the two previous workshops on long
wave runup.

The results of this workshop will be widely disseminated for further community
input.
