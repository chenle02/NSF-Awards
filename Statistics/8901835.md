This project partially supports the domestic travel of participants attending
the 1989 Gordon Research Conference on Statistics in Chemistry and Chemical
Engineering. The Gordon Research Conference Special Fund provides most of the
costs of the meeting. The conference provides an opportunity for the exchange of
new ideas among researchers in statistics, chemistry, chemical engineering and
the life sciences. Participants will come from academia, government and
industry. The topics will include, among others, design and analysis of computer
experiments in chemistry and chemical engineering as well inference and design
for spatial data.
