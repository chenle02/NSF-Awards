This award is for an REU site for 4 students to take place during the summer of
1988 at Fordham University. The research problem arises in algebraic topology,
specifically homotopy theory, a field of pure mathematics usually considered to
be well beyond the undergraduate curriculum. This question is within range of
undergraduates because it can be reduced to a computer search for certain kinds
of matrices. In algebraic topology, questions about a topological space are
translated into questions about algebraic objects, usually Abelian groups. These
Abelian groups, and homomorphisms between them, can in turn be represented as
matrices and matrix operations. This allows for computer representation and
manipulation. The undergraduates will design algorithms and implement them on a
computer to search for a certain kind of topological object, called a nilpotent
complex. By attacking the problem algorithmically, the undergraduates will
pioneer a new approach to questions about these spaces. Specifically, the
project seeks to answer an unsolved question about the existence of finite
three-dimensional nilpotent complexes.
