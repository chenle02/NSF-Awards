9255272 Wilson This proposal from Mark Wilson and Raymond Adams is intended to
develop a new testing technology that focuses on student constructed
understandings of mathematics. It is a psychometric study to develop
multidimensional models of sufficient flexibility to examine test issues of
reliability, validity, and equity. The investigators use a methodological
approach within Item Response Theory using recent performance tests carried out
in California and Melbourne Australia. The project would extend measurement
models to incorporate multidimensionality, develop computer programs to
calibrate items and raters, re-analyze performance assessments in mathematics to
study validity of each mode of assessment, and collect performance assessment
data to study longitudinal aspects of student measures.
