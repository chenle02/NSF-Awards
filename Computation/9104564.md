The principal investigator will conduct research on some analytical and
computational problems related to the Riccati transformation, the superstability
phenomenon for integration of stiff differential equations, and invariant
manifold approximation. This work involves (i) further study, implementation and
software production of reliable algorithms for integrating differential Riccati
equations, (ii) using the differential Riccati equation to perform mesh-
selection for stiff systems of two-point boundary value problems, (iii) software
production of a code for nonlinear two-point boundary value problems based on
the Riccati method. He will further study the so-called superstability
phenomenon arising during adaptive integration of stiff differential equations,
seeking efficient techniques that avoid the practical superstability occurrences
and that can be incorporated into general purpose ordinary differential equation
solvers. Finally, he will continue working on numerical approximation of
invariant manifolds, in fact on the numerical solution of the associated systems
of hyperbolic partial differential equations. This involves (i) approximation
analysis for the nonlinear case, (ii) efficient solution techniques (multigrid
approaches) for the resulting linear systems, (iii) exploitation of the link
with the Riccati transformation. Most realistic physical phenomena are modelled
by complicated nonlinear systems of differential equations. Exact solution of
these systems is hopeless, and numerical simulation is a necessity. This work
aims at producing reliable, and rigorously justified, algorithms to solve some
of these systems. The intent is to produce software tools for the working
scientist. In particular, work on the Riccati equation will be of value to
people working in Games' Theory, Optimal Control and connected Engineering
fields. The work on so-called stiff differential equations is useful in solving
systems having different time-scales, such as in chemical kinetics and
aerodynamics applications. Finally, the work on approximation of invariant
manifolds is useful in understanding the long-term behavior of nonlinear
dynamical systems. This has applications in many areas of applied science.
