This research is aimed at an understanding of the relationship between active
galactic nuclei (AGN) and giant radio galaxies, the largest known connected
objects in the universe. The variability observed in the radiation of AGN is
believed to be related to gas flows into supermassive black holed, and radio
galaxies are observed to be fed by jets which emanate from AGN. Utilizing
hydrodynamic codes on supercomputers, jet propagation through galactic and
extragalactic media will be studied.
