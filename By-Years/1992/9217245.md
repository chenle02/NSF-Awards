Oceanic waters contain predominantly the stable form of iodine (iodate), but
significant amounts of iodide are found in surface waters. Iodine is
incorporated in a reduced form into phytoplankton in the photic zone of the
ocean. Some of this iodine can be transported to oceanic sediments in
particulate organic carbon and to the atmosphere as volatile forms, but much
remains in the upperwater column where iodide accumulates due to
remineralization of particulate organic carbon. Iodide oxidation to iodate is
not an important chemical process in seawater. Preliminary results show
detectable speciation changes over a year at one location due to oceanic mixing.
This research will investigate the use iodine speciation as an indicator of
primary productivity. The changes noted above, in conjunction with sediment trap
iodine analyses, will be monitored over time at a time series location to
understand iodine and carbon cycling. Precise methods for the measurement of
both iodide and iodate are now available for a study of this type.
