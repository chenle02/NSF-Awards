This project concerns the isomorphism problem for combinatorial objects. This
is the problem of determining the complexity of deciding if two objects are
isomorphic. In the case of graphs, this problem, although not NP-complete, is
considered NP-hard. A combinatorial object is a finite set called the vertices,
and certain other sets associated with that finite set. Combinatorial objects
include graphs, designs, simplicial complexes, directed graphs, and partially
ordered sets. An isomorphism between two combinatorial objects is a one-to-one
correspondence between the two vertex sets that preserves the structure given by
the associated sets.
