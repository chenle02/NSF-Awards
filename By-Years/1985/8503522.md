Electromigration in Al-based thin films has become an important subject of study
because these films are widely used for metal interconnections in VLSI circuits
and are required to carry high current densities for circuit operation. Recent
experiments show that current (1/f) noise measurements can be used as a
sensitive tool for detecting electromigration damage and for predicting the mean
time to failure (MTF) of the films. To develop this new tool for studying
electromigration in VLSI circuits, the current noise of various Al-based thin
films which have been used in VLSI circuits will be investigated. This will be
done by measuring the temperature and current dependence of 1/f noise of these
films in different ambients, including hydrogen and inert gas ambients.
Systematic measurements will be made to relate the 1/f noise, electromigration
damage, and the MTF of the films. More information about the kinetics of
electromigration damage can be obtained from these measurements. This study will
give information for developing a new technique for predicting electromigration
damage in VLSI circuits.
