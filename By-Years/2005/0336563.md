This award provides partial support an international conference dedicated to the
phenomenon of spontaneous coherence in excitonic systems. This topic has gained
increasing attention in recent years, as a subject of fundamental interest in
solid-state optics, semiconductor nanostructures, and condensed matter theory.
The four-day conference, entitled the First International Conference on
Spontaneous Coherence in Excitonic Systems (ICSCE), will be held at the Seven
Springs Mountain Resort in Champion, Pennsylvania, from May 25-28, 2004. This
conference will allow experts in this field to network across several subfields
of physics, optical science, and engineering. Support from the NSF will provide
an opportunity for young researchers and graduate students to participate by
attending lectures, presenting posters, and discussing their research with some
of the leading international experts in the field.
