This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year nine students will work in
groups of three for nine weeks under the direction of three faculty at
Valparaiso University. The target audience will be rising sophomore and junior
students at primarily undergraduate institutions, with additional attention
given to the recruitment of first generation college students and minority
students. In particular, we will provide a first research experience for
students who are undecided about attending graduate school at the time of
participation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;By modeling the research experience of a
mathematician, the program will produce students engaged with, and prepared to
join, the mathematical community. In each proposed project, the participants
will investigate open questions of interest to the larger mathematical
community, and therefore yield potentially publishable results. The program will
emphasize the professional development of the students not only through the new
material the students will learn while conducting their research, but also by
gradually developing the presentation and writing skills of the participants. We
expect that the students will be more likely to pursue careers in mathematics
and other sciences as a result of their participation in the program.
