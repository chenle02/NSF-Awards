This research investigates issues associated with analysis, testing and
maintenance of procedural and object-oriented programs, with emphasis on the
problems presented by C and C++. Several issues of particular concern are
program representation, integration testing, selective regression testing and
testing of object-oriented programs. A program representation provides control
flow, data dependence, and control dependence information, supporting required
tools. This representation must be efficient in terms of both construction time
and storage space. Algorithms that accommodate program modifications are sought.
Integration testing techniques make use of the program representation to
validate interactions between procedures, and practical regression testing
techniques assist in retesting program after modifications. Many of these
techniques are applicable to object-oriented programs, but additional techniques
are being developed to test individual classes, selective regression testing
techniques are extended to identify the required testing in a subclass, and both
static and dynamic analysis techniques are required for the interaction among
classes. Finally, a prototype system is being built to facilitate experiments,
and methods for using the system in a distributed environment are investigated.
