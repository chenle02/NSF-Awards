Developers and researchers from the Consortium for Mathematics and Its
Applications (COMAP) and Teachers College are developing a Mathematical Modeling
Handbook to assist high school mathematics teachers as they try to integrate
mathematical modeling into their curricula. The handbook is available in both an
electronic and paper format. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Researchers at COMAP,
working with advisors from Teachers College, are creating 25 fully developed
modeling lessons that can be used and adapted by high school mathematics
teachers. Teachers have contributed to the lessons and will pilot the lessons
containing mathematical content, strategies for building and adapting
mathematical models, pedagogical ideas and mathematical applications, The
development team is also investigating how the lessons are used and working with
the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the National Council of
Supervisors of Mathematics, and the Association of State Supervisors to ensure a
broad dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Common Core State Standards in
Mathematics (CCSSM) call for the practice of mathematical modeling to be taught
in mathematics classes and this project provides a valuable resource that is not
currently available for high school teachers. The team-developed materials and
associated research on their use are examples of strategies to assist teachers
in implementing the practice standards of the CCSSM.
