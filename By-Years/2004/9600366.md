9600366 Weibel The PI will conduct a planning visit to Buenos Aires and La
Plata, Argentina to establish a collaboration with G. Cortinas of Universidad de
La Plata and O. Villamayor of Universidad de Buenos Aires in the area of
Hochschild and cyclic homology. The PI has already published with Cortinas and
will seek new directions with Villamayor and his "BACH" group within their
overlapping interests. One conjecture of interest to all three is whether the
trace map from the algebraic K-theory of a Q-algebra to its Hochschild homology
preserves the decomposition given by Adams operations; another, attributed to
Berger, deals with the module of Kaehler differentials over a regular ring. The
collaborators conduct active research programs in the proposed areas and the
questions addressed are important ones to the field. The visit will provide the
opportunity to establish a clear plan to take advantage of the combined efforts
of the three researchers. ***
