Twelve geology educators are meeting for two weeks to learn about geological
applications of fractal geometry. The workshops concentrate on six fractal
analysis techniques that are relatively simple to learn and apply, so that the
techniques may, in turn, be used in undergraduate class exercises and provide a
basis for small-scale, but productive undergraduate research projects. The
educators receive lectures on fractal geometry and fractal analysis techniques,
and read and discuss recent papers that present geological research applications
of the techniques. In addition, they also develop and carry out individual
research projects applying fractal analysis in their areas of teaching and
research interest, with the help of the University's Intergraph system, a state-
of-the-art facility for geometric data acquisition, analysis and graphics.
Mainframe or PC software versions of fractal analysis programs, along with a
semiannual newsletter, support participants' applications at their home
institutions. The home institutions of the faculty participants, as well as the
host university, are contributing to the cost of the program at an amount
approximately equal to 20% of the costs.
