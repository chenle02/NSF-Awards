9306221 Cary The project is designed to settle some questions in plasma
turbulence which center around the domain of validity of the quasilinear theory.
Recent numerical simulations suggest that the growth rate of a slowly growing
turbulent spectrum can be enhanced over the linear value. Experiments and early
simulations do not exhibit this enhancement. The numerical work to be undertaken
is designed to definitively answer the question by performing numerical
simulations using simplistic methods which are an order of magnitude faster than
currently available numerical approaches. ***
