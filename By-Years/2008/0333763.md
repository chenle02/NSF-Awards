Abstract

Award: DMS-0333763 Principal Investigator: Liviu Nicolaescu

The Great Lakes Geometry Conference will meet on April 17-18, 2004 at the
University of Notre Dame. Likely topics for talks at the meeting include gauge
theoretic methods in low-dimensional topology, symplectic and contact topology,
Gromov-Witten invariants, mirror symmetry, and Riemannian geometry. The
conference is expected to offer eight or nine sixty-minute lectures as well as
time for interactions in an informal setting.

This is the sixth in a series of conferences that run campuses in the Great
Lakes states. Financial support is particularly aimed at graduate students in
geometry and topology throughout the midwest, and the conference is intended to
provide an informal setting for graduate students and junior researchers from
the region to learn of recent trends and to interact with leaders in these
fields. After originating as a joint project of Michigan State University and
the University of Wisconsin, Great Lakes conferences have been held at other
campuses, including Northwestern University and the University of Michigan.
