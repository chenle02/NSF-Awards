Text classification is the automated assignment of text documents to pre-defined
categories/classes. Traditionally, a classifier is built using training
documents labeled (often manually) with pre-defined classes. This classifier is
then used to classify new documents into those classes. This classic model is
called supervised classification because the training documents all have pre-
labeled classes. Although this model is important, in practice it may not be
applicable in some common situations. For example, given a set of documents of a
particular class P (positive class) for training, one may want to classify a set
M of mixed (unlabeled) documents that contains documents from class P along with
other types of documents (negative documents) into documents from P and
documents not from P. Since there are no labeled negative documents, the
traditional classification techniques are inapplicable. This problem is called
partially supervised classification (PSC). Existing methods for solving PSC are
based on heuristics, which are prone to error. Researchers typically use the
evaluation method for supervised classification to evaluate PSC techniques,
which is inadequate because supervised classification approaches assume the
availability of labeled negative documents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives
of this project are to design a robust and principled technique to solve PSC,
implement a system for PSC, devise a method to evaluate such techniques, and
identify methods for determining the minimum number of labeled documents needed
to achieve the optimal accuracy in order to reduce manual labeling efforts. The
algorithms and systems developed by this project will be used in a graduate
course and put on the Web for other researchers to use in their research and
teaching. The results of this research should be widely useful because the
identification of targeted information/documents is of great value in this
information age. &lt;br/&gt;
