TERC and the Girl Scouts of America are partnering to create an energy
monitoring and conservation after school program for approximately 5,500 girls
ages 8-11 in eastern Massachusetts. The goals of the Girls Energy Conservation
Corps (GECCo) after school project are to involve girls in learning and applying
science, using technology, developing leadership and communication skills,
educating peers, saving energy, and addressing the global issue of climate
change. The project is (1) developing activity-based Energy Detective Kits to
help girls understand, monitor, and reduce energy use, (2) adapting devices for
measuring home electricity consumption, and (3) developing guidelines for using
new media (such as YouTube) to engage girls in science and helping them use new
media to inform and communicate their experiences and findings to Girl Scouts
nationally. Project participants are cumulatively reducing their energy
consumption and adopting more sustainable lifestyles.
