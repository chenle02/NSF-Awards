ABSTRACT STI-9413933 Welch, William J. This project will increase the number of
antennas in the Berkeley, Illinois, Maryland Association (BIMA) Array from nine
to 11, thereby increasing its speed and sensitivity, and will increase the
angular resolution of the array to 0.1" (HST resolution) by adding stations
which produce one kilometer baselines both East-West and North- South. Optical
fiber will be used to interconnect them. Much of the unique and important
science to arise from millimeter interferometers has resulted from their
superior spatial resolution compared to large single antennas. Current
millimeter arrays are limited to resolutions of 1.5" to 3" by the maximum
available separations between antennas. However, this resolution is not a
fundamental limit. Extrapolation from experience with current millimeter arrays
suggests that observations should be successful on several kilometer baselines
during good weather. The important new science that this development will enable
includes adequate resolution to fully image star formation, the study of rich
interstellar chemistry in distant clouds, imaging Active Galactic Nuclei, and
imaging the important smaller members of the solar system. ***
