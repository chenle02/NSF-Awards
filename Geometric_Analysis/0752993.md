Moduli theory is one of the central parts of algebraic geometry, cantered around
the phenomenon that in many cases objects of algebraic geometry (for instance
algebraic curves) are parametrized by an object of algebraic geometry (such a
sthe moduli space of curves). The past 15 years have witnessed an explosion of
activity in this area. It interacts extensively with other area: besides the
rest of algebraic geometry, it has very important intersections with complex
analysis, symplectic geometry, string theory, homotopy theory, geometric
topology.

A workshop and conference titled ``Aspects of Moduli Theory'' is organized, to
be held June 15-28 at the de Giorgi Center in Pisa, Italy. This activity is
meant to offer a wide view of many aspects of the field. It will be split into
two parts. The first week will consist of a summer school, in which high level
experts will teach five courses on recent and very important advances in the
subject. During the first part of each course he teacher will present the
necessary background material, making it accessible to graduate students and
beginning researchers. During the second week a regular conference will take
place.

The program aims to impact a considerable number of advanced graduate students
and post-doctoral fellows who will attend this program.
