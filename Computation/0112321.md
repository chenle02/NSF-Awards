INTERPHASE is a series of meetings, devoted mainly to numerical and
computational aspects of free boundary problems, which have been held
successfully once a year in Europe for the past 8 years. The apparent
misspelling of INTERPHASE is supposed to emphasize the chief purpose of this
meeting: facilitate the communication and exchange of ideas and methods between
communities (`phases') of scientists and engineers that otherwise may not
interact and thus profit from each other. In fact, interfaces arise in a variety
of applications from materials science and fluid dynamics, to image processing
and finance, which may not have any common roots and goals but however are
described by similar partial differential equations and thereby present
analogous difficulties, challenges, and methodology.

The 9th conference of the series will be held in College Park, MD, in September
2001 with the intention of encouraging more participation of US researchers and
stimulating the exchange of ideas between American and European peers in the
area of problems where there is an interface between regions of interest. We
plan to have about 30 senior speakers, 12 junior speakers, and a poster session.
