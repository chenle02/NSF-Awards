0129236 Tandy This award supports Peter Tandy and students from Kent State
University in a collaboration with Reinhard Alkofer of the Department of
Theoretical Physics at the University of Tuebingen, Germany. The project focuses
on hadronic processes in terms of confined quarks and gluons by bringing
together two presently disparate lines of investigation. The US side has
expertise in continuum nonperturbative QCD modeling of hadrons using the Dyson-
Schwinger equations. To be useful, the results must be packaged in the form of
model solutions of the gauge sector Dyson-Schwinger equations for at least the
gluon and ghost-dressed propagators and the gluon-quark vertex. This is exactly
the expertise of the German group. They have recently produced the most advanced
solutions of truncat4ed forms of the gauge sector Dyson-Schwinger equations and
have found unexpected behavior that relates to the origin of quark confinement
and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. The project has the potential to impact
the search for quark-gluon plasma, nuclear astrophysics, early universe
cosmology, and strongly interacting field theory. The work plan provides for
extensive participation by graduate students in the international
