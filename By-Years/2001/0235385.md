Scientists often use models based on the climatic tolerances of species
("bioclimatic models") to predict the spread of newly introduced exotic species
and to predict how the geographic ranges of species will change in response to
climate change. Although such models are conceptually simple and widely used,
many scientists object to bioclimatic models because they ignore interactions
between species (like predation and competition), the genetic structure of
species, dispersal, complex relationships among climatic variables, and ranges
that are not in equilibrium with climate. Despite their importance and potential
flaws, scientists have not evaluated the actual performance of bioclimatic
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I will use information on the spread of exotic
species in Europe and North America to test the performance of bioclimatic
models. I will select a wide range of species that have been introduced between
the two continents and construct bioclimatic models based on the distribution of
each species in its native range. These bioclimatic models will then be applied
to predict the range of each species in the continent to which it was
introduced. The predicted range will be compared to the actual range using
several statistical measures, which will reveal the actual predictive abilities
of bioclimatic models and diagnose likely causes of
failures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
