The goal of this award is to elucidate the reactivities and mechanisms of two
newly discovered haloperoxidase metalloenzymes, a vanadium bromoperoxidase
(V-BrPO) and a non-heme iron (III) bromoperoxidase (FeNH-BrPO) which are both
isolated from marine algae. V-BrPO and FeNH-BrPO are the first non-heme
haloperoxidases to be discovered. Experiments are planned to test whether each
metal ion functions as a Lewis acid catalyst or as an electron transfer
catalyst, shuttling between different oxidation states. Both V-BrPO and FeNH-
BrPO catalyze the bromination of pyrimidine- containing nucleic acids, cytosine
and uracil. The reactivities of the two enzymes will be studied in terms of a)
the types of organic compounds that can be brominated, b) the catalase and
superoxide dismutase activity of the enzymes and c) the mechanism of reoxidation
of the reduced derivatives of the enzymes. Halogenated organic compounds occur
widely in marine organisms. Some of them have exciting biological activity. They
represent a valuable, but neglected natural resource. The proposed research will
help us understand how the myriad halogenated compounds are formed.
