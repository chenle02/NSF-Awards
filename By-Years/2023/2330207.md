The Workshop on Modeling & Simulation of Systems and Applications (ModSim) is an
annual event that brings together researchers from academia, industry, and
government to discuss the latest developments and trends in modeling and
simulation. The 2023 ModSim workshop will focus on Disruptive Technologies,
exploring the latest developments and trends in computing and modeling, as well
as the challenges and opportunities that come with them.

Attending the ModSim workshop will provide students with several benefits,
including the opportunity to network with colleagues from around the world,
present and receive feedback on their research, and learn about the latest
developments in ModSim. This funding will help to increase the diversity of
attendees at the workshop, by providing travel grants to students who may not
have been able to attend otherwise. This will promote the participation of
underrepresented groups in the ModSim research community, leading to a more
inclusive and collaborative field. Approximately 13 students will attend the
workshop and benefit from its educational and networking opportunities.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
