This project introduces state-of-the-art remote sensing and geographic
information system technology to geography, geology, and biology students.
Computer hardware and software are utilized in two geography laboratory courses.
The equipment will also be used in various geology laboratory courses as well as
in biology laboratory courses. The computing equipment will be used to display
and process remotely sensed data and other forms of spatial data for a variety
of applications including land cover/land use analysis, vegetation mapping,
mineral exploration, and geologic mapping. The grantee provides funds for this
project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
