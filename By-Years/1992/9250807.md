A computer laboratory is being created for undergraduate ordinary differential
equations. The goals of the project are: (1) to introduce the students to modern
computational and symbolic methods for solving differential equations (2) to
increase the understanding of qualitative and geometric behavior of differential
equations, and (3) to develop the students' ability to derive and interpret
mathematical models. Students will be encouraged to tackle open-ended problems
as well as the more standard problems that have closed form solutions.
