9309172 Ciric This project explores the steady state of multiplicity and
stability of exothermic reactive distillation columns via a three part study.
The first part of the study unravels the role physical properties play in steady
state multiplicity using a multiparameter homotopic continuation technique. The
second part of the study evaluates the stability of a reactive distillation
column, This analysis is complicated by a logical relationship between the
amount of liquid runoff and the rate of change of the liquid holdup on a
distillation tray. This logical relationship creates discontinuities in the
dynamic model, and as a consequence, conventional eigenvalue analysis techniques
are inappropriate. An alternative optimization based stability test is proposed
that readily incorporates the discontinuities. this optimization based stability
test will also be used to find points of marginal stability for a bifurcation
diagram. The third part of the research tests the numerical predictions with
physical experiments. ***
