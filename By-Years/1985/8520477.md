The deterioration of masonry structures throughout the country is becoming a
major problem of concern for the general public. To extend the life of the
building or to upgrade it, economical techniques to repair and/or strengthen the
building are required. This workshop is a joint effort between Italian and
United States engineers to exchange ideas, methods, research data, and related
experiences on the subject of evaluation and strengthening of masonry buildings
of all types. The Italians have had a long history of maintaining masonry
structures of all types and engineers in the United States can benefit from that
experience. The proceedings produced by the workshop will be very useful to
engineers and architects in the United States because it will convey the most
recent information on the evaluation and strengthening of masonry structures.
