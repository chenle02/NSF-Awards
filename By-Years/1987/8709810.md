Some technologies (such as space exploration, air travel, and electric power
generation) offer significant benefits to society, but have severe consequences
of failure, as demonstrated by such accidents as with the space shuttle
Challenger and the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. The need for highly reliable use
of such technologies requires a disciplined approach to risk management in
design, construction, and operations, particularly when several groups are
involved in safety-related decisions. This interdisciplinary study is designed
to incorporate organizational effects into classical reliability assessment. It
will generate one quantitative measure of organizational effectiveness by
assessing how such factors as hierarchical structure, incentives, and protocols
for distributed decision-making can affect the physical risk. The national air
traffic control system is the proposed application. Of particular interest is
the formation of safety thresholds (the maximum allowable failure probability
for all or part of the system) or the different groups involved; the way in
which the standards evolve as system operation becomes routine (for example,
drift toward laxity); and the effect of such variations on the overall system
reliability.
