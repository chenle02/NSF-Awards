High Dimensional Statistical Theory for Sparse Regularization

The investigator studies statistical machine learning with sparse
regularization in the setting of high dimensional statistical estimation. A
number of research directions will be explored, including improved performance
bounds for sparse regularization, new sparse learning formulations, and the
statistical theory for several important computational algorithms.

In the information age, more and more data become available electronically, and
these data need to be automatically analyzed by computers in order to filter out
the most important information. Statistical machine learning is the main
technical tool for analyzing electronic data. Many modern applications involve
data in very high dimension that cannot be handled by traditional algorithms.
Sparse regularization is an important new statistical machine learning technique
that can deal with this issue by effectively identifying the most significant
patterns from a vast amount of available information. This research develops new
sparse regularization algorithms that will significantly enhance the capability
for modern computer systems to find critical information from available
electronic data.
