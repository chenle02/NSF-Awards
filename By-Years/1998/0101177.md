This proposal describes planned activities that will build a strong, ongoing
relationship between the Physics Department at Southern University (SU) in Baton
Rouge, LA and the LIGO Laboratory. The program has two major components: first,
the study of impurities in materials of interest to LIGO for advanced detector
optics; and second, an educational and research program for SU students together
with an outreach program in collaboration with the LIGO Livingston Observatory
(LLO) to inform and educate students of all ages about basic science in general,
and the LIGO search for gravity waves in particular. In addition, the proposal
looks forward to an interesting analysis program to correlate gamma ray bursts
(observed for a number of years, but still not understood) with gravity waves
that LIGO expects to observe when the LIGO upgrade is completed. The proximity
of LLO to the SU campus ( it is about 50 miles from SU) greatly enhances the
outreach program since students will have access to research projects at LLO
while they are enrolled in classes at SU.
