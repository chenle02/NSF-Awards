In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Mark A. Johnson of Yale University will continue and extend his
research in the development of a general spectroscopy for anion-molecule
complexes. Weakly bound excited states of ion-molecule complexes of the type
(X-).CH3Y will be investigated by high resolution spectroscopy to obtain
structures of nucleophilic substitution reaction intermediates. For this purpose
a pulsed field detachment method is to be developed as a general spectroscopic
tool. The goals of this research are the determination of the equilibrium
geometries of the complexes, to achieve selective excitation of the complexes
near the transition states for Walden inversion, to determine detailed reaction
rates for laser-triggered reactions and the measurement of product recoil
kinetic energy distributions, and to extend these methods to solvated reaction
intermediates. Molecular level reaction theory is at the forefront of
contemporary research in physical chemistry. Reactions involve excited
electronic states of single molecules, ions, as well as of molecular and ion-
molecule complexes. The transition state that lies between the reactants and the
products is of prime concern and this research is concerned with developing
suitable methods for its investigation. The overall aim of this investigation is
to obtain a better understanding of reaction dynamics.
