JILA (formerly Joint Institute of Laboratory Astrophysics) and the Department of
Physics at the University of Colorado continue to offer an REU summer program
introducing 12-15 undergraduates to active, ongoing physics research. The 30
participating faculty are well recognized contributors to the fields of Atomic,
Molecular and Optical Physics, Biophysics, Chemical Physics, Condensed Matter
Physics, Elementary Particle Physics, Geophysics, and Gravitational physics.
Special efforts are made to include significant participation levels from women
and minorities, as well as from students coming from smaller institutions that
do not have as many research opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the
main emphasis of the summer is centered around each student's individual
research lab, where the students are expected to master at least a part of a
large task, a variety of other activities are planned for the summer. Highly
successful electronics and machining classes are offered in the first two weeks
of the program, and weekly seminar series, lab tours, and field trips round out
the program. &lt;br/&gt;
