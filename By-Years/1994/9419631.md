9419631 CLARK This is an experimental and theoretical study of variation in
biochemical traits that are related through metabolic pathways. The experimental
system focuses on the maintenance of lipid and glycogen stores in Drosophila
melanogaster. The investigator, Dr. Andrew Clark will quantify lipid and
glycogen storage, along with the activities of 12 enzymes in associated
biosynthetic and degradative pathways, to perform large-scale quantitative
genetic studies of these traits. There is much theory dealing with enzymes in
biochemical pathways. An objective is to develop the evolutionary genetic
aspects of this theory and to test the fit of the theory to the model system of
energy storage in Drosophila. The idea that observed levels of phenotypic
variation in populations arise from a balance between mutation inflating the
variance and stabilizing selection restricting it has considerable appeal. But
attempts to estimate the necessary parameters have revealed discrepancies.
Theoreticians have shifted their focus toward pleiotropic effects of mutations
as a possible explanation for heritable variation, and this experimental system
is well-suited to test these ideas.
