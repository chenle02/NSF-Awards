This Clark Atlanta University program seeks to provide intellectually
challenging experiences in classroom instruction and hands-on research
experiences in the biological sciences and chemistry for 30 students entering
grades 8-12. The six-week program is for residential and commuting students in a
Young Scholars Program designed to increase their interest and knowledge about
career opportunities in the mathematical and natural sciences. The participants
will also be made aware of the academic preparation required to pursue these
careers through classroom instruction, weekly seminars, and field trips.
Participants in grades 10-12 will spend 75% of their work day in research
laboratories as members of on-going research teams consisting of research
professors, graduate and undergraduate students. Participants in grades 8 and 9
will enroll in a laboratory-based, interdisciplinary science course that
emphasizes research methodology, problem solving and critical thinking. Academic
year follow-up activities represent a critical component of the program.
