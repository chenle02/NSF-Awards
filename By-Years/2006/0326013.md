This project will develop algorithms, run time support, and software
infrastructure for scalable biological modeling will be developed, based on
MCell, a general Monte Carlo &lt;br/&gt;simulator of cellular microphysiology,
and Tarragon, a run-time environment for optimized asynchronous parallel
computing. This project matches the underlying &lt;br/&gt;asynchronous dynamics
of Monte Carlo simulations to a corresponding model of execution and the ability
to alter scheduling accordingly. Thus, the outcome will be novel programming
methodology and a run-time library for large-scale biological simulations, and,
more generally, &lt;br/&gt;increased knowledge about software techniques in
support of scheduling and latency-tolerant formulation. &lt;br/&gt;
