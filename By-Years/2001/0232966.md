The goal of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is
to determine the feasibility of leveraging existing weather and communication
systems to provide location-specific, detailed, automatic, and continuous
weather information nationwide to the general public. The project will determine
the feasibility of using an existing nationwide communication system in a novel
manner to augment regional weather broadcasts. It will also determine the
features and capabilities that must be included to make the commercial system
user friendly and autonomous. The commercial implementation of this research is
expected to provide the traveling public with weather information presented by
portable units suitable for personal use in automobiles, aircraft, and pleasure
boats.
