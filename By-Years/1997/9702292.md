This research explores methods and techniques for a design and simulation
environment with the target application being high performance and high
frequency communication circuits. Within the simulation environment a designer
will have access to a suite of models of varying accuracy and to analysis
capabilities that address the needs of high frequency design. The analysis
capabilities include periodic-steady state solution for RF circuits, calculation
of noise and distortion in the periodic-steady state, substrate coupling and
electrothermal interactions. The research is partitioned into three areas: (i)
development of new analysis capabilities for an integrated device-circuit-
behavioral simulation environment; (ii) improvement of simulator performance so
that it is valuable to designers of high performance and/or high frequency
analog circuits, and (iii) application of the simulator to realistic design
problems with particular emphasis on RFICs. A virtual lab environment is being
developed to provide students training in circuit/device simulation and tool
development with applications to real life design examples.
