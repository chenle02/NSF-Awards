9313052 Ellis This is an award to support research, the objective of which is to
devise mathematical models with stochastic, multiobjective and visual attributes
that are capable of being used to address environmental problems more complex
and on a scale larger than is now possible. The investigator plans on developing
parallel developing parallel approaches to devise models that address more than
a single objective simultaneously and that incorporate into the models
stochasticity and interactive visual interfaces. He plans on applying the models
developed to deal with environmental problems such as the design of air
pollution monitoring networks that consider intermedia transfer of pollutants
from air to water and to determine the way in which this approach could be used
in management of groundwater quality. Results of this research are expected to
include its application in engineering design of systems for abatement of air
and water pollution and in evaluating the ecological consequences that result
from emissions trading concepts, a current attribute of approaches for dealing
with abatement of air pollution and which is being considered for water as well.
Results of this project are expected to be utilized in design of approaches to
dealing with environmental problems on a scale that is more consistent with
scope of the problems than is now possible to address with existing
environmental models.
