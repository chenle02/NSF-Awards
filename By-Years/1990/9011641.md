Professor Papanicolaou will use probabilistic and analytic methods to
investigate certain questions concerning the Schroedinger equation. He will try
to estimate the total size of the gaps in the spectrum of a Schroedinger
operator with a bounded and smooth potential. He will study the dependence of
zeroes of the Green's function on the spatial and spectral variables. He has
defined a complex rotation number for multidimensional Schroedinger operators
and will now investigate its geometric properties. In addition he will
investigate the short time asymptotic behavior of heat kernels and apply the
results to inverse problems. The Schroedinger equation finds its most useful
application in nonrelativistic quantum physics but is also an area of intensive
investigation from a pure mathematics point of view. In the realm of physics,
this equation describes a tremendously wide variety of systems, from simple
atoms and molecules to large aggregates like a piece of glass or a
superconductor. The research described above will help in the understanding of
such systems by providing a more thorough comprehension of the basic mathematics
which describe these systems.
