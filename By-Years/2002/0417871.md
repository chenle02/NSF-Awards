PROJECT ABSTRACT Identity and the Economics of Organizational Behavior

This project will integrate economic theory and practice with significant
findings in sociology and psychology by considering the implications of the
concept of identity for economics. It will yield a better understanding of the
relation between economics and human motivation, especially within groups and
organizations. This perspective will increase our understanding of gender
discrimination, minority poverty, academic achievement in schools, the division
of labor in households, the role and impact of corporate governance, and the
role of compensation as incentive. Especially, it incorporates into economics
the concept of the fiduciary, thereby giving economists a new perspective on the
role and meaning of organizational governance. In addition, this work suggests a
major role for organizational leadership in encouraging workers' identification
with their jobs and with their organizations.

The project will further show theoretically that many of the non-economic
motives for obedience can be naturally captured in identity modeling.
Psychological experiments have shown that even in the absence of economic
reward, subjects are surprisingly willing to obey experimenters. The project
will explore such findings in a new context, that of economic-style laboratory
experiments. It expects to find identity-related reasons for obedience, and also
to establish the circumstances under which such behavior is likely to occur.
Such identity-related non-economic motivations for obedience would suggest a
likely role of identity-related motivation in broader contexts, outside the
laboratory. Such behavior is likely to be of great importance for a wide range
of social policy: from the proper stance toward corporate governance to the
proper remedies for minority poverty.
