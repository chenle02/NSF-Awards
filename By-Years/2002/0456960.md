Tropical geometry, the study of piecewise-linear spaces which represent
algebraic varieties over a field with a non-archimedean valuation; phylogenetic
algebraic geometry, the study of unirational algebraic varieties derived from
statistical models on phylogenetic trees; maximum likelihood degree, which is a
new invariant of a variety in projective n-space with a distinguished divisor
defined by the intersection with n+2 hyperplanes; toric varieties arising from
matroids, which is aimed at resolving basic open questions at the interface of
combinatorics and commutative algebra.

The field of computational algebraic geometry is concerned with the algorithmic
study of solution sets to systems of algebraic equations, and with the
development of polynomial models in science and engineering. For instance, many
widely used statistical models in biological sequence analysis can be specified
by polynomial constraints. Phylogenetic algebraic geometry concerns this
algebraic representation and its implications for the construction of maximum
likelihood trees. The ensuing interaction between algebraic geometry and
phylogenetics is a healthy two-way street: computational biologists may benefit
from new algebraic tools, while algebraic geometers find a rich source of new
problems concerning objects familiar from classical projective geometry. The
maximum likelihood degree of a statistical model quantities the algebraic
complexity of a fundamental problem in estimation, namely, to identify the
parameters of a model which best explain the observed data. The work in tropical
geometry will solidify the foundations of this new field, and it will lead to
new methods for solving systems of algebraic equations numerically.
