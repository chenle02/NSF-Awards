This is a proposal for continued work on the mantle section of the Oman
ophiolite by the PIs and a PhD student whose salary is the major item requested
in this proposal. The study is focused on the study of dunite veins and the
student (Michael Braun) will measure their size, distribution, abundance,
microstructures, and, in the lab, their compositions. The aim is to provide
quantitative constrains on how MORB magma is extracted from the mantle, the
fluid dynamics of reactive porous flow during melt migration through the mantle,
and how these processes affect mantle rheology. Specifically, these new studies
will approach the question of how much melt has flowed through harzburgite as
they travel in dunite channels. The main idea is to test between two possible
origins of the dunites; reaction haloes around cracks vs. diffusive
infiltration. This work complements studies by the PIs of the lower crust
sections in Oman and has application for studies of the origin of ocean crust.
