This project consists of a set of studies addressing the issue of acidity in
zeolites and related materials. Intermediates in H-ZSM-5 are studied
spectroscopically - nuclear magnetic resonance being the prime tool - to
characterize species whose stoichiometry and reactivity have been established
separately; the objectives are the determination of the structure of the
intermediates, the nature of their interactions with the zeolite lattice, and
the barrier heights for them to undergo further transformations. The effect of
various dealumination procedures and the roles of framework and nonframework
aluminum concentrations are examined by preparation of and investigation of the
acidity of a series of well-characterized H-Y zeolites; acidity surrogates used
include temperature- programmed desorption and thermal gravimetric analysis of
amines, alkane cracking, and alkali-metal poisoning. A series of metal-
substituted ZSM-5 and ALPO-5 molecular series are prepared and examined to
determine the relative acid strengths of these materials and to determine the
necessary conditions for maintaining the metal ions in the framework. Zeolites
are already widely used in the petroleum and chemicals industries both as
catalysts and separations media. Despite this, factors influencing their
performance are poorly understood. This work promises an approach to more
rational design for applications of zeolites and related framework materials,
better quality control over synthetic zeolites, and possible new applications of
known or new framework materials in chemical processing, environmental control,
and other areas.
