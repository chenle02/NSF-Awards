This proposal investigates recently discovered algebraic structures which
enhance our understanding of quantum field theory and the renormalization group.
Kreimer will investigate number theoretic aspects of quantum field theory and
their interplay with Hopf algebra structures, with an emphasis on applications
to non-perturbative results. Rosenberg will work on the connection between
differential geometry and quantum field theory, as suggested by the Birkhoff
decomposition in renormalization theory and their corresponding flat
connections. Jaffe will extend the methods of constructive field theory in light
of these recent developments.

In general, this work investigates the mathematical structure of quantum field
theory (QFT) and the renormalization group. These are theoretical concepts which
underlie the study of matter in phase transitions (e.g. boiling, freezing) as
well as physics at the highest energies. While the mathematics behind QFT is
still not well understood after fifty years of research, the predicative power
of QFT in the laboratory is remarkable for its accuracy. Kreimer and his
collaborators have discovered algebraic and combinatorial mathematical
structures underlying basic QFT computations, which substantially simplify these
calculations. In this research, we will both further the theoretical
understanding of these concepts as well as investigate new applications.
