This research program concentrates on studies of collision processes relevant to
the physics and chemistry of low- temperature plasmas used in processing. Four
different areas of emphasis are pursued: collisional and spectroscopic studies
involving silicon-organic compounds; LIF studies of neutral ground-state
dissociation fragments; electron collisions with C-60 and C-70; and modeling of
plasma-wall interactions and wall recombination processes. The results of the
work will contribute to the fundamental understanding of basic plasma processes
as well as provide information necessary for the utilization of plasmas in
processing applications.
