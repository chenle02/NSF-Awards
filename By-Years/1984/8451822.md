This research program explores the use of computer tools for VLSI. One problem
being studied is expediting the synthesis-verification cycle inherent in
computer-aided design. In all large designs, a substantial portion of effort is
made implementing and verifying design changes. Although tools are available to
aid in checking the design, these tools start the verification from scratch each
time they are run. By designing a verification tool that accepts changes to the
design interactively, it is possible to reduce the time and cost required to
design integrated circuits. In addition to working on methods to improve tool
performance, the research is looking at tools to improve chip performance. Using
background information in both circuit design and CAD tools, methods are
investigated to incorporate design knowledge initially into analysis tools, with
the ultimate goal of incorporating these ideas into synthesis tools.
