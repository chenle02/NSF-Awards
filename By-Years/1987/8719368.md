Continued field and lab studies of the Maclaren metamorphic belt are proposed
to determine the thermal and tectonic history of these rocks, which occur in a
suture zone between accreted terranes in South-central Alaska. The belt is an
example of inverted metamorphic rocks which grade upward in temperature.
Syntectonic tonalite sills are associated with the higher grade rocks but the
thermal gradient is interpreted as being caused by thrusting of hot, deeper
crust rocks over a thick sediment package during continent - continent
collision. They are exposed by subsequent uplift and erosion. The aim of the
research is to determine P-T history from which magnitude of uplift can be
estimated. Ar-Ar geochronology will be used to estimate uplift rates. These
results will be used to interpret the tectonic history and causes for heating.
