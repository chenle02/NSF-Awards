Dr. Lakowicz plans to continue his research in equipment design and
development, methods of analysis and the application of frequency-domain
fluorescence spectroscopy to the study of proteins, membranes and nucleic acids.
There is considerable interest in the dynamic properties of proteins, membranes
and nucleic acids. This interest is the result of molecular dynamics
calculations on proteins, a variety of experimental measurements of the dynamics
of proteins and nucleic acids, and a need to relate the measured properties to
the functional behavior of these macromolecule. The characteristic timescale of
fluorescence spectroscopy is well suited for quantifying the dynamics of these
systems.***
