The North Carolina Super-computing Center (NCSC) is conducting a three-week
Summer Institute which emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of computational
science by recruiting teams of faculty members from the same institution in the
disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and the physical or life sciences.
During the Summer Institute, participants receive a firm grounding in the
principles and practice of computational science. Special training in super-
computing, parallel computing, and visualization are incorporated into the
schedule. The program includes continuous support and coordination through use
of NCSC's advanced interactive video network, access to the high-performance
computing and visualization environment at NCSC, and mentors at top research
universities who work with the participants throughout the year.
