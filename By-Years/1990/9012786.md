Under a previous grant, the PI developed a very sensitive all-sky camera for
imaging selected faint emissions from the night sky that reveal important
processes in the upper atmosphere. This camera was developed to support the
CEDAR initiative aimed at better understanding the coupling, energetics and
dynamics of atmosphere retions. The CEDAR Class-I Imaging System is now a fully-
operational system located on the Millstone Hill Radar/Haystack Observatory
complex in Westford, MA. The image- intensified CCD imaging system will operate
15 nights/month compiling a multi-wavelength database containing a rich variety
of sub-auroral ionosphere. A small effort in equatorial aeronomy using data sets
obtained by other means is included. All of these studies merge optical,
incoherent scatter radar and other radio and satellite observations consistent
with CEDAR campaign science objectives. Fabrication of a Class-I imaging
spectrograph and investigation of a new CCD detector for imaging are the major
instrumentation components of the program.
