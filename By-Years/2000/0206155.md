Project PEERS builds on the PACTS program for minority middle school and high
school students in the District of Philadelphia. It is designed to offer a
citywide model for service learning in environmental research and public
engagement that meets the promotion and graduation requirements of students at
grades 8-12. The students will meet at the Franklin Institute for a maximum of
six hours per week. During the summers students will attend a six-week intensive
program (including five mornings per week for three and a half-hour sessions on
environmental science workshops, laboratory and online research, and
webspace/video development). For two afternoons a week students will conduct
research at the Centennial Lake Research site.

This project has three components to service learning: science learning and
research, community service, and public engagement. The project will engage
approximately 300 students, 150 of whom will complete the district requirements
for service learning. An additional 2,000 students and adults will participate
in the activities.
