9302095 Lam This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program award will support
travel, lodging, and communication expenses for six U.S. participants in a First
International Conference on Complex Systems in Computational Physics, to be held
in Buenos Aires October 18-22, 1993. The U.S. organizer is Luis Lam of San Jose
State University and Guillermo Marshall of the National Atomic Energy Commission
(CNEA) in Argentina. The conference will bring together 200 participants and 24
speakers from the U.S., Latin America, Europe, and Japan to review significant
developments and present new research results of complex systems in
computational physics, in the context of very large scientific computation. Such
systems include fractals, chaos, pattern formation, neural nets, and cellular
automata. All sides will benefit from the opportunity to exchange information
and identify research priorities. In particular, U.S.-Argentina collaborative
research ties in the area of complex systems are likely to be strengthened. ***
