Past instrumental and proxy records of climate are relatively scarce for the
middle to high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. Yet this highly oceanic
region is a key to larger-scale climatic change, in ways that are fundamentally
different from comparable northern latitudes. Climatically-sensitive,
absolutely-dated annual tree-ring chronologies have been developed for time-
spans ranging from recent centuries to the past millennium for the three
forested land areas at southern middle latitudes: Tierra del Fuego, Tasmania and
New Zealand. However this data has yet to be fully exploited in large-scale
studies of climate change. Prior research has demonstrated the value of using
tree-ring data as indicators of past atmosphere-ocean interaction at sites
around the globe. This award supports the utilization of these southern tree-
ring records to model and reconstruct indices of atmospheric and oceanic
parameters of climatic variability in the subantarctic sector. These new data
will allow us to evaluate the Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Epoch at these
latitudes, and how recent and possible future greenhouse warming relates to past
patterns of natural climate variability for this part of the Southern
Hemisphere.
