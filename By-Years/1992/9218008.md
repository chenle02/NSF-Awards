Research on stars which show surface activity analogous to the solar
chromosphere will be continued using instrumentation developed at Pennsylvania
State University. Types of stars to be studied include BY Dra stars, RS CVn
stars, weak-lined T Tau stars and classical T Tau stars. An archive of about two
thousand spectra has been built up over a period of years and will be exploited
in this research along with new data to be acquired. New instrumentation is also
planned for infrared observations with the goal of measuring magnetic fields in
stars.
