This project takes advantage of the proximity of the ALLEGRO resonant bar
gravitational wave detector at LSU to the LIGO Livingston Observatory to search
for a stochastic background of gravitational radiation. The new ability of the
ALLEGRO bar to rotate allows the introduction of a modulation to the signal by
alternately aligning and mis-aligning the bar with the LIGO interferometer. This
gives the signal a definite periodicity and distinguishes it from any correlated
noise that does not have the expected quadrupolar spatial dependence of the
gravitational radiation. Undergraduate students from Loyola University will
participate in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A stochastic background of
gravitational radiation could be a relic of the early Universe, produced by
inflation or a phase transition. The current limits on such a background are
very loosely constrained. Thus any observation or upper limit placed on a
stochastic background of gravitational waves could bring new information about
the Universe.
