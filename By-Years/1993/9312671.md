This research is part of our continued effort to extend a background calibration
principle to common multi-step/pipelined ADC's. The basic idea is to replace a
component trimming procedure usually done in the factory by a hidden electronic
real-time calibration circuit running in background. Unlike other calibration
techniques running in the foreground, this technique is based on dithering and
nonlinear interpolation. The goal is to improve the performance of inherently
fast ADC's by maintaining simple system architectures that perform a
sophisticated trimming operation in background. The generic research on lower-
power design using a recycled residue amplifier and capacitive reference divider
will help develop a family of high-performance analog digital interface circuits
with low power and premium speeds not readily available in monolithic forms.
