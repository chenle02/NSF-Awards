The primary focus of this exploratory research study is to investigate the work-
life balance policies at North Carolina A&amp;T State University, as well as
other minority serving institutions of higher education, to promote the success
of STEM women faculty of color. The project will: 1) expand the NCA&amp;T STEM
gender equity focus to include an emphasis on work-life equilibrium for STEM
women faculty of color and 2) develop a rubric, appropriate to the HBCU context,
to support the institutionalization of an HBCU Institutional Policy Matrix.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative effort between the North Carolina
A&amp;T University ADVANCE Program and the recently NSF-funded Gender Values
project, which has as its focus to implement widespread use of a mechanism for
collecting and cataloguing institutional family friendly policies and practices
as a function of levels of institutionalization and consideration for
inclusivity. This collaboration represents an effort to provide institutions of
higher education with a practical and tactical blueprint for promoting flexible
workplace policies and practices for STEM women faculty of color at the level of
precision required for dramatic change and sustained impact.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will contribute significantly to
advancing the national discussion and discourse on matters related to achieving
gender friendly climates in the academy, particularly as they relate to the STEM
fields. A major outcome will be the HBCU Institutional Policy Matrix that can
potentially serve as a featured contribution to the NSF Career Life Balance
website, providing guidance to researchers and evaluators about the assessment
of the integrity of existing institutional policies and their potential to
support STEM women faculty of color.
