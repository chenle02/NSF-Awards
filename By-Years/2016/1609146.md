This project is funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the
Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation. Professors Samuel Thomas
and Charles Mace of Tufts University, together with Professor Rajesh Menon of
the University of Utah, are developing several new types of light-emitting nano-
sized materials that respond to the molecule singlet oxygen. Singlet oxygen is
an important molecule in light-driven processes such as photodynamic therapy and
damage to plants upon overexposure to sunlight. One important outcome of this
research is improved detection of singlet oxygen. Another important outcome of
this research is better fundamental understanding of how the composition of
fluorescent nano-sized materials affect their light emission properties and
detection performance. This is important for other applications of light-
emitting nano-sized materials. The broader impacts of this work include societal
benefit from improved performance and reliability of analytical measurements
involving fluorescent nanomaterials, and improved active learning of students in
organic chemistry courses at Tufts University through a Peer-Led Team Learning
(PLTL) pilot.

The goal of this proposal is to understand how the compositions of different
fluorescent nanomaterials influence their response to singlet oxygen and yield
generally applicable comparisons of key characteristics such as energy transfer
efficiency, as well as improvements to the unsolved problems of singlet oxygen
sensing and imaging. The objectives of this proposal are: 1) Prepare and
characterize the fluorescence spectroscopy and energy transfer characteristics
of three classes of water-dispersible singlet oxygen-reactive nanomaterials?i)
conjugated polymer nanoparticles, ii) quantum dots, and iii) block copolymer
micelles, and 2) In collaboration between PIs at Tufts and University of Utah,
determine how the classes and compositions of these nanomaterials affect
performance in: i) singlet oxygen detection, ii) use of singlet oxygen as a
secondary analyte in bioassays, and iii) photoactivated fluorescence.
