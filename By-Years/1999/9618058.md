9618058 Thiel This is a three-year project to create a series of
microbiologically-based modules with appropriate instructional materials for
teachers. The high quality instructional materials are to reflect a real-world
focus and relate to the industrial applications of biology. One goal of this
proposal is to make science accessible and interesting to all high school
students, regardless of their academic abilities or career goals. A primary
objective is to involve academic and industrial scientists with educators in the
development of an innovative, real-world science program designed to engage high
school students, especially from historically underrepresented groups, in the
process of scientific inquiry. The eight modules are designed to be used in life
science classes to teach fundamental concepts of biology. This hands-on
curriculum with a science, technology, and society focus, is to be developed as
a collaborative effort between secondary school teachers, university scientists
and science educators, and microbiology consultants from St. Louis-based
industries.
