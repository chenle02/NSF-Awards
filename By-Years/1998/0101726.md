Technology companies in the Austin area face a shortage of qualified information
technology (IT) workers. To help solve this problem, the Austin Regional
Industry Education Systems (ARIES) Alliance is putting in place a competency-
based system for IT education at the high school and community college levels.
This effort includes (1) the development of IT skill standards for Texas, (2)
alignment of existing IT curricula with the skill standards, (3) design and
implementation of new curricula based on the skill standards, (4) professional
development for teachers, and (5) portable, performance-based assessments and
appropriate certifications.

The project is tailoring for the state of Texas the industry-validated IT skill
standards developed by the NorthWest Center for Emerging Technologies (an ATE
Center of Excellence in Bellevue, WA). The project is also adapting and
implementing the NorthWest Center's vendor-neutral "Introduction to IT" course
and the center's curricula in eight career concentrations: programming/software
engineering, network design and administration, enterprise systems analysis and
integration, database development and administration, Web development and
administration, digital media, technical support, and technical writing. A team
of statewide community and technical college faculty are using the new Texas IT
skill standards to align the IT curriculum in all Texas community and technical
colleges. Articulation between the curricula at the high school and community
college levels provides multiple entry and exit points for students.
