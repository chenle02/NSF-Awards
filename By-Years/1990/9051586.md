This project is restoring capabilities for mineralogic and crystallographic
analysis of earth materials by the use of x-ray diffraction. The equipment is
being used in a number of courses and in student research in the departments of
Geology, Environmental Sciences, Chemistry, and Physics. Laboratories that had
been abandoned due to malfunctioning equipment are being restored, and
additional laboratories in Structural Geology and Sedimentary Petrology are
being developed. The renovation of an x- ray diffractomenter, together with
previous improvements in atomic absorption and x-ray fluorescence
spectrophotometers, will restore a variety of options for independent student
research projects in the affected departments as well. The college will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
