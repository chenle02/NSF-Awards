DMS-9424122 Shaw Shaw will continue her work on pde's arising from problems in
several complex variables. In particular, she will study the Cauchy-Riemann
equations and tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations on complex and CR manifolds.
One of the central problems she will work on is to understand the local and
global solvability and regularity of the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations.
She will also study the regularity of the Bergman projection and the boundary
regularity of the d-bar on nonsmooth pseudoconvex domains. Several complex
variables arose at the beginning of the century as a natural outgrowth of
studies of functions of one complex variable. It became clear early on that the
theory differed widely from it predecessor. The underlying geometry was far more
difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more affinity with partial
differential operators of first order. It thus grew as a hybrid subject
combining deep characteristics of differential geometry and differential
equations. Many of the fundamental structures were defined in the last three
decades. Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic
mathematical forms.
