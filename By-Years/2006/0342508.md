With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Rochester will upgrade
an X-ray diffractometer with a more sensitive detector, a more intense beam, low
temperature apparatus and video microscope. This equipment will enhance research
in a number of areas including the following: a) three-coordinate, paramagnetic
complexes of iron, cobalt, and nickel; b) activation of strong bonds; c)
luminescent complexes of platinum and gold; and d) stereoselective total
synthesis of natural products and development of synthetic organic methodology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise
measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including
bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. These
studies will have an impact in a number of areas, in particular synthetic
organic chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
