LORENZ ABSTRACT This award supports the research of Professor Martin Lorenz in
the area of noncommutative ring theory with particular emphasis on the structure
of rings of invariants arising from actions of finite groups and finite
dimensional Hopf algebras. The main objectives will be the description of the
Grothendieck groups G_0 and K_0 of these rings, the continued development of the
representation theory of finite dimensional Hopf algebras, and the detailed
analysis of invariant rings of multiplicative group actions on Laurent
polynomial rings. Invariant theory and representation theory of groups are
classical algebraic themes that are ubiquitous in pure mathematics and are
indispensable in parts of applied mathematics and physics as well. Both are
formally subsumed in the theory of Hopf algebras, more recent algebraic
structures with a wide range of applications. In recognition of their relevance
in physics, certain types of Hopf algebras are referred to as quantum groups.
Hopf algebras further naturally arise in knot theory, an area of particular
interest to molecular chemists as well as physicists.
