9411738 Lawrence This project is to update the equipment utilized to control
experiments and collect data in the Structural Research Laboratory of the
Department of Civil engineering of the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign. This involves (a) conversion frame analog to digital control (b)
acquisition of a long-stroke ram and of transducer signal- conditioning
equipment. The Structural Research Lab at University of Illinois is used for
testing structures and their elements subjected to fluctuating loads such as
earthquakes, wind, waves and traffic loads. This is a Northridge earthquake
project. ***
