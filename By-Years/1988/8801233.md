This analysis of the hydrographic structure of the Greenland Sea will form an
integral part of a year-long investigation of the Three- dimensional Greenland
Sea circulation using acoustic techniques. It also contributes to an
international program of integrated oceanographic research in the Norwegian and
Greenland Seas whose objective is to quantify the environmental effects that are
active in the production of intermediate and deep water masses. The data base
will be produced through a series of oceanographic cruises, undertaken
cooperatively with West German, Norwegian, and Canadian oceanographers. The
Greenland Sea is an important area for the production of intermediate and deep
water masses that sink and spread globally. It is qualitatively understood that
the process of interior water mass formation is the result of surface cooling
and water column destabilization, but the deep convection events that must be
part of the process have to this time not been observed. Acoustic oceanography,
specially the year-long array of acoustic moorings that will be set out in the
Greenland Sea from 1988 to 1989, has the potential of making these observations,
but requires precise and accurate hydrographic information in order to interpret
the acoustic data and convert it to oceanographically useful information.
