The Department of Mathematics at the University of Houston will purchase, at an
estimated price of $69,781, a computer system that will act as a graphics, file
and compute server dedicated to support research projects in the mathematical
sciences. The specific projects that will make use of and be supported by this
system include: 1) Computing in nonlinear dynamics. 3) The numerical simulation
of certain physical processes. 4) Shock capturing methods for reacting flows. 5)
Knowledge-based algorithms.
