Nonlinear optics and nonlinear optical phenomena involve interactions between a
light beam and specially chosen materials which can result in; light beam
generation which has a tunable color; multitudinous light beams which can switch
one another; memories; and other phenomena which in the long run can have
practical implications. This conference brings together experts in materials and
optical phenomena to discuss the most recent results and problems associated
with this field.
