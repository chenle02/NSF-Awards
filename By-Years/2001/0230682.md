Oakton Community College (OCC), in partnership with Maine Township High School
District (three schools) and Niles Township High School District (two schools),
is developing and piloting initiatives designed to increase the number of high
school and Oakton students who pursue and receive degrees in the areas of
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The project has three
key components: (1) the Summer Bridge Program; designed to help under-prepared
students improve their math, English and study skills, (2) the Peer Tutor
Training Program; aimed at recruiting high school juniors with exceptionally
strong math skills (e.g., AP enrolled, National Honor Society) and train them to
become Peer Tutors to assist OCC students who are struggling in STEM courses,
and (3) the Student-Industry-Teacher Simulations (SIT SIMs) designed to augment
STEM instruction in high school and community college settings with hands-on,
contextualized learning modules developed by teams of industry professionals and
community college STEM faculty. The STEM Club offers motivational activities
such as encouraging all students to join and by hosting "Scholar, Expert, CEO
Forum", visiting local business or companies, coordinating the AMATYC Math
Competition, and holding other activities for career exploration in STEM. We are
also working with four-year institutions to smooth students' transition from
Oakton to the university.
