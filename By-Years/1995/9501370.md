9501370 Martin This career development project describes research and education
thrusts to be implemented over the next five years. It includes the development
of a research program that will describe the relationship between solid-state
transition metal oxides and halides, and synthetic approaches resulting from
hydrothermal chemistry. The education thrusts include undergraduate curriculum
development and evaluation, developing and teaching graduate courses in the
inorganic division, developing a materials group meeting and seminary program,
and tutoring "less-advantaged" high school students in math and science. %%%
