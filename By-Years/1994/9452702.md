9452702 White Iowa State University seeks to initiate a four week, residential,
Young Scholars project in life sciences/biochemistry for 20 students entering
grades 8 and 9. The target groups are young women, minorities including Pacific
Islanders, and rural students. This project introduces a hands-on approach,
giving individual participants the opportunity to develop their skills, to
pursue their own interests, and to initiate an independent research project.
