9515471 Hawley This award supports the participation of ten American
astronomers at a workshop entitled "Accretion Phenomena and Associated Outflows"
to be held at Port Douglas, Queensland, Australia, July 15 through 19, 1996. The
American organizer is Prof. John Hawley from the Astronomy Department of the
University of Virginia. The Australian principal organizer is Dr. Lilia Ferrario
of the Astrophysical Theory Center of the Australian National University. The
subject of the workshop is accretion disk systems. These systems are found in
such diverse locations as protostellar systems, binary systems containing black
holes, white dwarfs or neutron stars, and the centers of active galaxies. The
workshop brings together researchers conducting observations and theoretical
calculations pertaining to basic physical mechanisms involving these diverse
systems. The workshop provides the Australian investigators the opportunity to
interact with top American and a few third country astrophysicists, while
acquainting the American participants with recent observational and theoretical
research in Australia. It is anticipated that considerable new collaborative
investigations will emanate from this workshop in the area of
magnetohydrodynamical and fluid dynamical codes which find application to
modelling the physics of accretion disks, jets and winds. Astrophysics is one of
the major fundamental sciences supported by the Australian government. The
Australian support for the workshop is primarily provided by the Australian
Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST). The proceedings of the
workshop will be published by through the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.
