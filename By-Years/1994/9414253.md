9414253 Krusell One of the implications from the recent literature on economic
growth is that economic policy, and particularly taxes which affect the
accumulation of physical and human capital, may have important effects on
economic growth and welfare. The new literature on political economy offers a
theory of how policies are chosen in which the interaction between politics and
economics is brought to the fore and used to address a series of questions
regarding the interaction between economics and policy choice. More
specifically, this project addresses four aspects of the political economy of
growth: (1) how politico-economic institutions explain time series data on the
income and wealth distributions, capital accumulation, and tax rates; (2) the
political economy of the economic and political transition taking place in
Eastern Europe; (3) the effects of political uncertainty on economic growth; and
(4) the development of new conceptual and computational tools for politico-
economic equilibrium theory. This research could make important contributions to
our understanding of economic transition and transitional politics in the former
socialist countries. This project develops a dynamic model that formalizes the
important properties of economic and political transitions. Preliminary results
suggest that a simple move to democracy will, besides creating an initial
recession, lead to relatively poor long-run performance due to the dynamics of
policy determination. Under what conditions will vested interests against rapid
economic expansion build up and persist over time and across generations? The
research focuses on the political economy of adoption of new production
techniques and costly investment in human capital.
