This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of bioanalytical
chemistry. During the five-year tenure of this award, Professor Kennedy and his
students will pursue the development of electrochemical microsensors and
microcolumn separations, such as capillary chromatography and capillary
electrophoresis, for the investigation of peptide neurotransmitters and
hormones. A major goal of the research is the detection and continuous
monitoring of zeptomole quantities of peptides at single cells and in vivo with
millisecond time resolution and submicron spatial resolution. %%% The successful
attainment of the goals of this project should enable the broad advancement of
bioanalytical chemistry, in particular the analysis of minute quantities of
neuropeptides and hormones. The proposed methods, including microscale
sequencing and microcolumn separations, will allow the detection of peptides in
specific regions of the brain or in single cells.
