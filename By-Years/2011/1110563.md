One thing birds can do to protect their young from the threat of bacteria in the
environment is to transfer protective immune compounds, such as antibodies,
directly into their eggs. Although these antibodies are associated with improved
offspring growth and immunity, it is not known how levels of egg antibodies are
influenced by disease risk. The purpose of this project is to test the
hypothesis that tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) encountering more bacteria
in their nests will have higher levels of antibodies in their eggs. To tackle
this question, bacterial communities in swallow nests will be characterized
using DNA-sequencing and compared with antibody levels in eggs collected from
the same nests. This data set, from across North America, will be the most
comprehensive ever collected on bacterial communities associated with any bird
species, and the investigators predict that, as in plants and animals, bacterial
diversity will be highest at the most southerly sites (e.g., Virginia) and
lowest at the most northerly sites (e.g., Alaska). As a consequence, southern
birds should have more antibodies in their eggs than northern birds. In addition
to exploring new ground in bacterial biogeography, this study will bring new
perspective to the variety of ways in which female birds can protect their
offspring. Results from this study will also contribute to a large collaborative
study of investigators working to quantify pathogens inhabiting the nests,
feathers, feces, blood, and tissues of swallows through the NSF-funded
Golondrinas de las Americas network. And sequence data will add to a growing
wealth of 16S rRNA gene sequences publically available through GenBank. This
project will also contribute to the training of undergraduates working in the
field and laboratory. Through this research, students will have the opportunity
to share data, ideas, and personal interactions with investigators throughout
the hemisphere.
