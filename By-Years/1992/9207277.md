Non perturbative theoretical and practical numerical techniques are developed
and applied to studies of the quantum structure and dynamics of highly excited
atoms in external fields. Specifically considered are the dynamics of Rydberg
atoms in a circularly polarized microwave field and the diamagnetic and
resonance structure in static magnetic fields. The methods used include the use
of a quasi-energy formalism, coupled to the Lanczos and/or artificial
intelligence algorithm using discrete variable representations, fast Fourier
transform methods and complex scaling.
