The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps will be to enable faster
development of protein-based therapeutic drugs, such as antibodies and
biosimilars. The core technology allows for faster determination of structural
features of such protein therapeutic agents, which is important because
structure is essential to both the function and efficiency of a protein
therapeutic. The technology can be applied at many points within a therapeutic's
development, from the initial discovery and screening phases to testing a
developed therapeutic's stability under a wide array of conditions and
environments for quality control purposes. Given the significant fraction of
protein therapeutics, specifically, within the rapidly growing biopharmaceutical
market, we believe our technology will both be of significant value to this
industry and enable faster development of therapeutics for treating diseases in
the future.

This I-Corps project further develops a technology that determines structural
features of proteins in a liquid environment. This is significant not only
because a protein's structure dictates its function and by learning about the
structure much information is gained about the protein itself, but also because
proteins natively exist within cells in liquid environments. A plasma is used to
create a reactive molecule from water surrounding the protein, and by measuring
the areas on the protein that get labeled with this molecule, one can visualize
relevant regions of the protein. When another element is added that changes the
structure of the protein, or binds to and masks one side/face of the protein,
this is reflected is changing levels or areas of modification by the reactive
molecule. In this way, the technique can quickly map protein structural changes.
