This project is to convene a 2-day workshop, attended by a forum of experts in
engineering, data science, computer science, biological and behavioral sciences,
to explore the state-of-the art and the needs for the next-generation of sensors
and systems hardware that integrate advanced data science and computing
capabilities. The workshop will focus on the gaps and opportunities for new
hardware development as it relates to applications in medicine. The products of
the workshop will be a report which provides a technological roadmap that
defines the critical needs to bridge the gaps at the interface of sensor
hardware, data science, and computer science. Intelligent, interactive, and
networked sensor systems are a growing part of the biotechnological landscape,
especially in the area of wearable, implantable, and point-of-use biosensors.
The focus of this multi-phased workshop is to determine future strategies for
advancing the fundamental understanding and engineering of reconfigurable sensor
systems by integrating hardware with data harnessing, real-time learning, and
artificial intelligence capabilities. Specifically, this workshop will define
the state-of-the-art, necessary innovations, and future challenges facing the
research and development of reconfigurable sensor systems for applications in
understanding of human physiology, pathophysiology, metacognition, cognition,
and behavioral psychology. To achieve this capability, this workshop aims to
bring together the knowledge in hardware, theoretical models, methods and
processes, and data from multiple disciplines to develop new platforms for
addressing challenges at the human-device-data interface.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
