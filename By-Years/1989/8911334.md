High corporate debt levels have caused concern about the potential economic
costs of widespread failures in a recession. This project models the effects of
bankruptcy and financial distress and provides empirical evidence on the costs
of financial distress. Financial structure should affect the economic
performance of distressed firms only if it is impossible to renegotiate debt
contracts costlessly. This project explores renegotiation costs and their effect
on the investment efficiency of troubled firms. The project analyzes the
inefficiencies created by needing to reach agreement with several creditors
rather than one. The role of reorganization law to promote investment efficiency
is explored. The costs of financial distress are studied empirically. It is
inherently difficult to distinguish financial distress from poor economic
performance. The project attempts to do this by analyzing firm value response to
adverse shocks as a function of leverage, controlling for the economic
characteristics of the firm and industry. It studies the performance of firms in
distressed industries in order to pick out the important sources of the indirect
costs of financial distress as well as what determines if firms will use
bankruptcy to restructure. This research deals with a timely and extremely
important topic. Economic observers, policy makers and the press have expressed
serious concerns that a recession will lead to wide-scale corporate bankruptcies
which will impose large costs on the economy. Bank regulators are worried about
the levels of risky debt taken by deposit-insured banks. The contribution of
this project comes from incorporating into models of bankruptcy many of the
important features of bankruptcy law that are ignored by existing models. The
research will provide new evidence into the relationships between bankruptcy and
the costs of financial distress.
