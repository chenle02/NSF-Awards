9411185 Gerken ABSTRACT This research examines infants' and children's
sensitivity to two potential cues for early language acquisition: prosody and
function morphemes. Prosodic changes such as pausing, pitch resetting and
syllable lengthening potentially cue the locations of linguistically relevant
units. Function morphemes such as articles and verb inflections occur in
grammatically specified contexts (e.g.,"the" occurs only in NPs) and potentially
allow learners to distinguish among phrase types. One set of proposed
experiments examines the effects of prosody and function morphemes on 2-year-
olds' sentence comprehension. Another set uses sentence imitation with 2-year-
olds and preferential listening with 9-month-olds to examine syntactic and
discourse factors that might influence learners' sensitivity to phonological
phrases-prosodic units that appear to govern some aspects of prosody in adult
speakers. ***
