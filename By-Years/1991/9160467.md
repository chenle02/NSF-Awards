This award is to support Phase I research to determine the feasibility of a
process for treatment of wastewaters that involves use of enzymes that are
immobilized on a novel medium. The objective of the process utilizing the
immobilized enzymes is analogous to that of the suspended growth reactor process
used conventionally in biological treatment of wastewaters. Phase I is expected
to establish the feasibility of immobilizing the enzymes while retaining their
activity. The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF
91-20, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR). Results of this research are
expected to determine the technical feasibility of the proposed concept and the
basis for potential continuation of the research into a subsequent Phase II.
