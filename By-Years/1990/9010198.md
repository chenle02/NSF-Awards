This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Cook to initiate independent
studies aimed toward a comparison of responses to different stresses (heat,
salinity) in a family of related plants (marrow and okra). It is anticipated
that this award will help Dr. Cook obtain the preliminary results necessary to
launch an independent research career.
