Healed microcrack sets are common features in rocks and are marked by planar
arrays of fluid inclusions. The use of these features to delineate deformational
events, including paleostress determination, is of increasing interest. This
study will measure microcrack arrays in well-dated plutons in Utah in order to
determine the usefulness and limitations of microcracks as paleostress
indicators and to better understand the paleostress history of the Basin and
Range Province from the Mesozoic to the present. Results will be of general
interest in the field of paleostress determinations as well as local Cordilleran
geology.
