The environments in which we live are filled with noise. Noise makes speech and
other sounds of interest harder to hear, but also conveys information about the
world around us, telling us how hard it is raining, whether the room next to us
is full of people, or how close a kettle may be to boiling. Humans excel both at
separating other sounds from background noise and at recognizing the causes of
the noise in the world. Understanding these abilities could enable more
effective hearing aids, cochlear implants, and speech-based machine systems such
as those in our phones. Here the investigators propose to study human abilities
to hear in noisy conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will jointly
pursue three goals. First, the investigators will develop a computational
framework to understand the properties of noise that underlie human perception.
This will involve assembling a large data set of environmental noises and
measuring their statistical properties. These properties will then be related to
human perception by synthesizing sounds that have the same properties and asking
whether they are realistic and recognizable to humans. Second, the investigators
will measure the ability of human listeners to perceptually separate noise from
other sounds. They will then build models that can predict the conditions in
which such separation should succeed or fail. Third, the investigators will
measure the ability of human listeners to remember different noises and develop
a model to explain why some sounds are better remembered than
others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
