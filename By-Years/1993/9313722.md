In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Paul Dagdigian will study the gas-phase dynamics of atoms and small
molecular free radicals in molecular beams. Laser-induced fluorescence will be
used to determine the internal product state distributions. Both atom-radical
and radical-radical reactions will be studied. In a new direction for his
research program, Dagdigian will examine the reaction of oxygen and chlorine
atoms with vibrationally excited methane isotopomers using stimulated Raman
excitation to prepare the molecular reagents. The reactions of excited Al atoms
with H2 will be investigated using emission and laser-induced fluorescence
detection. In this project Dagdigian will study the effect on the rate or
pathway of a chemical reaction of energizing one of the reacting partners with a
specific type of excitation. Atoms with a large amount of excitation will be
reacted with certain molecules, or other larger molecules with lesser amounts of
excitation will be reacted with atoms. Such studies will permit an understanding
of the effect on reactions of exciting these different modes in the reacting
atoms and molecules. These are very fundamental studies which could impact
practical areas such as semiconductor or materials manufacturing.
