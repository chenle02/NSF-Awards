In this project, the P.I.'s will analyze a unique variety of oceanographic and
satellite-derived data taken from 1988 to 1990 in the confluence region of the
Brazil Current and the Malvinas Current east of Argentina. Data were collected
in a joint effort involving US, Argentine, and French scientists. Studies will
be made of the relation between local atmospheric forcing and local circulation,
meridional motions of the Brazil Current, and the transport of the two currents
separately.
