The objective of this project is to change the way in which the topics of
computer networks, user interfaces, and Web-Ware are viewed and taught. Not only
do students need to understand the important concepts in each domain, but
students need to better understand the effects of the interaction between the
domains. Sophisticated user interfaces are contributing network traffic that is
more varied in its type, amount, and quality of service needs. With computer
networks potentially separating the user, interface, and underlying application,
the design of user interfaces must take into account network delays as well as
interfaces to special-purpose devices available only over the network. The
development of web-ware technology naturally occurs at the interaction between
user interfaces and computer networks. The approach taken in this project is to
develop a single laboratory for Computer Networks, Human Computer Interaction,
and Web-Ware courses. The working name for this lab is the Web-Ware, Interfaces,
and Networking Experimental Laboratory, or the WINE Lab for short. It is used by
students enrolled in each of the three courses and by students choosing to use
its facilities for their senior projects. It is estimated that 200 to 250
students each year can make use of this laboratory. The WINE Lab improves these
three courses because students have the opportunity to complete projects,
experiment with relevant techniques, and make connections between topics that
would be impossible in a general-purpose computing environment. There is a real
need expressed by industrial contacts for such experience by students while at
the same time little related work was found at other institutions. These
findings suggest that these are increasingly important areas of the computer
science curriculum for which students are not being adequately prepared.
