0221520&lt;br/&gt;Imamoglu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan America Advanced
Studies Institute (PASI) award on Quantum Information, jointly supported by the
National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE), is being
organized by Dr. Atac Imamoglu of the University of California-Santa Barbara in
collaboration with Dr. L. Davidovich of the Universidade Federal do Rio de
Janeiro in Brazil. The meeting, which will be held January 12 -23, 2003 in both
Buzios and Salvador, Brazil, will bring together leading researchers, advanced
graduate students, post-doctoral and junior scientists in the field of quantum
information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past few years, the field of quantum
information has evolved to become truly interdisciplinary with contributions
from computer science, quantum optics, and condensed matter physics. This
interdisciplinary PASI will serve to increase and disseminate understanding of
the fundamental issues in the field, and will lead to enhanced collaboration
between researchers in the United States and in the rest of the
hemisphere.&lt;br/&gt;
