Dr. Lorraine Pillus has provided general support for her studies of positional
control of gene expression in yeast. Her research program is directed toward
understanding the molecular basis for control of gene expression and cell
identity. She is using the combined techniques of biochemistry, cell biology and
genetics to examine the assembly and inheritance of transcriptionally repressed
states of cell type information. In addition, she is attempting to identify
functional correlates of the yeast genes in vertebrates using a yeast assay
system, as well as identifying signals and targets in yeast controlling the
germination of yeast spores. %%% The ultimate goal of this research is to
understand molecular mechanisms for establishing and maintaining
transcriptionally inactive regions in the chromosomes of dividing cells. Because
the position effect that is the focus of these experiments involves a
heterochromatic structure of chromatin, the results of these studies will bear
on the genetic control of imprinting and on the structure of eukaryotic
chromosomes.
