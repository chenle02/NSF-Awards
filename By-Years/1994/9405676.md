9405676 Torgersen Will hold a Chapman Conference in June 1994 and entitled
HYDROGEOLOGIC PROCESSES: BUILDING AND TESTING ATOMISTIC- TO BASIN- SCALE MODELS
This conference will focus on the appropriate questions that should be asked and
the necessary information exchange that should occur among disciplines to
interface (1) model building, (2) model testing, and (3) scaling of naturally
occurring hydrogeologic processes. The outcome of this Chapman Conference will
provide a basis for using theory, experiments and the geologic product and
records of those processes at the macro- and micro- scale to more fully define,
develop and quantitatively evaluate the dynamics of hydrogeologic processes in
the Earth. This proposal seeks partial support for participant costs to hold
this meeting. ***
