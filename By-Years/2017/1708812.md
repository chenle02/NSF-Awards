This National Science Foundation award provides partial support for the 32nd
Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications to be held at the University
of Dayton in Dayton, Ohio on June 27 - 30, 2017. This conference series
specializes in advancing the development of topological methods and applications
to a broad range of areas including computer science, analysis, and algebra. It
maintains a tradition of an inclusive attitude towards developing new
application areas. This conference will bring together researchers across
subfields of Topology, and across generations, to share the latest developments
in Topology and related fields. The organizing committee will ensure the
representation of graduate students, young researchers, women, and researchers
from underrepresented groups. All sessions will host a mix of talks by
established specialists, graduate students, and early career mathematicians.
Talks will be centered on recent advances and techniques that impact the future
of the discipline. In keeping with tradition, conference proceedings will be
published by the peer-reviewed journal Topology Proceedings. Additionally we
plan to video and live stream the invited talks. This way, the latest
developments in Topology will be broadly shared.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This year
the conference will focus on five research themes in the topology plus model:
topology + algebra and analysis, topology + asymmetric structures, topology +
dynamics and continuum theory, topology + foundations, and topology + geometry.
There will be a workshop on monotone covering properties, and one on entropy in
topological groups. These fields were chosen to be representative of the broad
range of research being actively pursued today. The conference structure will
promote interaction between these diverse fields by having one plenary talk in
each field, providing workshops where interested parties can learn about new
fields, and by providing dedicated collaboration space and social space where
researchers can discuss problems informally. The conference will invite one
plenary speaker from each of these fields along with the Mary Ellen Rudin Young
Researcher Award winner. For more information see
