The proposed project studies combinatorial problems arising from representation
theory and algebraic geometry. A particular focus is on problems arising from
the study of loop groups, or affine Lie algebras. The PI with collaborators will
study the Schubert calculus of flag varieties of affine Lie groups, and the
relations to quantum cohomology. This includes understanding the geometry of
Schubert varieties and the combinatorics of the polynomials representing
Schubert varieties in (co)homology. Together with collaborators, the PI also
plans to develop a theory of total positivity for loop groups, aiming to extend
work of Lusztig for finite-dimensional reductive groups. Connections with the
theory of electrical networks, and to graphs embedded in surfaces will be
investigated. Another direction of research is the study of infinite reduced
words in infinite Coxeter groups. The PI will study partial orders on infinite
reduced words, and explore probabilistic aspects of random infinite reduced
words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is the study of discrete structures.
Such structures come up in varied contexts throughout science. One such
structure that arises in the proposed work is an electrical network consisting
of resistors. A basic problem is to understand the relationship between the
electrical properties of the network and the connectivity properties of the
network. These problems have applications to electrical impedance tomography, a
technique in medical imaging. Another type of discrete structure studied in the
proposed work are structures with a large number of symmetries, including for
example tilings of high-dimensional space in a regular pattern. A basic problem
with these structures is to classify them and analyze the large scale behavior.
Such structures are important for example in coding theory.
