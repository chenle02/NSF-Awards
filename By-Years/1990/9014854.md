This tectonic evolution of West Antarctica and its relationship to East
Antarctica is the most fundamental tectonic problem of the Antarctic continent.
It bears on global plate interaction, paleocirculation in the Southern Ocean,
paleoenvironment, and paleobiogeography as well as being critical to the
development of the continent itself. The joint United States-United Kingdom West
Antarctic Tectonics Project (1983-88) has shed considerable light on the
tectonic evolution of the Wessell Sea Region. This award supports a new
tripartite United States-New Zealand- United Kingdom program of study in Marie
Byrd Land for the years 1990-93 to complete our understanding of the tectonic
evolution of Marie Byrd Land crustal block and craton, New Zealand and the
Pacific Ocean basin. This study is the major U.S. contribution to the program
and involves structural, paleomagnetic, petrologic, and geochronologic
investigations bearing particularly on the pre-Cenozoic development of Marie
Byrd Land.
