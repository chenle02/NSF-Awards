9307784 Stanish With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Charles Stanish
will continue his archaeological research in the Lake Titicaca Basin of Southern
Peru. The work focuses on the Lupaqa, a prehistoric group which survived into
early historic times and was described in Spanish chronicles. The Lupaqa consist
of a distinct, spatially limited, regional group which maintained its identity
although it was conquered by and incorporated into successive Tiwanaku and Inca
empires. Building on his prior work, Dr. Stanish will expand his survey for
sites and will excavate several of them. On this basis he will reconstruct how
this group developed and responded to influences from the broader Andean region.
Archaeologists wish to understand how large complex entities such as empires
expand and maintain their control over subject populations. There is much
disagreement about the extent to which direct force of arms is involved and the
strategies used not only to establish but also to maintain power. Because the
Lupaqa constitute such a "marginal" group and because they were consecutively
incorporated into two such kingdoms they provide an excellent context in which
to examine this issue. This research is important for several reasons. The basic
forces which shaped Andean prehistory are evident in the world today. Many
countries consist of diverse ethnic groups brought together under a strong
central rule. An archaeological case such as the Lupaqa permits one to examine
the interplay of central and regional forces over a long period of time. ***
