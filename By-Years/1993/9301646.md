Johnson Rice University is establishing a two-part database composed of sampled
signals and signal processing software with the Signal Processing Society
serving as the gatekeeper. This database will be accessible through the InterNet
at no charge to users. Data and programs are being solicited from university,
industrial, and military sources. The data will provide a needed testbed for
evaluation of signal processing algorithms; the software will provide the signal
processing community with state-of-the-art algorithms and simulation systems.
