This project at East Tennessee State University (ETSU) provides three years of
support for three cohorts of ten students each. Students major in the
Mathematical Sciences with a Concentration in Computational/Applied Mathematics,
or Statistics; or receive a minor in the mathematical sciences, with a big data
focus, as they complete their major requirements in one of eight STEM
departments. Students enter the program as sophomores. The program starts with a
two week summer session in which students are immersed in computational science,
both theoretical and applied. In the Fall, and for the next three years,
students attend a bi-weekly seminar that alternates between mini-workshops,
visiting speakers, career planning, team building, and a variety of other
activities. Students are expected to graduate after three years of support.

The technical merit of the project lies in its alignment with the interests of
students who aspire to work in a computational, high-technology environment. The
summer program provides a concentrated Mathematical Modeling and Computational
environment that prepares participants for the next three years of study. As
such it represents a well-tested method of initiating a long-term training
effort when participants enter with diverse educational backgrounds. The overall
three-year effort intends to develop students into mathematical scientists who
solve complex data-driven problems. Additionally, the project integrates with
other programs at the institution - supported both by NSF and other
organizations, to enhance the impact of these particular scholarship
initiatives. Other collaborating programs include NSF-REU, NSF-UBM, NSF-Noyce,
TBR-Access and Diversity Initiative, and the ETSU Governor's School. Recruitment
of women and minorities is facilitated due to cooperation and communication with
other STEM education programs currently in operation at East Tennessee State
University. The project's activities, e.g. seminars, speakers, internships, and
courses, enable students to benefit from long-term immersion in a culture of
predictive modeling; analysis of large and complex or fluid dynamics data sets;
and scientific computation, all of which hold promise to increase retention of
students through graduation.
