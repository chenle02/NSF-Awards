9352007 Ononye NMR for Chemistry Laboratory Instruction and Research The project
will improve laboratory instruction and research training by providing hands-on
experience in the use of a modern Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer.
The hands-on experience will provide indepth training, and thus equip the
students with adequate competence and confidence needed for pursuing carriers in
science. The improvement would be primarily through Organic Chemistry,
Instrumental Analysis, Physical and Research Chemistry and will provide students
with a solid foundation for exploring a variety of other science disciplines
including biological sciences, medical sciences, agricultural sciences,
environmental science, and engineering. It will also help to increase the pool
of well trained scientists from this historically Black institution. ***y
