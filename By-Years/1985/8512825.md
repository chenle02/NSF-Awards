This research will complete specific analysis for cavity nucleation in nonlinear
solids and related fundamental issues associated with ductile fracture of metals
and investigations on Saint-Venant's principle in nonlinear elasticity and
related fundamental issues in mechanical testing of polymers and composite
materials. The research on cavity nucleation involving the formation and
subsequent growth and coalescence of voids from microscopic inclusions which
leads to ductile fracture in metals and alloys, has long been of concern to
material scientists. The studies on the extension of investigations on Saint
Venant's principle will help to resolve several critical issues related to
material instability.
