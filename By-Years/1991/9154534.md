This is proposal for funding of a project to examine the integration of
telecommunications technologies into the science and mathematics educational
reform process. We propose to address a particular educational goal or strategy
in order to examine the process of translating a strategy into practice through
the lens of telecommunications. Through commissioned papers and seminar
discussions in roundtable format among visionaries, experts critics, educators,
and other participants in the educational process, the project would produce
guidelines and recommendations, for both the National Science Foundation and
other key leaders and organizations, of necessary actions in linking online
learning to the science and mathematics educational reform process.
