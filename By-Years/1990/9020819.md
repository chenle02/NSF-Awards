BB1 is a software system (knowledge representation, interpreter, and system-
building tools) for building artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It embodies a
model called the "dynamic control architecture," in which an AI system
incrementally constructs explicit solutions to problems, integrates diverse
sources of knowledge, and dynamically constructs and modifies explicit control
plans to guide its reasoning. Previous versions of BB1 have been licensed to
over 100 academic, government, and industrial organizations. BB1 version 2.5
introduces new featuresthat allow an AI system to: integrate asynchronous
perception, reasoning, and action processes; dynamically control perception;
reason about temporal phenomena; and guarantee response times. These innovations
are especially useful for research and applications involving dynamic task
environments and real-time constraints, for example, intelligent agents, medical
monitoring, intelligent tutoring, control of manufacturing processes, and
control of autonomous vehicles. This project supports distribution of BB1
version 2.5 to others in the research community. Activities include: software
upgrading, testing, and debugging; development of demonstration systems;
preparation of installation instructions and a user manual; distribution of
software; and documentation of users and applications.
