0435527&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trend in Internet
deployment is for more advanced, more capable, and more sophisticated
applications combined with a growing part of the infrastructure as untethered,
mobile nodes. These trends create a requirement for a truly capable and robust
network infrastructure to seamlessly deliver data, including real-time streaming
data (e.g. voice and video), even though nodes may have heterogeneous
capabilities, be on the move, and/or be connected via a wireless link.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet the challenges of the evolving Internet, we are
developing new solutions to better handle the emerging network and traffic
challenges for the next-generation Internet. The next-generation Internet will
need to support traditional services (e.g. streaming voice), next-generation
applications (e.g. gaming,&lt;br/&gt;social computing), and a set of
applications we have not yet even conceptualized. We are building a network to
support the significant functionality demanded by these applications. Our set of
integrated research projects attempts to develop revolutionary cross-layer
solutions for the support of voice and multimedia services in mobile networks.
Specifically, we focus on three problems: (i) Coding support for real-time
voice; (ii) Routing solutions for real-time applications; and (iii) Formalizing
and extending wireless network testbeds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an educational
impact, not only are we able to achieve traditional key educational objectives,
but we are able to connect our work with specific projects at UCSB that expand
education opportunities and diversity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
