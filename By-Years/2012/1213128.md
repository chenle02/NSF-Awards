Future scientific and technological efforts to achieve better understanding of
oceans and water-related applications will rely heavily on our ability to
jointly consider communications, actuation and sensing in a unified system that
includes instruments, vehicles, human operators and sensors of all types. The
goals of this project are to design networking tools for mobile underwater
networks, develop novel navigation mechanisms for communication-constrained
autonomous underwater vehicles and to ultimately integrate sensing and
classification to provide solutions for the exploration-exploitation
tradeoff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will lead to development of
underwater communication methods with applications to science, security, and
industry in the areas of environmental monitoring, aquatic eco-system analysis,
ocean accident remediation, surveillance for defense applications, homeland
security, oil and gas, aquaculture, geological and oceanographic science, and
marine biology. It will also contribute to the training of new information
technology professionals and scientists with expertise in interdisciplinary
research spanning underwater networks, oceanography and computer science.
