9728215 Leustek The topic of this project is the developmental regulation of
Met biosynthesis in higher plants, focusing primarily on the key enzyme
cystathionine (-synthase (CS), and with some emphasis on threonine synthase (TS)
and homoserine kinase (HK). The goal is to study how Met synthesis is regulated
in cells and tissues during development in the model vascular plant Arabidopsis
thaliana. Using a reporter gene method it was determined that expression from
the CS promoter is not equal in all cells. In seedlings the CS promoter is
highly active in meristems and the vascular tissues of roots and cotyledons. The
activity is significantly lower in mesophyll cells. But in this cell type it is
induced by treatment of seedlings with Thr &amp; Lys (inhibitors of Met
synthesis), and is repressed by Met-feeding. Promoter activity in the vascular
tissues is unaffected by these treatments. In mature plants the CS promoter is
active primarily in vascular tissue of leaves, the flower stalk, floral
receptacle and anthers; and is inactive in siliques and developing seeds.
Inhibition of CS expression with antisense-RNA causes a severe growth defect
that can be partially restored by Met-feeding. The phenotype of these plants
resembles that of A. thaliana with reduced levels of DNA methylation. The next
phase of the project will center on further exploration of the reporter gene
results. The possible role of substrate competition in regulating Met synthesis
will be explored by studying CS and TS expression in parallel. Both will be
analyzed by measurement of in situ mRNA and protein. The affect of Met and its
metabolites on cell specific expression will be studied in two ways: through
analysis of CS and TS in plants that have been treated with agents that perturb
Met synthesis, and through analysis of A. thaliana mutant lines with elevated
levels of Met or with lower levels of S-adenosylmethionine. The subcellular
localization of the CS enzyme in plant cells will be explored and the kinetic
propert ies of the recombinant CS enzyme will be analyzed in order to determine
whether enzyme regulation plays any role regulating Met synthesis. Finally, the
cDNA encoding HK will be cloned, the goal being to study the HK enzyme and to
study how expression of HK is regulated. The amino acid methionine is of vital
importance to all living organisms being intimately involved in every aspect of
metabolism. Animals are unable to produce methionine and they must obtain it
from their diet. Yet, most crop plants do not contain sufficient amounts of this
key nutrient. One reason may be that plants control precisely the amount of
methionine that they make. Understanding how this regulation takes place could
lead to methods for improving the nutritional value of crops by increasing their
methionine content.
