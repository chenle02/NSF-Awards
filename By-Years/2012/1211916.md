This award will support the continuation of a project to detect and characterize
supernovae, the final, explosive stage in the evolution of certain types of
stars. The principal goal of the project is to improve the understanding of the
progenitor stars, explosion mechanisms, nucleosynthetic products, and
cosmological utility of different types of supernovae. This work will have three
parts: (a) the continuation robotic searches for supernovae, extending a
recently implemented technique of discovering supernovae very shortly after the
explosion; (b) the acquisition, reduction, analysis, and interpretation of
extensive new data (photometry and spectroscopy, with particular emphasis on
improving the utility of supernovae; (c) the analysis of new and existing data
concerning pre-supernovae outbursts and the nature of stripped-envelope core-
collapse supernovae; and (d) the analysis of new and existing polarimetry data
on supernovae.

The award will contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students
and will support communication of the results of this project (and of supernovae
in general) to the general public. The results are also expected to have broad
implications for topics as diverse as the chemical evolution of galaxies, the
birth rate of pulsars, the masses of black holes, the nature of gamma-ray
bursts, and the expansion of the Universe.
