This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment design for the
research vessel MOANA WAVE operated by the University of Hawaii and dedicated to
use in support of ocean science research. The Shipboard Scientific Support
Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the
proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support
for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and
retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars,
gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research
sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite
transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment
such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data
retrieval sites. The Project Director, Dr. C. Barry Raleigh is fully qualified
to direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the
acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment. This project will allow the
institution to fund an engineering design to modify the ship's stern A-frame.
