A Dynamic Reconfigurable Processing Fabric

Abstract

This project deals with design methods and tools for a new dynamic
reconfigurable hardware fabric that can be embedded in a System-on-Chip (SoC)
platform. The objective is to address needs and requirements for adaptable SoCs
in high performance on-board processing and communications.

SoC technology is well suited for many new compute-intensive applications such
as multimedia, visualization, signal and image processing, wireless
communications and networking. In more sensitive environments such as
networking, satellites and airborne vehicles, SoCs will need to function in
multiple roles and moreover need to be dynamically reconfigured in response to
environment changes. Reconfigurable computing and reconfigurable hardware will
be a key enabler technology to achieve these objectives.

Our approach employs an architecture with two key hardware and software layers:
the reconfigurable fabric and the manager configuration kernel. We provide a
pervasive dynamic configuration scheme based on the coordination and interaction
of the hardware and software layers. Our proposed reconfigurable system has
significant advantages over FPGA-based systems and other reconfigurable
architectures in terms of flexibility, word length scalability, cost, and
compatibility with SoC technology.

Our work will involve 1) analysis, simulation and design of the hardware fabric
using commercial CAD tools; 2) design and development of the software
configuration kernel; 3) a prototype test bed of the reconfigurable system and
emulation on advanced FPGA platforms.
