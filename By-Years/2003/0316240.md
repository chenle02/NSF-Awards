Coordinated movements are characterized by precise temporal sequences of muscle
activation, referred to as "motor patterns." These motor pattern sequences are
produced by networks of neurons (nerve cells) called "central pattern
generators" (CPGs) in the central nervous system. This project examines the
neuronal mechanisms that are utilized by spinal cord CPG networks to generate
rhythmic and coordinated swimming movements of the forelimbs and hindlimbs.
Neural pathways that coordinate the timing of forelimb and hindlimb CPGs will be
investigated, as well as the intrinsic cellular properties of spinal CPG
neurons. These experiments permit the investigation of cellular mechanisms
contributing to the construction of complex, coordinated limb movements. This
research will provide opportunities for behavioral neuroscience training for
graduate and undergraduate students. The investigation of motor control
mechanisms in biological neural networks has direct impact on new approaches to
paralysis and the design of biologically inspired control systems in robotics.
