Professor Gaillard will study the structure of Harish- Chandra modules for
semisimple Lie groups. In particular he will study the relationship of the
representation algebra and the extension algebra and try to show that they are
dual formal algebras in the sense of Beilinson and Ginsburg, a conjecture he has
verified already in special cases. This research involves the theory of group
representations. Group theory is basically the study of symmetry. To take an
example, when the system in question is invariant under a change in the position
of the origin of space, the group of translations naturally arises. While groups
are abstract objects, particular situations demand concrete realizations or
"representations" of the symmetry group.
