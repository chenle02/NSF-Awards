This research involves development of a new approach to radical initiated
polymerization based on the concept of captodative stabilization, and the use of
new initiating systems based on reversible dimerization of cyclic captodative
radicals. New monomers will be synthesized that will allow evaluation of the
balance between radical stabilization and reactivity. Dehydroalanine derivatives
(which are known to be highly active radical monomers) will be examined first to
evaluate tacticity, copolymerizability, and the use of reversible termination by
coupling to generate radical block copolymers. Analogs of dehydroalanines will
then be synthesized in which the captodative groups include combinations of
nitrile, nitrate, sulfonate, or phosphonate derivatives with amine, hydroxyl,
sulfhydryl, or silyl functionality. Bond strengths and charge distributions of
monomers and intermediates will be calculated and correlated with empirical
data.
