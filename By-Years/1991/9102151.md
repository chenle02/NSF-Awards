Funds are provided for a one year sediment trap deployment in the California
Current System off southern California. Time series data on planktonic
foraminifera and hydrographic measurements on plankton standing stock will be
obtained to test models of foraminiferal response to spring upwelling by
comparison with previously collected trap data. Ancillary objectives are to
develop ecological transfer functions and reconstruct history of upwelling over
the past 20 k.y.
