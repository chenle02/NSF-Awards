ABSTRACT CTS- 9614653 The principal investigators propose to study the transport
process involved in droplet-based manufacturing of composite materials. The
configurations to be investigated include a single stream of mono-size droplets
impinging on a substrate, CO2 laser induced re-melt of the substrate at the
droplet impact location, and co-deposition of liquid/liquid or liquid/solid
droplets. Basic issues to be addressed include droplet impact, spreading,
solidification sequence, and porosity development. Visualization and measurement
of relevant parameters will be conducted using a mono-size droplet deposition
setup. Numerical models will be developed to simulate the deposition process.
