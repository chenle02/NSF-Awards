Electronic advancements of recent years have placed a challenge to undergraduate
chemistry faculty to incorporate the use of modern chemical instrumentation into
the undergraduate laboratories. To meet this challenge, undergraduate faculty
members must use and understand the capabilities of modern instrumentation. This
project updates the chemical instrumentation skills of two-year college
chemistry faculty who teach in university transfer and chemical technology
courses Sinclair Community College and partners (George Mason University,
University of Dayton, and Western Washington University) will offer a series of
one-week chemistry instrumentation workshops. Participants will be selected from
two-year colleges across the United States with an emphasis on attracting women
and minority faculty members. each year a one-week instrumentation workshop for
18 participants will be held at George Mason University in Fairfax, VA; a second
for 18 participants will be held at Western Washington University in Bellingham,
WA. Instruction will focus on instrument applications in undergraduate general
and organic chemistry, introduction to instrumental analysis, associate degree
chemical technology course applications, and applications of environmental
chemistry. Participants will select instruction in the following areas: Fourier-
transform infrared, gas chromatography/mass spectroscopies, vapor phase and high
performance liquid chromatography, computerized data acquisition and treatment
multimedia approaches to chemical education, and environmental chemistry.
