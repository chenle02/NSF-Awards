Professor Peter Jurs of Pennsylvania State University is supported by a Small
Grant for Exploratory Research from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program
to use neural network learning methods to predict chemical properties. The first
track consists of generating the Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship
(QSPR) model by using a training set of compounds whose property values are
known. The second track, which is novel to this project, consists of generating
a binary classifier or similarity assessor trained to distinguish betweeen
compounds whose structures are similar to those of the training set versus those
whose structures are not similar to the training set. The goal is to be able to
assess properties of molecules computationally so that large numbers of
compounds can be screened for effectiveness in separation, sensing, biological
activity, and so on. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of computational quantitative
structure/activity relationships (QSAR) is an important approach to molecular
design in industry. This work seeks to improve the accuracy of prediction of
important chemical properties such as toxicity and medical efficacy using
chemical databases.&lt;br/&gt;
