This three-year award supports U.S.-United Kingdom cooperative research in
software programming languages between J. Eliot Moss of the University of
Massachusetts and Ron Morrison of the University of St. Andrews in Fife, United
Kingdom. The objective of their research is to extend main object space
algorithms for use in collecting persistent object databases. This so-called
garbage collection scheme will locate, and organize for reuse, memory containing
data which is no longer accessible in databases. The project brings together two
compatible and complementary research groups in persistence research. The
algorithm extensions will be designed jointly, and then implemented, evaluated
and integrated into each team's existing database systems. The project will
advance our understanding of the management of huge amounts of data in object
databases.
