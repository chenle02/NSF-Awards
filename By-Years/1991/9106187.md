In the last two decades, there has been remarkable progress in the theory of
operator algebras and its applications to both mathematics and physics. The
modern theory of operator algebras interacts with a wide variety of specific
areas, including index theory for foliated manifolds, the geometry of multi-
connected manifolds, difference differential equations, quantum groups, quantum
physics, the Yang Baxter equation, the theory of knots and links, and via the
latter, even the study of DNA by biologists. In view of the rapid advances in
the field and the preeminence of the West Coast in research in operator algebra
theory, this grant will support a West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar in
October, 1991. This will enable researchers to assess the latest achievements
and further stimulate research activities.
