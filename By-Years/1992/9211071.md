The advent of the Intel Delta machine, a large-scale parallel computer with
powerful i860 nodes and high speed communications between the nodes, combined
with fast algorithms in computational fluid mechanics, will allow unprecedented
explorations, via numerical simulations, of complex flows with and without solid
boundaries. Our computational method is based in the Lagrangian description of
the vorticity field. Computational elements of vector-valued vorticity are
convected with the local fluid velocity and the vorticity vector is continually
strained by the local velocity gradient. The classical vortex method is enhanced
to account for viscous effects. An adaptive, fast algorithm has been efficiently
implemented in two-dimensions, in both vector (CRAYS) and parallel (Mark III
hypercube) architectures allowing unprecedented simulations using up to O(10 6)
computational elements. We propose to extend the viscous technique to three-
dimensional flows in the presence of arbitrarily-shaped solid bodies and
implement a fast three-dimensional algorithm on the Delta. We expect to obtain
computing speeds that are much higher than those of a serial supercomputer speed
at a fraction of the cost, allowing simulations using up to O(10 6)
computational elements for three and two-dimensional simulations. This
capability will allow large scale extended numerical simulations, in two and
three dimensions, for laboratory Reynolds numbers and should lead to significant
breakthroughs in the understanding and control of complex flow phenomena that
are fundamental to unsteady bluff- body flows.
