In this award funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program
of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Brooks H. Pate and his graduate students at the
University of Virginia will collaborate with Dr. Michael C. McCarthy and a
postdoctoral research associate at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics to develop new tools to discover chemistry in astronomical
environments through laboratory broadband microwave spectroscopy and next-
generation radio astronomy observations. Both radio astronomy and laboratory
microwave spectroscopy have been revolutionized by high-speed digital
electronics that have increased data rates by order-of-magnitude. The assembled
research group will develop new approaches that exploit these technological
advances to increase the rate of discovery of interstellar molecules. They will
also develop computational algorithms to extract chemical information from
chemical images from ALMA and JVLA including exploring techniques to test
proposed interstellar reaction mechanisms through multispecies spatial
correlations in radio astronomy images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact
of this work is the initiation of a research program in chemistry that explores
ways that data enabled science can lead to new insight about the formation of
molecules in astronomical and terrestrial environments. Pate and McCarthy will
continue to work with the VA NC Alliance (an NSF LSAMP program) to recruit early
career undergraduates in under-represented minority groups for summer research
in the area of the chemistry of the universe.
