The aim is to emulate the reaction processes used in nature for lignin
polymerization, the setting of mussel glue, and insect shell hardening. These
polymerization and curing processes are enzyme-initiated and then they progress
in a "domino" fashion. In this project, it is proposed to use tyrosinase to
convert natural phenolic precursors into reactive o-quinones, which can then
serve as agents for polysaccharide crosslinking and protein-polysaccharide
coupling. To elucidate more mechanistic details, a combined biochemical and
mechanical screening program has been devised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
