This is a SGER grant covering a period of twelve months. The proposed tasks are:

To explore different neutrino detector designs in the proposed Homestake/Yeats
formation.

To work closely with manufacturers who are developing new photon detectors (PDs)
so that the new PDs will be suitable for detecting neutrinos. For example, they
would supply specifications and check PDs for characteristics that are unique to
neutrino detection, quantities such as: quantum efficiency as a function of
wavelength, ability to stand pressure, longevity of the PDs, amount of intrinsic
radioactive materials in the PDs, etc.
