Submerged pressure transducers are studied for measuring shallow water stream,
river, and estuarine depth and flow rates. Signal processing of the transducer
output could, in principle, lead to the extraction of a signal corresponding to
the upstream and downstream propagation of a surface wave whose propagation
speed is uniquely related to water depth. The research will explore the
possibility of utilizing this principle in a practical, useful way.
