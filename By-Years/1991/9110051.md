This project focuses on assessing the influence of nonlinearities on the
dynamical behavior of rotating flexible bladed disk/shaft systems. Such systems
are affected in a nonlinear sense by blade material, support mechanisms, and
clearance. The research goal is to determine the impact of these nonlinearities
on turbomachinery design. Previous work in nonlinear rotordynamics has
concentrated separately on shaft vibration or on blade vibration, and has
neglected coupling dynamics between them. Furthermore, work in this area
typically consists of perturbation analyses which is valid only for motion about
some operating point. In this project, nonlinear models are be developed and
their global dynamical behavior are be explored. Experimental verification of
the analytical work is included in this work.
