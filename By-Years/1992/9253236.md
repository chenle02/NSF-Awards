This three year project, sponsored by Portland State University, will carry out
a program, enrolling 25 well prepared high school chemustry teachers each year,
which will acquaint teachers with the chemistry processes used in industry and
connect them to the high school chemistry course. The teachers will meet during
the academic year and in the summer for a total of 27 days. Teachers will visit
research and industrial laboratories, study laboratory management and
instruction issues and prepare laboratory experiences for application to the
regular classroom. Each teacher will work to disseminate the approach in his/her
district. The NSF award is being matched by the University, by an amount
equivalent to 7% of the grant.
