A grant has been awarded to the University of South Carolina (Columbia) under
the direction of Dr. Robert Raguso to improve the Herbarium collection, located
within the Department of Biological Sciences. The collection is especially rich
in plants of South Carolina. Its most significant holdings are those of rare and
endangered species, cultivated plants, and weedy species. Two major current
issues have resulted in the development of this project. First, the physical
safety of the specimens is jeopardized by their continued housing in old,
inadequate steel (and wood) cases as storage units. Some of the cases within the
Herbarium are dilapidated to the point that there is no air seal, allowing
possible infestation by destructive insects. Second, the collection has reached
sufficient size and importance that its availability as an on-line database has
become apparent. &lt;br/&gt; The project developed for the Herbarium calls for
funding to replace inadequate herbarium cases with new storage units, and to
provide salary for the manpower involved in recording specimen data within an
on-line database. The first aspect of the project will involve moving old
cabinets out of the herbarium, replacing them with new ones, and transferring
the specimens. The databasing of the collection will be of three-year duration;
three university students will be hired for this. Additional computer software
will not be needed, as we have access to a Microsoft Access platform using
"Index Kentuckiensis".&lt;br/&gt; The state of SC is botanically diverse, and
considerable botanical inventory remains to be completed. Thus, the largest
single scientific collection of plant specimens should be of utmost importance
in understanding the state's botanical diversity. As a result of this project,
the collections within the Herbarium will be better protected and more available
for scientific use, both now and well into the future. The project will allow
for a modest expansion of existing storage capacity. The data processing of the
collection will result in approximately 70% of the total collection made
available as an on-line electronic resource. Finally, a certain broad impact of
this project will be the collaboration of USC with other state institutional
herbaria for the consolidation of state-wide herbarium data. Additional use of
the collections as a resource will be enhanced, for instance, as a continuing
source of free plant identifications for gardeners, farmers, extension agents,
and plant enthusiasts. &lt;br/&gt;
