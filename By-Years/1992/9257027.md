This research includes studies on the effect of coarsening, grain growth and
particle packing on densification, defect formation and constitutive parameters,
and reactive processing of composites and constrained films. Sub-critical
mechanical properties (e.g. fatigue and creep) of ceramic composites and
multilayered systems including film-substrate assemblies will also be
determined.
