This action would provids funds for continued research in experimental high
energy physics at Northeastern University, to be carried out by a group
consisting of six faculty, four research associates, one senior programmer, one
technician, eight graduate and two undergraduate students. The group will
concentrate its research efforts on Experiment-706 at Fermilab (a study of
direct photon production in hadronic collisions), on experiments with the L3
detector at CERN, (European Center for Elementary Particle Physics, high energy
electron positron collisions in the LEP collider), and on the plastic
scintillating fiber tracking and vertex finding generic detector development
program for the Superconducting Super Collider. The E-706 experimental program
at Fermilab involves a continuation of the analysis of the data from the 1987-88
run, and two additional runs, one in 1990, the other in 1992. The work at CERN
involves a continuation of the application of the scintillating fiber technique
to the calibration and monitoring of the tracking system for charged particles
in the L3 detector. The scintillilng fiber development program involves software
simulation, bench-tests in the laboratories at Northeastern of various fiber
options and tests of different PSF detector options with cosmic rays and in a
particle beam.
