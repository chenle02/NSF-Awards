9321929 Scott This action concerns the use of scale models to investigate the
response of geotechnical structures (earth dams, embankments, building
foundations, etc.) to earthquake-induced strong-ground motions. In particular,
the possibility of using a scale model mounted on a shake table to simulate the
earthquake response of a full-scale geotechnical structure is being investigated
through this exploratory study. If this 1g (normal gravity loading) experimental
technique fulfills its promise, it will effect two areas. First, the potential
impact is large for industry, because the lower cost of 1g tests in comparison
with experiments performed on a geotechnical centrifuge (approximately 25% to
40% lower) will improve the access to physical modeling by practicing
geotechnical earthquake engineers; resulting in a substantial advance in
industry practice. The second impact is to centrifuge experiments. The new
scaling relations will permit the current maximum capacities of centrifuges to
be overcome to that the need for larger and more costly centrifuges is reduced.
This research program combines experiments and analytical studies to compare
with the experiments, in order to investigate scaling relations. Particular
emphasis is placed on pore fluids and the dynamic environment, motivated by the
need to resolve some concerns regarding the appropriateness of the scaling
relations currently used for centrifuge studies. ***
