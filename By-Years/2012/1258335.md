The rising cost of long-term patient care, the shortage of nurses, and the
increasing number of seniors in the United States make it imperative to
investigate the possibility of intelligent systems for elder/patient care. One
challenge is how to prevent falls, which often result in serious injury and
considerable hospital and patient costs. In this exploratory project the PI and
her team will focus on analyzing sensory data of patient actions in an effort to
develop algorithms for the automatic detection and prediction of falls among
elderly patients. Their goal is to gain a good understanding of how multimodal
sensory data combined with domain knowledge of falls can be used to characterize
pre-fall patient actions, in order to determine the feasibility of developing
automatic alert systems that incorporate machine learning algorithms to assist
human nurses and robotic caregivers by warning of potential falls.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Project outcomes will pave the way for
future development of intelligent systems to reduce the incidence of patient
falls, which is a major societal concern. The project will provide a rich
spectrum of interdisciplinary training for graduate student researchers, and
will also strengthen UNC Charlotte's existing programs in broadening
participation in computing and in research experiences for undergraduates (REU)
by deepening involvement of women and minority undergraduate students in
research.
