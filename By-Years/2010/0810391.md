This STTR Phase I project is to develop processes and optimized integrated
structures based on the piezoelectric effect, and complemented by other
traditional sources, to enable energy harvesting devices for self-powered
sensors and devices. The team has recently developed a piezoelectric composition
with the highest ever reported energy density for bulk piezoelectric ceramics.
This project will seek to develop and optimize piezoelectric thin film processes
using the newly discovered composition.

Successful use of piezoelectrics for energy harvesting from vibration sources
can provide a high efficiency and low maintenance power source, particularly at
a small scale, for applications that are remote, inaccessible and in darkness.
