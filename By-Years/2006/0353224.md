Over the past two years I have been working on multi-linear singular integral
operators. Recently, in a joint work with T.Tao and C.Thiele we generalized the
previous results on the bilinear Hilbert transform to the case of multilinear
operators with much more singular symbols. The striking fact about these
developments is that it seems that these techniques could have a very nice and
important application to the spectral theory of Schroedinger operators. The
final goal of our project, is to show that for the classical Schroedinger
operators with square integrable potential and for almost every positive
eigenvalue, their corresponding eigenfunctions are bounded. The answer to the
above conjecture would imply a better understanding of the behaviour of the
Schroedinger operators, which lie in the heart of Quantum Mechanics.
