9321112 SHEEHAN This archaeological project will recover data on prehistoric
and historic occupations at Pingasagruk, Point Franklin, once a whaling village
on Alaska's Chukchi Sea coast. The rapidly eroding site will provide comparative
data on differential access to trade and resources in the region, and provide a
background for interpreting the well-documented aboriginal warfare of the past.
In addition to analyzing settlement abandonment phases, and the hiatus between
the historic and prehistoric settlement at Pingasagruk, poorly documented
outlying sites will be recorded using spatial domain radar (SDR). Information on
house pit reuse and the vertical and historical extents of middens can be used
to refine population estimates and patterns of resource exploitation. The
project will be carried out in cooperation with Wainwright village residents and
the North Slope Borough. Both students and elders will participate. ***
