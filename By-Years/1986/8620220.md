This research is concerned with commutative algebra on local rings and their
singularities. Specific topics include birational transforms, spots,
multiplicities, Hilbert functions, and integrally closed ideals. This research
is in the general area of commutative algebra as it applies to algebraic
geometry. The principal investigator will continue to study the question of
singularities in algebraically defined geometric objects. This is a topic of
current interest in the mathematical community.
