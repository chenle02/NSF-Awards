It is proposed to examine the effects of some promising structural variations
on the adsorption of surfactants such as xylene sulfonates, ethoxylated
sulfonates, and ethoxylated alcohols. Fluorescence, electron spin resonance,
resonance Raman and NMR spectroscopy will be used to characterize the
microstructure of the absorbed layers and calorimetry for fundamental
thermodynamic information on the absorption of these surfactants. The adsorption
of mixtures of these surfactants as well as mixtures with nonionic ethoxylated
alcohols on solids will be investigated in detail using these techniques in
conjunction with surface tension, electrokinetic and wettability measurements.
This comprehensive approach should shed new light on interactions between
surfactants during their absorption as well as self-association and orientation
during packing at interfaces and help to identify optimum surfactant structure
and system conditions for different processes.
