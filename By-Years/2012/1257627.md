Many toxic animals have bright warning colors to deter predators such as birds
and lizards. Often a group of unrelated species mimic one another by sharing a
single defensive pattern. For insects such as butterflies that use wing patterns
to recognize their own species, especially when they are choosing mates, mimics
of different species might be confusing. This group has recently found that the
color vision of toxic passion vine or Heliconius butterflies of South and
Central America is able to distinguish the Heliconius yellow wing pigments from
those of their mimics, whereas the two types of yellow pigment produce colors
that are indistinguishable for bird color vision. This project will investigate
the differences in color vision between species and sexes of Heliconius
butterflies, using molecular, anatomical, biochemical, electrophysiological and
next-generation sequencing methods. The resulting data and models of color
vision will provide evidence on how color is used for both choosing mates and
finding leaves on which to lay eggs and flowers to feed. This study will make
predictions about Heliconius color vision that can be tested behaviorally. This
research will reveal in unprecedented detail the evolution of color vision
within a group of closely-related animals in relation to the signals they
encounter in their daily lives. Whereas much is know about sexual differences in
animal coloration, virtually nothing is known about sexual differences in color
vision. This is a major gap that can now be addressed. Spectral data resulting
from this project will be deposited in the Dryad Data Repository
http://datadryad.org/ and made freely available to the public. There will be
training of a postdoc, graduate and undergraduate students in intracellular
recording and anatomical methods, as well as in the analysis of next-generation
sequencing data. This research group will recruit undergraduate math and
chemistry majors to analyze color reflectance spectra.
