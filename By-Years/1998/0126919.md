Physics (13) This project is adapting and implementing the Tutorials in
Introductory Physics, by&lt;br/&gt;Lillian McDermott, Peter Shaffer and the
Physics Education Group at the University of&lt;br/&gt;Washington, in the
recitation sections of the large introductory calculus-based
physics&lt;br/&gt;courses taught at the University of Cincinnati. The goal of
this proposal is to improve the&lt;br/&gt;performance of the science, math and
engineering students taking introductory calculus-&lt;br/&gt;based physics
courses, which have been a barrier for many science and
engineering&lt;br/&gt;students at the University of Cincinnati. The students in
these courses come from a&lt;br/&gt;diverse background and include many at-risk
students. The tutorials have been pilot tested&lt;br/&gt;at the University of
Cincinnati, and students using tutorials have shown improvement&lt;br/&gt;over
non-tutorial students. A Tutorial Coordinator is helping the department
completely implement the tutorials, and peer instructors helping as facilitators
in the tutorial recitation classes. The Coordinator will coordinate all tutorial
recitations and manage the recitation instructors'&lt;br/&gt;tutorial training
sessions, under the supervision of the Principal Investigators.
Innovative&lt;br/&gt;features of this implementation of the tutorials are the
pairing of a graduate teaching&lt;br/&gt;assistant with an undergraduate peer
student, the testing and selection of an effective set&lt;br/&gt;of tutorials
for less well-prepared students, and the use of checkpoints and grading
based&lt;br/&gt;on recitation performance to motivate students and guide the
recitation instructors. The&lt;br/&gt;University of Washington Physics Education
Group will be involved in observing and&lt;br/&gt;advising on the implementation
of the tutorials.
