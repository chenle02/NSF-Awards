The Networked Resource Discovery Project of Colorado has investigated a number
of issues concerned with allowing users of the Internet to discover resources of
interest in large administratively decentralized environments, including
resources such as documents, network services, and people. Implicit in these
projects is the assumption that the Internet will continue to grow and evolve as
a medium for supporting wide area distributed applications. In response to a
number of well publicized problems many sites have installed mechanisms to limit
their exposure to security intrusions. While these measures are preferable to
the damage that could occur from security violations, taken to extremes they
could limit the capability of the Internet. To understand the evolution of this
situation, the researchers propose to carry out a longitudinal measurement study
of changes in service-level reachability in the global TCP/IP Internet. The data
they gather will uncover changes in how sites resolve the problem of supporting
open network usage while ensuring reasonable security.
