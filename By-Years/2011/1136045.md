Harnessing wind energy is one of the pressing challenges of our time. The scale,
complexity, and robustness of wind power systems present compelling cyber-
physical system design issues. Leveraging the physical infrastructure at Purdue,
this project aims to develop comprehensive computational infrastructure for
distributed real-time control. In contrast to traditional efforts that focus on
programming-in-the-small, this project emphasizes programmability, robustness,
longevity, and assurance of integrated wind farms. The design of the proposed
computational infrastructure is motivated by, and validated on, complex cyber-
physical interactions underlying Wind Power Engineering. There are currently no
high-level tools for expressing coordinated behavior of wind farms. Using the
proposed cyber-physical system, the project aims to validate the thesis that
integrated control techniques can significantly improve performance, reduce
downtime, improve predictability of maintenance, and enhance safety in
operational environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has significant
broader impact. Wind energy in the US is the fastest growing source of clean,
renewable domestically produced energy. Improvements in productivity and
longevity of this clean energy source, even by a few percentage points will have
significant impact on the overall energy landscape and decision-making.
Mitigating failures and enhancing safety will go a long way towards shaping
popular perceptions of wind farms -- accelerating broader acceptance within
local communities. Given the relative infancy of "smart" wind farms, the
potential of the project cannot be overstated.
