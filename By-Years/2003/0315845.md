Plants are exquisitely sensitive to their light environment. Recent studies in
the P.I.'s laboratory indicate that the plant hormones auxin and
brassinosteroids (BRs) act in close proximity to modulate the seedling light
response. The auxin and BR pathways have been studied individually in some
detail, but significant gaps in each pathway exist. This project aims to
identify components that may be shared between the auxin and BR signaling
pathways. The primary aims are: (1) to characterize the BR-auxin interaction in
Arabidopsis using existing physiological and genetic tools and (2) to uncover
novel signal transduction components utilized by both hormones. This research
will address the impact of the interaction between these hormones in regulating
such diverse responses as changes in gene expression, cell expansion and
division, and vascular differentiation. The long-term objective is to completely
understand the signaling networks that regulate seedling development, and to
relate this to general mechanisms of signal transduction in other organisms.
