This proposal requests funding for partial support of the travel and
registration expenses of U.S. graduate students at the 15th Conference on Hadron
Collider Physics 2004 (HCP2004) to be held on the campus of Michigan State
University from June 14-18, 2004. The conference will cover the experimental and
theoretical aspects of Hadron Collider Physics, but will also include talks from
electron-proton, electron-positron and heavy ion physics. There will also be
presentations of the physics anticipated at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
being constructed at CERN, near Geneva, Switzerland. Newspapers and local
television stations are being informed of the event and will encourage and
inform the public at large.
