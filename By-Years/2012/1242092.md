This award will provide partial support for 25-30 participants of the third
Workshop for&lt;br/&gt;Women in Probability to be held October 14-16, 2012 at
Duke University. All of those receiving support will be young female researchers
(graduate students or recent PhD's) and will be recruited from a wide variety of
institutions. This conference features talks on current exciting research areas
by ten women probabilists, who are leading researchers in their field. Topics
will include mathematical biology, stochastic partial differential equations,
fractional Brownian motion, random matrices, dynamical systems, interacting
particle systems, stochastic networks, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and randomized
algorithms. Participants will have an opportunity to interact with the speakers
in a way that is difficult at a large national or international meeting, and to
give poster presentations on their own research. This conference will foster the
formation of networks of a support structure for female mathematicians at the
beginning of their careers. The young researchers will have the chance to
network with their peers as well as more senior women in their field, and to
discuss the challenges they face in graduate school and early professional life.
The interpersonal contacts resulting from this meeting will help guide them
through early career transitions, which will ultimately improve the retention of
talented women in the mathematics work force.
