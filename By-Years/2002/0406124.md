This project proposes to develop a framework for hardware-assisted speculative
program optimization (H-SPOT). H-SPOT optimizes programs aggressively based on
actually observed program properties by speculatively performing optimizations
that are profitable but cannot be guaranteed to be safe at static compile time.
The project develops a transactional processor model that provides architectural
support to ensure the correctness of optimizations at run
time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's technical contributions are: (1) The
H-SPOT compiler that provides a&lt;br/&gt;reformulation of compiler
optimizations to apply them even in cases when traditional static compilers
would not be able to perform them. It implements dynamic program analysis to
obtain information about program properties and uses a cost-benefit model to
apply the most promising optimizations. The compiler also develops a static
recovery and fix-up code analysis to determine the run-time actions required to
ensure the correctness of optimized programs.
