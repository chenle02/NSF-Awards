This project will support the purchase of computer- projection equipment which
will be used for classroom demonstrations. It is being funded under the
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of
improving the quality of the undergraduate curriculum by supporting projects to
develop new or improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory and/or field
courses in science, mathematics, or engineering. In particular, the main
objectives of this project are curricular innovation and delivery in calculus
and undergraduate numerical analysis courses. Three groups of courses will be
affected: (1) a twelve-hour, three- semester calculus sequence for mathematics,
engineering, and physical science majors, (2) a six-hour, two-semester calculus
sequence for business administration and social science majors, and (3) a one-
semester numerical methods course required of all engineering freshmen. Software
(with an emphasis on graphics) especially developed for classroom demonstrations
will be used.
