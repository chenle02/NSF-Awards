This award allows Professor Harold Orville and Dr. Nancy Knight to supervise
undergraduate students' participation in the North Dakota Thunderstorm Project,
scheduled for the summer of 1989. The objective of this field project is to
study hailstorms and the role of feeder cells in the development of hailstorms.
Students selected from regional universities will assist in either analyzing or
collecting data from an extensive array of instrumentation including radars,
aircraft, atmospheric sounding systems, etc. In particular, a hail measurement
device utilizing an infrared optical transducer designed previously by students
will be tested in the field.//
