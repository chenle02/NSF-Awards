Clear, unambiguous, "real world" physics laboratory experiences are crucial for
the development of an appreciation and understanding of physics by the non-
physics major. Heidelberg College is addressing this need by developing
laboratory experiences that utilize a "video system" (camcorder, jog and shuttle
player, monitor and tripod).The equipment acquired with this grant is being used
to conduct experiments in the areas of kinematics, dynamics, momentum, angular
motion, and energy. These are areas which students have found difficult to
visualize and understand. The video equipment is providing students with tools
to record the complex or short duration events common to these areas, and
analyze the events step-by- step as the events progress in time.The power of the
video system is that it aids students in observing and quantifying "real world"
events that normally cannot be considered in the introductory laboratory because
of size, spatial, and time limitations. For non-physics majors, it is sometimes
the first time they discover that physics exists outside of the laboratory.NSF
funds are being matched with funds from non- federal sources.
