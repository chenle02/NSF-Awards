One of the largest areas of Quaternary potassic volcanics in the world, in NE
Asia, is also one of the least well-known. The most potassic, most accessible,
and the only sites of historic eruptions of these rocks are in northwestern
Heilogjiang and adjacent Inner Mongolia, China. The PI has begun a major
petrologic, geochemical and isotopic study of these rocks. A Chinese graduate
student is currently working on them at Santa Cruz. This award will provide
temporary support for the student until longer-term funding for the project as a
whole can be obtained. During this time he will obtain major and trace elements
by XRF and complete petrographic characteriaation of samples collected already;
complete U-Th disequilibria studies of representative samples; and obtain rare
earth analyses of a subset of samples.
