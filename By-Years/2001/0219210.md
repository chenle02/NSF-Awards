This project is at the interface between Information Technology and Nuclear
Physics. We will develop and apply a two-site data grid at Stony Brook and
Brookhaven National Laboratory to analysis of heavy ion collisions in the PHENIX
experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Collisions at RHIC produce
many thousands of particles, resulting in enormous volumes of data to analyze.
In order to study the rare process of gluon scattering at large angle, and how
the nuclear medium affects this process, we must sift through hundreds of
millions of these complex events. We will use the software tools developed by
the Globus collaboration to allow seamless data analysis across two computer
facilities comprising many computers and terabytes of disk storage. Jobs will be
automatically directed to the facility where requested data are disk resident,
and results returned to the user. We will take advantage of many developments by
others in information technology, but we bring to the table a unique mix of real
data, eager users, and a cutting edge data grid application with a simple
demonstration grid of two nearby sites with very similar
hardware.&lt;br/&gt;Testing and optimizing this prototype grid under "battle"
conditions will provide information applicable to development of large-scale
global data grids for the future, as well as physics results from
PHENIX.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
