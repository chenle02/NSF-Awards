This award supports Dr. J.E.T. Channell and a graduate student from the
University of Florida to collaborate in geological research with Dr. Rainer
Brandner of the Institute for Geology and Paleontology at the University of
Innsbruck. They are attempting to reconstruct the paleogeography of the Northern
and Southern Calcareous Alps using a variety of geochemical and stratigraphic
techniques. Dr. Brandner has primary responsibility for the sedimentary facies
analysis to delineate the basinal, swell and shallow water depositional
settings. Dr. Channell will carry out the paleomagnetic work to determine the
paleorientation of these facies boundaries. The proposed field work will
concentrate on paleomagnetic and sedimentological studies of the Northern
Calcareous Alps and the Drauzug Range of Austria. The results will be combined
with previous studies of the Central Australpine Complex and the Southern Alps
to produce insights into the paleogeographic relationship between these areas
and ultimately improve our understanding of the origin of the Alpine region.
