Mutations in a number of genes in the fruit fly lead to an overproduction of
neuronal precursor cells. One such gene, "pecanex", is expressed maternally and
codes for a large, transmembrane protein thought to be involved in cell
interactions occurring early in neurogenesis. The discovery of homology between
"pecanex" in the fruit fly and an expressed gene in rat suggests that the study
of this gene in the fruit fly may be relevant to understanding neurogenesis in
vertebrates. Immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization will be used to study
the expression of the "pecanex" gene and its gene product in the fruit fly
embryo. In addition, molecular techniques will be used to define the coding
region of the "pecanex" gene. The principal investigator teaches at a small
undergraduate college and will be training young scientists in neurogenetics
during the course of these studies.
