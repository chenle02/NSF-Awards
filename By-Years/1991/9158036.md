It is generally believed that increasing the lattice mismatch beyond the point
of pseudomorphic growth (thus creating dislocations in the structure) renders
the material useless for electronic devices. I am currently investigating the
possibility that this belief may not be correct and that in some systems, it may
be greatly advantageous to increase the lattice-mismatch past the point of
pseudomorphic growth. Currently, I am collaborating with two other Professors
one from UW Physics, x-ray diffraction and the other from ASU, Physics, electron
microscopy on a long term project to theoretically and experimentally
investigate strain relaxation in near- and over-critical thickness InGaAs
quantum wells and thin films, as well as in naturally and artificially-graded
quantum wells and thin films.
