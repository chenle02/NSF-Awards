This is a project to obtain chemical, mineralogical, textural, and
thermodynamic analysis of hydrothermal mound structures from samples obtained
from East Pacific Rise at 21 N and the Endeavor segment of the Juan de Fuca
ridge. The principal focus will be on the sample suite obtained during an ALVIN
expedition to the Endeavor segment in July, 1988. Data will include petrographic
analysis, XRF, microprobe, isotopic and fluid inclusion studies. Data will
permit description of mound structures and will help elucidate the relationship
between the mound and chimney structures. %%% One of the most exciting
discoveries on the seafloor during the past decade has been that of active high
temperature venting and the formation of hydrothermal ore deposits. The
hydrothermal structures consist of large basal mounds with chimneys superimposed
on them. The bulk of the work on analyzing hydrothermal samples has been on the
small, actively growing chimneys; little work has been done on the larger mounds
structures. This project will begin the work on this important component of
hydrothermal precipitate on the seafloor.
