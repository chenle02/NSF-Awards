Working with his colleagues, the investigator will develop the formalism of
Derived Deformation Theory. This theory aims to resolve in a systematic fashion
many of the difficulties arising from the fact that moduli spaces in algebraic
geometry related to higher dimensional varieties are typically singular. The
basic idea is that the correct object to consider for a moduli problem is some
``derived moduli space'' which should be manifestly smooth in an appropriate
sense and should carry a differential-graded structure sheaf. The usual moduli
space is obtained from the derived version as the degree-zero truncation, and
this explains its singular nature. In recent work, Ciocan-Fontanine and Kapranov
defined and studied the ``right derived category of schemes'', whose objects are
differential-graded schemes, and they have constructed the derived version of
Grothendieck's Quot scheme. The investigator will extend the formalism to a
larger category of differential-graded stacks, and use it to construct derived
versions of some other important moduli spaces in algebraic geometry (such as
moduli of vector bundles, stable maps, etc.). As a first application of the
theory, it is proposed to give a simpler and more general construction of the
virtual fundamental classes of Behrend-Fantechi and Li-Tian. This new
construction is expected to be better suited to investigate the properties of
virtual fundamental classes in the case of moduli of stable maps of higher genus
to a hypersurface in a Fano manifold and to understand mathematically mirror
symmetry at higher genus. The project has also a part dealing with some explicit
calculations of genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of flag manifolds, and
applications to mirror symmetry.

This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, which is one of the oldest
branches of modern mathematics. In recent years, the methods and ideas of
algebraic geometry, especially the study of moduli spaces, have been employed in
string theory, a very active part of theoretical physics. Developments in string
theory have sparked a fruitful interaction between the two communities of
researchers and have led to the discovery and study of many striking new
phenomena. Mirror symmetry is one example. It is expected that a better
understanding of moduli spaces in algebraic geometry will lead to more
applications to string theory.
