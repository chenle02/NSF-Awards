This project is an experimental study aimed to provide fundamental information
on the oxidation of alkali and magnesium halide surfaces under dry and wet
conditions. The technique of vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG)
spectroscopy will be applied to this study, which is well suited because it is
sensitive to species located on solid and liquid surfaces providing molecular
level information. In addition, mass spectrometry will be employed to monitor
the gas phase composition, and Raman and infrared spectroscopy will provide the
composition of aqueous solutions before and after reaction. More complex,
atmospherically relevant systems will also be studied that include incorporation
of oxygenated organic and alkyl halide compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
results from these laboratory studies will help bring quantitative understanding
to the mechanisms involving halogens in the marine boundary layer. This is
information that can be incorporated into numerical models of atmospheric
chemical processes to examine importance of these processes relative to well
known gas phase processes. This project will involve significant training of
students from underrepresented groups helping improve diversity in geosciences
research.
