Project Objectives: The primary objective of the project is to develop a
competitive research proposal on "Racial Differences in the Causes of and
Responses to Political Alienation". The proposed research will attempt to make a
comprehensive analysis of the determinants and behavioral consequences of
socially-based differences in political alienations. Broader Significance of the
Project: Support of the project will assist a well trained black sociologist to
improve his research capability and to complete the planning and development of
a regular MRI proposal. The planning activities, if successful, will
significantly enhance the potential of the investigator to compete for MRI and
other research support.
