The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovakia cooperative research project
between Dr. Robert S. Brodkey of Ohio State University and Dr. Ivan Fort of the
Czech Technical University is to formulate and test better theoretical
approaches to problems of solids transport. Of particular interest is the
definition of the buoyancy term in a force balance when used to describe solid
particle motion. The researchers intend to measure the turbulent fluctuations of
both liquid and solid in a two-phase, dense, solid-liquid mixture. They will use
invisible and marked particles to enable optical diagnostics of the flow
turbulence between particles. Both particle motion and fluid motion are to be
mapped, for comparison to particle predictions from a theory developed by the
Czechoslovak partner. Results should yield new data on turbulence flow, with and
without particles, and may resolve a theoretical controversy about the role of
buoyancy in equations of motion. This project in fluid dynamics research
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents
and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
