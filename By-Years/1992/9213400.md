This award provides continued support for the Duke University Primate Center
(DUPC). DUPC houses the largest and most diverse collection of prosimian
primates in he world. The DUPC operates as a research resource providing
animals, tissues and blood samples to scientists in diverse areas of research
including animal behavior, anatomy, morphology, physiology, ecology,
developmental biology, taxonomy, evolution, biodiversity, and conservation
biology. In the last few years, research on prosimians has increased in scope,
intensity and sophistication. The DUPC serves an important function for the
research community by maintaining a colony of diverse prosimian primates and
providing the research material as well as facilities. Duke University has
committed considerable resources for the DUPC, and NSF provides funds necessary
for the DUPC to function as a community resource for national and international
researchers.
