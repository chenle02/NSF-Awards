ITR-[ECS]-[soc]: Spectrum Management toward Spectrum

0428887&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wireless
networking technology is the fastest growing segment in the United States
telecommunications market and holds out the promise of providing greater
broadband competition, increased connectivity in rural areas, and increased
communication density in developing nations that are not able to invest in wired
infrastructure. But making this vision a reality entails overcoming three
formidable barriers that can only be solved through careful interdisciplinary
work that pulls together policy, electrical engineering, and computer science
expertise. In particular, policymakers need assistance in: (1) identifying
opportunities for "underlay technologies," wherein existing licensed spectrum
can be protected while affording access to unlicensed uses, as well as new bands
for unlicensed spectrum uses; (2) evaluating the technology - both in hardware
and software - that will enable unlicensed uses not to cause undue interference
with licensed ones or other unlicensed ones; and (3) determining how to best
enforce the requirements - i.e., protocols (or etiquette standards) - that
ensure that unlicensed uses can co-exist with one another and with licensed ones
without causing undue interference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
