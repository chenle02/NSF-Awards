The growth of device quality, large area GaAs epitaxial layers on silicon
substrates is recognized as an important technological development. The quality
of heteroepitaxial layers of GaAs on silicon are limited by GaAs-Si lattice
mismatch and thermal coefficient mismatch. The defect density of the GaAs
epilayer is directly related to the interface area. Our laboratories have
demonstrated a viable GaAs-Si growth technique: selective liquid phase epitaxy,
SLPE. This approach enhances the epilayer quality since the lateral overgrowth
region is shielded from defects originating at the interface. The substrate is
prepared by placing a silicon dioxide layer on the silicon and opening a
selective pattern in the oxide using photolithography. The nucleation vias will
be five microns wide and one hundred microns long, placed on fifty to one
hundred micron centers. After nucleation in the vias, lateral overgrowth will
yield device quality GaAs on silicon. Direct contact between the GaAs and
silicon will be limited, which will limit lateral tension and confine
dislocation propagation to the via area.
