Sociologists view the organization of work and the careers of workers as shaped
by the stratification among organizations, the operation of often very different
and distinct occupational and firm labor markets, and changing technology as
applied to production or service work as well as changing business conditions.
Working from this perspective and approaching its work as an intensive case
study of one industry, this project will study the causes and consequences of a
case of a shift in employment relationship from a market basis (freelance work)
to an hierarchical basis (staff working within an organization) that has
parallels in other organizations and industries. The study will apply or test
transaction cost theories of industrial organization, models of cumulative
advantage in career paths and recently developed approaches to the production of
popular culture. The effects of changing organizational and industrial
conditions on opportunities for women, minorities and older workers will also be
studied. Career histories and data on employment practices within the industry
under study -- television production -- will be collected and analyze using
time-series and event history statistical modeling techniques.
