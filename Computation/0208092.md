Sauer 0208092 The investigator studies computational aspects of nonlinear
dynamical systems, emphasizing the role of chaotic dynamics in the
interpretation of long-time simulation outcomes and data from complicated
dynamical processes. The work on simulation is an ongoing study of subtle biases
occurring in deterministic modeling that have macroscopic effects on outcomes.
It is an open question whether it is possible in principle for long-term
computer simulations of typical nonhyperbolic chaotic systems to approximately
match true system behavior. The second major area is ongoing work on the
interpretation of physical and biological experiments that generate aperiodic
data. There is a long history of applying random modeling to time series and
spike timing data collected from laaboratory and natural processes. The
investigator syudies ways to use dynamical systems techniques, including
embedding theory and spike train reconstruction, to extend the power of
deterministic modeling for experimental data. Computer simulation is a critical
ingredient of modern science. It is important to know whether solutions of a
mathematical model used for simulation can be expected to be accurate
qualitative and quantitative representations of the natural phenomena being
modeled, in the face of small modeling errors, and whether computer solution of
the model can represent solutions of the model, in the face of small floating
point errors. This reseach builds a foundation for answering questions like this
for physically relevant models. In particular the investigator is involved in
isolating and quantifying the limitations of deterministic representations,
especially for the purpose of long-term modeling. The second major focus of the
project is the interpretation of data collected from experimental systems and
nature when no first-principles mathematical or computer model is available. If
time traces of physically relevant quantities can be measured from the process,
techniques exist to attempt to reconstruct the dynamical behavior of the
process, with potential to predict or control the process. Complex deterministic
time series are being identified in physical, chemical, engineering and
biological/medical settings. The investigator has made previous progress on
expanding these conceptual foundations and developing related computational
implementations, and is working to increase their power for the study of complex
systems in scientific and engineering-related contexts.
