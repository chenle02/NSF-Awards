Northern Illinois University will initiate a 3-week residential Young Scholars
project for 32 students in grades 7-9 in mathematics. The development and use of
mathematical models in integral to scientific research. Recent technological
developments have provided new tools for mathematical modeling including
graphing calculators and microcomputers. The focus of this project is to
familiarize students with mathematical modeling and its role in many diverse
areas of scientific endeavor. By exposing students to a variety of scientists
and mathematicians using mathematical modeling in their work, the project will
stimulate interest in science disciplines as possible and realistic career
choices and make the students aware of the academic preparation necessary for
such careers. This project, using the theme of mathematical modeling as an
introduction to experiences in other disciplines, is designed to do precisely
that. Each cycle of the project, lasting one year, will consist of a three-week
residential camp during July and August, follow-up activities during the
academic year, and a culminating one-week residential camp during the following
June.
