*** This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, will
investigate ways to group images to facilitate the development of effective
indexing methods for image search. Most current approaches to this problem focus
on texture and color characteristics in the images. This effort, building on
prior funded research in this laboratory on nonparametric shape modeling, seeks
to determine whether structural encoding can be used more effectively to give
the search engine more information about the image, and thereby facilitate the
search. Generally, contemporary approaches have avoided relying on such
structural information as too difficult to obtain. The planned approach will
combine geometrical and topological considerations such as symmetry,
parallelness, orthogonality, and connectivity to gainmore of an understanding of
the image content, leading to the production of digital geometric primitives to
aid in image search. These geometric/topologic primitives should complement the
texture and color information currently used for this purpose.***
