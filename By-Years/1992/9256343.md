This award to a group of 13 Faculty from 3 departments (Biological Sciences,
Chemistry, and Computer Science) provides 5 slots for an interdisciplinary
training program in biophysical approaches to cellular and developmental
biology. All faculty are members of the STC for Light Microscope Imaging and
Biotechnology. The training program will consist of six required courses, four
of them new interdisciplinary courses (fluorescence spectroscopy, biological
imaging, quantitative light microscopy and computational biology.) and two of
them existing advanced courses in cell biology and developmental biology that
are being modified to fit the program's biophysical aims. The training will
equip students with the intellectual and experimental skills to pursue both
basic and applied research in a multidisciplinary area of great excitement.
