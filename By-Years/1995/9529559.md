ABSTRACT CTS-9529559 Mixing and Segregation mechanisms of granular materials in
rotating containers will be investigated by using kinematic and granular
dynamics modeling techniques. Kinematic (or " geometrical") investigation will
provide generic rules of behavior in the entire volume of a container. Granular
dynamics simulations of slightly deformable particles will lead to predictions
based on particle properties and micromechanical flow characteristics. A wavelet
methodology will be used to characterize the degree of mixing. Both two-and
three-dimensional flow situations will be considered. Overall goals are the
identification of the dominant mixing and segregation mechanisms in rotating
drums, quantitative characterization of mixing in laboratory and industrial
conditions, and optimization of mixing processes. Because the current methods of
investigation are largely empirical, the proposed project is expected to provide
critical advances in the mathematical modeling and understanding of processes to
relevance to chemical plants, pharmaceutics, metallurgy, cement and polymer
industries. ***
