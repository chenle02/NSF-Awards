LGL Ecological Genetics, Inc. identified a commercial opportunity to develop DNA
fingerprinting assays for use on psittacine birds. This technology will result
in a registry of the legal birds in captivity. The need for this registry
results from the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 which stipulates that
certain species of exotic birds must have a unique and identifiable mark. Only
genetic marks are accurate enough for this purpose. However, an adequate
fingerprinting process for these animals does not yet exist. Therefore, they
will develop PCR primers to amplify microsatellite loci suitable to establish
the identity of any individual bird. The company will serve to provide the
laboratory analyses required for registration of a bird. Phase I will
demonstrate such primers for the hyacinth macaw, and show their accuracy for
discriminating among closely related individuals. Phase II will involve the
fingerprinting of large numbers of hyacinth macaws, developing primers for a
diversity of psittacid taxa, and the fingerprinting of the individuals in the
"macaw colony." Phase III will entail the establishment of the registry and the
development of the fingerprinting industry which will be funded on a user-fee
basis.
