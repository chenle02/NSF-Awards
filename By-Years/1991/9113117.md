This work in theoretical nuclear physics will investigate a new chiral quark-
meson model of the nucleon. In this model the chiral meson fields carry a
composite structure due to their generation from quark fields as propagating
vacuum fluctuations. There is a natural place in the model for an absolute
confining mechanism that does not require an auxiliary field.
