Does legal doctrine genuinely constrain the choices Supreme Court justices make?
Do justices' ideological preferences dominate their decisions? The "law versus
ideology" debate provides conflicting answers to these questions. What is
missing is a fuller accounting of the capacity of legal doctrine to constrain
justices from acting on the basis of their ideological preferences. The current
project aspires to provide a comprehensive theoretical and empirical examination
of legal doctrine's impact on judicial decision making. Depending on how
presumptive legal doctrine is of an outcome, some legal rules and standards may
constrain ideological discretion, while others may actually enhance such
discretion. The current research tests competing models and hypotheses regarding
how variation in the presumptiveness of legal doctrine influences ideological
discretion and hence the degree of ideological voting. The project will examine
justices' voting behavior in a large number of cases within multiple legal issue
areas spanning the prior sixty years. The data will be analyzed using multi-
level statistical models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings of this research
will facilitate a richer understanding of judging. More broadly, the insights
regarding how and when the "rules of the game" constrain political actors are
informative in better conceptualizing the role of courts in the democratic
process.
