A nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer has been acquired by the Chemistry
Department of St. Norbert College for use in undergraduate instruction. The
instrument is being used extensively in the following courses: organic, advanced
organic, physical, instrumentation, biochemistry, and independent research.
Experiments such as determining the pKa values of organic bases, measuring the
percent enolization of acetylacetone, and the determination of coupling
constants to distinguish between cis, trans, and geminal vinylic isomers are
among the activities carried out. Students are provided with the hands-on
experience expected by employers and graduate schools.
