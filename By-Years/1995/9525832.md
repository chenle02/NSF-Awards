9525832 Spong The Center for Artifical Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) in
Bangalore, India is organizing the International Symposium on Intelligent
Robotic Systems to be held in Bangalore during the last week of November, l995.
This is the third in a series of very successful biennial symposia that began in
l991. The scope of the Symposium encompasses intelligent systems of all types,
and includes learning theory, worst-case identification, AI, fuzzy logic, and
neural networks based control, etc. A one day pre-symposium tutorial, "Neural
Networks and Fuzzy Logic for Intelligent Control," will be given by the
conference chairperson, M. Vidyasagar. In addition, several keynote addresses by
renowned researchers in Intelligent Systems are planned. This proposal is for
travel funds to facilitate the participation of U.S. researchers in the
Symposium. ***
