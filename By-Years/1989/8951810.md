This award to the Alabama Marine Environmental Sciences Consortium is made in
response to a proposal submitted to the NSF's Instrumentation and Laboratory
Improvement Program, a program whose goal is to extend support for undergraduate
instructional instrumentation. The award will provide one-half of the funds
needed to acquire a high-resolution physical and biological sensing system for
marine water studies. The Consortium is committed to matching the NSF
contribution for this equipment. The instrumentation will be used to enhance a
field oriented undergraduate curriculum in marine sciences.
