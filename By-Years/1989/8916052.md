This grant is for research in two different areas of condensed matter theory.
The first part will study the properties of microemulsions using the techniques
of lattice-gas theories. In particular, the system of oil, water and amphiphile
will be modelled using a Blume-Emery-Griffith based Hamiltonian. Studies will
also be conducted on surface melting, mixtures of chiral molecules and quantized
Hall conductance. In the second part, research will be conducted on the quantum
Hall effect and its relationship to hopping conductivity in mesoscopic systems,
on one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems and on high temperature
superconductors.
