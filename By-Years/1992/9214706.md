This project involves the renovation and modernization of the interdisciplinary
environmental engineering and science laboratory at Manhattan College. The
successful completion of this project will result in a comprehensive and unified
environmental laboratory complex. Individual research and research training
areas will include: unit operations/advanced water and water waste treatment;
instructional/research training; aquatic and sediment chemistry research;
microbiology; instrumentation; toxicology; radiological microcomputer; storage;
equipment calibration/repair; glassware storage/washing. Some of the research to
be supported by the renovated facility includes: risk assessment research - in a
modern dedicated toxicology lab overseen by a new faculty member; the
continuation and expansion of breakthrough research to determine toxic effects
based upon acid volatile sulfide contents of sediments - in a dedicated acquatic
and sediment chemistry lab; investigation of new techniques for advanced
treatment of water and wastes such as biological fluidized beds and odor control
- in a renovated unit operations lab; and enhancement of research characterizing
risk to the ecosystem and human health of genetically engineered microorganisms
- in a dedicated microbiology lab. Additionally, hundreds of thousands of
dollars of research instrumentation acquired under various sponsored projects
will be housed in a climate controlled instrumentation lab.
