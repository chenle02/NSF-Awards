1264997/1264750&lt;br/&gt;Yang/Liu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to
develop a new class of nanoparticle sensors based on ultrahigh quality factor
(Q) optical micro-resonators on a silicon wafer to achieve not only ultra-
sensitive detection but also molecule-specific identification and measurement of
nanoparticles and molecules in air and in liquid environments at single particle
resolution. The merit of this new technique lies in enhancing Raman and Rayleigh
scattering and integrating them in an ultrahigh-Q Whispering Gallery mode (WGM)
micro resonator to achieve multi-function sensors. On one hand, Rayleigh
scattering in resonators leads to self-referencing mode-splitting, which can be
utilized to detect and measure nanoparticles (e.g., size) down to several nm in
size. On the other hand, Raman scattering, which is greatly enhanced by several
orders of magnitude in an ultrahigh-Q microresonator, provides identification of
molecules/particles through recognition of their spectral fingerprints of
molecular vibrations. By integrating mode-splitting and microresonator-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy, they can achieve a multifunction sensing unit capable of
ultra-sensitive real-time, in-situ detection, identification and measurement of
single nanoparticles.
