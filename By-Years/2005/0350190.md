This project will use a genetically tractable model organism, baker's yeast, to
investigate the molecular events that accompany the process by which genes
become dormant ('silenced') and are subsequently re-activated. Yeast genes share
many features with those of complex organisms, including a beads-on-a-string
structure and many regulatory mechanisms. Shutting off specific genes at the
right time and in the right place (i.e., within the proper tissue) is critical
for normal development and survival. Understanding the molecular details of how
gene expression is shut down is therefore of great interest - all the more so
given recent evidence suggesting that the way this happens is remarkably similar
in yeast, insects and humans. The goals of this project are: (1) to demonstrate
that RNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for copying the DNA into messenger
RNA, is present, but is rendered incapable of working by the specialized
chromosomal structure uniquely seen in dormant genes; (2) to characterize the
molecular changes that occur when dormant genes become activated in response to
an environmental stimulus; and (3) to identify the proteins that assist RNA
polymerase in overcoming the 'repressive' effects of dormant gene structure
during activation. This project will also provide training for a post-doctoral
researcher.
