It is proposed to study radiative level shifts in hydrogen, spectra and decays
of bound quark-antiquark systems, and radiative corrections to toponium decay.
The major effort concerns the lamb shift of hydrogen. The work entails
calculation of pure recoil corrections resulting from triple Coulomb exchange,
as well as single Coulomb exchange. A calculation of two loop radiative graphs,
using Dirac Coulomb propagators, will be initiated. Proposed work on quarkonium
bound states will be directed toward formulating a coupled channel mixing
approach in which the virtual states are treated relativistically. Research on
toponium decay will involve analysis of virtual Higgs contributions.
