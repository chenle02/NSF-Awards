The clearing of tropical forest in the Amazon Basin changes the amount and forms
of sediment and nutrients that move from land into small streams. These changes
can alter the plant and animal communities in streams and may ultimately
influence water quality in larger rivers, including the Amazon River itself.
This research will quantify the amount of water that moves from land to water in
different hydrological pathways, including overland flows, shallow subsurface
flows and deep groundwater flows. It will also use nitrogen-15, a stable isotope
of nitrogen, to trace how much nitrogen moves from land to water and to quantify
how nitrogen is transformed within these different flow pathways. This work will
provide new basic information on how nitrogen moves in tropical watersheds. It
will help to improve pasture management, to design stream-edge vegetation
buffers, and to maintain water quality in the rivers of the Amazon Basin.
