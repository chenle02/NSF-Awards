As many undergraduates are moving away from an interest in medicine and
descriptive biology into the research and technical areas of Molecular Biology,
it becomes increasingly important to expose them to basic methods of
ultracentrifugation and spectrophotometric analysis. The Department is changing
its curriculum to offer an emphasis in Microbiology and Molecular Biology to
meet this change in student interest. The new equipment (ultracentrifuge and
UV/Vis/spectrophotometer) purchased through this award is being used for
experiments in six different laboratories as well as in independent student
research projects. This broadly based exposure is ensuring that the students
have multiple chances to use and become familiar with this instrumentation and
its uses.
