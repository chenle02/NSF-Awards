Dr. Wyse at the Johns Hopkins University will use this award to investigate the
present day kinematics and distribution of chemical elements of the stars of our
Milky Way Galaxy. Dr. Wyse is adopting a new and promising observational
technique for this work, which will be done primarily with the four meter
diameter Anglo-Australian Telescope. Our Galaxy offers a unique opportunity for
addressing fundamental problems in the areas of galaxy formation and evolution,
through the development and analysis of detailed models of its three dimensional
structure. Dr. Wyse's theoretical modeling of her new observational results will
provide new insight into the shape and scale of the gravitational potential of
the Galaxy and into the course of evolution of the Galaxy.
