Tougaloo College, a minority-serving institution, is awarding two-year
scholarships to 18 talented, upper-level students with a major in biology,
chemistry, mathematics or physics who desire certification in secondary
education and are committed to completing four years of teaching in grades 7-12
in high-need school districts in Mississippi. The substantial curriculum is
being driven by clinical field-based experiences in formal and informal
settings, seminars, and workshops in collaboration with established local school
districts and community partners. The Noyce Program is being structured around
undergraduate and post-graduate mentoring by STEM and Education Division faculty
and master 7-12 teachers, professional development activities and networking.
Scholars are being prepared to enter the 7-12 STEM classroom as highly
qualified, highly effective teachers and are provided resources and support to
ensure teacher retention. Pre-Noyce activities such as teaching in the college's
Summer Science Program are being made available to freshmen and sophomores who
wish to ultimately apply for Noyce scholarships. By establishing a strong STEM
Teacher Education Program that will impact Mississippi students for years to
come, the Program is increasing the number of qualified beginning STEM teachers
in Mississippi and increasing the number of effective beginning teachers in
schools serving economic and socially disadvantaged students. The project is
establishing a mechanism for ongoing participation between Tougaloo STEM and
Education faculty, increasing the number and expertise of STEM beginning
teachers, and subsequently improving the aspirations and competence of
Mississippi students. By building partnerships with community schools, the
Program is creating a pipeline for future qualified STEM teachers to serve in
area high-need schools.
