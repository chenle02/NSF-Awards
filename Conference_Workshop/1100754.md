This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants,
especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the
international conference "Challenges for Nonlinear PDE and Analysis" that will
take place from June 20-24, 2011, at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris,
France.

This conference will focus on a variety of topics in the theory of partial
differential equations (e.g., calculus of variations and optimal transport;
qualitative properties and viscosity solutions of parabolic and elliptic PDE;
dynamical issues for dissipative, dispersive, and fluid equations; front
propagation and transport in mechanics, physics, and biology). All of the topic
areas cited in the proposal are central to analysis and extremely active
subjects of current research. The format of the meeting is such that young
people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the
various conference activities.
