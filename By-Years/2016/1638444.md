PI: Quarles, Greg&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1638444 &lt;br/&gt;Title: OSA
BIOMEDICAL CONGRESSS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
high level of technical development in biomedical optics, biophotonics, and the
brain is drawing new researchers into the field from diverse disciplines ranging
from chemistry and genetics, to laser optics and neurosurgery. OSA has
identified the urgent need for a forum where these researchers can come together
and discuss these areas at many levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will
provide a forum for presentation of new research results and will stimulate new
ideas and collaborations that will provide visionary direction for future
projects. In addition this meeting will provide an opportunity for students,
trainees and young investigators to present their work, and to hear and network
with internationally-renowned invited speakers
