This is a two-year collaborative research project between Dr. James Bayfield,
University of Pittsburgh and Professor Li Jiaming, Institute of Physics,
Academic Sinica, to study dynamical correlation of atomic processes. This is the
important field or atomic physics. The U.S. team is strong in Rayleigh
scattering and the expertise of Chinese team its in quantum defect theory. The
unique strength in each team makes this collaborative project complementary and
strong. The results of this study can have a wide range of applications in
astrophysics, energy research and medicine.
