This is a two-year planning project that will support planning activities to
provide a basis for further STEM education reform in the Greater Mohawk Valley
of New York. These include different workshops for school administrators and
teachers preparing them to support student research and venues for students to
present the results of their research. Perhaps even more importantly it will
provide an alternative path for assessment of districts' STEM educational goals.
The 25 years of Utica College's support and programming of student research
activities will provide a rich background for assessment of the effectiveness of
student learning in science, mathematics and technology through such activities.
