With the increased use of automated reasoning systems and the proliferation of
parallel machines, the need for research in parallel automated reasoning was
never more evident. Coarse grain parallel theorem provers have been developed
which demonstrate linear speed-up for small to medium scale problems; however,
fine grain provers for very large scale problems have yet to be developed. In
this work a SIMD parallel automated reasoning system will be designed based upon
the clause graph (or connection graph) model. This system will be implemented on
the Connection Machine model CM-2 and will be applied to a number of problems in
group theory and combinatorial geometry. In addition, parallel algorithms will
be developed for computing and analyzing the spectra of clause graphs.
