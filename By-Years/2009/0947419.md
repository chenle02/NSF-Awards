The Initiating New Science Partnerships in Rural Education (INSPIRE) project
between Mississippi State University and three rural school districts in North-
Central Mississippi focuses on technology-supported, inquiry learning in the
Earth and Space sciences for 7th-12th grade classrooms. The interdisciplinary
project will recruit 50 Fellows from three STEM disciplines (Geosciences,
Physics, and Engineering) where they will be partnered 2:1 with a teacher. The
innovative aspect of this project includes the use of spatial analysis platforms
(e.g., Google Earth) during the classroom implementation of graduate student
research. The project aims to achieve five essential goals: 1) enhance Fellows?
communication, teaching, and team-building skills; 2) develop and implement
technology-supported, inquiry-based instructional materials that infuse Fellows?
STEM research; 3) increase K-12 science teachers? content knowledge and
technological skills; 4) build partnerships between K-12 school districts and
University STEM disciplines that serve to support K-12 students? pursuit of
higher education and STEM-related careers; 5) provide international research
experiences for Fellows and teachers where they receive training across
geographic borders. The intellectual merit of the project is the incorporation
of Fellows? scientific research into the classroom through the use of technology
and the extension of this research beyond our nation through international
training experiences. The broader impacts of the project include creating future
STEM leaders that conduct cutting-edge science, have solid communication skills,
and possess a passion for supporting science education; building a skilled STEM
workforce in Mississippi; and developing sustainability and institutional change
for GK-12 type activities at MSU beyond the lifetime of the project.
