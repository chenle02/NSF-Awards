9725900 Presnall Because partial melting processes in the mantle are generally
understood to involve a close approach to fractional melting, it is important to
obtain data on melt compositions at &lt;2% melting. The low melt fraction
limitation of studies on natural lherzolite can be overcome by using linear
algebraic methods to extend the classical model system approach to systems of
more than four components. This project will use this extended classical
approach to study melting relations of model lherzolite in the CaO-MgO-
Al2O3-SiO2-CO2 system in 3-5 GPa pressure range. All experiments will be done
with a multianvil press and phase compositions will be determined with an
electron microprobe. In this system, compositions of liquids produced by large
to extremely small (0-2%) degrees of melting of lherzolite can be determined
right down to the solidus by direct analysis, so that extrapolations from larger
degrees of melting are unnecessary.
