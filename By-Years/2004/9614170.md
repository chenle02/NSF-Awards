9614170 Wu This project is concerned with theoretical studies of lattice models
in statistical physics with emphasis on exact results and applications. While
most exact results are limited to 2-dimensions, this project proposes to study
the 3-dimensional systems by building around the 2-d solution. Specific plans
include: analysis of the relationship between a quantum spin system in
2-dimension and a classical one in 3-d, further work on certain conjectures on
the distribution of zeroes of the Potts model partition function and directed
percolation problem in 3-d. Additional projects involve: investigation of
roughening of crystal surfaces, gel-sol transition in a ternary polymer
solution, the mathematical problem of restricted partitions of an integer and
derivation of a new link invariant in the theory of knots and kinks. %%% This PI
is widely known for his contributions to more mathematical aspects of the
materials related problems. In research on the fundamental properties of
materials and phase transitions, this PI has made contributions where the
problem has been simplified to the extent that a mathematically exact and
rigorous solution is possible. The more realistic problems then can be
understood by building up on the exact results. Much of the present grant
supports search for exact solutions in bulk (3-dimensional) on certain
simplified models where the solution is known for a thin film (in 2-d). ***
