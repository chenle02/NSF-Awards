This proposal requests support for a multidisciplinary effort to develop the
digital imaging microscope for the anlaysis and control of changes in molecular
distribution underlying cell function. We propose to enhance the spatial and
temporal resolution of fluorescence imaging by developing new microscope and
camera systems for imaging in the millisecond domain and by developing
computational methods for further extending resolution. We will develop
methodology for quantitative analysis of 2-D, 3-D and 3-D time series
fluorescence images and for determining error bounds on estimates of the
concentration of a given molecule in a compartment. We will provide a powerful
capability for the measurement and analysis of images by integrating tools for
image display and interaction with automated feature extraction algorithms. We
will develop tools to investigate the relationship of two or more molecules with
respect to one another. We will incrased the algorithm computation speed to make
the digital imaging microscope into a real- time device that allows interactive
or automated control of experiments. Finally, we will add to the instrument the
ability to control and modify molecular distribution in living cells by
controlled photolysis of "caged" compunds.
