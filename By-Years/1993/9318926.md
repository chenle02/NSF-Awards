9318926 FLANDERS The proposed research will look at the management of protected
natural areas under continuing human use of their natural resources. The central
question will be whether local community use and knowledge reduces uncertainty
in managing for ecosystem reproducibility and landscape diversity. The research
also addresses the questions of whether it is possible to have continuing human
use of resources and still protect the ecology of protected areas, and how
different management systems affect the successful integration of human
activities into natural systems. The research will develop quantitative
ecosystem management models for national parks which incorporate information
from local and traditional users. Studies will be conducted on national park
units in Alaska, Newfoundland and Finnish Lappland. This project will take a
systems approach to the analysis of human/environment interactions in Arctic
regions of relevance to global change research. ***
