Flavocytochrome c will be investigated further as a soluble model of oriented
coupled electron transfer. The heme and flavin subunits are tightly associated
and it has been shown that electron flow is from doner to flavin, followed by
rapid intramolecular transfer to the heme and finally to the acceptor. The
flavin and heme are optimally oriented for electron transfer and the electrons
enter and exit via different paths. Flavocytrochrome c will be cloned and the
mechanism of electron transfer will be further characterized. Considerable
advances in our knowledge of biological electron transfer have been achieved,
although many crucial questions remain unanswered. Much of our present
understanding is based on studies with cytochrome c (the only soluble protein in
the respiratory chain) and other small proteins having a single redox center. It
is clear that redox potential, electrostatic and steric factors play an
important role. In larger proteins containing multiple redox centers these
interactions are less well understood, but additional factors play a role. Thus
the mechanism of action of cytochrome c may not be representative as a whole.
Flavocytchrome c presents an opportunity to investigate an electron transfer
system which more directly mimics the less tractable membrane found electron
carriers of respiratory and photosynthetic pathways.
