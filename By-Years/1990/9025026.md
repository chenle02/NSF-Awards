The general area of research encompassed by this project relates to the theory
of several complex variables and partial differential equations. One question of
particular concern is that of the uniqueness of continuation in Cauchy-Riemann
manifolds. Basically these studies involve questions of whether or not a
holomorphic function of several variables can be constant along various
submanifolds of a domain without being constant everywhere. A second aspect of
the work will focus on the properties of sets preserved under holomorphic
mappings between spaces of different dimensions. Much of what is intuitively
obvious in the one dimensional case turns out to be false in higher dimensional
settings.
