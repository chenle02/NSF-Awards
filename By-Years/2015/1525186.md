This project challenges the assumption that adaptive hypermedia systems require
expensive knowledge engineering for domain and content modeling. It replaces
carefully-crafted domain models with automatically-created domain models,
lowering the cost of developing adaptive educational hypermedia software while
also providing a wider range of instructional paths through the content.
Adaptive educational hypermedia is known for its ability to improve learning
outcomes and engagement maximizing educational opportunity for learners with
different levels of knowledge. The development of this more automatic, open-
corpus approach to adaptive educational hypermedia will increase the volume and
the variety of resources available for meaningful online learning, especially
for individuals learning on their own. Automatic knowledge indexing of
educational content makes the system easy to maintain and update over time.
These new open corpus user modeling techniques automatically adapt user models
and personalized guidance to new materials as they are acquired. The ability to
automatically organize, index, and adaptively recommend distributed educational
content without the need of manual processing by system developers, enables new
material to be integrated dynamically and with minimal effort in response to
student needs.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project merges research on text
analysis, human learning, and personalization to enable open corpus personalized
learning. It develops its models of the domain and human learning from an
initial set of well-organized, manually selected materials. Automatic text
analysis creates an ensemble of domain models with different characteristics.
Each individual model may be flawed or incomplete, however collectively they
provide comprehensive coverage of the topic from several perspectives, thus
reducing the manual effort required to create adaptive educational hypermedia.
Multiple perspectives also give the system more flexibility in how to guide each
student. These domain models are used as a foundation for building and
maintaining dynamic models of user knowledge. The ensemble of domain and user
models is used to deliver reactive and proactive adaptive guidance in an open
corpus context. The growth of a person's knowledge is inferred by observing
learner behavior and obtaining occasional feedback. This exploratory research
opens the way to open corpus personalized learning. The domain modeling, user
modeling, and personalization techniques developed in this research will be
evaluated using a multi-layer framework that includes assessment by subject
experts, performance prediction, cross-validation, and user studies.
