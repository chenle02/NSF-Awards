This project combines local numerical optimization routines from applied
mathematics with flexible global models from statistics to create efficient
hybrid optimization routines. These routines can address difficult optimization
problems involving multi-dimensional and multi-modal functions. We focus on
pattern search as our local routine and treed Gaussian processes as our
statistical emulator. We develop an implementation in an asynchronous parallel
computing environment, and allow for both known and hidden constraints. We also
explore optimization of stochastic functions and optimization under uncertainty,
as well as robust optimization.

This project solves difficult optimization problems by combining tools from the
fields of applied mathematics and statistics. By intertwining efficient local
numerical routines with global statistical emulators, we develop efficient and
robust algorithms for maximizing or minimizing functions. This inherently inter-
disciplinary work has immediate applications in a wide range of fields, and we
demonstrate its effectiveness on problems from electrical engineering and
hydrology.
