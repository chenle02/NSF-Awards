A grant has been awarded to the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga under
the direction of Margaret J. Kovach to acquire a microarray scanner and real-
time PCR system to enhance undergraduate research and education in molecular
biology. The instrumentation will be used by faculty and students in the
departments of Biological and Environmental Sciences and Chemistry to elucidate
changes in gene expression associated with biological processes. Microarray
analysis offers the advantage of profiling expression levels of thousands of
genes simultaneously, whereas real-time PCR analysis provides precise
quantification of expression levels for a small set of genes. In this proposal,
these methods will be applied to model systems to measure responses to
experimental stimuli to gain a better understanding of the molecular events
behind certain biological processes. Specifically, this proposal is comprised of
13 research and teaching activities by five faculty members that represent a
wide range of biological research and organismal systems including: mechanisms
of gene regulation associated with genomic instability and tissue
differentiation in mammals, physiological stress responses in plants, muscle and
bone development in fish, the role of biologically active small molecules on
biochemical processes and the activity of soil microbes in bioremediation and
biogeochemistry of forests and wetlands.

This proposal will enhance faculty development and student growth by enriching
course offerings in molecular biology, plant physiology, developmental biology,
biochemistry and microbiology through integration of hands-on exposure to
advanced genomic and proteomic applications such as microarray analysis and
quantitative real-time PCR. Pivotal to the student?s education is increasing the
number and variety of experimental procedures available for independent research
projects through modern instrumentation. Ultimately, this grant will serve to
train young scientists in cutting edge technologies relevant to post-graduate
studies and employment in molecular biology and biotechnology.
