Large numbers of students take mathematics courses in high school yet leave
high school without an understanding of how mathematics is affecting their lives
(e.g., CAT scans, compact disc recorders, cryptological protection of banking
transactions, etc.) Mathematics is too frequently taught in a void, outside of
any personal or historical context. Fortunately, new development in mathematics
and mathematics education provide an opportunity to make constructive changes in
the content and context of how mathematics is taught in high school This
approach involves stressing applications of mathematics at all stages of the
curriculum, and emphasizing a historical approach to see how mathematical
concepts and applications evolved. Exciting and important examples abound:
Euler's work on graph theory laid the foundations for modern applications to
operations research, spurred by the exigencies of World War II; the work of
Malthus and Volterra on population growth led to mathematical models now being
applied to critical environmental and ecological problems. The primary goal of
this project is the development of a series of student-ready modules that use a
historical framework to study a variety of recent significant areas of
applicability (optimization, voting, growth, cryptology, etc.). Over the grant
period, the COMAP staff will produce six modules in both student and teacher
versions and a fifteen-minute video segment. COMAP will dedicate its efforts,
through its network of over 20,000 high school mathematics teachers, to ensure
widespread dissemination of the materials.
