$86,434 - 12 mos. Formal Consensus Models in Belief Networks: Theoretical
Developments and an Application to Advanced Clean Coal Technology A significant
number of intelligent system designers favor belief networks as the formalism
underlying their systems' knowledge bases. This project uses belief networks as
the framework for developing formal consensus models for reconciling disparate
recommendations from multiple experts. The need for formal consensus models
stems from the fact that decision-makers often seek advice from multiple
experts. Research in belief networks within this project is pursued within the
context of the need for decisions among various advanced clean coal technologies
that promise to reduce environmental discharges while simultaneously improving
coal plant efficiency and reducing operating costs. So products of this project
will include both belief networks in this important area and formal consensus
models for belief networks.
