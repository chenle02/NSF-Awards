"Explore Evolution" is a three-year project that uses a combination of traveling
exhibits and activity kits to introduce the concept of evolution to museum
audiences and 4-H groups. Six museum partners will collaborate on the
development of eleven interactive exhibit modules on the following topics:
disease in humans, eye development in animals, fruit fly diversity, sexual
selection, hominoid development and extinction. The museum consortium includes
the Kansas Museum and Biodiversity Center, Museum of the Rockies (MT), Sam Noble
Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, Science Museum of Minnesota, University of
Nebraska State Museum and the Exhibits Museum of the University of Michigan. The
inquiry-based activity kits will be modeled after the University of Nebraska-
Lincoln's "Wonderwise" kits, funded in part by NSF, and designed for middle
school audiences. An "Explore Evolution" website will be launched to support the
exhibits and activity kits. Dissemination will occur through museum education
programs as well as a consortium of 4-H programs in Iowa, Minnesota, Montana,
Michigan, Nebraska and Wyoming. It is anticipated that more than 1.8 million
museum visitors and 800,000 4-H members will participate in this project.
