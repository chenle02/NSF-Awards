This instrument is designed to monitor the work function of surfaces during
processing. It will measure the contact potential difference between the surface
and an inert reference electrode by avariable capacitance non-mechanical, non-
contact technique. The instrument design allows monitoring of surface electrical
properties of high Tc oxide superconductors during manufacture of SQUIDS and RF
cavity structures, and of semiconductor wafers during processing. A modulation
technique allows higher frequency operation than standard methods, offering
lower noise, faster response, and greater resolution.
