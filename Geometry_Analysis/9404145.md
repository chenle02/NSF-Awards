9404145 Barge The research covers studies of rotational behavior for invariant
irreducible plane continua using methods of topological dynamics. Minimal sets
of Denjoy type and periodic orbits will also be investigated. The research has
potential applications to other areas of dynamical systems and chaos theory. ***
