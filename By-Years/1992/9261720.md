Millions of tons of mine tailings and dump wastes occur throughout the United
States that contain residual metals of both commercial and environmental
interest. Many of these materials contain economic concentrations of copper,
silver, and other metals. Other heavy metals such as lead, zinc, and cadmium are
found in these materials that may leach into surface and ground water supplies.
Many of these tailings and dumps have been on site for many years and have been
weathered or oxidized. Therefore, classical biooxidative leaching is not
appropriate for these materials. MBX Systems Inc. has shown that bioreductive
bacteria can solubilize metals from oxide minerals. MBX Systems Inc. proposes to
use these nonacid-generating bacteria to biologically reprocess these waste
materials recovering marketable metals to support the operations and removing
other metals that are toxic to the environment.
