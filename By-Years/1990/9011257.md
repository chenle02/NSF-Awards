This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Dr.
Kenneth B. Wiberg at Yale University. The results of this investigation will
provide new insights into the ways that chemical reactivity is dependent on
molecular structure. The experiments that will be carried out by Professor
Wiberg will focus on the chemical and physical properties of unactivated carbon-
carbon bonds in small-ring hydrocarbons. New and unusual small-ring compounds
will be synthesized, and their reactivities will be examined using kinetic and
tracer studies. Spectroscopic methods will be used to study the influence of
bond angle deformations and substituent effects, and theoretical calculations
will be employed to obtain detailed information on the origins of the observed
properties for ground-state species and reactive intermediates.
