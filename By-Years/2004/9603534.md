9603534 Wang This award supports a three year program of cooperation in solar
physics research between Haimin Wang, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and Ai
Guoxiang, Beijing Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences. This
award adds an international dimension to work funded under CAREER award ATM
9628862. The opportunity to coordinate longitudinal coverage of the sun and the
ability to see solar events from the Earth at different longitudes on Earth are
very important reasons to collaborate with China in this field. China has
assigned a high priority to solar research, and does more research in this area
than the U.S. does. This cooperative program will allow U.S. researchers access
to a major space solar program initiated by the Chinese. The Huairou Solar
Observing Station of the Beijing Astronomical Observatory is the center of solar
physics research in China. Support for Chinese participation in the project will
be provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.
