This award will support two months of a six-month, long-term visit by Professor
Craig A. Tracy and his graduate student Mr. Morris Beatty of the Department of
Mathematics at the University of California, Davis, to Japan for a cooperative
research project with Professor T. Miwa, Research Institute for Mathematical
Sciences (RIMS) at Kyoto University. Their collaborative research will involve
continued investigation into isomonodromic t-functions that arise from a
holonomic quantum field theory of free fermions on manifolds. This will be
important in understanding and clarifying the nature of phases for a quantum
field theory in hyperbolic space; and it should permit a transparent discussion
of the zero curvature limit. Results of the research should have implications
for holonomic quantum fields, integrable systems and differential geometry. The
research is of fundamental importance with respect to isomonodromy problems in
mathematical physics. Both groups are well-respected experts in their field.
RIMS is the ideal Institute for the researchers to carry out their research. At
Kyoto they will be working with the inventors of the notion of a t-function;
Professors Mikio Sato, Tetsuji Miwa and Michio Jimbo. They are all known for
their innovative approach to holonomic quantum fields and associated
isomonodromic transformations. In addition, there are many experts in Riemann
surface theory at the Institute. It is expected that, following the expiration
of this award, collaborations between the researchers are likely to continue.
