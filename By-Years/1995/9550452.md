HRD-9550452 The purpose of the project is to develop a mathematical environment
for students with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). These students tend to be
easily distracted and tend to disrupt the typical classroom, thus they tend to
be several years behind their appropriate grade level. For this reason, few ADD
students enter careers in mathematics and science. The project will include the
following: (1) Adaptation and/or design of innovative instructional and
motivational mathematics activities specifically for students K-12 with ADD.
Particular emphasis will be placed on the use of technology, writing,
cooperative learning, experimentation, and manipulatives in mathematics
education. The NCTM standards will be applied throughout. (2) Training of
teachers in the use of these techniques and making materials readily available
for classroom use. By meeting these objectives, the project will benefit
students with ADD by accelerating the development of their mathematical
capabilities and putting them on a level with their peers. This improvement also
should change their attitude toward the study of mathematics so that it ceases
to be a chore and becomes more an interest. Implementation of this project is
intended to result in methodology for teaching mathematics to children with ADD
so that students with this problem will have better educational outcomes.
