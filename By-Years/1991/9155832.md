An introductory engineering course based entirely on case studies will be
developed. It will stress timeless aspects of engineering--involving design,
visual thinking, judgement, and the like--that are independent of the state-of-
the-art. Differences between engineering and science will be emphasized in order
to convey to students that the goals of the engineering curriculum are distinct
from those of the math, science, and engineering-science courses that dominate
the first two years of study. The case studies will be chosen not only for their
technical content but also for the inherently interesting humanistic and social
contexts in which they show engineers how work and engineering projects do
occur. As part of the course, each student will be required to develop an
independent case study (chosen from a well-prepared list) and report on it
orally and in writing. The course will thus emphasize to first-year students the
importance of reading, speaking, and writing skills for the practice of
engineering. Students will be expected to take from the course a broad
collection of case studies that will provide a real-world context in which to
interpret and integrate subsequent engineering coursework. The experience is
also expected to convey at an early stage a sense of professionalism that will
have career-long implications. The course material and case studies will be
collected and disseminated widely, potentially affecting in fundamental ways how
engineering is taught.
