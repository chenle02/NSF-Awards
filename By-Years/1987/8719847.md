Dr. Sillen will chair a two week conference which will bring together
approximately 20 experts in physical anthropology and allied fields to discuss
the application of chemical techniques to the reconstruction of prehistoric
human diet. In particular the group will focus on the analysis of human skeletal
remains. Past research has shown that different foodstuffs vary in their
isotopic composition of carbon and nitrogen as well as such trace minerals as
strontium. These differences are often reflected in the bone composition of
their consumers and through analysis of skeletal remains it is possible to gain
some insight into diet. However the suite of techniques used to accomplish this
are still under development and this conference will examine specific problems
and suggest ways around them. In particular the participants will focus on
variation in the foods themselves, methods of analysis, the problem of
diagenesis (change in bone composition over time) and the analysis of specific
archaeological sites. The research is important because it will increase our
understanding of our own past and help to establish a baseline against which
modern human diets can be measured.
