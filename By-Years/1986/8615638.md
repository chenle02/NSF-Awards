With this grant in the Organic an Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Dr. J. E.
McMurry will attempt to encapsulate ions (cations and anions) within the very
restrictive cavity of bicyclo?4.4.4!tetradecane derivatives. These ions can be
viewed as models for what is believe to be the transition states of common
Organic reactions that follow cationic (carbonium ion) or anionic (SN2)
mechanistic paths. One such cation, with a symmetrical C-H-C three center two
electron bond, has been prepared and fully characterized. Similarly a fluorine
cation will be formed and investigated. The complimentary preparation and study
of anionic encapsulated hydrogen and fluorine will be pursued. The preparation
of these kinds of charged organic systems will make fundamental contributions to
our knowledge of chemical bonding. The facilities available to Professor McMurry
are suitable for the research to be conducted, and the prior results of the
Principal Investigator demonstrate his abilities.
