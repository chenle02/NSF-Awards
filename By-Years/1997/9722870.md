Walsh 9722870 This award will support five undergraduate engineering students
and two faculty advisors to travel to Japan to participate in the International
Robot Grand Prix hosted by the Tokyo Institute of Technology and to visit
Japanese university, government and corporate laboratories which conduct
research on robotics. Dr. Gregory Walsh of the Department of Mechanical
Engineering, University of Maryland, is the principal investigator for this
project. He organized and taught a senior level mechatronic design course in
which students designed and constructed an autonomous mobile robot that will be
entered in the Grand Prix. Robotics, which is becoming an increasingly important
generic technology, is an area in which the Japanese excel. This project will
enable a group of highly motivated U.S. engineering students to have focused
technical interactions with Japanese students and researchers working in this
important area. It is expected that exposure to the Japanese laboratories,
together with the interaction and exchange of ideas with their Japanese
counterparts, will enable the American participants to initiate beneficial
collaborative research activities. ***
