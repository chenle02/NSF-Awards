Condensed matter physics has made tremendous contributions to society over the
past several decades through the study and development of novel materials such
as semiconductors and computer memory devices. Presently, however, the condensed
matter physics community is at a crossroads, faced with challenges of
understanding the fundamental behavior of increasingly complex materials. This
workshop brings together leading experimentalists, both junior and senior
faculty and researchers from across the US, to discuss emerging trends and ideas
to better measure and understand such materials. The discovery of several new
materials in recent years has highlighted the need for advanced experiments. The
iron pnictide superconductors, for example, exhibit a complex interplay of
electronic, spin and lattice degrees of freedom that give rise to difficulties
of interpretation. In order to make progress, novel experiments to measure the
response of these systems to non-traditional perturbations such as uniaxial or
hydrostatic pressure, high magnetic fields, or large electric fields are vital.
This workshop brings together experimentalists in these different fields with
the goal to elucidate potential new opportunities that may emerge by combining
techniques that traditionally have remained disparate. The workshop features a
panel discussion on current and emerging trends, and will explore topics at the
frontier of correlated electron research.
