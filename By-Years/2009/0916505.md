Future communication networks are envisioned be dynamic reconfigurable at the
physical, label and routing layers forming a multiple layer communication
infrastructure. In the resulting hierarchical structure each layer is a network
on its own, having the flexibility to change the formation dynamically. There
are also structural dependencies due to the multilayer infrastructure. For
example, a link failure at a lower layer can impact multiple links at an upper
layer. With dynamic changes in traffic demand, reconfigurability, and structural
dependencies, future multilayer networks present new design challenges. In this
project, future multilayer network design is addressed by considering routing
properties of different layer networks, layer dependencies, virtualization,
topological reconfigurability, and resiliency. For this, new optimization models
are developed. As the problems can be large due to interdependencies, new design
algorithms are developed that exploit the special structure of the problems. The
exploration of multilayer networks with emerging technological possibilities
leads to key insights that would benefit future networks in terms of efficient
and robust network design, deployment, and operations. Expected results include
new design models and algorithms. Studies conducted will provide deeper
understanding of the overall system dynamics in terms of interdependencies in
layers and trade-offs on functionalities to be invoked in different layers. All
research results will be made available to the scientific community.
