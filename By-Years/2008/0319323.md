This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
establish the feasibility of merging a novel radiometrically-accurate
nonuniformity correction (NUC) algorithm with the wireless infrared-sensor
technology. As the low cost of uncooled amorphous-Si technology is accompanied
with substantiated fixed-pattern noise (FPN), the proposed NUC capability is an
enabling technology sought to elevate the performance of the affordable uncooled
sensors to a level competitive with that of the costly cooled sensors. In
addition to its impressive computational efficiency, the proposed NUC algorithm
has the unique feature that it maintains radiometric accuracy without
compromising the continuous operation capability of the sensor. In this project,
a comprehensive study will be launched to optimize the proposed NUC algorithm
for both on-sensor and near-sensor modes of operation in microbolometer sensors
described above. Prototype digital and hardware will be developed to implement
the algorithm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the ability to remove the calibration
dead time and the FPN, the system reliability will be increased dramatically.
The diversification of the market for the detectors is currently limited because
of the FPN in the detector. If, by some means, the FPN can be eliminated, the
uncooled cost-effective microbolometer detector can be applied to markets where
cooled high performance detectors dominate, such as predictive and preventative
maintenance and surveillance applications. In addition, the existence of a cost-
effective uncooled detector can be integrated into smaller packages such as
flashlights and can be provided to mobile security forces, government special
agents and law enforcement officials.&lt;br/&gt;
