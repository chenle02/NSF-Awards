This grant provides funding for research on the complexity of the design
process. Data are obtained as discrete sequences of instructions; they form
`curves` in a multi-dimensional design space, approximating an underlying design
`surface`. Thus, given two points on such a surface (an initial design and a
final design), there exists a geodesic (or shortest path) in theory. Yet,
practical design sequences are rarely optimal in the sense of being the
shortest. There are personal preferences and there are group practices which
cause a design to deviate from the ideal, shortest path. Such a phenomenon is
studied by analogy to a Lagrangian; the optimization of a path as the
maintenance of the excess of the kinetic energy (from an individual, manifested
as `creativity` or `preference`) over the potential energy (from the
environment, as `outside influence` or `group practice`). If successful, this
research will lead to the understanding of the `mechanics` of creation, as
constrained by the environment in which the designer is in. It permits explicit
experimentation with `what-if` scenarios such as: what happens when `peer
pressure` exceeds a certain critical point; what if `peer pressure` is replaced
by `self-drive`? The work is expected to be useful in explaining the emergence
of patterns or structures exhibited in socio-economics, biological systems, and
non-equilibrium chemo-dynamics.
