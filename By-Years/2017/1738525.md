The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is significant. On the commercial front, this
project introduces a disruptive technology in motion tracking. The technology
can benefit a broad customer base, including gaming, VR/AR and smart appliances.
On the societal front, the motion tracking technology enables new ways of
controlling virtually everything around us, which can lead to new ways of
education, telepresence, health care, and scientific experiments. Moreover, the
novel algorithms developed in the project significantly advance the state-of-art
in localization and motion tracking technology. Through its internship program,
the project provides exciting hands-on research experience opportunities for
students and teaches them how to transfer research into products. Such
experience will train them as leaders in future research &amp; development
roles.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project develops accurate motion tracking and gesture recognition
systems using acoustic signals to offer four distinct advantages: (i) high
tracking accuracy; (ii) low-cost and easy deployment without the need for
additional hardware; (iii) easy to use; and (iv) the ability to function under a
wide range of scenarios. The technology can potentially revolutionize gaming,
VR/AR, and the smart appliance industry, and opens the door to new applications.
In addition to designing accurate motion tracking systems, the project will
create a software development kit (SDK) and several significant applications
that take advantage of the accurate tracking capability.
