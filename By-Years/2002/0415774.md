This award provides funding to the Chemistry REU Leadership Group to enhance the
effectiveness of more than sixty Chemistry REU sites. The Chemistry REU
Leadership group facilitates communication among the REU sites and prospective
participants and also supports undergraduate travel to professional meetings.
They will also host an online celebration of REU-supported participants and
projects. Support is also provided for regular meetings of the Chemistry
Leadership Group to meet to discuss program evaluation and development and
explore cooperative ventures between Chemistry REU programs and other programs
and organizations supporting undergraduate research. One partnership to be
strengthened is between the Chemistry REU sites and the Louis Stokes Alliance
for Minority Participation (LS AMP) sites.

The Chemistry REU leadership group will also organize a pan-disciplinary REU
site director's meeting in the Spring of 2005. This pan-disciplinary meeting is
jointly sponsored by the Directorates of Mathmatical and Physical Sciences;
Education and Human Resources; Compututer and Information Science and
Engineering; Engineering; Geosciences; and Social, Behavioral and Economic
Sciences.
