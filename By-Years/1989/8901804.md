This action is to develop a catalog of potential field experimentation sites
for geotechnical engineering research. Such an action was recommended by the
NSF- supported workshop on "National Test Sites for Geotechnical Research", held
at the University of New Hampshire on September 25-28, 1988. A preliminary
catalog was assembled for the workshop. This catalog is being extended to
identify locations missed in the initial catalog. For each site identified, all
available documentation is being summarized in a standard format. This
information will improve greatly the site selection process, with a
corresponding contribution to geotechnical field experimentation. The objective
is to disseminate this catalog widely among those researchers interested in
geotechnical field experimentation.
