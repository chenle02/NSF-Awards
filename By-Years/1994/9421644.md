This award is for support of a three year study to analyze geophysical data
(airborne and ground based radio-echo profiles, surface ice motion and strain
rate data, snow accumulation rate and surface temperature data) collected both
on Taylor Dome and Taylor Glacier to aid in the paleo-climatic interpretation of
the Taylor Dome ice core. The project will have three components: 1) Processing
of data from the airborne radio-echo survey which was flown over Taylor Dome.
This data will be combined with ground- based radar profiles and used along with
the stratigraphy to infer mass balance and ice flow, using 2-D and 3-D ice flow
models; 2) Refinement and improve-ment of thermomechanical model calculations
(incorporating ice velocity, strain data, surface accumulation rate data and ice
core data) to allow a better dating of the deep ice core; and 3) Analy-sis of
all data sets in order to compare the ice core paleoclimate record with the
radiocarbon-dated Dry Valleys record of paleoclimate. No new field work is
involved in this project.
