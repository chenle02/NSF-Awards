9708986 Cinlar This award provides funds to partially support the 1997 Seminar
on Stochastic Processes. The seminars have become one of the most important
regular seminar series for probabilists in the USA. They attract and bring
together an active group of eminent researchers and young specialists in
probability and stochastic processes. The emphasis areas this year will be
stochastic calculus, stochastic partial differential equations, and numerical
methods for them. The primary aim is to provide an overview of significant lines
of research and to enable participants to discuss their work in an informal
atmosphere.
