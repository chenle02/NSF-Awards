This project is concerned with the development and analysis of methods of
solution of nonlinear partial problems differential equations. In particular,
the initial value problems of the Boussinesq and Korteweg-deVries equations will
be studied. Periodic solutions of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential
equations and their bifurcations will also be pursued. Nonlinear hyperbolic
partial differential equations appear in many applications to physics and
continuum mechanics.
