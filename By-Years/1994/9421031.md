9421031 Haselkorn This multi-user equipment award provides funds for an
automated DNA sequencer and associated components. The principal users are
members of the Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology. The research
themes of the users are united by interests in gene organization and regulation,
with the organisms being studied including bacteria, yeast, and plants. The
bacterial work concentrates on the photosynthetic Anabaena bacteria. More than
1,000 genes are being studied whose expression is differentially induced by the
production of heterocysts. Yeast work is concentrating on regions of the
chromosomes that are relatively silent in gene expression and the identification
of other genes that can induce expression in the silent regions. The plant work
is primarily on Arabidopsis, where genes required for interaction between pollen
grains and the pistil during fertilization are being identified. Genes from
other organisms that have similar DNA base sequences are being isolated and
sequenced. A gene family that codes for the chloroplast processing enzyme is
being identified. This family is responsible for enabling proteins to enter the
chloroplasts, where photosynthesis occurs. Finally, genes from wheat that are
involved in herbicide resistance are being sequenced in order to see how they
differ from the genes in sensitive plants. %%% The sequencing being carried out
with this machine is important for our understanding of bacterial development,
gene expression in yeast, and mechanisms of herbicide resistance in crop plants.
