This EAGER project and the methods that will be developed combine recent
advances in peptide mass spectrometry with quantitative genetics and has
potential value to the broader scientific community as a high-throughput, low-
cost assay that is applicable to any organism and any post-translational
modification. The project will provide training for a graduate student in
proteomics, quantitative genetics and plant physiology and molecular
biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most decisions made by plants utilize post-
translational mechanisms that sense changes in the environment or in other cells
of the plant, and that lead to transcriptional changes. A major kind of post-
translational mechanism is the reversible post-translational modification of
proteins. There are many known modifications; the best studied is
phosphorylation. Many aspects of plant stress and plant development are
regulated by protein phosphorylation. Recent proteomic surveys have shown that
phosphorylation is dynamic and widespread throughout the proteome. A technical
grand challenge for research on protein phosphorylation is to develop a method
for mapping the enzyme-substrate relationships for every protein kinase and
phosphatase. This EAGER project will develop a method to meet this grand
challenge. Specific objectives include 1) developing assays for approximately 50
proteins known to undergo biotic stress-induced changes in phosphorylation at
specific sites; 2) mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) that regulate the
levels of phosphorylation at each site; and, 3) validating the function of
selected genes underlying 15 QTL. All data (e.g., raw MS spectra, m/z values,
ion intensities, isotope ratios, and chromatography retention times) will be
available through the project website and upon request.
