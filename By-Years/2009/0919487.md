Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;The history of the development of practice in
many engineering disciplines is, in large part, the story of failures, both
imminent and actual, and of changes to designs, standards, and procedures made
as a result of the timely interventions or forensic analyses. Case studies are
an effective vehicle for not only improving student understanding of forensic
engineering and the underlying theoretical principles but also for highlighting
non-technical issues such as professional and ethical responsibility. Despite
their usefulness, case studies in forensic engineering are not in widespread use
in undergraduate civil engineering curricula. Through this project, forensic
engineering case studies that feature structural failures are being adopted at
thirteen diverse universities across the country. The case studies cover a wide
range of structural failures and were previously developed and rigorously
evaluated through a CCLI Phase 1 project. Student learning and improvements in
motivation through the use of failure case studies are being evaluated through
this project at these diverse institutions and the results are being broadly
disseminated to the engineering education community.
