9403199 Resasco This is a study of the mechanisms of promotion occurring in
olefin alkylation and methane coupling reactions when transition metals are
added to sulfated zirconia catalysts. Promoters such as iron, manganese,
platinum, and tin that can modify the initially high acidity of these materials
are studied; acid catalyst site densities and strengths are measured. A series
of weak bases is used to characterize acid-site distribution by temperature-
programmed desorption. A variable temperature, diffuse-reflectance, Fourier-
transform infrared spectrometer is used to monitor interactions of probe
molecules with acid sites. These results are correlated with mass spectra of the
evolved products to illuminate reaction mechanisms. The effect of hydrogen is
also observed. The reactions being studied are being introduced to replace
refinery operations that are no longer environmentally acceptable. When these
systems are fully developed ( a ways off yet), they will permit natural gas to
displace crude oil as the principal source of liquid fuels and petrochemical
(including polymer) feedstocks. ***
