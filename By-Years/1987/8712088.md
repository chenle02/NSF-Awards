This research is aimed at providing an improved understanding of the chemical
transformations and environmental fates of chemical compounds in the atmosphere
that interact with airborne particulate matter. While many gaseous chemical
conversions (homogeneous) have been well documented, heterogeneous phase
reactions are less well understood. A combination of theoretical predictions,
basic laboratory studies, and field investigations support conclusions that
heterogeneous reactions are probably important atmospheric chemical processes.
One objective of this work is to improve the capabilities for studying
heterogeneous chemical transformations in the atmosphere. This research project
may lead to new concepts in chemical reactivity in atmospheric systems. The
specific objectives for this project are to: (1) develop improved understandings
of atmospheric heterogeneous chemical reactions; and (2) determine trends,
patterns and behavior of chemical reactions between gases and complex
atmospheric aerosols.
