9452989 Stombler The Georgia Institute of Technology seeks partial funding from
NSF to host the U.S. Academic Decathlon on April 18-21, 1996. The United States
Academic Decathlon is a high school program whose goals include improving the
status, recognition and popularity of academic endeavors in every high school in
the United States. It is based on the athletic model that includes practice,
teamwork, competition and recognition. In 1996, 45 teams will be brought
together to compete in the National Tournament. The 1996 theme, "Cooperation and
Competition," recognizes the 1996 Summer Olympic Games to be held in Atlanta.
The 10 events include: an essay; speeches; interviews; written tests in
mathematics, science economics, social studies, humanities, fine arts and
language and literature; and a college bowl-like Super Quiz. ***
