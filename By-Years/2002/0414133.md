This is a project to plan for long-term U.S.-Azerbaijan collaborative research
on the geochemistry and sequence stratigraphy of the Maikop series in
Azerbaijan. &lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators are Cari Johnson from the
University of Utah and Malakhat Efendiyeva from the Geological Institute of the
Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maikop series
is a set of shales, which are likely the source rock for one of the most
prolific petroleum resources of the 20th &amp; 21st centuries, the South Caspian
Basin. If we can explain why the South Caspian Basin contains the most rapidly
deposited and thickest sedimentary successions anywhere and one that contains
substantial source and reservoir rocks for petroleum, this would be a major
advancement in our understanding of sedimentary basins everywhere.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in earth sciences research fulfills the
program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and
Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,
reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
