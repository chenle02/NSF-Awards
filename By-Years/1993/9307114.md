9307114 Czarnetzki This project seeks to install a network of three low-cost
computers to run an OS/2-based UNIDATA PC-McIDAS system. This network will
become an integral component of the existing meteorology course offerings, would
provide the needed sophistication for the development of additional atmospheric
science courses, and will provide data which could be used to initiate or
enhance research projects. The UNIDATA network will also make substantial
contributions to computer literacy initiatives in progress at the University of
Northern Iowa. ***
