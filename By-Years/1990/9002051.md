This award will support collaborative research between Professor Keith Pannell
of the University of Texas at El Paso and Professor Jorge Cervantes of the
Universidad de Guanajuato in Guanajuato, Mexico. The investigators will study
the synthesis of transition metal complexes containing Si-Si, Si-Ge, and Ge-Ge
bonds and their photochemical, mass spectral fragmentation, and electrochemical
properties investigated. Such studies will provide the first insight into the
capacity of germanium to participate in various processes and rearrangements
noted for oligosilyl complexes. Furthermore, the results will illustrate the
ability of these complexes to undergo various redox processes. Synthesis,
structural, photochemical, and multi- nuclear NMR studies will be performed at
the University of Texas at El Paso, Texas, while mass spectral analysis and
electrochemical studies will be performed at the Universidad de Guanajuato,
Guanajuato, Mexico.
