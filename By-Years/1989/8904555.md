This award will support Professor Mario Amzel of the Johns Hopkins University in
a research collaboration with Professor Julio Urbina of the Universidad Central
de Venezuela. The investigators intend to study the detailed molecular
mechanisms of the phosphofructokinase (PFK) and the PEP-carboxylase kinase (PEP-
CK) enzymes involved in the energy metabolism of the Trypanosoma Cruzi parasite.
This parasite, endemic to most areas of Latin America and the Caribbean, infects
animals and humans and in the latter it causes Chagas - a fatal disease that
results in loss of heart function. The kinetic and regulatory properties of the
two enzymes mentioned above play a central role in the unusual metabolic
strategy of this protozoan parasite. Further understanding of these key enzymes
will require knowledge of their three-dimensional structure. Using X-ray
diffraction techniques, the investigators intend to gain some insight into their
atomic structure. The study will serve to bring together the complementary
strengths of the U.S. side in X-ray diffraction studies of energy metabolizing
enzymes, with the expertise of the Venezuelan side in parasite metabolism.
Knowledge of the three- dimensional structure of any of these enzymes will allow
the design of more powerful agents against the parasite.
