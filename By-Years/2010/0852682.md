Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process that plays an important role in
the transfer of the solar wind mass, momentum, and energy into Earth's
magnetosphere. Fundamental issues on the micro- and mesoscale characteristics of
reconnection in the magnetopause boundary layer are not adequately understood.
This project will use a 3-D global hybrid plasma model to investigate magnetic
reconnection at the magnetopause. The hybrid code treats electrons as a fluid,
but includes full particle kinetics of ions. The code and is capable of
resolving the plasma physics in a broad range from ion gyro-period to the
dayside convection time scale, and from the ion Larmor radius to the global
scale lengths. The primary tasks of this project are: (1) determination of the
3-D structure of magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause, (2)
determination of the magnetic field and plasma properties and evolution of flux
transfer events (FTEs) in the magnetopause reconnection, (3) investigation of
the corresponding ion dynamics and velocity distributions in reconnection events
at various locations, and (4) investigation of the differences between
reconnection that occurs when the magnetic fields are primarily anti-parallel
and reconnection that occurs when there is a strong guide field (also know as
component reconnection). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will contribute to our
understanding of 3-D, multi-scale physics of magnetic reconnection in the global
magnetosphere and will improve our knowledge of the dynamical and structural
properties of geospace. The 3-D hybrid modeling efforts will also have broader
applications in other topics of magnetospheric, astrophysical, and laboratory
plasma physics. The study will include a graduate student and it will also
contribute to the National Science Foundation's goal of developing and
maintaining cutting edge national computing and information infrastructure for
research and education
