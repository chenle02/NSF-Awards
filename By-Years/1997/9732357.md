The investigators are exposing university faculty and students to the
interdisciplinary nature of interactions among the geosphere, hydrosphere,
cyrosphere, and biosphere, and their policy impact. This Earth System Science
Program will provide a Research Experiences for Undergraduates site, selecting
10 undergraduate students each summer. Summer activities, which complement the
existing ESS Program, involve data analysis and modeling activities focusing on
the effect of atmospheric aerosols and trace gases on solar radiation at or near
Earth's surface. Students will attend a series of ESS lectures, discuss critical
thinking across scientific disciplines, train in scientific writing, and develop
oral presentations.
