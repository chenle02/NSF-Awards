This research project is to investigate adaptive and nonlinear methods for the
solution of certain large and often ill-posed inverse problems, where the
solution may not depend continuously on the data. The particular applications
addressed concern large scale adaptive filtering computations, such as in active
noise control, and nonlinear and adaptive image enhancement computations. The
project is using a 400 node IBM SP2 at the Maui High Performance Computing
Center. This particular facility specializes in image and signal processing
applications. The project includes the following topics: - Fast and stable
adaptive algorithms for estimation and filtering, along with sensitivity
analysis, with applications in signal processing. - Nonlinear and adaptive image
enhancement methods, including Total Variation minimization involving partial
differential equations, adaptive multi-level segmentation-based methods, and a
combination of these two approaches. - Coupling numeric and symbolic
computations. - Parallelization of the algorithms. The project has strong
educational and REU research components, and includes participation by
underrepresented minorities.
