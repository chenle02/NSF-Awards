The Exploratorium will develop a series of Internet resources on three popular
topics -- cooking, gardening, and making music -- to encourage users in science
education activities in relation to daily activities. The three-year project
will include the development and testing of resources that explore the science
behind these topics, using the notion that we all, consciously or not, are
"accidental scientists" who engage in the scientific process in the course of
everyday life. Target audiences include general public adults and youth.
Components of the site will feature aspects of cooking, gardening, and making
music that are intended to appeal to diverse communities. The resources will
also serve formal education through the Exploratorium's national and local
network of educators.
