This award, administered by Prof. Michael Haley of the University of Oregon,
will support a newly established Gordon Research Seminar (GRS; conference title:
Physical Organic Chemistry--Methodology, Scope and Defining New Frontiers) in
Summer 2013. This event brings together young scientists working in areas
ranging from mechanistic organic, bio-organic and physical chemistry to
theoretical, macromolecular and materials chemistry to discuss, communicate and
learn about new research in these fields. Their attendance will be complemented
by the involvement of established senior scientists who can discuss the latest
developments in the field and provide an exchange of ideas between junior and
senior investigators. The attendees will also participate in a tandem
conference, the Gordon Research Conference on Physical Organic Chemistry, which
encompasses areas ranging from synthetic and mechanistic organic chemistry,
including reactive intermediates, computational chemistry, spectroscopy and
photochemistry, to advanced functional materials and supramolecular chemistry as
well as chemical processes in biological systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Physical
organic chemistry is broadly defined and of fundamental importance for the
development of interdisciplinary areas that link together chemical synthesis,
biological and material sciences with theoretical and physical chemistry.
Participation in two related conferences on analogous topics will help "jump
start" the careers of young investigators on the threshold of their careers.
