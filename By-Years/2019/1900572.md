Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and
Universities to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to
strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate
education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty
member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution,
and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project will
investigate the impacts of learning about the basic science of sleep on interest
and motivation among STEM students on interest and motivation. Further, this
project will enhance teaching and learning at Fort Valley State University and
increase professional development and marketable quantitative skills of
underrepresented STEM students to prepare them for workforce entry or graduate
school. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to understand the
impact of an integrated research and education plan that focuses on the
introduction of basic sleep science into the learning curriculum as an
intervention to impact student STEM interest, motivation and performance. This
project builds on Social Cognitive Career Theory and preliminary data that
suggest that learning about the basic science of sleep, sleep deprivation and
its health effects promote academic interest, motivation and performance in STEM
fields. To meet this goal, researchers will investigate the impact of science
based sleep education modules, consisting of a series of sleep science based
research components and the incorporation of technology tools with education on
sleep-related health outcomes. At the conclusion of this project we expect to
have shown that introduction of the science based sleep education modules is an
effective method for enhancing learning of and engagement in complex STEM
science concepts by students, and established the effectiveness of the
professional development of educators in basic sleep science as an intervention
tool for student success. This project addresses a significant need to identify
the most effective interventions for enhancing interest, motivation and
performance in STEM fields and to disseminate this knowledge directly to
educators and students. Moreover, this project will contribute to a general
framework to evaluate the delivery of basic science concepts and project based
learning services in undergraduate STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
