An exploratory study is conducted to develop an analytical model for the
nonlinear guy cables which anchor the bottom of an ocean tower to maintain its
lateral stability. Each guy line consists of a lead line, a trailing line, and a
clump weight to limit the tension in the cable. For normal sea condition a
relatively stiff system is required. However, in survival sea states it is
desired to allow the system to become more compliant. This is achieved by making
the clump weight leave the resting position on the sea floor, thus making the
system more flexible and decreasing the dynamic amplificaton factor. The effort
will be focused on the development of a stochastic linearization technique in
the frquency domain for a systems involving coupled nonlinearities in stiffness
and damping, and on the development of a more accurate and efficient model of
slack guylines to simulate the dynamic contact of the guyline and clump weight
with the ocean bottom.
