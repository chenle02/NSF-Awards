The kinetics of oxidation at high pressure is a basic yet poorly understood
problem of combustion. The proposed faculty should enable this research to
resolve the mechanisms involved in the combustion of alkynes fuels approaching
the complexity of actual automotive fuels. Special care will be brought to the
design and instrumentation of this program, while numerical programs will enable
a swift interpretation of the collected data. High pressure combustion is the
key to efficient combustion (thermodynamics cycles). Yet it is still an art
rather than a science: "knocking" is an example of an ambiguous, unresolved high
pressure problem. This study should be a good first step toward a scientific
resolution of this problem.
