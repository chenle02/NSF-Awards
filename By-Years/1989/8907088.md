Funding is requested for the neccessary equipment to construct a custom-designed
high-temperature fermentation system, as well as funds for the development of
several new pieces of equipment. The research will study extremophiles. These
studies are likely to lead to important new industrial applications as well as
advances in basic microbiology. Research on extremophiles is lagging because of
a lack of suitable facilities for mass culturing these organisms. This proposal,
if funded, will attack some of the research deficiencies in this area.
