The proposal requests funding to help defray the expenses of US participants in
the "Third Symposium on Spectral and Scattering Theory" that will be held July
17-28, 2017, on the campus of the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC)
in Florianopolis, Brazil. The bulk of the support is directed at graduate
students and postdocs. For additional information see the conference website:
http://www.math.purdue.edu/~sabarre/SymposiumFlorianopolis.html.

The purpose of this symposium, the third in a series that began in 2003, is to
bring together experts working on diverse aspects of scattering and spectral
theory, as well as related inverse problems, in order to stimulate interactions
and collaborations among the participants. A highlight of the 2017 event will be
four minicourses for graduate students and postdocs taught by well-known experts
in the field. The topics of the minicourses and their presenters are the
following: the stability of matter (Rafael Benguria); x-ray tomography and
boundary rigidity (Colin Guillarmou); quantum ergodicity of eigenfunctions
(Hamid Hezari); inverse scattering theory (Andreas Kirsch).
