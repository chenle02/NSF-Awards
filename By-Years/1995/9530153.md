P.I. : PAINE, ROBERT T. Proposal #: 95- 30153 PROPOSAL ABSTRACT All natural
communities are organized in the sense that the species within them interact
with one another. When the strengths and rates of interaction are known,
understanding the forces that regulate community structure can be estimated.
These estimates are useful for modelling the predictability of biological
changes due to natural processes and anthropogenic impacts. Such knowledge is
basic to food web theory and many conservation issues. The proposed research
will examine four kinds of experiments to explore the importance of a major
predator (the starfish Pisaster) when excluded and when introduced in rocky
intertidal habitats. In addition, long-term (ca. 25-y) monitoring routines will
be continued. These studies will supply information on inter-annual variation in
the abundance of a suite of grazers, in the disturbance factors effecting mussel
beds, and in the intensity of barnacle recruitment.
