This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the area
of chemistry. During the summer of 1992, twelve undergraduate students will
spend ten weeks engaged in research in the chemical sciences, under the
direction of various members of the faculty in chemistry. The students will
participate with Baylor students and students from several foreign exchanges in
cross-cultural experiences in addition to weekly seminars, an end of summer
undergraduate research symposium, especially designed classes in modern
instrumentation, and glassblowing. Trips to nearby industries and research
institutions will be organized.
