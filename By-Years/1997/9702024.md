In conventional magnetic and optical recording, data is stored by saturating
the media in one of two states. In M-ary recording, more than two recorded
signals are used, allowing for larger storage capacity and higher data transfer
rates. A number of M-ary recording channels are being developed for optical
recording and a good deal of work has been done by the PI and others in this
area. The primary objective in the research plan is to move to the next level in
the understanding, modeling and analysis of channels, codes and signal
processing for M-ary recording channels. The research plan addresses fundamental
limits of M-ary constrained recording channels and new coding approaches which
seek to achieve them. The teaching plan seeks to increase the number of trained
engineers in signal processing and communications for recording and emphasizes
close connection with and feedback from industry. The specific research and
educational objectives are: 1) To integrate communications and optical models to
better characterize the fundamental limits (i.e. channel capacity) associated
with optical (both binary and nonbinary) recording channels. 2) To develop new
methodologies for code design for M-ary channels whose constraints are typically
difficult to deal with. 3) To develop new modulation codes for M-ary recording
channels which exploit their three dimensional nature. 4) To develop new
educational approaches that emphasize the interrelation of system components and
help develop a broader perspective. 5) To emphasize interaction with industry
and to take advantage of undergraduate and PhD co-op programs. 6) To continue
developing outreach programs for encouraging research careers for
undergraduates. The proposed research and educational activities will: 1)
Educate and train a core group of researchers in the emerging area of M-ary
recording both in fundamental limits and practical systems implementations. 2)
Result in modulation codes that are c onceived and designed from a systems and
practical perspective and achieve the largest known information density.
