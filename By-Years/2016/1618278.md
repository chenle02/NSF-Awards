Energy-harvesting and wireless power transfer are quickly becoming game-changing
technologies for wireless systems by opening the exciting possibility to build
self-sustainable, maintenance-free networks of perpetually communicating
devices. In a harvesting wireless device, energy is a random and dynamic
quantity that is continuously generated and consumed, and this leads to a
fundamental shift in communication system design principles. The broad goal of
this project is to lay the theoretical foundations for communication system
design under such random energy dynamics. This foundation can enable optimal
trade-offs between cost, size, energy and performance in the design of these
wireless devices and is critical to scale them to trillions to enable the true
emergence of Internet of Everything. The project also promotes the training of
research engineers through a plan that envisions close interaction with system
and device groups at the home institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
consists of three parts. The first part focuses on a point-to-point channel
where the transmission energy is provided by an external random energy arrival
process. The project develops a framework for approximating the capacity of this
channel with explicit guarantees on the approximation gap. The second part looks
at remotely powered communication, where the external energy arrival process at
the transmitter can be partially controlled by a remote energy source. It
develops an information-theoretic formulation for this problem that reveals a
novel interactive coding problem, where actions of the remote source depend on
previous actions of the transmitter and vice versa. The third part clarifies how
wireless devices powered by these new mechanisms can be made to coexist and
cooperate forming large scalable wireless networks.
