This award funds Student Travel Fellowships for students from the United States
(US) attending 2023 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data.
SIGMOD will be held in Seattle, Washington, USA from June 18 to June 23, 2023.
The Student Fellowships will help cover the travel costs for a diverse group of
US students, allowing them to attend the conference, disseminate their work, and
discuss it with other attendees from academia and industry. The conference also
allows students to interact with future national and international scientific
collaborators. In this edition, the conference incorporates events specifically
designed for students to participate in discussions with each other and to
engage with the general audience.

The SIGMOD conference, established in 1975, has a dynamic and comprehensive
program for publication, education, and interaction, including research papers,
tutorials, panels, industrial papers, technical demonstrations, and
undergraduate research papers. The program includes publications relating to all
aspects of data management defined broadly and particularly encourages
publications on topics of emerging interest in the research and development
communities. The program also includes workshops that showcase dedicated
coverage due to their relevance to the current data management research and
development, industrial exhibits, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and
industry. All these activities provide a unique opportunity for students to
share their knowledge, experience, and research work with internationally
recognized researchers from academia and industry. In recent years, more than
800 attendees attended SIGMOD, and we expect similar numbers this year.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
