In this project, several questions in commutative algebra will be studied. They
are concrete statements about homological properties of rings and modules, but
have unexpected and intriguing connections to other areas of mathematics. One
part of the project proposes to investigate the vanishing behavior of Ext and
Tor functors over Noetherian rings. Better understanding of such behavior can be
used to attack a diverse set of problems such as Gabber 's conjecture about
Picard groups of punctured spectra of complete intersections, or the existence
of non-commutative resolution of singularities. Other topics include
classification of subcategories of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules, solving
equations in the semi-ring of vector bundles on algebraic varieties and
regularity of Stanley-Reisner ideals associated to simplicial complexes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commutative algebra deals with some of the most ubiquitous
objects in mathematics, such as sets of equations in several variables. It has
both natural and deep connections to fields such as algebraic and arithmetic
geometry, number theory, representation theory and combinatorics. Such
characteristics allow one to phrase many interesting questions at the front of
modern research in the form accessible to even early graduate students. Many
topics proposed in this project are about such connections, and their
investigation are especially suitable for training and collaboration between
young researchers.
