9617793 Zhou Decentralized trading raises three important questions. First, how
can mutual gains to trade among a large group of agents be realized when the
only direct meetings between agents are in small groups, e.g., pairs? In other
words, how can the lack of double coincidence of wants be overcome in a
decentralized trading environment? Second, how can uniform terms of trade be
established and maintained among these trading coalitions that only communicate
indirectly with one another, and can the uniformity be exact or only
approximate? Third, are there other non-uniform patterns of trade that could be
equilibria, and how do they compare to the uniform terms of trade in efficiency?
Kiyotaki and Wright initiated a research program that has made great progress in
addressing the first question. Their model makes simplifying assumptions that
trivialize the other two questions, though. This project analyzes a
generalization of their model that permits all three questions to be addressed
in an integrated framework.
