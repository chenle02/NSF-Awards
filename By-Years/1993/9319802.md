9319802 Nanni This project will investigate the feasibility of using several
different types of fibers to increase the ductility of the group acting as a
pretressing strands for use in concrete construction. The carbon fiber may also
be used as a monitor for permanent damage in the concrete. Fibers to be
considered are: carbon, aramid, and poly-vinyl-alchol, because they are stable
in the alkaline environment of the concrete. ***
