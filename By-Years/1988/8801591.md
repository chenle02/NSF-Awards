This is a continuation of studies in denotational semantics and its applications
to the design and implementation of programming languages. Areas of study
include semantics and type-checking for object-oriented programming systems and
the continued study of reflection and semantics-directed compiler generation.
The activities at work in OOP include a uniform reference principle,
information-hiding, inheritance, and distributed definition. Uniform reference
principle, refers to the use of field selection or message- passing as a generic
way of retrieving data from composite structures. Information-hiding, refers to
the typical way in which the internal structure of an object is protected from
the outside world: the "instance variables" of an object are manipulable only
through the interface of the "methods". Inheritance refers to the manner in
which new classes of objects are created as incremental variations of old ones.
Distributed definition refers to the syntactic structure of class definitions in
certain object systems, in which the definitions of the methods may be textually
distributed through a program or systems.
