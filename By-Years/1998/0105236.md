A fundamental goal of the GLOBEC program is to understand the secondary
production of the coastal Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and how the success of higher
trophic levels, specifically salmon, are affected by the variability in the
magnitude of secondary production seasonally, inter-annually, and at the decadal
scale. Because of the highly advective nature of the GOA, it is necessary to
establish the relative importance of local versus imported production. The PIs
will determine the rates of development, growth and egg production for the
dominant copepod and euphausiid species in the coastal GOA. They will determine
the in situ rates inshore and offshore by incubation techniques employing
artificial cohorts (copepods) and individual females (both copepods and
euphausiids). Incubation techniques are the only appropriate methods for this
region due to its highly advective nature. The proposed research will put the in
situ rates in perspective by determining their maximal rates under food-
saturated conditions in the laboratory. The investigators also will estimate the
extent to which secondary production is food-limited in the field by determining
the functional relationships of development, growth and egg production to body
size, temperature and food regimes. Food regimes will be assessed in terms of
chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon, plus the abundance and biomass of
autotrophic and heterotrophic protists. In collaboration with other researchers
in the GLOBEC program, the implications of physical versus biological processes
on the success of salmon recruitment will be established and
predicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
