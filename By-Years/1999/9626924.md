This project will analyze the water and carbon dioxide in basalt glasses from
four areas chosen to represent different mantle magma sources. Heavy isotopes
and He-3 distinguish deep (primary) and shallow (recycled) mantle-plume
reservoirs. Characterization of the volatiles will contribute to understanding
physical properties and fractionation of the melts, as well as the degree of
crustal contamination resulting from recycling of subduction-zone material.
