9415328 Washabaugh This SGER type award is to construct a protype transducer
employing finite length optic measurement paths. The performance of this
transducer will be evaluated for its sensitivity in torsion and its cross-
sensitivity to other types of loading. Errors related to manufacturing and
locating the transducer will also be examined. ***
