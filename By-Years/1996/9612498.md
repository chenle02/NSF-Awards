This project will partially support the research visits of U.S. scholars in the
mathematical sciences to the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques (IHES) in
Bures-sur-Yvette, France. This international institute is comparable to the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey and, in addition to
support from the National Science Foundation, is supported in part by science
agencies in a number of other countries. Areas of research at the IHES include
algebraic geometry, number theory, combinatorics, group representations,
harmonic analysis, convex sets and analysis, geometry, and topology,
differential geometry, dynamical systems, and ergodic theory.
