Halobacterium sp. is a halophilic (salt loving) organism that thrives in
naturally occurring environments of high salinity (>10 times the salinity of sea
water) such as the Great Salt Lake, the Dead Sea and solar salterns. This QSB
(Quantitative Systems Biotechnology) project is designed to evaluate the effects
of DNA damaging stress on Halobacterium sp. resulting from ultraviolet
radiation, gamma radiation, oxidative damage and chemical mutagenesis using a
systems approach. In a systems approach, the effects of genetic and/or
environmental perturbations are measured at a molecular level and on a genome-
wide scale. The resulting large data sets and diverse data types are analyzed
simultaneously to formulate descriptive and/or mathematical models to describe
the behavior of the whole organism. This will ultimately lead to engineering of
complex biological processes for important and safe biotechnological
applications.

Broader impact: This collaboration brings together two leading laboratories with
different perspectives regarding investigation of the same problem -DNA repair.
These studies will result in training of one graduate student at UMD and one
postdoctoral fellow at the ISB. Whereas UMD will benefit from global
perspectives, new technologies and software developed in the Baliga laboratory,
in return ISB will benefit from the DiRuggiero laboratory expertise in study of
DNA repair mechanisms. Furthermore, all software developed at the ISB is open
source and data from all projects is freely available on the ISB website as well
as through other public databases. This study will also complement an ongoing
education effort at ISB since the Baliga laboratory has recently joined an
outstanding educational outreach program in a complementary NSF-funded project
to bring new concepts of systems biology to high school classrooms.

This project is co-funded by the Molecular Biochemistry Program in the Division
of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Biotechnology Program in the
Bioengineering and Environmental Systems Division.
