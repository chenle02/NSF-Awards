9411515 HEINZ During the last two decades, extensive changes have taken place in
the legal services industry. In particular, the market for legal services has
changed significantly. U.S. Supreme Court decisions striking down limitations on
advertising and fee schedules unleashed new forms of competition and new
mechanisms for the delivery of legal services, including franchise law firms and
group legal service plans. Corporate law firms experienced dramatic growth,
internal bureaucratization, and intense competition as longstanding client
relationships gave way to a transactions- oriented market. During these same
decades, women entered the professions of the law in far greater numbers than
ever before, and the percentage of minorities among legal professionals also
increased substantially, though far less rapidly. These practitioners control
access to the legal system - in fact, they dispose of most of the cases.
Therefore, the social backgrounds from which they are recruited, the types of
work they do, the kinds of clients they represent, the professional and
community roles they occupy, and the social and political values they hold are
related fundamentally to the character of justice in American society. This
study will be based on interviews with the full range of legal professionals,
including prosecutors, judges, and inside corporate counsel, as well as private
practitioners. Data exist from a similar survey conducted in Chicago in 1974-75,
which will provide a basis for comparison and analysis of the extent of changes
over the past twenty years. Personal interviews will now be conducted in Chicago
with a random sample of about 800 respondents. The analyses will assess changes
in the nature of the work, work settings, career histories, professional
commitment, client relationships, professional networks, and personal background
characteristics. Special attention will be given to the changing roles of women
and minorities in the legal services industry. ***
