Abstract

PI: Babak A. Parviz, Electrical Engineering Department, University of
Washington

The objective of this proposal is to design, build, and test a fundamentally new
interface with the human body for monitoring health. The approach is to
construct a functional contact lens that incorporates electronic biosensors and
continuously monitors biomarker levels on the surface of the eye. These
biomarkers include the glucose, lactate, and bacterial biofilm. The contact lens
is equipped with an antenna to harvest energy, incorporates circuitry to control
and read-out the sensors, and integrates a telecommunication module to convey
the collected information to the outside world.

The construction of such a system constitutes a revolutionary step forward in
creating non-invasive intelligent interfaces with the human body. It allows for
collection of previously inaccessible and potentially crucially important
biomedical data. The construction of the lens pushes forward the state-of-the-
art in engineering in multiple fronts from nano-scale electronic molecular
detectors, to microsystem integration, extreme miniaturization of
telecommunication systems, energy harvesting, and biomaterials engineering.

The data produced by the lens is applicable in the management of chronic
conditions such as diabetes (glucose detection), management of acute conditions
such a heart attack (lactate detection), and prevention of blindness due to
bacterial infection (biofilm detection). The project provides a ground for
training multi-disciplinary researchers at the interface between engineering and
medicine and is used to recruit students from under-served groups into science
and engineering. A contact lens camp outlined in the proposal provides middle
school students with hands-on laboratory experience and demonstrates the
immediate application of research in improving the quality of life.
