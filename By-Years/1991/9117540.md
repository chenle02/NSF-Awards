The utilization of tritium as a hydrological tracer and as an isotopic age-
constraint is becoming increasingly more difficult as tritium concentrations
decrease in global precipitation. The proposed study can make an original
contribution to the science of hydrology by determining if and how low
concentrations of environmental tritium (0-35 tritium units) can be utilized to
better understand the hydrochemical systematics of runoff generation. The
proposed study will be conducted within the 190 km2 Falling Creek basin in the
Piedmont Province of Georgia. This study will acquire and interpret major ion,
stable oxygen isotope, and tritium data derived from precipitation, surface
water (under a wide range of flow conditions), the vadose zone and the saturated
zone within the Piedmont regolith. The results of this study will lead to a
better understanding of (1) the rates and mechanisms of natural water movement
and chemical processes within watersheds and (2) how future regional
hydrological investigations may continue to utilize tritium.
