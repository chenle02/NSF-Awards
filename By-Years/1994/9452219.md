The objective of this project is to enhance the laboratory experience in
introductory astronomy for non-science majors by providing a set of new
activities in each of the two courses offered based on currently available
computer simulations. This project will improve the quality of undergraduate
education in science by replacing relatively passive learning techniques with
more active ones. Students will be involved in a laboratory environment which is
more dynamic, less intimidating, and which allows the individual exploration
which can capture the imagination and lead to the excitement of scientific
discovery. They will take from these courses a greater understanding of science
and a greater appreciation of its importance in their lives.
