9413533 Shankar This award will provide an IC tester for VLSI circuits and
Integrated IC Systems. This tester will be part of a new Center for VLSI and
Systems Integration (CVIS). The tester will be used in the following research
projects associated with CVIS: (1) Integration of test into hierarchical
structured design methodology; (2) Mixed signal testing and eventual integration
into a seamless environment; (3) Characterization of low voltage analog and
digital designs; (4) VLSI for parallel optical character recognition; (5)
Testing of MEMS; and (6) Testing of MCM packages. ***
