Description: This project provides support for collaboration between Drs. A.V.
Krishna Murty and Vijay Kumar of the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the
Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, India, and Dr. J.N. Reddy of the
Department of Engineering Mechanics at the Virginia Institute of Technology and
State University in Blacksburg. These scientists plan to continue theoretical,
analytical studies on the behavior of laminated composite panels under
compressive loads. Specifically, they are seeking to develop analytical tools to
describe the process of delamination in such panels. These studies will be also
useful in determining residual strength of these plates. The collaborative work
will benefit from experimental work being done independently by the Indian team
at the I.I.Sc. Scope: This project provides support to extend collaborative
research currently being carried out by the same scientists under an earlier NSF
grant. The work has already provided better understanding of the problem, and
resulted in several joint publications. The project fits well with the
objectives of the U.S.-India Cooperative Science Program.
