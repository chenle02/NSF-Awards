This award supports postdoctoral work on mathematical questions in the theory
of harmonic analysis of weighted spaces. The theory of Ap and RHp weight has
been developed in great detail, but the dependence of certain estimates on the
norm of such weights has not been adequately studied. This work will focus on
this dependence for two specific questions, one relating to operator norms, and
the other relating to the Jones factorization theorem. Work will also be done
analyzing weight conditions which are weaker than RHp and also less well
understood. In particular, efforts will be made to find analogs for WRHp weights
of results involving RHp weights. Further studies of Muckenhoupt's class Cp
weight will also be taken up as time permits. The theory of weighted spaces was
developed to understand complex integral transforms induced by differential
operators. Understanding how weighted integrals compare gives information on how
the integrals preserve metrics or norms. This data, in turn, illustrates the
extent to which existence of solutions of the differential equations can be
guaranteed.
