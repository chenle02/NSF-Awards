This renewal will support an additional year of study of the geophysical data
collected during three field programs in 1988. These field programs have
produced rich data sets about crustal accretionary processes along the
intermediate-spreading Southeast Indian Ridge and the slow-spreading Mid-
Atlantic Ridge. The renewal will support further analysis of the volcano-
tectonic characteristics of these spreading centers as well as for further
processing of the magnetic and gravity data sets.
