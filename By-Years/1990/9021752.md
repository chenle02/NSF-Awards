This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Wichita State University for the
repair and renovation of the Wichita State Aerodynamic Laboratory which houses
research and research training activities in aerospace engineering. This
building was constructed in 1949 and last renovated in 1982. The ARFMP grant of
$116,000 and $116,643 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to
modernize these research and research training facilities. This project will
address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by refurbishing
the wind tunnel structure including water proofing the wind tunnel tube,
replacing its balance system, and modernizing its data processing system. This
award contributes to the infrastructure of science and engineering by providing
an improved environment for the conduct of research, for developing strong
linkages to state and regional industry, and for the training of entry-level
engineers from several major aerospace companies in the area as well as for the
training of quality undergraduate and graduate students. Students trained in the
Wichita State Aerodynamic Laboratory, with its nationally pre-eminent program in
experimental aerodynamics, are in demand in both basic and applied research
fields.
