A joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Workshop on Algebraic Groups and Related Number Theory,
organized by Armand Borel of the Institute of Advanced Study (Princeton, New
Jersey) and V.P. Platonov of the Institute of Mathematics, Byelorussian Academy
of Sciences (Minsk, U.S.S.R.), will take place in Minsk, May 20-27, 1991. The
meeting will bring together mathematicians from both countries who have made
leading contributions to some of the most promising aspects of algebraic group
theory for the purpose of fostering further progress through new long- range
cooperative research projects. The Soviet Union and the United States are among
the world leaders in this important branch of mathematics. This project fulfills
the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary
efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in
the field of basic scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity,
and mutuality of benefit.
