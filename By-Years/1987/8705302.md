This research will extend concepts and theory on three trophic level
interactions. The central theme is that the dynamics of modular plant parts, the
shoots, defines plant architecture, and in a predictable way, the dynamics of
herbivores and their enemies in space and time. Plant architecture of the arroyo
willow, Salix lasiolepis, defines resources for the herbivore, shoot-galling
sawfly Euura lasiolepis, because the metamere, or internode, is the resource
utilized, and those on the longest shoots have the highest probability of attack
by sawflies. In turn, metamere quality defines gall characters that influence
access to the herbivore by the third trophic level. Thus, studying the
population dynamics of plant modules is basic to understanding the dynamics of
this herbivore, and its interaction with enemies. This research addresses four
major questions: 1. how willow clones grow and display resources through space
and time; 2. how sawflies respond to these displays; 3. how sawflies influence
displays of resources; and 4. How resources influence the herbivore-enemy
interaction. These questions are approached by describing conditions in wild
clones and using field experiments with potted clones to understand better the
mechanistic dynamics of the system. Plant/animal interactions is a major area of
ecological research which provides the information base for biological control
strategies in agriculture.
