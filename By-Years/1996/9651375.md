The purpose of this project is to change the teaching and learning of physics
through the utilization of microcomputers and Calculator-Based Laboratory units
as data acquisition, storage, and analysis tools. The acquisition of this
technology supports the introduction of Workshop Physics, Tools for Scientific
Thinking, Real-Time Physics, and Conceptual Exercises: Overview Case Studies
curricular materials and the transformation of instruction from a lecture-
oriented delivery system to one that is more collaborative, constructivist, and
laboratory oriented. This new technology-rich learning environment also
encourages the mastery of new measurement and analysis skills and better
prepares the college's physics students for the learning and work environments
in which they will eventually find themselves.
