This research project uses combinatorial structures and methods to solve
problems in two areas: the representation theory of Lie algebras and Schubert
calculus. In representation theory, the investigator will continue his work on
deriving explicit tableau formulas in classical Lie types from the Ram-Yip
formula for Macdonald polynomials and the Yip formula for their product; these
formulas are in terms of the alcove walk model, which was introduced by
Gaussent-Littelmann and the investigator in collaboration with A. Postnikov, and
was then developed by other mathematicians. One of the applications is an
efficient computation of the energy function, which defines the affine grading
on a tensor product of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals. This application is based
on an interesting connection between Macdonald polynomials, quantum cohomology,
and affine crystals. In order to better understand it, the investigator proposes
a crystal-theoretic counterpart (based on the alcove model) of the
"quantum=affine" phenomenon relating the quantum cohomology of flag varieties
and the homology of the affine Grassmannian. Other projects in representation
theory involve explicit constructions of certain representations, as well as the
topology of crystals (as posets) and of a poset which encodes the structure of
Mirkovic-Vilonen cycles. In Schubert calculus, the investigator has projects
related to the cohomology, quantum cohomology, and quantum K-theory of
generalized flag varieties. Most of these projects involve new approaches to
positive combinatorial formulas for the Schubert structure constants, which
express the product of Schubert classes in the basis of Schubert classes.

A unifying theme of this project is the emphasis on combinatorics and
computation. During the last decades, computation has gained an important role
in mathematical research. This stimulated the development of combinatorics, as
it became clear that combinatorial structures are particularly well suited for
encoding complex mathematical objects, while combinatorial methods are well
suited for related computations. The investigator will use combinatorial
techniques in representation theory (which is a fundamental tool for studying
group symmetry, and which has important applications in mathematics and beyond,
e.g., to theoretical physics), and in Schubert calculus (which has its origins
in enumerative geometry, e.g., counting the lines or planes satisfying a number
of generic intersection conditions). Certain representations and the related
algebraic varieties are modeled by graphs or partially ordered sets. By studying
the structure of these discrete objects, which displays remarkable complexity,
the investigator will be able to derive important algebraic and geometric
information.
