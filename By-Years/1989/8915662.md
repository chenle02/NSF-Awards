This project provides funds for the partial support of an International
Symposium on Fracture and Damage of Concrete Structures and Size Effect to be
held at Northwestern University. There are a number of groups who are revising
design codes by considering the use of fracture mechanics to evaluate concrete
failure. Therefore this is an appropriate time to hold such a meeting.
