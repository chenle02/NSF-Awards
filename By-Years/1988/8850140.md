The primary objective of this project is to offer a four-week hands-on science
program at Southwest Texas State University for 24 high- potential eighth-grade
students from Texas rural schools with minimal science opportunities.
Participants will develope both analytical and communicative skills necessary
for success in college science programs. This objective will be accomplished in
a peer/mentor residential setting, through interactions with prominent
scientists, field experiences at major urban research centers and guided
scientific experiments with state-of-the-art scientific instruments. A
collection of the participants' final experiments, performed during school year
follow-up activities will be published. Students also will present their
experiments at state-wide science fairs and conferences in collaboration with
their school science teachers.
