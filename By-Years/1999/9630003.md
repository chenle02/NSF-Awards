This award from the Chemical Research Istrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Rochester
acquire a mass spectrometer (MS). This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including the following: (1) supramolecular chemistry,
specifically the formation of ensembles of organic molecules such as aromatics
and dyes, and (2) electron transfer photoreactions . Mass spectrometry (MS) is a
technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular
compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic
molecules. The technique of MS affords the chemist one of the most powerful
tools available for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this
capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier
research in many fields of chemistry.
