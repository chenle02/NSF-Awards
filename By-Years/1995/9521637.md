Braun, Douglas 95-21637 Dr. Braun will study Sunspot Seismology, the only known
way to explore subsurface magnetic fields of the sun. He will determine the way
that acoustic (p-mode) waves, trapped in the solar interior, interact with
sunspots. He will use GONG data to determine the complete p-mode scattering
properties of a wide variety of solar active regions. The goal is to identify
signatures of the subsurface presence and evolution of magnetic regions in the
p-mode scattering amplitudes and incorporate these into the scattering models
currently available. Thus the GONG data will be used to infer the physical
considerations within and beneath the surface active regions and possibly find
p-mode scattering signatures that may be used to predict such things as the
emergence of magnetic fields.
