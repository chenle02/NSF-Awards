This project will continue development of a real-time confocal scanning optical
microcope. The theory of imaging and of the microscope itself will be extended
from its present relatively elementary form. New types of contrast mechanisms
will be investigated, such as the incorporation of dark field imaging,
polarization imaging, phase contrast imaging, and fluorescence imaging in the
real-time confocal optical microscope. New types of microscopes will also be
investigated. One is the scanning correlation microscope, which uses correlation
between a reference signal and the reflected signal from an object. This
microscope offers the possible advantages of eliminating aberrations in the
lenses and obtaining still better definitions than the scanning optical confocal
microscope. Another is a new type of near-field microscope, the plasmon
resonance near-field microscope. The use of plasmon resonance in this microscope
should give greatly enhanced sensitivity and better control of the position of
the probe from the object.
