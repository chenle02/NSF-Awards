A large number of facilities are becoming available for observations in the
submillimeter wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Several new
highly accurate telescopes have begun operating at dry, high altitude sites. Dr.
Sutton has constructed a receiver, for work at submillimeter wavelengths, which
is one of the best available. The confluence of this technological advance in
receiver design with the proliferation of telescopes promises exciting
astronomical accomplishments over the next few years. This grant will support
Dr. Sutton's astronomical research using the receiver he built for operation at
frequencies around 345 GHz. The instrumentation will be further improved and
used to address a variety of astronomical problems, particularly in the areas of
galactic structure, interstellar chemistry, and regions of star formation. At
least initially, the receiver will be operated on the 10.4 meter diameter
telescope of the California Institute of Technology Submillimeter Observatory
located on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.
