This project will utilize a facility called Plasma Krystal-4 (PK-4) on the
International Space Station to conduct experiments in microgravity investigating
the underlying physics of large amplitude waves. Waves are moving oscillations,
which can propagate in many substances. In some substances waves are easily
visible, in some they are easily manipulated, and in some the waves attain a
large displacement so that they take on a different character called
nonlinearity. Attaining all three of these characteristics at the same time is
possible in a substance called a dusty plasma, which is a mixture of highly
charged micron-size solid particles immersed in a partially ionized gas
consisting of electrons, ions, and neutral molecules. In this project, large
amplitude waves will be observed using video microscopy and manipulated using an
experimental instrument on the International Space Station. An undergraduate
student will carry out the analysis. The topic has an overlap with other fields
of research including nonlinear dynamics as well as other plasma physics areas
outside of dusty plasmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data to be analyzed are
mainly from the PK-4 instrument, which is a European-Russian apparatus now on
the International Space Station. Data returned to Earth are distributed to
scientists at other locations including The University of Iowa. A scientific
video camera images a cross-section of a cloud of polymer microspheres, which
are electrically charged due to their immersion in a weakly ionized plasma. This
so-called dust cloud sustains waves such as dust acoustic wave and ionization
striations; these waves grow naturally, by an instability, to attain nonlinear
amplitudes. The use of data from PK-4 is valuable because under microgravitiy
conditions, the dust cloud fills a three-dimensional volume of greater size than
is possible in laboratory experiments on Earth. To support this effort the
investigators will collaborate with theorists in describing the nonlinear
motion. This award to support an undergraduate student is made under a "NASA/NSF
Partnership on Science of Dusty Plasmas: Utilizing the PK-4 Facility on board
the International Space Station" and is complementary to a NASA award made under
the joint program.
