The researcher is concerned that the number of women who participate in Science,
Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology (STEM) education is lower than that of
young men. This study seeks to understand better how young African American
women, who appear to be interested and engaged in science during high school
years, remain underrepresented in STEM courses in college. The project creates
new data collection technologies to find unique gender subcultures of African
American communities that contribute to their decision-making. It is
hypothesized that factors that discourage young women involve interactions at
the university that reflect gender and race bias.

The study will first analyze a national data set (NELS) to obtain national
estimates of rates of transition of women and men in the science pipeline. Then
it will create a method to assess the perceptions of science experiences and
factors involving interactions with other people that encourage, or discourage,
women to enter science professions. She would develop measures of perceptions of
science experiences that might help explain why trends in attitudes toward
science observed with NELS data were found.
