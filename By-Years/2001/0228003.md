This project addresses the chemical composition of emissions from biomass
burning. Biomass burning is a major source of trace gases and particles. In
particular, the following questions will be addressed: 1. What are the major
reactive and stable initial emissions from tropical deforestation fires, biofuel
use, and agricultural waste burning? 2. Smoke plumes are both an unusual
environment and a globally significant source of reactive gases. What is the
rate of the photochemistry in smoke plumes from tropical deforestation fires? 3.
What are the effects of cloud processing on gases and particles in Brazilian
smoke?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic
techniques will be used to measure nearly all the major reactive and stable
trace gases in biomass burning smoke. Airborne FTIR will be installed on a
Brazilian research aircraft along with instruments that measure particle
emission factors, size distribution, absorption, and scattering, as well as gas
phase composition, including volatile organic compounds, and hydroxyl radicals.
Comprehensive airborne measurements of the emission factors for savanna fires,
tropical deforestation fires, and pasture maintenance fires will be made in
Brazil for several weeks during the 2003/4 burning season.
