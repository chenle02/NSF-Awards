The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Guy A. Thompson of the University of Texas, Austin, and Dr. Laszlo Vigh of
the Biological Research Center in Szeged, Hungary, is to study the biochemical
regulation of membrane fluidity. By using homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts to
change membrane lipid composition, the researchers hope to determine and analyze
the effect desaturation has on membrane permeability and capacity for signal
transduction. Results should contribute to our basic understanding of both plant
and animal cell physiology, particularly the mechanism for chilling resistance
and high temperature stress response. This project in biochemistry fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
