The development of large batholiths associated with subduction tectonics is of
considerable interest in crustal genesis. Prior work in the Sierra Nevada has
indicated that the present erosion surface cuts obliquely through a 30 kilometer
depth section, thus offering an opportunity to develop a model of both shallow
and deep portions of the same batholith-dominated crust. The work involves
structural, petrographic and geochronological studies aimed at understanding the
development of the batholith as of approximately 100 million years ago. Results
will refine understanding of subduction-related plutonism in California, which
should also apply to general models of batholith development.
