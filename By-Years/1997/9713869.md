This project is working with selected Advanced Technological Education (ATE)
programs to identify characteristics of strong mathematical components and
chronicle the process of developing such components through a series of case
studies which is being made available in print and on the Internet. This
information is being used by current and future ATE project directors to develop
a more sophisticated understanding of the kinds of mathematical skills students
preparing for technological careers are expected to have and a more realistic
view of what ATE programs should accomplish in mathematics. Specific goals of
the project include: (a) creating a vision of high quality mathematics for
students in vocational and technological education programs consistent with high
academic standards developed by numerous organizations, and (b) developing and
publicizing a variety of effective strategies for creating challenging
mathematical tasks.
