This collaborative project combines theoretical and observational work to study
circumstellar disk winds, evolution and dispersal. They will analyze high
resolution optical and infrared spectra of 55 disks around stars that are at
different stages of evolution in order to constrain thermochemical and 2-D
hydrodynamical models of planet formation. Most of the necessary data are in
hand, and new observations are planned with large optical telescopes, such as
the Multiple-Mirror Telescope, Large Binocular Telescope and other
observatories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts training undergraduate and
graduate students in research and professional development of science and math
teachers. The research team will also make presentations to the public,
including on an episode of the SETI Institute radio show Big Picture Science.
