This project is measuring noise levels on the borehole seismometers and
strainmeters installed as part of the Plate Boundary Observatory component of
EarthScope. These measurements establish at what times the data represent
background noise, and at what other times anomalous signals are happening. These
anomalous signals include both small earthquakes, and other signals such as
episodic tremor, which has only recently been observed, and which can be
difficult to distinguish from noise. Better measurements of these signals are
important in understanding the behavior of the fault zones around which these
instruments have been installed.
