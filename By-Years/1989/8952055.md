A Scanning electron microscope will be purchased to improve undergraduate
instruction and research and give students better insight into
structure/function relationships. The acquisition of a S.E.M. will facilitate
ongoing curricular improvements at the college and provide opportunities not
currently available. The S.E.M. will be used in 1. two new advanced
undergraduate courses that integrate theoretical and practical training, 2.
enhancing currently existing courses and 3. undergraduate research. The Hitachi
S-2300-2 S.E.M. and support equipment will provide a "user friendly" system
which is ideal in undergraduate instruction. The university will provide 50%
matching funds.
