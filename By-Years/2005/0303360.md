This project is about the study of representations and algorithms for the
computational modeling of human movements. The ultimate goal is to devise a
general representation of human motion structure that potentially covers a wide
range of domains: from subtle lip motions during speaking and facial
expressions, to complex hand and full-body gestures. Possible applications
include improved visual tracking algorithms, gesture classification tasks, face
and body animation tasks, and new tools for bio-medical studies. Corner-stones
will be the use of large example motion databases and appropriate statistical
estimation algorithms. In this proposal, we specifically focus on techniques
that can acquire kinematic models from video sequences. These models and
measurements will be a building block for further studies on dynamics and
higher-level human activity representations and will aid motion studies for
research in bio-mechanical and medical projects.
