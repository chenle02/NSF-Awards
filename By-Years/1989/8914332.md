This dissertation research project will try to explain why some Yupik Eskimo
communities retain Yupik as their primary language while other villages undergo
language shift to English. A PhD student in anthropological linguistics from the
University of California-Berkeley will conduct ethnographic research, including
collecting qualitative and quantitative data on language use in two villages,
one speaking Yupik and the other English. Methods used will include ethnographic
participant observation, a census of language use, analysis of social networks,
video-taping of language behavior and sociolinguistic interactions, and
conversation-and rhetorical analysis. This research is important because most of
the world's 9,000 languages exist as minority languages within multilingual
nation- states. Understanding of the general causal principles which influence
language retention and change will help planners achieve policy goals of
preserving cultural diversity while maximizing socio-political integration.
