This award will enable an international collaboration for software development
in computational chemistry between researchers in the United States and the
United Kingdom. This international collaboration arose from a joint NSF/EPSRC
workshop on Software Development for Grand Challenges in the Chemical Sciences
held in Oxford, United Kingdom in June 2011. This award will provide travel for
project team members to attend plenary and planning meetings, and for exchange
visits to catalyze initial subprojects. The project will lead to the develop of
new software capabilities for the study of protein systems across multiple
resolutions. The collaboration will include the sharing of large datasets and
the development of computational infrastructure for controlling simulations.
Outcomes of this award will include software for computational chemistry and
improved international collaboration in support of sustainable software for
science and engineering. Interdisciplinary training of young researchers is an
important consideration for this work.
