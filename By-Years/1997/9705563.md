In this RUI project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of
the Chemistry Division, Dwyer of SUNY Brockport and Doetschman of SUNY
Binghamton will use pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques to
examine electron- and proton-transfer reactions in zeolites. Differences between
reaction in the solvent and in the zeolite microreactor will be explained in
terms of reagent-environment interactions. In this project molecular
interactions with solid-state cage cations and Lewis acid sites will be examined
to determine their effect on the nature and temperature dependence of molecular
motion. Experimental work will be performed using the regional pulsed EPR and
photochemistry facility at SUNY Binghamton. Zeolites are inorganic materials
with unique internal structures which can act as reaction solvent cages, or
microreactors for short. These materials have industrial as well as academic
application as hosts for novel light-induced reactions. In this project
undergraduate students from Brockport will be able to study these sorts of
reactions using state-of-the-art equipment in Binghamton that is not normally
available at undergraduate institutions.
