Dr. Hirsch is a leading investigator in the area of the nitrogen-fixing
symbiosis between leguminous roots and the rhizobial bacteria which colonize
them. The problem being addressed is that of cell division factors produced by
the bacteria which elicit morphological changes in root hairs. This award is a
National Science Foundation Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers.
The proposal fulfills the FAW objectives, which are: 1, to recognize outstanding
and promising women scientists and engineers in academic careers of research and
teaching and 2, to facilitate the further development of their careers.
