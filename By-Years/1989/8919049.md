The objective of this research is to develop the chemistry and applications of
inorganic-backbone network polymers. The research will focus on devising a
method of functionalizing silicon and/or germanium network backbones to produce
polymers with a variety of electronic, surface, and optical properties. These
new inorganic polymers will be prepared using new synthetic methodology, and the
effect of variation of polymer side chains on the electronic and physical
properties of the inorganic backbone will be determined. Synthetic tailoring of
the polymer backbone's properties will thus be attempted. Evaluation of the new
polymers as photoresists, self=developing waveguide media, photopatternable
coatings, optically and electronically active layers, and precursors to ceramic
films will be carried out.
