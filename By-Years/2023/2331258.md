One of the goals of scientific research is to have an impact beyond the
laboratory; however, many university researchers do not have the knowledge,
support, or resources to translate their discoveries to the point of societal
and economic impact. This project seeks to address the challenges and barriers
faced by researchers in transforming their innovative ideas into solutions for
real-world problems. By designing action-oriented activities and providing
hands-on business training and support, the Accelerating Research Translation:
Technology, Entrepreneurship and Commercialization Hub (ART:TECH) project aims
to help researchers navigate the complex technical, ethical, and
commercialization landscape associated with innovation and entrepreneurship.
Researchers will learn how to utilize local, state, and national resources, as
well as partner effectively and efficiently with the local communities to
advance their research beyond the laboratory. The guiding principle of the
project is to bring together expertise and resources to establish and maintain a
culture of innovation built on diversity and respect where impactful discoveries
will result in direct benefits to society.

The vision of the project is to establish the foundations for a robust research
translation infrastructure that serves as the natural nexus point for use-
inspired research activities. ART:TECH addresses institutional barriers through
the creation of new training and support programs, scaling existing successful
programs, and establishing an ambassador network. The project is designed to
advance academic innovations, facilitate translation of benchtop research into
real-world impact, and achieve an institutional culture change by raising
awareness of the economic and societal benefits of translational research.
Creative activities will be implemented to build capacity to scale and
accelerate research translation while also training the next generation of
graduate and post-doctoral students in innovation and entrepreneurship. The goal
is to not only advance high impact, translational research but also promote
innovation, economic growth, and societal well-being.
