The Dauphin Island Sea Laboratory (DISL) is a coastal facility of the Marine
Environmental Science Consortium, comprising 21 colleges and universities in
Alabama. The Lab has a growing complement of resident scientists, and an
excellent record of hosting visiting researchers. Dr. John Pennock, a senior
scientist at DISL, requests support for purchase of a scintillation counter.
This piece of equipment analyzes the concentration of radioactive tracers,
allowing measurement of rates of movement and metabolism of organic matter in
ecological systems. The requested equipment will be made available to resident
and visiting scientific staff at DISL. This instrument will support a diverse
array of biological research projects, and will encourage future investigators
to use the growing facilities at DISL.
