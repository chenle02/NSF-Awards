This undulator beamline will be developed, instrumentated, and operated at the
Advanced Photon Source (APS) under the auspices of the Michigan/AT&amp;T
Collaborative Access Team (MATT-CAT). The APS represents a very significant step
forward for the future of materials research: for the first time it will be
possible to carry out time-resolved studies of materials under real dynamic
conditions. MATT-CAT is conceived as a center for real-time x-ray studies which
will operate as a joint university-industry initiative bringing together faculty
and students at the University of Michigan, and research staff at AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories, to focus on the kinetic behavior of materials. MATT-CAT's goal is
to establish a center of excellence devoted to the structural kinetics of
materials which will benefit from the interaction of physicists, chemists,
materials scientists and engineers. To accommodate this goal, two fully
instrumented beam lines will be developed, one will have an undulator source,
and the other a bending magnet. The undulator beam line is designed to achieve
high resolution and will consist of a back-reflection monochromator, situated in
the rear hutch, with the monochromated beam transported to a forward hutch.
Here, high-resolution analyzers and fast array detectors currently under
development will be available for time- resolved scattering studies. The
extremely high brightness, collimation, and stability of the undulator beam will
be exploited for new kinds of coherent spectroscopic measurements of non-
hydrodynamic modes in solids and complex fluids. This beam line will be
available to the MATT-CAT members 75-80% of the time, with the remaining time
allocated to general users. Technical staff will be employed in the construction
of the beam lines, the day-to-day operation and upkeep of the instruments, and
will assist users.
