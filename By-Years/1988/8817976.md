The methods of population genetics will be applied to two main levels of the
species. The investigators will concentrate on making models that can lead to
realistic predictions and explanations. One part of the work will compare the
fitness (survival and fertility) of individuals produced by inbreeding with the
fitness of those produced by outcrossing to unrelated individuals. Such
comparisons allow estimates of "inbreeding depression", the fitness deficit of
inbred progeny relative to the fitness of outbred progeny. Inbreeding depression
is very important in plant and animal breeding, and may also be important in
determining the evolution of breeding systems. The genetic causes of inbreeding
depression are not fully understood at present. So studying populations which
display both outcrossing and self-fertilization (as in most plant populations)
should help to distinguish between the different possible mechanisms. To do
this, the investigators will study a model in which many genetic loci affect
fitness because the loci are subject to mutations having deleterious effects on
fitness. The investigators will make predictions about the relationship of
inbreeding depression and level of self-fertilization. Then they will compare
these theoretical results with data from natural and domesticated plant
populations. Studies of how new species are formed will use models in which
population randomly shifts from one equilibrium state to another. Populations
founded by a small number of colonists will be used. The process may be
important in generating new species, and has been much discussed recently under
the name of "peak shifting". Few studies of genetic models of the process have
been carried out, but these studies must be done before it is known how likely
peak shift is.
