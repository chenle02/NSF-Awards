This goal of this proposal is to develop advanced techniques in weak lensing for
cosmology, in both data analysis and theoretical understanding. The work focuses
on mitigating several systematic uncertainties that affect dark energy
measurements to below the 1% level. The methods developed will be important for
interpreting the results of upcoming lensing surveys, such as the one planned
for NSF?s Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), the top ground-based priority
of the 2010 Decadal Survey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work
include training of a postdoc and a graduate student, and release of weak
lensing analysis software to the astronomical public. The PI will give lectures
at Alleghany Observatory and to minority middle-school students.
