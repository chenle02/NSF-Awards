The annual ACM Computer and Communications Security (CCS) conference is a
leading international forum for computer and communications security
researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas
and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. ACM CCS is the
flagship event of ACM Special Interest Group of Security, Audit and Control
(SIGSAC). Its acceptance rate is around 15-20%, which makes it a highly
selective conference.

This grant provides support for 30 students to attend ACM CCS and associated
workshops. Preference will be given to undergraduate students participating in
the poster session, and students with papers in the conference or workshop who
do not have other support. Participation by women and underrepresented groups
will also be encouraged.
