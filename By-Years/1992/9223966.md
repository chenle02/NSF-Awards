9223966 Russell This award is to start a new Materials Research Group (MRG) at
Princeton University on the topic of microstructured macromolecular soft
materials. The goal of the research is to understand, control, and exploit these
materials. The research addresses three major themes: (1) block copolymers where
the meso-scale morphology is determined by block lengths and thermodynamic
incompatibilities of the constituents, (2) polymer-particle dispersions where
the attachment of the block copolymer at an interface leads to ordering in the
colloidal phase, (3) study of the properties of complex structured fluids. These
three themes involve research on dynamics of ordering, effects of shear on
ordering, use of phase separated systems as templates for nano-lithography,
effects of block copolymer structure on adsorption and ordering, tailoring of
fluid rheology through control of microstructure. Microstructured soft materials
order on the length scale of ten to hundred nanometers, where structure
formation or self assembly occurs in the fluid state. Structure formation is
determined by the balance among structural entropy, steric energy, and
electrostatic forces. Examples of microstructured soft materials include motor
oils and lubricants, colloidal additives to plastics, thermoplastic elastomers,
paints and coatings, drilling fluids, nano-lithography for electronics, and
nonlinear optics. The research involves collaboration with Exxon Corporate
Research Laboratories. The institutional environment at Princeton University is
excellent for training advanced students for careers in research and teaching.
