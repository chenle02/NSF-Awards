This is a proposal to purchase six color computer workstation, a high speed
graphic server a color laser printer, peripherals for storage and video
graphics, and related software. Funds for a 50% computer services manager to
manage the system and provide training and graphics consultation will be
provided by the University. The facility would be available to all faculty and
students with either theoretical or experimental research programs involving
computational problems in biology. Use of the instrumentation will form a core
feature of graduate research training in computational biology across the
campus.
