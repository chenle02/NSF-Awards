This institution has a strong interdisciplinary undergraduate Cartography and
Map Technology Program that is nationally recognized. The objective of this
project is to obtain the necessary resources to pedagogically improve the
cartography program by implementing an integrative approach of study involving
several key cartography and geography courses. Students can benefit from this
approach by learning the discipline holistically in completing major mapping and
research projects that have a common theme. These IGIS projects would result
primarily from multicourse exercises that are more meaningful and sophisticated
in terms of method because they extend over a 2-year period. For this
integrative approach to properly executed in the cartography program, the
following equipment and software are being purchased: 15 Pentium PCs, 15
upgrades to l7` color monitors, and 2 additional Digital Video Plotter licenses.
Three key courses that require these resources to implement the integrative
approach are Remote Sensing, Photogrammetry, and a revised course to be named
Applied Digital Image and/or Photogrammetric Analysis. Project data generated
primarily by image processing and softcopy photogrammetry can be utilized by
these same students in ensuing cartography and geography courses. Because each
major project links various key courses to IGIS exercises, this integrative
approach enables students to gain insight into professional mapping practices
and sophisticated research designs that require lengthy periods of time to
complete.
