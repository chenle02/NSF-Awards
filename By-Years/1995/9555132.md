Algebraic algorithms discovered in the last three decades, coupled with
inexpensive high speed computation have created a minor revolution at the
research level in algebraic geometry. The new computational methods have found
wide application in a number of other fields (including robotics, computer
science, and CAD). These ideas are accessible to undergraduates and, in fact,
sometimes simpler to grasp than the material in the standard abstract algebra
course. This project is creating materials which introduce and explore these
methods. The materials can be used as the basis of a number of useful and
accessible first algebra courses for students of science, mathematics and
engineering.
