Reasoning tasks in spatial, temporal, and physical domains often involve
quantities at vastly different scales. A cross country trip of three thousand
miles begins by backing up the car six feet; the 150 foot Challenger rocket
exploded because of a 1/200 inch gap in the O-rings; the shining of the sun is
explained in terms of the interaction of nuclear particles. Automating such
reasoning raises issues of representations and inference techniques that do not
arise in reasoning at a fixed scale, particularly in cases where the level of
detail and the precision of information available varies widely across different
components of a single system. A number of different aspects of this problem are
under study, including calculi for order of magnitude reasoning; the use of
dimensional and structural hierarchies; and the composition of physical theories
of different granularity. The result of this research will be a body of tools
and techniques for reasoning across multiple scales that can be used in
automated physical reasoners over many different domains.
