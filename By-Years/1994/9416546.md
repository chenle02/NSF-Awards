9416546 Beroza This research is to model strong-motion data of the Northridge
earthquake in order to estimate the factors controlling earthquake rupture and
to understand the component of the strong ground motion attributable to the
earthquake source. A unique aspect of the near-source data for this earthquake
is that a number of high dynamic range digital accelerographs recorded the
initiation. Like the Loma Prieta and Landers earthquakes before it, the
Northridge earthquake began gradually before breaking out into a large event. A
goal is to understand how earthquakes nucleate. Preliminary work on this event
and many other earthquakes indicates that there may be a distinct nucleation
phase at the beginning of most earthquakes. This project is a contribution to
the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program and is supported by the
Northridge Earthquake Emergency Appropriation. ***
