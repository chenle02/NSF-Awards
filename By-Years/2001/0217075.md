0217075 Toole&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis of existing finestructure and
microstructure data will be conducted. The data, derived from two recent
investigations of ocean mixing processes: the Brazil Basin Tracer Release
Experiment and the study of Circulation in the Romanche Fracture Zone, consist
of vertical profile observations from the High-Resolution Profiler and moored
current meter measurements. Several signals in these data will be explored,
documented, and presented in the scientific literature that address (1) the
nature of the finescale shear and strain and the associated turbulent
dissipation in the abyssal ocean above rough bathymetry (at subtropical
latitudes and on the equator), (2) the flow within a mid-ocean ridge fracture,
(3) the intensity and spatial distribution of turbulent dissipation in a field
of equatorially trapped deep jets, and (4) the intensity of the mid-depth
internal wave field and associated mixing at tropical latitudes away from the
immediate vicinity of the equator. The projects are related by the common goal
of improving understanding of mixing and diapycnal transport in the deep
ocean.&lt;br/&gt;
