The investigator will study problems arising in the classification of foliated
manifolds (as represented by the homotopy type of foliation classifying spaces),
and how the analytic structures (the analytic K-theory and spectral theory)
associated to elliptic operators along the leaves of a foliation are related to
the algebraic topology of the ambient manifold. This project will study the role
of global topology in the spectral properties of foliation operators, especially
regarding: leafwise eta-invariants and odd analytic K-theory; Chern characters
and asymptotic methods for transverse operators; gap phenomenon for leafwise
Schrodinger operators based on generalizing Brillouin zone theory of solid state
physics via Fourier integral operator methods. Recent work of T. Tsuboi has
introduced a new method for the study of the algebraic topology of the Haefliger
classifying spaces of foliations. The investigator hopes to extend the approach
of Tsuboi to make a comprehensive study of how the cohomology of a classifying
space is related to the dynamics of the foliation groupoids that it classifies,
and to their transverse differentiability. He intends to continue his research
into the application of the transverse cyclic cohomology invariants of Anosov
foliations to providing rigidity phenomena for Riemannian manifolds with
negative sectional curvatures. The classical foliation problem is whether one
can comb the hair on a cocoanut (without whorls). Vast generalizations of this
have been conceived and elaborate algebraic and analytic machinery evolved for
treating them. Still the underlying ideas have a natural appeal to geometric
intuition which gives a special flavor to the entire subject and inclines one to
bear with its many technicalities.
