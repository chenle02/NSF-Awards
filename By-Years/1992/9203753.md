Schlumprecht will continue his study of the structure theory and local theory
of Banach spaces, and specifically, the distortion problem. Schlumprecht's
recent work in this area contributed significantly to the solutions of several
long standing problems, including the unconditional basis problem, the
hyperplane problem, and the prime Banach space problem, and additional results
in these and related areas will be pursued. Banach space theory is that part of
mathematics that attempts to generalize to infinitely many dimensions the
structure of 3-dimensional Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space. The axioms for the
distance function in a Banach space are more relaxed than those for Euclidean
distance (For example, the "parallelogram law" is not required to hold.), and as
a result, the "geometry" of a Banach space can be quite exotic. Much of the
research in this area concerns studying the structure theory of Banach spaces.
