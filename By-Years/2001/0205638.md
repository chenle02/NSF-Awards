Mobile systems primarily processing multimedia data are expected to
become&lt;br/&gt;a dominant computing platform for many application domains. The
design of&lt;br/&gt;such systems imposes several new challenges, as it must
consider demanding,&lt;br/&gt;dynamic, and multidimensional resource
requirements and constraints, with&lt;br/&gt;energy becoming a first-class
resource. At the same time, the ability of&lt;br/&gt;multimedia applications to
trade off output quality for system resources&lt;br/&gt;and the difference
between their peak and average demands offers a huge&lt;br/&gt;opportunity for
optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A promising approach to meet the challenges
of mobile multimedia systems,&lt;br/&gt;therefore, is to design all system
layers with an ability to adapt in&lt;br/&gt;response to system or application
changes. Further, to reap the full&lt;br/&gt;benefits of these adaptations, all
system layers must cooperate to reach a&lt;br/&gt;system-wide globally-optimal
configuration. This research seeks to develop&lt;br/&gt;and demonstrate an
integrated cross-layer adaptive system where hardware&lt;br/&gt;and all software
layers cooperatively adapt to changing system resources&lt;br/&gt;and
application demands, seeking to maximize user satisfaction
while&lt;br/&gt;meeting resource constraints of energy, time, and bandwidth.
This work is&lt;br/&gt;expected to have a large impact because it will expose
sources of&lt;br/&gt;substantial performance improvement not available before,
for a platform of&lt;br/&gt;increasing importance to many application
domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
