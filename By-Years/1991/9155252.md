This three year project, sponsored by Texas A&amp;M University, provides a four
week summer program each year for 32 psychology teachers to prepare them to
teach the advanced placement psychology course. The summer program will cover
all the major areas of psychology but emphasis will be given on those areas
known to receive insufficient coverage in the typical high school course. Topics
included will be cognition, neuropsychology, sensation and perception and
research methods. The summer program will generate a wide variety of materials
for conducting an honors psychology course emphasizing active learning exercises
which can be used to establish a laboratory component for the course. The
project will result in more courses offered at the high school level which
provide a more accurate understanding of the scientific method, particularly as
it applies to the science of psychology. This project is supported by matching
funds from the university which are equivalent to 28% of the NSF grant.
