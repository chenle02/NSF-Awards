This project is a collaborative effort of the University of Louisville, an urban
university with a liberal arts mission and the Kentucky State University,
designated as a Historically Black College/University, to develop a
concentration and certificate programs in information security. This project
develops the curriculum content, faculty development, and infrastructure
development in this area, including dedicated stand-alone Information Security
labs for providing hands on experience for the students that provide exposure to
dealing with network attacks. The collaboration enables the institutions to
recruit both urban and rural students from a diverse student population for a
rigorous academic program.
