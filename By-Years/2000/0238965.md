This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the
challenge of seamless interoperability among computer systems and user interface
components such as displays and keyboards. Such components today are tightly
coupled with the computer, which restricts the utility of both especially in
mobile systems, where users invariably have to choose between usable displays
and reasonable portability. The system being separates I/O devices from
computing devices enabling a different mode of use of computers where a user can
carry around much smaller computing devices and use shared larger I/O devices as
available.. The design and implementation of these enhancements will be guided
by feedback from users of prototypes deployed in the field.&lt;br/&gt; In the
long run, the widespread adoption of this approach has the potential to
revolutionize the way humans interact with computers, by allowing computing
devices to shrink out of sight, while freeing interfaces from the constraints of
portability. The technology has immediate commercial applications in health care
and mobile computing as well, these markets will be explored through future
strategic partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;
