Abstract ATM-9413291 Young, John A. University of Wisconsin Title: Convection
and Circulation Variability for TOGA-COARE: Synthesis of Satellite and IOP Data
This research aims at extending studies supported by an earlier NSF grant
"McIDAS Operations and Applications for TOGA COARE." The following two aspects
will be the focus. (1) Satellite Applications and Convection Regimes - In this
part the focus will be on the extensive surveys of convective systems observed
during TOGA COARE. Modes and scales of the convective events will be studied.
The explanation of these systems will be sought from satellite, rawinsonde,
radar and other forms of COARE data. (2) Convection and Divergence over Large-
Scale Array (LSA) This part deals with comparing space time scales of convective
regimes observed in satellite data with the corresponding GCM analysis and
forecasts to assess the quality of the GCM analysis and forecasting. This will
help in improving convective predictability. All the data that can be extracted
from satellite and COARE data sets will be utilized. This research is important
because it seeks to improve our understanding of tropical convection in the
context of seasonal to interannual climate variability.
