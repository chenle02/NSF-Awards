We will develop mathematical formalism for estimating fluctuations in parameters
in stochastic parametrizations due to changes in the large-scale forcing
(forcing applied to the large-scale structures). The forcing will be chosen to
mimic the global warming scenario. Therefore, the proposed research will
elucidate the validity of stochastic parametrizations estimated from the
present-day climate for other climatological conditions. We propose a novel
technique for estimating parameters in stochastic parametrizations of small-
scale processes from the data of the large (resolved) scales alone. In the
course of the proposed research we will develop rigorous mathematical foundation
for accurate estimation of parameters from the time-series of large scale.

Stochastic models (also known as stochastic parametrizations) play an important
role in Global Circulation Models of the atmosphere and ocean. In particular,
stochastic models represent small-scale physical processes which cannot be
sufficiently accurately resolved by modern numerical methods. Typically,
parameters in these stochastic models are estimated from the present-day
climate. The key question is how stochastic parametrizations will change in
response to global climate change. In particular, estimation of stochastic
models from time-series of large-scale structures can fail if the time-step of
observation is too small. This is due to the fundamental differences between the
trajectories of stochastic models and observed data. We will develop
mathematical techniques to overcome this problem.
