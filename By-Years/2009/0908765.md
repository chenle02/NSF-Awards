The project focuses on the relation between cluster algebras and the
representation theory of finite dimensional algebras.&lt;br/&gt;Finite
dimensional algebras are often described as path algebras of quivers with
relations. The modules of the algebra then correspond to the representations of
the quiver. Cluster algebras are commutative algebras with a special
combinatorial structure. The theory of cluster algebras is a fast developing
field which is related to many areas of mathematics. One of its most active
branches is its connection to the representation theory of finite dimensional
algebras which has been established in the PI's joint work with Caldero and
Chapoton and, independently, by Buan, Marsh, Reineke, Reiten and Todorov. Their
construction of certain triangulated categories, the cluster categories, has
provided unexpected new insights in tilting theory and has given rise to a whole
new class of finite dimensional algebras, the cluster-tilted
algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When cluster algebras were introduced
by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2002,&lt;br/&gt;their original motivation came from
representation theory, which is a&lt;br/&gt;branch of modern algebra that is
concerned with the study of&lt;br/&gt;symmetries of scientific models. Studying
the symmetries of a model is&lt;br/&gt;often more fruitful than studying the
model directly, and&lt;br/&gt;representation theory has found many applications
in physics and&lt;br/&gt;chemistry, as well as in other mathematical fields. The
cluster algebras &lt;br/&gt;provide a mathematical framework for fundamental
patterns which occur &lt;br/&gt;throughout representation theory. Surprisingly,
these patterns are also &lt;br/&gt;observed in various other branches of science
which, a priori, are not &lt;br/&gt;related to representation theory. This
motivates a further development of&lt;br/&gt;the theory of cluster algebras to
which this project will contribute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
