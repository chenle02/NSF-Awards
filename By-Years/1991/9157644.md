On-line intelligent systems (natural or artificial) must respond to real-time
constraints, synchronize themselves with their environments, and be capable of
adapting their behavior continuously to dynamic environments. Furthermore,
adaptive mechanisms must play a central role at manylevels if we are to utilize
large-scale and highly complex computing environments effectively. These
statements provide thebasis for this research. Self-adjusting data structures
are a simple example of how adaptive principles can be exploited within a
traditional computing framework. A more radical approach uses insights from
nonlinear dynamics to design systems in which many low-level interacting
adaptive units produce a global dynamics that computers some useful function.
This latter approach is refer to in this effort as "emergent computation."
Classifier systems and other computational ecologies provide evidence that such
systems are feasible. The immune system provides an excellent model of adaption
operating at the local level and of useful behavior (e.g. recognizing antigens)
emerging at the global level and will be used as the domain of analysis for this
work.
