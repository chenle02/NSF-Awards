This award will support a three-month visit by Dr. Selman to Kyoto University
where he will collaborate with Professors Zenichi Takehara of the Department of
Industrial Chemistry), and Yasuhiko Ito of the Department of Nuclear
Engineering. Their aim is to develop a nucleation model which can be applied to
refractory metal deposition. This is important because, whereas interest in
refractory coatings for commercial applications continues to increase,
particularly for high-temperature corrosion and wear resistance, attempts to
improve the process by which this may be attained (molten salt electrochemical
deposition) are doomed to failure without a better understanding of the
mechanism by which refractory coatings are started and the factor which control
how they stick to and grow on the base. Nucleation is an important aspect of
this process. The American and Japanese counterparts have previous experience in
this process which should make their joint efforts complementary and effective.
