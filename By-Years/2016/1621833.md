The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is three-fold. First, accurate motion tracking
is an open research problem, and the proposed approaches have the potential to
significantly advance state-of-the-art in localization and tracking and
facilitate new innovations. Second, there is the potential for significant
commercial impacts. The project aims to introduce a disruptive technology in
motion tracking to benefit a broad customer base. If successful, it can
accelerate development of companies whose products benefit from motion tracking.
Third, motion tracking has many applications and opens the door to new ways of
interacting with everyday devices, education, and health care, which has
profound societal impacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a cutting-edge novel motion tracking
system based on audio signals. It promises to turn a mobile phone into a
universal controller. By simply moving his or her hand holding a mobile phone, a
user can play interactive games, interact with VR/AR headsets, and remotely
control smart appliances. It offers four distinctive advantages: (i) high
tracking accuracy, (ii) low-cost and easy deployment as it does not require any
extra hardware and is a completely software-based solution, (iii) easy to use -
simply by hand movement, and (iv) will work under a wide range of scenarios. The
proposed technology can potentially revolutionize the gaming and VR/AR
industries, and enable new applications in tele-presence, education, and health
care.
