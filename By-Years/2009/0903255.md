This collaborative project between Old Dominion University, the University of
Louisiana at Lafayette, the Mid-Atlantic Maritime Academy, Marshall Community
and Technical College and South Louisiana Community College is modernizing
marine technology education in three major shipbuilding and maritime areas of
the country. The project is developing instructional modules in lean six sigma,
value stream engineering, green manufacturing and shipyard environmental
footprint. The instructional modules utilize active learning instructional
methodologies that have been documented to improve student learning. Fifteen
community college faculty and sixty secondary school teachers are being trained
in the use of these modules and subsequently integrating the modules into the
curriculum at their respective institutions. The project has strong
participation and support from major shipbuilding entities, including the
Virginia Ship Repair Association and the American Society of Naval Engineers,
who are providing input on the content and quality of the instructional modules.
The project includes job placement activities for students interested in careers
in shipbuilding. An independent evaluator is implementing formative and
summative evaluation plans throughout the life of the project.
