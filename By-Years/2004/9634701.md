DMI-9634701 Osswald In most polymer processes the quality of the final part
stems back in great part to the mixing of the polymer blends and the viscous
heating that occurs during the process. Both the material properties and the
formability of the component into shaped parts are highly influenced by the
quality of the mixing. Optimizing mixing processes is time consuming and
expensive. It is often necessary to build complex visualization equipment, i.e.
model extruders with transparent barrels, to qualify the mixing processes. This
research project will investigate a simulation program and to model the mixing
phenomena of polymer blends inside complex three dimensional mixing devices,
such as single and screw extruders. This project is a NSF GOALI project and will
be in partnership with 3M Process Development-Polymer Processing Laboratory. The
flow visualization experiments will be performed at the University of Wisconsin
and the twin screw extrusion experiments will be carried out at 3M. Results of
this research project could provide valuable findings in the optimization of
existing processing equipment and development of new engineering materials
through blending of existing polymers, fillers, and solutions.
