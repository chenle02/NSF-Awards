The main objective of this proposal is to purchase a MABA6 Mask Aligner with
Nano Imprinting Option by SUSS MicroTec Inc. The nanofabrication tool has both
nanoscale imprinting and submicron optical lithography capabilities.
Intellectual Merit: The requested nanoimprint lithography tool will be paired
with an existing high-resolution electron-beam lithography system within the
cleanroom facility of CREOL to create a low-cost nanofabrication capability.
Nine faculty members with expertise in various fields related to nanotechnology
will be able to conduct research in a wide range of interrelated topics
facilitated by the proposed tool. Specifically, research on (I) Nanolasers, (II)
Passive nanophotonic integrated circuits (reconfigurable silicon photonic delay
line chips, photonic crystal chips and chip-scale ultrafast photonics), (III)
Nanoplasmonics (nanoaperture structures and devices, plasmonic metamaterials,
graphene nanodevices, threshold-less nanolasers), and (IV) Advanced Solar Cells
(light-trapping-based and plasmonic-enhanced types) will be facilitated using
the proposed equipment. Broader Impacts: Acquisition of the new tool is
transformational because it is expected to bring low-cost nanofabrication
capabilities to those researchers and entities that may not otherwise be able to
afford the electron-beam lithography fabrication costs. The tool will enhance
the unique multi/inter-disciplinary research and education at the involved
academic units. The new tool is expected to be heavily used by graduate student
researchers and programs to integrate undergraduate and underrepresented
minority students in the usage of the tool are proposed.
