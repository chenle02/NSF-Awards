This project is planning the creation of a Performance Education and Research
Laboratory (PEARL) in the Computer Science Department of New Jersey City
University (NJCU), a federally-designated Predominantly Minority and Hispanic
Serving Institution. The project promotes undergraduate research participations
in order to expand the number of minority students attracted to and retained in
Computer Science. Research partnerships are being established between NJCU,
Brookhaven National Laboratory, and New Jersey Nanotechnology in Bell Labs.
Joint research teams are being formed with NJCU faculty, undergraduate student
researchers, and scientists from national labs. The goals are to expand research
experiences for undergraduate minorities and to enhance the faculty research
environment. A proposal for a five-year continuing grant is being developed. The
project has the potential to become a model for development of programs for
minority success at similar urban universities.
