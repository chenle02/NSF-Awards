This project is developing technology for the rapid de novo fabrication of
large DNA molecules up to and including entire genomes directly from a computer.
Presently the field of genetic engineering is limited to the de novo engineering
of single genes. This project seeks to enable the engineering and fabrication of
vastly more complex systems including complete biochemical pathways and genetic
networks. It is anticipated that the capabilities developed by this project will
be enabling for new disciplines such as genetic circuit and transcriptional-
translational logic engineering. Those attempting to model large genetic
networks would be able to physically construct and test these networks.

Ultimately the ability to engineer genetic networks and biochemical pathways has
extremely broad promise. Several early applications of great interest include 1)
Detoxification of various types of both chemical and biological waste; and 2)
Production of useful chemicals, such as plastics, pharmaceuticals, and hydrogen
gas for fuel cells.
