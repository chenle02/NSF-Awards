This project will examine the dynamics of mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) dispersal
within specific macaque populations; estimate levels of mtDNA diversity within
and among populations of macaque species that have mainland and island
distributions; and, test the hypothesis of rate constancy by examining levels of
divergence among macaque populations. Molecular study of macaques is important
because of several similarities with humans. (1) Macaques are thought to have
radiated at about the same time as the emergence of the genus Homo. (2) Their
spread in Southeast Asia parallels the expansion of hominids into the same part
of the world. (3) Macaques and humans share many demographic attributes relevant
to genetic change. For these reasons, demonstration of a relationship between
the zoogeography of the macaques and the rate of molecular change implies that
key events in our own past history can be similarly dated.
