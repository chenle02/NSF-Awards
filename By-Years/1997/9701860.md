This CAREER Award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports the research and education plans of David S. Glueck of
Dartmouth College. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the
formation of phosphorous-carbon (P-C) bonds to develop metal-catalyzed syntheses
of chiral phosphines and to design phosphine ligands resistant to P-C bond
cleavage. Mechanistic studies of reductive elimination and oxidative addition
reactions with organophosphorous species will guide chiral catalyst development
and test the hypothesis that arylphosphines with electron-donating substitutents
will resist degradation. A new course will be developed to improve the
scientific literacy of liberal arts students by taking an interdisciplinary look
at a few top industrial chemicals. The industrial chemistry, economics, and
environmental impacts of these chemicals will be explored.
