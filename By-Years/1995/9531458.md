INT 9531458 Gerber This U.S.-Czech research project between R. Benny Gerber of
the University of California, Irvine, and Pavel Jungwirth of the Heyrovsky
Institute of Physical Chemistry, Prague, will examine the chemical dynamics of
many-body systems for the purpose of characterizing systems such as those in van
der Walls and hydrogen bonded clusters. The intent is to employ the strengths in
quantum dynamics of the U.S. participants and those of the Prague group in
electronic structure calculations to study three specific topics: 1)
Spectroscopy and dynamics of photodissociation, quenching and recombination of
iodine embedded in large argon clusters; 2) the dynamics of a chlorine atom in
water following electron photodetachment from hydrated chloride ions; and 3)
Raman spectra and hydrogen atom dynamics in photoexcited hydrogen bonded
clusters. Results are expected to contribute to our basic knowledge of molecular
clusters and related condensed phase phenomena. This project in theoretical
physical chemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of mutual
interest and competence. ??
