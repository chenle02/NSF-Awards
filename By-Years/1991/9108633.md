This award will support collaborative research between Professor M.E. Kassner
of Oregon State University and Professor E. Evangelista of the University of
Ancona, Italy. The objective of the project is to investigate the dynamic
restoration mechanisms associated with large strain deformation of aluminum and
aluminum alloys at ambient and elevated temperatures. The project is a study of
large strain deformation of pure aluminum and aluminum- magnesium alloys, a
fundamental basis for understanding metal- forming operations with the important
1xxx and 5xxx series aluminum alloys. The investigators hope to determine
whether, for high purity aluminum at ambient and near-ambient temperatures,
deformation to large plastic strains (e.g., > 4) will result in a mechanical
steady state. The second objective of the research is to determine whether the
newly observed (elevated temperature) phenomenon, geometric-dynamic-
recrystallization (GDR) is general. The US principal investigator will
substantially benefit from access to a torsion machine that is designed to be
more suitable for hot deformation of specimens for eventual transmission
electron microscopy examination than the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
(LLNL) Instron 1125. The US principal investigator will also benefit from the
Italian investigator's breadth of knowledge of the thermal-mechanical
phenomenology of aluminum alloys. This project will benefit the Italian
principal investigator by allowing access to highly reliable torsion testing
equipment (Reometrics Spectrometer II) for the purpose of determining accurate
stress versus strain behavior.
