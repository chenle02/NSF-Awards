Vocal behavior is important in evolutionary processes in songbirds, yet few
studies have attempted to explain morphological and genetic diversification in
light of vocal information. This research will integrate vocal, morphological,
and genetic data in the highly polytypic North American red crossbill (Loxia
curvirostra) complex. This group presents an unsolved evolutionary paradox: the
birds are nomadic, suggesting a high rate of gene flow, yet there is extreme
diversity in bill size, body size, and plumage coloration within the group.
Several testable alternative hypotheses regarding the nature of the variation in
North American red crossbills will be tested. The hypothesis currently favored
by ornithologists is that different forms of red crossbill are subspecies. This
hypothesis, along with alternative hypotheses that the forms may be species,
discontinuous morphs within breeding populations, or the result of developmental
plasticity will also be examined. Data to be gathered include information on
geographic variation in vocalizations, morphology, and allozymes, combined with
information on mating behavior and breeding structure in populations.
