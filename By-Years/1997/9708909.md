9708909 Schneider This is a twelve month SGER grant to develop two elementary
science cases relating to student knowledge of science concepts drawn from real-
life classroom teaching. Patterned after the cases successfully used to prepare
other professionals such as those in business and law, these science cases will
ground theoretical ideas and enhance analytic thought, reflection, and decision
making in the teaching of physical science. The project, based on earlier work
in mathematics, will explore and answer the following questions: What does a
science case look like? What are the essential elements of a science case? What
issues that arise in science cases transfer from one conceptual area in science
to another? How will involvement in a case improve teachers' physical science
content and knowledge and instructional strategies. If successful these
prototypes my lead to a new type of professional development material for
science education.
