Ciliated protozoa are widely recognized as an important component of planktonic
communities and are believed to play a pivotal role in marine microbial food
webs. The importance of ciliates as consumers of phytoplankton and, to a lesser
extent, bacterioplankton has been well studied and is now generally accepted.
Larger zooplankton are usually viewed as the predominant consumers of ciliates,
yet there is little evidence that grazing by metazoa has a substantial impact on
ciliate populations. Recent studies of the parastiic dinoflagellate Duboscquella
cachoni and its tintinnine host Eutintinnus pectinis in Chesapeake Bay indicate
that parasitism can have a significant impact on host abundance in coastal
environments where E. pectinis densities are sufficiently high to support
epizootic infections. Whether parasitism has a strong influence on other
estuarine species or on ciliates in the open ocean where host densities are
considerably lower is uncertain. The importance of parasitism to the fate of the
ciliate protozooplankton in Chesapeake Bay will be evaluated through a
combination of field studies to determine host-parasite abundance, species
composition, parasite life histories and generation times.
