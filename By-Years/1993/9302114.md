9302114 Friedman Contexts are a perfect means for expressing variable sharing
across multiple lexical scopes. A context is a syntax tree with nonterminal
leaves, called holes, that are to be filled later with terms (which are contexts
as well). Unlike substitution, filling a context's hole with a term causes the
term's free variables to be captured by the context's bound variables. First-
class contexts thus are a basis for incremental development of information-
sharing program pieces. Giving contexts first-class status facilitates separate
compilation of contexts. The target code can be reused on different
instantiations of the context's free variables or be reused on resolving its
different filling terms' free variables. Contextual programming brings
compilation, linking (context filling), and evaluation under the user's control.
It is a conceptually simple and yet very general programming paradigm. In
particular, modular and object-oriented programming are both special cases of
contextual programming. This research has both formal and experimental
components. Formal reasoning systems furnish a platform for analyzing and
comparing contextual programming with other programming language concepts and
mechanisms. Experiments are expected to generate insightful information to
evaluate design decisions, uncover deficiencies, and develop a better
understanding of contextual programming. ***
