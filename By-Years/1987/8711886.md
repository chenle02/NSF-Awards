Chemically-reacting systems tend to organize themselves in space and time,
unless the usual agents of mass and energy transfer among volume elements (e.g.
diffusion, convection, radiation) are suppressed. An instance simple enough to
be fruitfully tractable in both theory and experiment has come to light in an
aqueous isothermal reaction system internally coupled by molecular diffusion
alone. Mathematical analysis, computer simulation, and chemical experiments have
revealed the existence of mm-scale "organizing centers" in such excitable
reaction systems. Dr. Winfree plans to study the anatomy and behavior of such
organizing centers experimentally and by computer simulation. Such systems are
of interest not only to physical chemists, engineers, and mathematicians, but
also to biophysicists studying the activity patterns in neuromuscular tissue,
i.e. fibrillations, cardiac rhythms and arrhythmias, and epileptic seizures. For
example, recent experimental tests of Dr. Winfree's proposition that the newly
discovered three-dimensional waves in reaction-diffusion media should also be
observed in heart muscle, where the equations are practically the same even
though the underlying physics is quite different, indicate that the proposition
is sound. These results are of immediate practical interest to cardiologists.
