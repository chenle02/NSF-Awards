Nerve cells and glial cells are the major cell types present within the nervous
system. Glia cells surround nerve cells and constitutes more than half the mass
of the nervous system. The traditional view was that glial cells were just space
fillers between nerve cells, however, with the advent of new technologies, it
has been determined that glia plays a crucial role in many neuronal processes
such as neurogenesis, neural regeneration and neural function. Glia have been
shown to interact with nerve cells in complex ways that are essential for the
health of the nervous system. A conferences under the auspices of the New York
Academy of Sciences has been planned to bring together investigators studying in
vivo and in vitro preparations involving vertebrate and invertebrate systems.
The intent of this meeting is to discuss the recent advances in the cell biology
and physiology of glial cells and to examine the most promising lines of future
development.
