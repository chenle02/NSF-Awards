La Selva Biological Station, a lowland tropical rain forest site in Costa Rica,
is currently one of the world's most active centers for research in tropical
biology. The existence of a modern biological laboratory adjacent to 50,000 ha
of protected forests spanning a 3000-m altitudinal transect is unique in the
humid tropics. The recent addition to La Selva of 600 ha of altered and/or
manipulable habitats has fostered a quantum increase in large-scale process-
oriented research. An exceptionally diverse spectrum of researchers and academic
institutions are taking advantage of these opportunities. A critical
multidisciplinary mass has been reached at La Selva, which is simultaneously
stimulating new lines of research and pushing existing laboratory facilities to
their limits. With this Biological Facilities Center proposal, funds are
requested to equip a modern analytical laboratory to serve this growing network
of interrelated research efforts. This analytical laboratory with first-rate
instrumentation (GIS and standard and state-of-the-art equipment to permit
onsite evaluation) will greatly intensify the application of new techniques to
the biological study of tropical rain forest. Owing to La Selva's ties to a
large proportion of the U.S. academic community, this facility will benefit
users from an unusually broad geographic and disciplinary spectrum. The
development of technologically advanced infrastructure at a rain forest site
with an exceptional record of multidisciplinary research will have a major
impact on the next generation of knowledge of tropical ecosystems.
