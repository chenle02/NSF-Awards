9314394 Sansone Previous studies on Loihi seamount found low-temperature
hydrothermal vents with bacterial communities. These vents are very different
from those found in ridge-axis environments in by virtue of being highly gas-
charged with high volatile/heat ratios; and high 3He and CH4 plumes have been
found as well. Thus, Loihi seems to have an end-member hydrothermal system this
quite different from the ridge-axis systems. In this project, the PIs will go
back to Loihi and dive with Pisces V fitted with the new and improved gas
sampler and obtain an accurate sampling of the volatile phases that are pouring
out of these low-T vents. They will analyze the gases, particles, and ions that
are being brought out by the vents into the sea water. Their main goal is to
characterize the thermal, chemical, and particle fluxes at these vents.
