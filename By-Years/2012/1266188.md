This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of graduate students and
postdocs attending the Advances in Nonlinear Science that will be held on March
14-16, 2013, on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop aims to bring together leading experts and
researchers in nonlinear partial differential equations (both on the applied and
theoretical sides), with an emphasis of the Theme Semester on the modern game
theory with applications. The proposed conference builds on the relevance and
applications of stochastic methods applied to non-linear partial differential
equations that stem for recent developments in game theory. The keynote speakers
have been confirmed and represent top figures in mathematics. These are: E.
DiBenedetto of Vanderbilt University, R.V. Kohn of New York University, L.
Mahadevan of Havard University and G. Strang of MIT. Between 30-40 participants
are expected to participate in the workshop, the majority of whom will be from
outside of the University of Pittsburgh. Special attention will be paid to the
recruitment of women and minorities participants.
