Paleoecological research in the Hawaiian Islands will provide new information
about whether systems of the tropical Pacific Ocean before, during and since the
last glacial maximum, perhaps leading to a better understanding of the
discrepancy between continental and marine temperature records. Changes in past
vegetation will be determined from fossil pollen, wood and charcoal in peat bogs
and in soils buried beneath lava flows. Statistical methods of interpretation
will be developed, relating modern pollen assemblages and plant distributions to
the extensive data base on modern climates on the Islands. Four peat bogs have
been located, at elevations varying from 500 m to 1400 m above sea level, with
records extending from the present back to the last glacial maximum, and two of
the bogs have bottom dates &gt;36,000 and &gt;41,000 years. Samples are already
available from over 100 buried charcoal deposits. The locations of fossil sites
along an elevational transect and rainfall gradient controlled by the trade
winds means they can provide information about past lapse rates, the strength of
the trade winds and the elevation of the trade wind inversion.
