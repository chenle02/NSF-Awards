The Denver Metro Chem Scholars (DMCS) program is providing financial assistance,
effective student supports, and academic experiences leading to student degree
completion. DMCS graduates are entering the STEM workforce or continuing their
formal STEM education in graduate school. The project is supporting
approximately 24 students spread across three cohorts, during their sophomore,
junior and senior years, as they pursue Bachelor's degrees in Chemistry. The
DMCS program, led by a team of Chemistry faculty, is focused on retention and
reducing the time-to-degree by augmenting existing student support services with
peer mentoring, supplemental instruction, faculty-guided undergraduate research,
enhanced academic advising, and workshops on post-graduation opportunities.
Additional program features include collaborative cohort activities, a focus on
science literacy, and professionalization into the scientific community through
scholarly journal groups, conference participation, and engagement with student
chapters of professional societies. Metropolitan State University Denver, with a
total enrollment of over 23,000 and 94% from the metro area, serves more
students of color (31.6% of the student population) than any other university or
college in Colorado and is designated as an emerging Hispanic Serving
Institution. Due to the diverse population served, the DMCS program is enabling
students from underrepresented groups to persist, graduate, and pursue graduate
education or enter the STEM workforce. Because all DMCS activities are open to
all students, the project is leading to improved retention and graduation rates,
and to an increase in the number of students pursuing undergraduate research.
