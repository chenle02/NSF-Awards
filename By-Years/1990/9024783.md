This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Western Kentucky University acquire an Inductively
Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES). The instrument will be
used in research investigations in the following areas: analysis of trace
elements in fuels, analysis of gunshot residues, direct determination of
elements in slurried solids, forensic soil analysis, analysis of elements in
colonizing grasses, analysis of elements in tree growth rings, and elemental
analysis of animal blood and excrement samples. Atomic emission spectrometry
gives the direct elemental analysis of samples. Much interest has been directed
toward the atomization of solids into the inductively coupled plasmas (ICP), by
thermal vaporization of the sample followed by transport into the plasma in an
inert carrier gas. ICP excited atomic emission lines of the elements allow for
qualitative identification of the elements present in the sample. ICP-AES is
most frequently used for multi element analysis in areas such as real-time
process control, environmental monitoring, and electronic-grade materials
manufacturing.
