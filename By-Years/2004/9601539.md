Over the past century the United States, Britain, and Germany have taken
different approaches to the development of public telecommunications and have
built different telecommunications systems and capabilities. To account for such
differences in trajectory and outcome, this project will examine how material,
economic, cultural and social conditions have shaped the meaning of
telecommunications technologies. In contrast to purely cultural studies of
technology, this work will look closely at the technological artifacts in their
contexts, through comparative case studies of components. It will also analyze
the strategies employed by innovators to incorporate different groups of users
into public telecommunications networks and will compare such strategies across
nations. Finally, by examining the history of telecommunications to the present
the study will provide insight into the gains and losses society might expect
from future changes.
