Roughness measurements of solid surfaces, such as thin films and machined
metals, at microscales and nanoscales show that the surfaces are rough and
disordered over several decades of length scales. Similar features have been
observed in turbulent fluid interfaces. Such disordered structures strongly
influence thermal phenomena at interfaces. Previous studies on thermal phenomena
at such interfaces have conventionally made either oversimplifying idealizations
of smoothness of an interface or resorted to empirical and semi- empirical
methods of analysis. This lack of physical understanding of the phenomena was
mainly due to an inability to quantify the disorder in these structures. This
study proposes to use the novel concepts of fractal geometry to understand and
characterize the fundamental nature of disordered surfaces. Such a
characterization quantifies the structure of surfaces at every length scale
within certain limits. This is particularly important in providing key insight
into the interactions of thermal phenomena with interfaces at relevant length
scales. Preliminary studies on applying fractals in contact conductance have
explained several previous experimental results. Based on these encouraging
prospects, this study proposes to use fractals to study interfacial thermal
phenomena of scientific and engineering importance such as contact conductance,
frictional heating, and interactions of radiation with surfaces.
