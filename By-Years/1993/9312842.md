ABSTRACT P.I. John Fleagle SBR-9312842 Fossil remains of human ancestors have
been carefully examined anatomically to show that physical changes occurred
through time and to attempt to reconstruct likely behaviors of the individuals
and species concerned. These fossils are usually not isolated finds: they are
frequently found in association with other animal remains. Studies of these
animal remains have contributed a great deal to paleoanthropology, and have been
used to reconstruct environments to determine the relative ages of sites that
cannot be dated by absolute techniques. Also, a picture of environmental and
animal change or stability over long periods of time can be derived, over time,
and across different areas. This comparison is important for identifying
possible ecological pressures that may have affected the evolution and
behavioral ecology of different groups, including humans. This dissertation
project will compare the animal remains from early proto-human sites from the
African Pliocene by using various quantitative methods of analysis with the goal
of reconstructing the habitats and analyzing the ecological structure of these
assemblages. The information will be used to test current ideas regarding the
behavior and adaptation of early proto-humans. The multiple analytic approaches
to be employed will enable the development of more reliable interpretations of
site similarities and differences. *** P\anthro\jfried\9312842.abs F P3 P v P3 P
