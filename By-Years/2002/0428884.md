The research goal of this Sensor Small Team (SST) award is to investigate
integrated manufacturing processes for miniaturized millimeter wave systems. The
team members are to jointly work on innovative processes toward low-cost, batch-
fabricated, miniaturized and integrated millimeter wave systems for sensing,
imaging and communication applications. The system front-end is based on the
electronically-controlled millimeter wave beam-former architectures with new
manufacturing approaches utilizing micromachining techniques to fabricate three-
dimensional radio-frequency structures including antennas, splitters, phase
shifters, waveguides and passive components in a batch fashion. The overall
system architecture consists of three flip-chip bonded physical layers: antenna,
transmission-line and circuit layers. The antenna layer serves as a vertical
integration platform that has a horn antenna array with high gain and coupling
efficiency. Several enabling plastic micro-manufacturing process modules are to
be established, including plastic molding, embossing, mechanical polishing,
assembly and bonding processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The low-cost high-power
millimeter wave front-ends will create a wide range of novel sensing
applications such as vision goggles that assist firefighters to see through
smoke, mobile radars that enhance safety in foggy weather for automobiles and
airplanes, chemical and biological agent detection by spectrometry and portable
broadband communication systems. The new micro manufacturing processes will
benefit the general Microelectromechanical Systems community to inspire new
device development. The synergy of research interaction and integration between
manufacturing (mechanical engineering) and high frequency devices (electrical
engineering) will be an engine for the multidisciplinary fusion in research
expertise for the next-generation scientists and engineers.
