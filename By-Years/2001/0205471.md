Conventional computer architecture has been based on and dominated by
the&lt;br/&gt;capacity poor systems we were forced to build 20 and 50 years ago.
For&lt;br/&gt;over three decades, the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) has
formed the&lt;br/&gt;basic architectural abstraction for scalability. As
wonderful as the ISA&lt;br/&gt;abstraction has been, its range of utility is
coming to an end. Our&lt;br/&gt;systems have grown orders of magnitude in size
and speed, and many of the&lt;br/&gt;simplifying assumptions which underly the
ISA are limiting forward&lt;br/&gt;scalability rather than enabling them. This
effort explores a&lt;br/&gt;reformulation of our basic assumptions and machine
abstractions to&lt;br/&gt;accommodate the large capacity computing systems we
can now build. Whereas&lt;br/&gt;the sequence of primitive instructions was the
core fixed point in ISA&lt;br/&gt;model, this effort proposes stream-connected
graphs as the model fixed&lt;br/&gt;point for these Decentralized Streaming
Architectures (DSA). This way&lt;br/&gt;communication is abstracted directly in
the architecture facilitating&lt;br/&gt;parallelism and optimization for
physical locality. DSA will give us a&lt;br/&gt;single, unifying system model
for future computing systems which scales&lt;br/&gt;from modest, single-chip,
single-processor systems, to multiprocessor ICs,&lt;br/&gt;to a wide range of
heterogeneous System-on-a-Chip designs, to large-scale,&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous,
multi-component systems that evolve over decade
long&lt;br/&gt;lifecycles.&lt;br/&gt;
