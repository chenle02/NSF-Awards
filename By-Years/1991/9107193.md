This is a study of the relaxation mechanisms in highly non- equilibrium glass
structures. X-ray diffraction, Raman and Infrared spectroscopy, and Differential
Scanning Calorimetry will be used to follow structural changes during annealing
of rapidly quenched germania, boria, and silica glass fibers. The experimental
results will be analyzed using a new phenomenological model which will be
derived to address the inadequacies of current equilibrium models for highly
non-equilibrium systems. The improved model together with data on structural
changes and the corresponding enthalpy relaxation will lead to a better
understanding of the microscopic mechanisms in structural relaxation phenomenon
in oxide glasses. Understanding relaxation is essential for the development of
new important glasses for the communication technology.
