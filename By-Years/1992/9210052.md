The purpose of this research is to address the issue of fairness in the context
of bargaining. Over a decade of research by experimental economists using
sequential-move bargaining games has documented the observed tendencies toward
equal split of the available surplus. This is contrary to the predictions of
noncooperative equilibrium theory based on self-interested bargainers. Is this
due to a preference for fair outcomes, or is it due to expectations arising in
the context of social exchange? Double blind experiments have already been run
where no one, including the experimenter, can identify who made what decision.
The project will analyze the effect of this anonymity in a variety of bargaining
games, and explore procedures for assuring that a subject has earned the right
to an advantageous position in a bargaining situation. These issues are
fundamental to understanding the nature, circumstances and conditions under
which self-interested outcomes are observed in our society, as well as to
understanding the effect of social context on outcomes, and the extent to which
they arise because of expectation of reciprocity in social relationships. If it
is the latter, then fair play is based on self-interest and may be fragile and
dependent upon expectations of continuing relationships. This type of research
on the effect of earned rights on behavior toward others is fundamental to
property rights and contracting in the creation of markets.
