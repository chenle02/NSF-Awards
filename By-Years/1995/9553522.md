9553522 Abernethy This proposal seeks support for a four week, residential Young
Scholars program in computer science for thirty students entering grades 11 and
12. The program is designed to introduce students to computing as a scientific
discipline by immersing them in computer science-oriented research projects from
four primary areas: image processing, neural networks, scientific data
visualization, and research issues associated with the Internet. A primary goal
of the project is to assist students in expanding their perspective of the
computing sciences from a conventional programming paradigm toward a broader
theoretical and research-based approach to computing. The program will also
include follow-up activities consisting of continuation of work on research
projects initiated during the school year, making a presentation on their summer
experience to students at their home school, and a one day Fall workshop on the
Furman campus.
