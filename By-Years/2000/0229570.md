The explorers of Antarctica's heroic era (early twentieth century) erected
buildings and brought large amounts of supplies to survive the extreme
environment during their Antarctic exploration. These buildings were abandoned
once the expedition was over, leaving huts and thousands of artifacts (e.g.,
furniture, scientific apparatus, food stores, clothing) behind. Today these
historic sites provide a remarkable view into the past and while the extreme
polar environment has provides some protection from rapid decay, serious
deterioration is apparent. This project (in collaboration with New Zealand
scientists) and is a continuation of research to identify the bacteria and fungi
attacking these historic structures and artifacts and to elucidate the
mechanisms of biodegradation occurring in the polar environment. Studies will
also be done to better understand the non-biological (e.g., salt, UV light,
wind) deterioration processes taking place and to test methods for protecting
the historic woods from continued attack. Pollutants (e.g., polyaromatic
hydrocarbons) that contaminate the historic sites pose serious problems to the
Antarctic environment and investigations will assess the extent of contamination
and develop appropriate protocols for remediation. &lt;br/&gt;This project will
provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to become involved
in research. The preservation of the historic wooden structures will be of great
interest to those in the international community and the general public who are
intrigued by the last great age of polar exploration. Results will provide the
scientific data needed by conservators to help protect these important Antarctic
historic sites for future generations. This research will also add significantly
to our knowledge of the biology and ecology of the Antarctic microorganisms, the
biodiversity of microbes present in the polar environment and elucidate unique
deterioration processes.
