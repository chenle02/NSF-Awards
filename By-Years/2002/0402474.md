This award will enable a five-year project using the science of dendrochronology
to examine the relationship between the Asian monsoon and the large-scale
coupled processes that drive much of its variability. The researchers will
examine these interactions on inter-annual to centennial time scales and
anticipate that this project will yield information about how the monsoon system
has varied over the past several centuries. Specifically, they will investigate
the relationship of the Asian Monsoon to the large-scale coupled processes that
drive much of its variability; namely air temperatures and sea surface
temperatures (SST).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is motivated by a series of
research question such as: "How have the processes responsible for driving much
of the observed Asian monsoon climate dynamics varied and interacted on inter-
annual to centennial time scales?" and "How have Asian surface air temperatures,
Indian Ocean SSTs, and Tropical Pacific SSTs covaried and interacted over the
past several centuries?" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Asian monsoon climate system
plays a significant role in large-scale climate variability over much of the
globe. Due to its considerable importance to global climate and implications for
the world's population, a greater understanding of this system, with the
ultimate goal being improved prediction on annual to decadal and longer time
scales is warranted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help the science
community understand climate variability in a densely populated region of the
world. On the practical side, improved knowledge of climate variability could be
used to improve long-term agricultural planning in the region by buffering
agrarian societies against the effects of monsoon variability. The award will
support post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students at Columbia
University and the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory and help build scientific
capacity, infrastructure, and professional partnerships among Asian colleagues.
