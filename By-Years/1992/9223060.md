The aim of this research is to investigate synthesis, structure, and properties
of new early transition metal sulfide phases. The proposed compounds will have
perovskite related or layer structures and transition metals with do to d1
configurations. A variety of synthetic techniques will be employed such as BaCl2
flux reactions, CS2 sulfiding reactions, and sulventothermal reactions. All
compounds will be characterized by XRD, transport, and magnetic measurements.
These compounds will allow comparisons of the structures and properties of
isocompositional oxides and sulfides in the areas where metal insulator
transitions occur. The importance of structure and covalency in the formation of
new metallic solids will be addressed. %%% The aim of this research is to
investigate synthesis, structure, and properties of new classes of unexplored
solid state materials. These compounds will comprise early transition metals
(Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta) and sulfur. Attempts are made to design features into
these materials that are known to be important in the copper oxide
superconductors. The atomic structure and properties of the new materials will
be determined. The importance of structure and bonding in the formation of new
materials, with desirable properties such as metallic behavior and/or
superconductivity, will be addressed.
