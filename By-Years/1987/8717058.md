The goal of Dr. Whittaker's research is an understanding of the structural
origins of the unique spectral and catalytic properties of the mononuclear
active site in galactose oxidase. This site has already been extensively
characterized in biochemical terms but many aspects of its structure and
mechanism remain unclear. Dr. Whittaker is developing the information content of
the unusual spectral features for this active site through parallel studies on
the biological complex and structurally defined inorganic models containing
copper in a formal +3 oxidation state. He is applying the powerful methods of
inorganic spectroscopy to develop extremely sensitive structural probes of the
active site metal ion and its interactions with protein and exogenous ligands.
