Intellectual Merit: To bridge the gap between the understanding of violent
hotspots in Iraq, refugee experiences of that violence, and the refugees'
decision to leave their country of origin temporarily or permanently, the fellow
presents an in-depth study of the relationship between spatio-temporal patterns
of violence in Iraq with refugee perceptions of and strategies toward violence
and security risks. The project includes 1) the creation of a digital spatial
map representing violent events in Baghdad, Iraq from 2003-2007 to model
patterns of violence; and 2) intensive fieldwork in Damascus, Syria to gather
ethnographic data on Iraqi refugee communities to overlay contextual, cultural,
and personal information with the digital-cultural map.

Broader Impacts: This research will increase the field's comprehension of forced
migration, macro- and microscopic forces behind refugee movement patterns, and
civilian experiences and perceptions of violence by integrating empirical
knowledge of violent patterns with human understandings and reactions to that
violence. Using this analysis, this research will assist in making
recommendations on optimal uses of space and time for security and development
work; provide security strategies to civilian, aid, and law enforcement
communities; and predict patterns of violence. This project has wide-ranging,
transformative potential to provide direct societal benefits through improved
security and refugee support.

Lastly, this project increases participation of underrepresented groups in the
STEM fields through the addition of a non-white, non-Arab researcher in the
field of Middle Eastern Studies, and via the Fellow's interactions with diverse
groups in the Los Angeles area both with and outside the university.
