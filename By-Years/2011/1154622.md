This project provides 54 two-year scholarships for students enrolled in
Civil/Mechanical Engineering Technology, Electronic Engineering Technology,
Machine Manufacturing Engineering Technology, and Microelectronics at Portland
Community College (PCC). Scholarships are awarded based on academic achievement,
financial need, and interest in technology fields. Student support strategies
include faculty mentoring, tutoring services, cohort activities, and others.
Scholars receive assistance in pursuing technology careers or seeking four-year
degrees. New approaches to recruiting students into technology programs are
used, specifically targeting Hispanics. A Math Visits Recruitment Program
introduces students to technology programs and careers through classroom
presentations. High school students interested in robotics receive free tuition
to attend introductory machine manufacturing courses, gaining college credit,
hands-on experience, and exposure to the S-STEM program. The proposed project
strengthens connections among PCC, local high schools, four-year colleges, and
technology industries. It has a direct impact on the Portland Metro area by
increasing the number of women and underrepresented minorities in technology
industries and creating positive role models for these populations. New
partnerships with Upward Bound and Talent Search enhance recruitment strategies.
Additionally, effective partnerships with technology industries increase
experiential learning opportunities. Outcomes from these strategies inform the
broader higher education community on effective means of attracting and engaging
students in technology programs and careers.
