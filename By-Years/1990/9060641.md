Proton exchange membrane (PEM) based fuel cells are the power system of choice
for many applications including electric vehicles, but they require complex
water recirculation and humidification systems for effective operation. Three
anion exchange membranes identified in preliminary experiments conducted at
ElectroChem form the basis for the proposed development of novel anion exchange
membrane (AEM) based fuel cells. The membranes are OH ion conductive, chemically
stable in hot caustic, and are not fouled by CO2. It is anticipated that AEM
fuel cells will have all the advantages of PEM fuel cells, namely, no free
electrolyte-associated materials problems, high power densities, and good
reliability. AEM's are expected to have favorable water transport properties and
would eliminate some of the problems related to water management, resulting in
system simplification. It is further anticipated that the advantages of alkaline
electrolytes-- rapid oxygen reduction kinetics and the possible use of non-
noble metal electrocatalysts--will be maintained without the problem of CO2
intolerance. The result should be a simple, compact, and efficient power system
for terrestrial and space power applications.
