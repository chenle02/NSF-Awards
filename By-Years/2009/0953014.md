Computer systems security is an arms race between defenders and attackers that
has mainly been confined to software technologies. Increases in the complexity
of hardware and the rising number of transistors per chip have created
opportunities for hardware-based security threats. Among the most pernicious are
malicious hardware footholds inserted at design time, which an attacker can use
as the basis of a computer system attack.

This project explores of the feasibility of foothold attacks and a fundamental
design-time methodology for defending against them. First, this project looks at
techniques for highlighting potentially malicious circuits in a design
automatically. The basic algorithm, called dead circuit identification (DCI),
analyzes hardware description language source code and dynamic execution traces
of design verification tests to identify suspicious circuitry whose results do
not impact the computation.

The second aspect of this project is a system for removing suspicious circuits
from a design automatically. The dead circuit elimination (DCE) tool removes
suspicious circuits from a design by pushing potentially malicious logic up to a
higher layer where it can be analyzed in more detail at runtime.

The third aspect of this project is a new technique for generating test cases
and perturbing existing test cases to search specifically for potentially
malicious circuits.

This project provides a pathway to detection and defense against security risks
from hardware comprising attacks, making the enormous disruptions possible with
such attacks far more difficult than today.
