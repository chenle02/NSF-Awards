One of the definite goals of the Engineering Directorate in the future years is
to increase interaction and cooperation with the International engineering
community. This interaction may include many forms of implementation, but must
be based on a quid pro quo relationship resulting in benefits to both countries.
The purpose of this grant is to continue this activity with specific emphasis on
the French Ocean Engineering Community. Discussions have been held with persons
representing French research and United States research. The workshop discussed
herein will bring together researchers to define a program in collaborative
activities in Ocean System Engineering and the outline of future joint efforts.
