Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;We have identified a need for failure
awareness in the undergraduate engineering curriculum. Engineers can learn a lot
from failures, and failures play an essential role in engineering design. This
need has been documented in a number of papers and conferences over the past 15
years. Our work is in response to this situation and aimed at providing a
heightened appreciation of the role failure analysis knowledge can play in
higher education and public safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have produced
educational materials on failure case studies for use in civil engineering and
engineering mechanics courses, in print and CD-ROM format. In addition we have
developed a one-day workshop to disseminate these materials to 24 engineering
faculty members from across the U.S. During the course of our project we have
developed our educational materials, including review and feedback by the
committees discussed below, and the workshop, as well as a thorough evaluation
of both efforts. Although the majority of the work has been carried out at The
University of Alabama at Birmingham, faculty members and practicing engineers
from across the country have participate in the development of these materials
and the workshop. This work has been accomplished through the various committees
of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Technical Council on Forensic
Engineering (TCFE). Our work has specifically targets the NSF Division of
Undergraduate Education crosscutting theme of Faculty Development.&lt;br/&gt;
