Richard Schwartz plans to continue his work in geometry and dynamical systems.
The first area of his focus will be the dynamics of particles in the complement
of planar polygonal regions. Building on his solution of the 1960 Moser-Neumann
question, Schwartz plans to continue developing the theory, finding connections
to such subjects as Diophantine approximtion, self-similar tilings, and polytope
exchange transformations. The second ares of his focus will be on optimization
problems, such as the question of how a finite number of electrons optimally
distribute themselves on the sphere. Specifically, Schwartz would like to extend
his solution of Thomson's 5-electron problem to the case of other power laws.
Finally, Schwartz plans to study a variety of geometric iterations, such as high
dimensional iterated barycentric subdivision.

For the most part, Schwartz's research involves studying what happens when one
makes a simple geometric construction over and over again. For instance, one
could follow a ball as it bounces endlessly inside a triangular table, or follow
the motion of traffic as it moves along an infinite grid of one-way streets
according to certain rules, or study the shapes one gets when one cracks a
tetrahedron into smaller and smaller tetrahedra. Often these simple
constructions, when done repeatedly, produce very beautiful and unexpected
patterns. Schwartz likes to study such problems, at first, by doing computer
experiments and then, later, by trying to construct rigorous proofs that the
phenomena uncovered by the experiments actually exist.
