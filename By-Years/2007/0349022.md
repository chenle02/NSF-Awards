This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project proposes to develop a
high performance transparent aluminum oxynitride (AlON) material, with improved
mechanical properties and low cost, via an innovative powder synthesis method.
Using nanoparticle sintering, an IR transmission of 80% can be achieved. The
smaller grain size leads to a MOR of 400 MPa.

The Phase II program proposes to extend the applications of AlON for wide spread
commercial applications. Several major forming methods will be developed in this
Phase II program so that the forming capability can be established to fulfill
all of the different parts for different markets. These products include high
intensity discharge lamps, security windows, semiconductor substrates, laser
windows, consumer optic windows, orthodontic brackets, etc.
