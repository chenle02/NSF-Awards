ABSTRACT AST- 9423209 Narayan, Ramesh This grant will pursue two topics. The
first is Gravitational Lensing, the phenomenon by which light rays from a
distant source are deflected by the gravitational influence of intervening
galaxies. In some cases, this results in an observer seeing multiple images of a
source. It is possible to deduce the gravitational distribution of the
intervening mass from the observed images, and it is proposed to develop a new
algorithm for this, based on the Maximum Entropy Method, a well-known image
processing technique. Furthermore, when a source is multiply-images, light takes
different lengths of time to reach the observer by different paths. By combining
a model of the lens with the measured time difference between correlated
variations in the image, the distance to the source can be estimated, which
gives a value for Ho, the Hubble constant. The second topic is Accretion Flows,
viscous spiraling in of gas onto a compact gravitating mass, such as a neutron
star or a black hole. The PI proposes to model the inner regions close to the
accreting mass, whence most of the observed radiation derives. The neutron star
and black hole cases will be treated differently, since gas accreting onto a
neutron star ultimately slows down and settles on the stellar surface, whereas
flow around a black hole accelerates to supersonic radial speeds before falling
through the horizon. ***
