The world-renowned Mouse Mutant Stocks Center at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar
Harbor, Maine, has two important functions: (1) research on new mutants of the
mouse; and (2) maintenance and distribution of mouse mutants and genetic
information about them to the scientific community. Mutants that have potential
value for biomedical research are maintained in the colony with constant genetic
backgrounds and, when necessary, by special genetic techniques. Mutants with
controls or breeding pairs of mutation carriers are distributed to scientists
world wide upon request. The Center also assembles information on mouse genes
and provides other scientists with comprehensive linkage maps of the mouse, a
computer list of genes with information about them, and a computerized strain-
by-locus matrix of polymorphic loci. This award provides a partial subsidy for
the maintenance and distribution functions of the Mouse Mutants Stock Center.
