9318511 Yablonka The value to academic health care organizations of access to
the Internet has been well documented in the literature. A Northwestern Memorial
Hospital Network (NMHNET) connection to the Internet would provide a critical
service as Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH) moves forward in the delivery of
care to our patients and the support of research and education. NMH has deployed
a high speed network over the last several years. NMH is continuing this
substantial investment with a new high performance, TCP/IP network
infrastructure to support advanced clinical applications such as: clinical
decision support systems, diagnostic imaging and the creation of electronic
patient records. This grant request will provide over the two years a connection
to the Internet with the appropriate hardware and an opportunity to improve
patient care, research and education at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. NMH
needs to provide a connection for hospital clinicians, researchers and educators
to communicate with NIH, NLM, Supercomputers in Champaign, IL, and colleagues
and co- investigators across the nation via E-Mail. We must remove these
barriers in order to enhance our support of patient care, research and
education. The connection of NMHNET to the Internet is a vital link to our
clinicians, researchers and educators. These initiatives being undertaken with
our partners at Northwestern University Medical School (NUMS) constitute the
development of a highly advanced medical center network providing services to
our diverse clinical, research and academic staffs. ***
