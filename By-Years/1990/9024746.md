Marine bryozoans are important bottom-dwelling animals, especially where there
are solid surfaces like shells, rocks or seaweed for colonies to attach. The
purpose of this project is to carry out a survey and species inventory of the
little known marine bryozoan fauna of the northeast coast of the United States.
Researchers will accomplish this by 1) making new collections in as many
locations as possible between Maine and Virginia, 2) analyzing collections made
by other scientists working in the area, and 3) examining material already in
museums in the region, especially the type specimens, on which any original
descriptions of local species were based, and any still uncataloged specimens
they may have. By means of the latest scanning electron microscope (SEM) and
electronic measuring techniques, all species found will be studied and the
findings published. The result will be an up-to-date illustrated guide to the
marine bryozoans of the northeastern United States. It will be of great
practical use to biologists studying the increasingly environmentally stressed
northeastern coastal zone. It will be important also to scientists and students
interested in bryozoan evolution, providing a current classification and new
descriptions, as well as answering questions about family relationships and
geographical distribution.
