Extremely thin sputtered coatings of carbon are used to protect the magnetic
storage medium on computer disks against damage due to head contact during
starts and stops. In this study the mechanisms of wear of these films will be
determined and related to their microstructure and to their mechanical and
physical properties. The results will be used to validate a generic friction
model developed by the author and his co-workers and to determine which film
properties provide optimal wear and friction performance, and why.
