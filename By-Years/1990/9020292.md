Dr. Lacy has constructed an echelle spectrograph which is an order of magnitude
more sensitive than other available instruments for spectroscopy of moderate to
high resolution at mid-infrared wavelengths. With this grant he will continue
his pioneering work in this wavelength region of the spectrum. Three projects
will be emphasized: 1) He will investigate the relative importance of gas- phase
and grain-surface reactions on the composition of molecular clouds by observing
absorption of various molecules in the gaseous and solid phases; 2) He will
study the pure rotational line emission of molecular hydrogen, to learn about
the conditions in shocked gas and photodissociation regions, and to determine
the ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide; and 3) He will observe the mid-
infrared emission lines of ions of neon and sulfur to study the kinematics and
excitation of infrared luminous galaxies. There are two principal advantages to
the mid-infrared spectral region for astronomical spectroscopy: the small
interstellar extinction relative to that at shorter wavelengths, and the
presence of several interesting spectral features, notably vibrational
transitions of molecules and fine-structure lines of ions. Many objects which
are unobservable, because of extinction, at visible or near-infrared wavelengths
become accessible in the mid-infrared. Spectral lines of molecules and ions
provide valuable information about the kinematics and physical conditions of the
newly revealed objects. Dr. Lacy's spectrograph represents a significant advance
in the quality of instrumentation for exploring objects at mid-infrared
wavelengths.
