The Early Proterozoic orogenic belt in Arizona is a wide complex zone of
deformed continental crust that was accreted to North America between 1800 and
1600 Ma. Prior work has identified several major crustal blocks, bounded by
shear zones, that underwent different structural histories prior to their
juxtaposition sometime after 1695 Ma. These new data strongly suggests that the
Proterozoic of central Arizona evolved by a process of accretionary tectonics
analogous to accretionary collages in Phanerozoic orogens. This renewal project,
in collaboration with workers at Washington University, will extend mapping
coverage and structural analysis to a larger area, including several terranes
and possible suture zones. Precise U-Pb geochronology will be applied to
constrain the sequence and timing of deformation and metamorphic events. Results
will address the problem of evolution of the Proterozoic plate margin along the
southern edge of the North American continent, and mechanisms of continental
growth.
