9618149 Vickers Science that Counts in The Workplace is a physical science
course embedded in workplace contexts that addresses the learning goals of the
science standards and the goals of the school-to-career movement. The modular
materials, emphasizing Industrial and Engineering Technologies, are particularly
appropriate for career academies and high schools organized by career clusters.
The target audience is eleventh and twelfth grade students who have not tended
to take a third year of science because they do not thrive on abstract science
teaching. The six modules can be used as a course or as drop-in units. The
contexts are taken from the design, manufacturing and maintenance of buildings,
transportation systems and consumer goods. The emphasis is on teaching science
in the context of work rather than on delivering occupationally-specific
training. Each group of lessons within a module begins with a workplace issue
and maps backwards to develop an understanding of the underlying science and
mathematics. All students participate in common workplace experiences that take
the form of field trips to job sites that give students experiences exploring
and/or applying the science concepts and skills learned in the classroom. The
materials provide a hands-on, inquiry-rich pedagogy, providing a meaningful
context for science learning that helps students understand that science
learning is key to a variety of careers. The materials support employees in
industry to contribute more confidently and effectively to the education of
students, serve as a model for developing academic curriculum embedded in
workplace contexts and support high school reorganization.
