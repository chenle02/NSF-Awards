This project will allow the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (OIMB) to improve
its local area computer network and enhance its link to the University of Oregon
campus network. The research program at OIMB has expanded considerably in the
past five years and has doubled the number of faculty positions and
corresponding support staff. Incremental changes have been made to the local
area network, but such piecemeal improvements have not been able to keep up with
current technological developments. By improving the computer network and
software packages the facility will provide all visiting and resident
researchers with access to the Internet, utilizing appropriate graphical user
interfaces, and will enhance our ability to store, manipulate and analyze data.
The improvements will also allow OIMB to share locally significant databases
with the larger scientific community via an OIMB Mosaic Homepage on the World
Wide Web. This project fits well with the philosophy of advancing computing and
communications capabilities of field research facilities. It will place OIMB
well within the framework of current technology.
