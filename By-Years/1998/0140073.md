Three topics in cold-atom physics are investigated. First, low-energy collisions
with dipolar interactions are studied to provide a realistic assesment of the
effect of laser induced dipoles in atomic gases. Second, evaporation and loading
dynamics are studied in far off resonance traps. Finally, squeezing and
entanglement in spinor-1 condensates are examined for quantum correlations and
the effect on qunatum information science.
