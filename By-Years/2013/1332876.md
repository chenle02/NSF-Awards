The PIs are funded to use surface and body wave tomographic techniques to
examine the structure of the upper mantle beneath the Juan de Fuca Plate. OBS
arrays associated with the Cascadia Initiative (CI) will be used in conjunction
with land arrays to investigate the evolution of the plate?mantle system, from
melt production and asthenospheric structure at the spreading center to plate
deformation and small-scale convection at the subduction zone, as well as
asthenospheric return flow from trench to ridge. Surface and body wave data will
be combined in a joint inversion, followed by waveform modeling to refine
tomographic images. An additional goal is to constrain the locations and
mechanisms of moderate-sized earthquakes that occur before and during the
experiment. The project will partner with education and outreach efforts
associated with the CI, including mentoring community college students and
contributing to the Seismometers@SchoolSites program for high school students.
Post-doctoral scholars and graduate students will be trained. Project data will
be incorporated into undergraduate coursework and research projects. The PIs
will take advantage of the UO cloud computing facility for parts of the
research.
