New thrusts in Biotechnology are being provided in the curriculum at the
freshman, sophomore and advanced levels. Related laboratory experiences include
work in modeling, DNA manipulation, fermentation, and tissue culture using
agarose gel electrophoresis and electro-blotting. New equipment supporting these
advances include a hood, a freeze dryer and a computer-based data acquisition
system. Three tissue culture, three DNA manipulation, a stable isotope plant
selection exercise, and two computer modeling lab sessions are being added to
existing courses. A new lab oriented-course called Biotechnology also is being
developed. Its major components involve recombinant DNA methods, fermentation,
bioproduction and bioconversion, eukaryotic tissue culture and differentiation,
and simulation modeling. Enhanced educational opportunities in experimental and
quantitative Biotechnology are being provided, and a regional need for formal
education in Biotechnology is being met.
