This research, supported by a National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award, will develop numerical algorithms for moving boundary problems in crystal
growth, construct fast algorithms for parabolic systems and geometric problems,
and study dispersive limits and lattice models. The National Science Foundation
Young Investigator award recognizes outstanding young faculty. This award
recognizes the recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as
a research mathematician and for significant development as a teacher and
academic leader.
