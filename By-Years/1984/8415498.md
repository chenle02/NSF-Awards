In this research program, two important problem areas in the field of digital
signal processing are examined. The first topic deals with the design of finite-
impulse response (FIR) digital filters with fixed length coefficients. For cases
where the filter length is too long to make use of optimal techniques, the
coefficients are quantized with an error spectrum shaping quantizer. This
technique allows the error due to rounding to be weighted in a desired fashion
within the frequency band. The second topic of research is in the area of linear
time-varying signal processing. An important feature of such processing is that
both the analysis and design can be approached within a standard framework,
permitting the solution to be accomplished in a uniform manner.
