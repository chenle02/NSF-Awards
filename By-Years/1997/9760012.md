*** 9760012 Lyon This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to
demonstrate the chemistry for a new, more efficient, and cleaner method of coal
combustion. The use of coal to generate electrical power involves severe
pollution problems. These problems include the emission of S02 and NOx, which
cause both a local air pollution and the national problem of acid rain, the
emission of mercury, furans, dioxanes and submicron particles containing toxic
heavy metals, and the emission of massive quantities of carbon dioxide, the
greenhouse gas chiefly responsible for global warming. A new method of coal
combustion is proposed which avoids all these problems and improves the
efficiency of producing electricity from coal. As the hardware necessary to
implement this new combustion concept has already been developed for other uses,
the key uncertainties relate to the chemistry. The research program aims to
demonstrate this chemistry. The new combustion technology-if successful-could be
used in a major share of U.S. and foreign generating capacity. ***
