This proposal requests funding to assist approximately 40 US-based researchers
to attend the First Workshop on Deterministic Multiprocessing (WoDet) in
Seattle, WA, in the first week of October 2009. The goals of the workshop are to
initiate a discussion in the areas of deterministic multiprocessing from
languages all the to hardware and tools and to spark funding for new research
programs. While there is a growing consensus that determinism would greatly help
with the programmability challenges of multicore systems, there is still little
consensus on many important questions. &lt;br/&gt;The support requested enables
the participation of both academic and industry researchers. The PIs also open
the workshop to a select set of students who are already working in the area.
