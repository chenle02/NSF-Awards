Professor Gillet will continue his work on Arakelov theory and arithmetic
Riemann-Roch type theorems. He will also work on Gersten's conjecture in
Algebraic K-theory and connections between Lichtenbaum's conjectures on K-theory
and Regulators and arithmetic intersection theory. This project falls into the
general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest
areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
