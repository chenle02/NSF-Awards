Nanoparticles and nanowires can provide a variety of functions and are
considered as building blocks for future nanotechnological devices. The overall
goal of this research is to develop a parallel tool to direct the self-assembly
of nanoparticles and successive growth of nanowires on silicon substrates with
sub 100 nm resolution to enable the manufacturing of nanotechnological devices
that use nanoparticles and nanowires as building blocks.
