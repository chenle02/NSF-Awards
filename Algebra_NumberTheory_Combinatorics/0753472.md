ABSTRACT

Principal Investigator: Frieze, Alan Proposal Number: DMS - 0753472 Institution:
Carnegie-Mellon University Title: Random Graphs: Structure and Algorithms

The study of random combinatorial structures has emerged as an important
component of Discrete Mathematics. The most intensely studied area is that of
random graphs and many of the results of this area have been extended to
hypergraphs or set systems. This proposal is aimed at doing research into
various structural properties of random graphs and hypergraphs. In addition the
proposal will consider some related algorithmic questions.

Graphs and networks are emerging as important phenomena. Networks arise in
social contexts such as links between pages in the World Wide Web. They also
arise in biological systems such as the protein inter-action network of a cell.
These networks arise from "random processes" and so the study of random graphs
is becoming more and more relevant. Finally, studying algorithms on typical
graphs will hopefully be usefull in drawing back the shadow of the negative
results of complexity theory.
