9413163 Quay This project is a contribution to the US World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Hydrographic Program (IO WHP). The PI will carry
out part of the sampling for Carbon 14 on WOCE lines I8S and I9S, which are
essentially meridional lines along 115 degrees east, and 85 to 95 degrees east
between about 30 degrees South and the Antarctic Continent. In addition, the PI
will participate with other WOCE scientists in analyzing, interpreting and
publishing the data. Specific objectives include study of the deep water
circulation in the western South Australia Basin, and the formation of
subantarctic Mode Water.
