This project will culture planktic foraminifera to address questions concerning
the controls upon incorporation of stable isotopes and trace elements in the
calcite skelteon. Topics to be addressed include: the role of seawater carbonate
chemistry and of temperature in isotopic ratios in warm-and cold-water taxa, the
relationship of Mg concentration to temperature, and the relation of Cd
concentration to nutrient content. When the environmental controls on these
tracers are better understood, it will be possible to use the geochemistry of
fossil foraminifera to produce more accurate quantitative estimates of ocean and
climate changes. The estimates can be used to test the accuracy of climate
models in simulating climate under various conditions such as those of the
recent past.
