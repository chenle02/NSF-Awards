The I/UCR Center for Hazardous Substance Management (HSMRC) at the New Jersey
Institute of Technology plans to form an Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) Partnership for Science and Engineering with one or more
colleges/universities in Indonesia. One of these institutions will serve as the
lead institution of an academic consortium in Indonesia which will participate
in the partnership. The consortium concept offers the opportunity to access a
broader range of expertise than that which can be offered by a single university
to address hazardous waste management issues. The academic consortium in
Indonesia will serve as a nucleus for the formation of an Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center which will carry out at the academic institutions, a
research program in the area of waste management of value and interest to the
industrial participants in the cooperative research center. Faculty and students
from Indonesia will participate in educational and research programs at the
HSMRC; HSMRC faculty will participate in the Indonesian institutions' research
activities; and there will be possibilities for development of interactive
economic and business endeavors by the corporate membership of the two linked
Cooperative Research Centers in Indonesia and in the U.S. This Center, once
established, will train personnel to: a) address the waste management concerns
of Indonesia's industry and provide solutions compatible with local requirements
and conditions and b) contribute to the development of an infrastructure that
will lead to sustainable development of Indonesia's economy. The I/UCRC concept
is appropriate to address the environmental concerns of Indonesia's industry.
The academic industrial cooperative effort allows academia to recognize
industry's problems and develop strategies to best address these problems with
solutions that can be implemented by industry. This award will be for $100,000
for 24 months.
