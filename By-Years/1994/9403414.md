This research is on compiled simulation of synchronous and asynchronous
circuits. A digital logic simulation algorithm, called the Inversion Algorithm,
is being investigated. This is a very efficient algorithm, yet capable of
simulating any digital circuit. Basic extensions are being made to the
algorithm. These involve including unit and multi-delay timing models, a logic
model with unknown value, new gates, new types of functions, as well as bit-
parallel simulation. Further, it is being redesigned so as to reduce both the
complexity of the simulation and the number of events processed during
simulation. Additional activities include extending the existing model to a
multiple processor implementation, and to handle asynchronous sequential
circuits. Application of the Inversion Algorithm to hierarchical simulation and
incremental compilation is being explored.
