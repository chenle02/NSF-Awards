This grant is for participation in the conference "Type
Theory,&lt;br/&gt;Homotopy Theory and Univalent Foundations", at the Centre
de&lt;br/&gt;Recerca Matematica in Barcelona (Spain), September 23-27,
2013.&lt;br/&gt;The grant will enable selected mathematicians affiliated with
U.S.&lt;br/&gt;institutions to participate in the conference. The
allocation&lt;br/&gt;of funds will favor graduate students, postdocs, junior
faculty,&lt;br/&gt;and faculty with no current NSF
support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic of the conference are the recent
connections&lt;br/&gt;discovered between type theory and homotopy theory based
on the&lt;br/&gt;interpretation of identity types as path spaces.
These&lt;br/&gt;connections provide a new topological intuition that
facilitates&lt;br/&gt;working with type theories and allow for new computational
tools&lt;br/&gt;for manipulating homotopy-theoretic structures.
Furthermore,&lt;br/&gt;Voevodsky's Univalent Foundations program provides a
solid&lt;br/&gt;logical basis for the practice of identifying
isomorphic&lt;br/&gt;structures, common throughout mathematics even if it is
not&lt;br/&gt;allowed by standard set-theoretic
foundations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic of the conference has an unusually
wide impact since&lt;br/&gt;it involves several areas: mathematical logic,
theoretical&lt;br/&gt;computer science, homotopy theory and category theory.
In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the developments offer a new perspective
on&lt;br/&gt;computer-assisted formalization of mathematical proofs
and&lt;br/&gt;verification of their correctness, which promises to benefit
all&lt;br/&gt;mathematical endeavor, and further influence on design
of&lt;br/&gt;programming languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web page:
