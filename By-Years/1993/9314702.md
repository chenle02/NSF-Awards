9314702 Maple This award is for support of the "International Conference On
Strongly Correlated Electron Systems," to be held in La Jolla, CA, on August
16-19, 1993. The funds will be used to provide travel stipends for young
scientists. The conference, to be held at the University of California at San
Diego, is jointly sponsored by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the National
High Magnetic Field Laboratory, and the Institute for Pure and Applied Physical
Sciences. The conference addresses a major research area in modern condensed
matter physics and materials science with topics ranging from mixed valence
systems to heavy fermions and high temperature superconductivity. NSF funding is
being provided jointly by the Condensed Matter Physics Program and the Materials
Theory Program. %%% ***
