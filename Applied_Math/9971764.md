NONLINEAR SURFACE WAVES ON WATER OF FINITE DEPTH

Shu-Ming Sun

The project concerns nonlinear capillary-gravity waves on water of finite
depth. By ``water'', it means that an incompressible, inviscid fluid with
constant density is moving under the influence of the gravity with surface
tension on the free surface and the flow is irrotational. The proposed research
focuses on the mathematical theory of nonlinear capillary-gravity waves on water
bounded by a rigid horizontal bottom and a free surface. It consists of two
parts. The first part intends to give a mathematical proof of the existence of
three-dimensional propagating waves bifurcating from a two-dimensional solitary
wave with large surface tension. The second part deals with the motion of
capillary-gravity waves on the free surface of water in a two-dimensional
rectangular region.

The theory of water waves plays a crucial role in the development of fluid
mechanics. Apart from being important in various branches of engineering and
applied sciences, many water-wave phenomena happen in every-day experience.
Waves generated by ships in rivers or reservoirs and waves generated by wind or
earthquakes in oceans are probably the most familiar examples. This work focuses
on certain wave motions on the free surface of water in oceans or reservoirs and
intends to give some conditions for generating certain kinds of waves and obtain
the large-time behavior of these waves. The results obtained from this research
may present explanations of some natural phenomena, such as wave propagation in
oceans generated by earthquakes, and provide descriptions of some wave motions
in reservoirs that can be observed. Such understanding of those wave motions in
oceans or reservoirs can be used to predict certain natural phenomena for
preventing human disasters caused by them as well as benefiting from them, such
as generating more electricity.
