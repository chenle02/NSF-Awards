TX 760543219 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Life Sciences Title: Physiology
Laboratory Exercises with Interactive Computer- Enhanced Instruction Computer-
enhanced instruction in the physiology laboratory exercises is being employed to
determine: (1) if computer-enhanced instruction improves mastery of the material
covered, (2) what student attitudes are towards the use of computer applications
versus conventional laboratories, and (3) if student dropout rates are affected
by this new approach. The student audience includes non-science and allied
health majors, with women comprising 78% of this population. A three-pronged
approach to laboratory instruction is being employed: (1) Standard hands-on
laboratories of a conventional type, (2) Mixtures of hands-on laboratories and
interactive multimedia software, and (3) Computer-enhanced laboratories.
Intelitool and A.D.A.M software is being employed with IBM compatible computers.
Results of the project will be reported at the Texas Junior College Teacher
Association Convention and to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board in
Austin, Texas. Information will also be disseminated by the publication of a
scholarly paper. Evaluation will primarily be based on data collected on-line
from statistically proven questionnaires administered over the length of the
project.
