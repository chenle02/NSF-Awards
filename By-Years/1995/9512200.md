This grant will provide equipment for enlarging the capabilities of the FIREFLY
Free Electron Laser at Stanford University. This includes beam handling, beam
conditioning, optical detection, data acquisition, and fast optical switching of
the infrared beam. This will allow a broad class of experiments in condensed
matter and surface physics by the user community.
