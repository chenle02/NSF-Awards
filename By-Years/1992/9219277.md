The goal of this project is to define the biochemistry of the anaerobic
O-demethylation (AOD) reaction in Acetobacterium woodii, a homoactogenic
bacterium. Initial studies will be undertaken to identify the product(s) of the
reaction. To accomplish this, demethylation enzyme(s) will be partially purified
to minimize interference by other competing cellular reactions that may act to
modify the test substrate and/or transform reaction product(s), thereby
obscuring the chemistry of the demethylation reaction itself. Currently, little
is understood about A. woodii AOD, except that O-demethylation is stimulated by
exogenous tetrahydrofolate (THF) and by ATP. To begin the understand the
chemistry of the reaction, we will first identify reaction product(s) formed in
the presence of THF and determine if other low-potential reductants also serve
to stimulate the reaction. Our studies will continue on to determine the role
played by ATP in O- demethylation. If time permits, and if it appears warranted,
we will attempt to purify O-demetylation pathway proteins to homogeneity. To
begin to learn about the regulation of the pathway, we will also initate studies
to screen for transposon- generated AOD regulatory mutants cells. %%% Aromatic
compounds containing O-methyl ethers are abundant in foods and wood processing
wastes. The first step in biodegradation of these compounds is removal of their
methyl group by the O- demethylation enzyme. The reaction has already been
studied in aerobic organisms where it uses oxygen as a reactant. The mechanism
of action of the analogous enzyme is not understood in anaerobic bacteria, where
oxygen is not used. It is important that we understand how this anaerobic
reaction also operates, because a major part of the earth's biosphere is
anaerobic. For example, important anaerobic environments include the digestive
tracts of animals, fresh water and marine sediments, and man-made anaerobic
digestors. In our research program, we plan to determine how the mechanism of
anaerobic O-demethylation (AOD) operates in Acetobacterium woodii, a common
anaerobic bacterium. The results gained from our study will contribute to
understanding the natural anaerobic process. In addition, we may discover ways
to engineer the O-demethylation reaction in these anaerobic bacteria, and then
use it commercially for the conversion of renewable biomass waste material and
for the production of industrially useful products.
