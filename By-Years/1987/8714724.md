The International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS) is
sponsored by the Computer Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers, IEEE. For the last four years, the ICDCS has been held in the United
States. This year the Seventh ICDCS will be held at the International Congress
Center in Berlin, West Germany, during September 21-25, 1987. Twenty American
Scientist and Engineers will participate in the Conference. Their attendance
will increase the level of information exchange and cooperation with European,
Australian, African, and Asian researchers. The Conference is a milestone for
examining the state of the art at the international level and outlining the
future technical developments in all aspects (theory, design, and
implementation) of distributed computing systems. The Conference Proceedings
will be published by the Computer Society of the IEEE and selected papers of
exceptional merit and interest will be considered for publication in the major
IEEE journals. This is a very important conference which should have the
participation of American Scientist and Engineers. The subject areas are
especially relevant to scientific research supported by the Foundation.
