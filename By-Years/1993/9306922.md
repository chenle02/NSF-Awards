The specific aim of this research planning grant for women is to identify and
subsequently characterize cytochrome P450 enzymes expressed during murine
embryonic development. This will be accomplished initially by screening tissue
sections of mouse embryos using in situ hybridization and radiolabeled probes
encoding known P450 enzymes. Probes that hybridize specifically will be used to
characterize the temporal pattern and cellular sites of expression of P450
transcripts during embryogenesis. Identification of specific hybridizing
transcripts will be accomplished using techniques such polymerase chain
reaction, molecular cloning and sequencing. Once cloned, endogenous P450
transcripts can be expressed in host cells and the functional activities of
specific murine P450 gene products can be characterized. The purpose for
carrying out these studies is to identify chemicals produced by embryos that are
important in regulating normal developmental processes. It is proposed that the
production and degradation of such regulatory compounds involves members of a
large family of enzymes known as cytochrome P450 which metabolize a wide range
of chemical compounds in almost every tissue of the body. By utilizing a
plethora of available molecular tools to study P450 enzymes, it should be
possible to identify and then to characterize the functional activities of those
P450 enzymes expressed during embryogenesis. This knowledge will provide
considerable insight into which endogenous compounds or chemicals are produced
by embryos and what role they might play in regulating normal fetal development.
