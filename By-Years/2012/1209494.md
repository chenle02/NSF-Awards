This action funds Brett Maurer of Virginia Tech to conduct a research project,
entitled "Improving predictions of earthquake-induced soil liquefaction damage,"
during the summer of 2012 at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New
Zealand. The host scientist is Professor Misko Cubrinovski.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the development of a reliable
index for evaluating the damage potential of earthquake-induced soil
liquefaction. The index is being developed from the truly unique data available
from the 2010-2011 Canterbury, New Zealand earthquakes and will facilitate
future liquefaction hazard evaluations around the world. Facilitated by
excellent ground motion recordings, thorough soil characterization data, and
detailed documentation of liquefaction induced damage, the Canterbury
earthquakes present a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of the
risk to the built environment from liquefaction.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
