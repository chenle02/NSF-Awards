titled Time Travelers: Rediscovering the Past. This eight part series will
present in compelling terms the recent scientific innovations in archeology and
how new techniques have added startling insights into past civilizations. The

Worlds; Great Spirits; Scribes and Subscriptions; The Artisan; Power and
Prestige; The Hearth; Realms of the Maya; and Collapse. A major traveling museum
exhibition will parallel the series and a trade book will be developed. The
