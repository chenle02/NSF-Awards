This award to the University of California at Berkeley supports the work of
Professor Jeffrey R. Long, Department of Chemistry, aimed at the synthesis and
characterization of expanded clusters using multinuclear cyanometalates as
building blocks to make open frame and microporous materials. These clusters
prepared by solution chemistry, after dehydration will result in porous
materials with large void volumes and without loss of structural integrity.
Cluster-cores with edge-bridged octahedral geometry will be prepared from
cobalt, zirconium and other metal chlorides with boron or beryllium for
potential applications in ion exchange reactions, porous magnets and chemical
sensors. In addition, inclusion properties of pores will be modified for
specific applications. Students involved in this project will learn advanced
synthetic methods and will gain interdisciplinary experience in chemistry,
materials, and physics relevant to nanoscience and engineering.

Porous clusters with large void spaces, open-framework and microporous solids
will be robust and reusable. These clusters may be functionalized with inclusion
groups for different applications such as ion exchange reactions, porous magnets
for separations, and sensors for volatile organic compounds. In addition,
students involved in the project will gain experience in solid state and
inorganic chemistry.
