The focus of this research is the use of chiral alkylation strategy using
2-trifyloxy esters for the synthesis of amino acid derivatives and peptide
isosteres. A second area of pursuit will be the use of the concept of
differential reactivity to prepare densely functionalized molecules without the
use of extensive protection-deprotection schemes. Third, 2-nosyloxy-3-keto
esters will be used to develop methodology for the preparation of spiroketal
lactones. The thrust of the total project is to afford efficient methods for the
synthesis of molecules having interesting biological properties. With this
renewal awrad. the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Robert V. Hoffman of the department of Chemistry at New Mexico State University.
Professor Hoffman will focus his work on developing methods for the
enantioselective synthesis of amino acid derivatives, peptides, peptide
isosteres and densely functionalized compounds. Finding improved methods for the
preparation of these classes of materials is desireable due to the potential for
discovering interesting bioactivity.
