The decay of 87 Rb to 87 Sr results in increasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in the rock
matrix, which is recorded by garnet as it grows. We have shown that variations
of 87 Sr/86 Sr within single crystals of garnet can be measured to high enough
precision to determine rates of growth of the garnets. The time resolution by
this method was of about 2.5 million years due to the relatively low Rb/Sr of
the schist matrix from which the garnets grew. With renewal we plan to extend
the use of the method and continue to make improvements in sampling and
measurement techniques. We should be able to improve the time resolution by at
least a factor of 10 by focusing on rocks with higher Rb/Sr ratios and by
improving our understanding of Sr isotope redistribution during metamorphism.
Our observations have resulted in the first measured rate of a prograde
tectonometamorphic process. We now want to extend application of our method to
geological problems of regional extent in western New England and to test some
samples from the eastern and central Alps toward a similar goal.
