A coordinated theoretical and observational program to study the relation
between hydrodynamic and particle acceleration processes in extended radio
sources will be carried out. This program is a scientific and technical
extension of past research which has contributed significantly to the empirical
and physical understanding of compact and extended radio sources. A new class of
numerical simulations will be carried out, in which results of microphysics
calculations of particle acceleration in shocks and turbulence will be
incorporated, for the first time, into state-of-the-art hydrodynamical
simulations. The goals of the simulations include a better understanding of
particle acceleration in astrophysical contexts as well as improved insight into
the relationships between radio source surface brightness and the internal
dynamics of the sources. The observational program will study the dependence of
synchrotron emissivity on the inferred pressures in extended radio source
shocks, and will let scientists search for and examine other features expected
from the simulations. A unique view of the dynamics/emissivity relation will be
produced through observations of the evolution of knots in the Cassiopeia A
supernova remnant.
