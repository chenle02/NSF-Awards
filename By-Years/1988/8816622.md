This is a collaborative project to investigate the deformation of sheet
silicates, principally the common micas, by means of triaxial deformation
experiments designed to measure the critically resolved shear stresses required
for (001) dislocation glide at temperatures to 700oC and pressures to 400 MPa,
combined with microstructural (optical and electron microscopy) and
micorchemical (electron microprobe and IR absorption) studies to determine the
principal slip directions and their dependencies upon crystal chemistry and
struecture. The determination of the stress-strain relations of micas will have
direct applications to yield envlopes constructed the continental lithosphere,
to the mechanisms of strain localization along ductile shear zones and brittel
faults, and to mica-bearing metamorphic tectonites. In addition, this study
should lead to a deeper understanding of dislocation glide in minearls, as it is
influenced by signicicant changes in crystal chemistry and structure within a
single mineral group.
