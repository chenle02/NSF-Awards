This project will develop an artificial neural network control system for biped
locomotion. The intended application is the restoration of locomotion in
individuals with neuromotor impairments. The control system will specifically
address the problem of adaptively controlling cyclic movements in multi-
segmented systems using electrically stimulated muscles as actuators.
Characteristic features of vertebrate neuromotor locomotion control systems will
be incorporated into this neural network control system. This research is
important since the results may be useful in Functional Neuromuscular
Stimulation rehabilitative devices that provide electrically stimulated walking
in spinal cord injury, stroke and head injury patients.
