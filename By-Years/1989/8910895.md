This engineering research equipment grant is for the acquisition of a lapping
machine and an interference contrast microscope to be used in surface finishing
studies on ceramics. The acquired equipment will be used in specific studies
directed at: (a) investigating the residual stresses and the near surface
dislocations on lapped/polished ceramic surfaces; (b) characterizing the plastic
deformation induced changes in the near surface electromagnetic properties such
as permeability, magnetostriction, and refractive index in lapped/polished
ceramics; (c) developing ultra-fine abrasive finishing, chemical finishing, and
mechano-chemical polishing processes; and (d) modeling of lapping and polishing
processes to predict the nature of the surface cracking, the residual stress
distribution, and interface temperatures. The ultimate goal of the research is
the generation of up to atomically smooth ceramic surfaces with the desired
surface quality.
