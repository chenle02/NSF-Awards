The goal of this project is to improve the breadth and balance of educational
experiences and to increase students' experimental proficiencies within a group
of existing undergraduate Microbiology courses. The acquisition of temperature-
programmable gas-liquid chromatographic equipment is faciliating the laboratory
introduction of important concepts, principles, and procedures which previously
could only be described in the lecture portion of these courses. The
incorporation of educational experiences utilizing the newly acquired equipment
is consistent with the Microbiology Department faculty's intent to introduce
students to conventional analytical procedures in Microbiology, and to emphasize
their value in the development of knowledge in these areas. The result should be
graduates who are much better prepared for graduate studies or for employment in
biotechnical positions.
