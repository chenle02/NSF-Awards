This study will concentrate on the effects of oxygen-derived free radicals.
These oxidants are generated not only by lonizing radiation but also by normal
aerobic metabolism in almost all cells. They have been implicated as causes of
mutations, cancer, aging and of tissue damage associated with inflammation. This
proposal will focus on a specific multigene system in Escherichia coli that is
induced by compounds that generate superoxide. This global response includes the
genes for the DNA repair enzyme endonuclease IV, for a superoxide dismutase, and
for glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase, all of which are positively regulated at
a transcriptional level by soxR and soxS, newly discovered genes that have been
cloned, mapped and sequenced in this laboratory. The soxRS region will be
transcriptionally mapped and tested for exogenous and endogenous regulation.
Existing mutations will be sequenced and additional specific ones produced if
needed. The proteins will be purified and their effect will tested in vitro on
the transcription of one of the target genes, that for endonuclease IV (nfo). In
the likely event that one or both or the proteins bind on the nfo promoter
region, then the contact points will be identified via footprinting, in vitro
modification of the DNA, sequencing of promoter-constitutive mutations, and a
survey of target sites in other genes. Physical studies of the purified proteins
will center around possible proteins-proteins and protein-nucleic acid
interactions, conformational changes accompanying activation, and the function
of four close cysteines in soxR. Posttranscriptional control will be explored by
connecting the nfo (endonuclease IV) target gene to foreign promoters and
possible feedback loops will be examined by measuring nfo transcription and
translation in cells with different copy numbers of the gene. If the entire
system cannot be reconstructed in vitro, then additional genes in this pathway
will be sought through mutation, employing gene fusions as indicators. //
