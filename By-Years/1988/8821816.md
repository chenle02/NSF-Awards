This award supports a vertebrate paleontological investigation to increase
knowledge of the composition and biostratigraphy of Campanian and Maestrichtian
terrestrial faunas of the North Slope, Alaska. Collecting in the Big Bend-Ocean
Point area will provide: 1) more material for a thorough systematic analysis of
the common hadrosaurid, 2) taphonomic data for an evaluation of the fidelity
with which the bone bed reflects the composition of the fauna, and 3) specimens
for a study of the processes of fossilization that apparently involved little
permineralization. Results of these studies will promote investigations of
possible modes of adaptation of vertebrates to the rigors of environments at
high northern latitudes and patterns of intercontinental dispersal of
terrestrial vertebrates between North America and Asia.
