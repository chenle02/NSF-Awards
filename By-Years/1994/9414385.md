9414385 Srienc This project is on research to study the dynamics of eukaryotic
cell populations at the single cell level using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
murine hybridomas as eukaryotic model systems. Flow cytometry techniques have
been developed which permit experimental determination of the rate, transition,
and partitioning functions for balanced growth conditions. These fundamental
physiological functions, in combination with population balance equations,
rigorously describe the growth dynamics of cell populations. This approach will
now be extended to evaluate how these functions depend on environmental growth
parameters, such as concentrations of specific nutrients, with the aim to better
understand transient growth situations in a bioreactor. Also, this project will
focus on experimental determination of the relationship between single-cell
growth rates and single-cell rates of nutrient consumption and product
formation. ***
