9701834 Shepherd This research planning grant will put in place the foundations
for developing a knowledge-based model to evaluate the effectiveness and
reliability of water shortage response plans during a drought. It will follow a
threepart research strategy to : a) formalize the expertise of water agency
personnel to evaluate drought response strategies; b) determine the timing and
phasing of drought response plans to minimize adverse impacts from water
shortages; and c) develop a knowledge-based model for testing and refining plans
for drought and water shortages. The expected products include new methods for
evaluating and improving drought response plans, a peer-reviewed journal article
and the preparation and submission of a full proposal to NSF. ***
