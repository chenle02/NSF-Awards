The most promising area to detect long range forces and the Casimir effect lies
in electromagnetic interactions. However, the hope of observing this interaction
between a pair of atoms is extremely small. Recent precision experiments on the
fine structure of helium Rydberg states has given rise to the hope of observing
the Casimir interaction between the highly excited electron and the core atom
even though for the states studied experimentally, the Rydberg electron is not
quite in the asymptotic region where the Casimer effect manifests itself in a
pronounced way. A thorough relativistic quantum field theoretic evaluation of
the two photon exchange potential in the electron- ion interaction for all
distances beyond a few Bohr radii has been carried out recently, and a variety
of corrections comparable to the Casimir effect have been estimated. An accurate
verification of the Casimir effect seems to be within reach of both theory and
experiment. In this proposal, The principal investigator describes recent
progress made and plans to improve on the calculations and extend the
investigation to a variety of systems of interest.
