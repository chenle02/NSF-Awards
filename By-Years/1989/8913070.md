This dissertation research will study how Islamic people living in the Southern
Philippines use the concepts and values of their Islamic heritage to deal with
each other on a daily basis. The student will live in a village for a year and
observe Islamic court cases as well as daily activities. Methods include
participant observation, structured interviewing, and the analysis of public
documents such as court proceedings. This research is important because Islam is
a powerful force in many areas of the world that are important to U.S.
interests. Frequently the actions of Islamic peoples seem incomprehensible to
Westerners; therefore we need studies such as the present one to explain the
role of Islamic beliefs in influencing daily behavior and conflict resolution.
