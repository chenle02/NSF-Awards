This project focuses on shoring up the security vulnerabilities that exist in
computer processors. Just like in software, bugs in hardware present
vulnerabilities that can be exploited by determined attackers. Prior work has
developed a method whereby the processor monitors itself and sends an alert to
software whenever dangerous, anomalous behavior is observed. The question of
what constitutes dangerous behavior is an open one, and tackling it is the goal
of this research. In doing so the project has the potential to make self-
monitoring processors practical and efficacious, significantly advancing the
state of the art in protecting hardware from malicious
attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The self-monitoring processor works by encoding in
hardware the properties that a processor should always maintain and then
throwing an exception to software if one of the properties is ever violated. In
this project, the researchers develop a semi-automated methodology and tool-
chain to identify and build the security-critical properties encoded in a
hardware design language. The project uses a set of already-patched bugs of a
processor design to automatically create an initial set of security-critical
properties, and machine learning techniques to infer an additional set of
properties that are not tied to any particular known vulnerability, yet are
critical to security.
