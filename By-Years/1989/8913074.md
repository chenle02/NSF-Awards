In this proposal the notion of "voltage collapse" associated with large-scale
electric power system dynamics is explored. While there has been significant
research done during the past few years on the static voltage instability
problem, the dynamic problem is only now beginning to emerge in analysis. The
premise here is that while static indicators are important it is only through an
understanding of the dynamics that effective control measures against collapse
can be derived. This proposal contains three main ideas. First, any
understanding of voltage dynamics requires a relevant load model. An accurate
first principle dynamic load model is difficult if not impossible to achieve. A
neural network based model trained on dynamic load data as a substitute for the
impossible task of writing the load differential equations is proposed. The
second idea is to modify the minimum singular value static performance index to
include dynamic phenomena. The third idea is to extend a center manifold dynamic
voltage collapse model to general slowly time-varying multi-parameter systems.
