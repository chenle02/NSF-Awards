This project provides logistical support only for NASA Wallops Flight Facility
personnel to continue flying balloon borne ozonesondes from Palmer Station,
Antarctica, as was done in 1987 and 1988. The purpose is to study the formation
of the annual antarctic ozone hole, particularly the development of the vertical
profile. It is expected that the project will continue for two more years. The
researchers are fully supported by NASA.
