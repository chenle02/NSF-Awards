The Melanoplinae make up the most diverse group of grasshoppers on the North
American. In this subfamily, there are 606 species in 43 genera, including the
very diverse genus Melanoplus, with 273 species placed in 31 species groups and
an additional 83 species not currently placed in any group. The goal of this
project is to produce a comprehensive and dynamic taxonomic treatise of the
Melanoplinae of North America and Mexico. This synthetic work will complement
previous treatises on the grasshoppers of North America (The Grasshoppers of
North America series Vol I and II; Otte 1981 and 1984) and will provide a
foundation for future genetic and phylogenetic studies that will inevitably
increase our understanding of the relationships among this diverse group. In
turn, this resource will encourage and promote scientific studies that use
grasshoppers to understand evolutionary, ecological and environmental processes.
Broder Impact of this project include outreach to the public and K-12 students,
as well as museum exhibits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Grasshoppers of North
America Vol. III. Melanoplinae will 1) provide a thorough and updated taxonomic
treatment of known species and species groups, summarize information on their
ecologies, and update maps of their geographical distributions, 2) provide
illustrations of diagnostic characteristics and produce identification keys to
the major species groups, and 3) produce a dynamic on-line resource on
Orthoptera Species File that will be updated and responsive to future taxonomic
discoveries, revisions, and systematic works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
