The objective of this research is to develop a new manufacturing technique for
nanoscale devices and molecular interconnections with the potential for
producing self-aligned ten-nanometer-scale metal structures with spacings
controlled at the nanometer scale. The approach is to use electron-beam
evaporation through a stencil mask onto a semiconductor or other substrate. The
stencil mask is translated with respect to the substrate with nanometer
precision between evaporations of dissimilar materials. The materials are
selected to have dissimilar etch chemistry such that upon subsequent etching one
of the materials is removed. The remaining material has a size determined by the
difference between the two patterns. This process is termed difference-defined
nanofabrication. Since commercial nanopositioners can perform translations with
one-nanometer precision, difference-defined nanofabrication allows feature size
control at the single-nanometer level. Difference-defined nanofabrication is an
inherently clean, organic-free technique. The capabilities of this approach will
be demonstrated through the development of a nanoelectromechanical tunneling
transistor and electrical test structures for molecules.

The societal benefits of this research are in the advancement of nanotechnology.
Nanotechnology takes many forms and will be broadly applied in health care,
homeland security, and information technology applications, creating new jobs in
manufacturing and service in the United States. The research undertaken here
promotes the development of new ways to form solid state, molecular, and
bioelectronic devices and sensors and to make electrical connections at the
molecular scale. Success in this effort will accelerate the ability of
researcher to construct devices at the nanometer scale.
