9452191 Dorwin The project is to develop and improve two courses in underwater
archaeology. One course focuses on classroom work involving background, and
theory and technologies of underwater archaeology. The second course emphasizes
field work and conservation laboratory techniques and experience. Also, the
field work takes place in two locations, Lake Michigan and the White River at
Conner Prairie near Noblesville, Indiana. Currently, students work on shipwrecks
in Lake Michigan and excavate trade goods lost in the White River at the landing
associated with the Conner Trading Post (1802-1823).
