0821302&lt;br/&gt;Tomascak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant will support acquisition a quadrupole
detection inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (quad ICP-MS) to allow
for high precision trace element analysis of digested minerals, rocks, soils and
sediments, natural waters and plant material. The quad ICP-MS would support a
range of research across the Departments of Geology, Chemistry and Biology at
SUNY-Oswego including: geochemical investigations of migmatite and granite
petrogenesis; investigations of paleoredox conditions associated with marine and
lake sedimentation based on trace metal proxies; experimental studies of the
effects of trace metals on insulin biochemistry; and studies of the
phytoremediation potential of wetland vegetation for sequestering heavy metals
in soils and waters. SUNY-Oswego is a non-Ph.D. granting institution. The ICP-MS
will afford undergraduate and M.S. students the opportunity to gain hands-on
experience with state-of the-art techniques for high precision elemental
analysis of natural materials. The PIs intend to incorporate ICP-MS lab
exercises in a number of courses, one of which would include heavy metal
analysis of drinking water samples retrieved from the Democratic Republic of
Congo, where current public use of polluted water supplies is associated with
high infant mortality. Co-PI Kadima intends to work with the government of the
Congo to improve public water use practices based on analysis of experimental
data obtained with the requested ICP-MS.
