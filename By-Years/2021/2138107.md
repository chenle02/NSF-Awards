Daniel Vallejo is awarded a FY21 Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending
Postdoctoral Research (NSF MPS-Ascend) Fellowship to conduct a program of
research and activities related to broadening participation by groups
underrepresented in Chemistry at Georgia Tech. The project being performed by
Daniel Vallejo, entitled Triboelectric Nanogenerator Ion Mobility-Mass
Spectrometry for Studying Cultural Heritage Materials, is to be conducted under
the guidance of mentoring scientist Facundo M. Fern√°ndez. This project is
supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project
examines a new approach for analyzing the chemical constituents of cultural
heritage materials based on the coupling of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)
ion source with ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS). The approach minimizes
sample consumption compared with traditional mass-selective methods of analysis,
while also distinguishing structural differences of protein binding agents in
paints and other cultural heritage materials that could not be identified using
mass spectrometry alone. The research plan includes a systematic
characterization of protein structure and stability in simulated samples, as
well as development of a new database for compiling data that are relevant to
the community. The broader impacts of the project include the importance of
cultural heritage materials and the likelihood that studying these materials
will broaden participation in STEM research by engaging students from diverse
backgrounds. Activities supported by this project also bring together scientists
and conservators at the intersection of science and cultural heritage
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
