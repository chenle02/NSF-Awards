ABSTRACT Babcock, Linda C. Carnegie-Mellon University SBR-9409723 The PI
proposes to investigate the role of uncertainty in causing self-serving biases
which lead, in turn, to bargaining impasses. In the proposed study both field
data and experimental manipulations will be used to investigate this issue.
First, educators will be surveyed concerning their reservation values in a
hypothetical labor dispute. Ambiguity will be manipulated by varying the range
of salaries of other school districts. Second, teachers will be asked in the
survey what is the geographical area they use in deciding which neighboring
school districts are proper bases of comparison for salary determinations. A
geographic information system and archival data will be used to investigate the
relation between the characteristics of these comparison districts and teacher
negotiation behavior. The general hypothesis in this investigation is that
ambiguity, defined as variance in comparison group salaries, leads to fewer
successfully negotiated settlements.
