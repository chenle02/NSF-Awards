This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University in the purchase
of a parallel computational facility using IBM SP1. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including the following: the development and
application of parallel computational software in electronic structure theory,
surface dynamics and statistical mechanics, and scattering theory. A workstation
network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the
computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a "computer network" also serves
as a development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides
state-of-the- art graphics and visualization facilities and supports research in
state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing.
