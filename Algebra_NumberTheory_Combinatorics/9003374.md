This research is concerned with integral extensions of noncommutative rings.
The principal investigator will determine if an algebra, with a Hopf algebra
action, is integral over the invariant subring. He will also examine when a
smash product is integral over the coefficient ring. These results and
techniques will be used to study the prime spectra of the rings involved. This
project is in the general area of ring theory. A ring is an algebraic object
having both an addition and a multiplication defined on it. These objects arise
naturally in various branches of mathematics, physics and computer science.
