The project explores the geometry and topology of three-dimensional hyperbolic
manifolds, those which admit a Riemannian metric with negative sectional
curvatures. Some of the most fundamental questions about hyperbolic 3-manifolds
concern the extent to which their properties are inherited in, or, conversely,
may develop among covering spaces of finite degree. The famous virtual Haken and
virtual fiberering conjectures answer this description, for example, as do the
questions below. Given a hyperbolic 3-manifold with a special topological
property, for instance a knot complement, with how many others that have this
same property does it share a finite-degree cover? Or for a fixed hyperbolic
3-manifold M and a family of finite-degree covers {M_n}, does the rank of the
fundamental group of M_n grow linearly with the covering degree? This relates to
the fixed price question in the study of topological dynamics. The PI intends to
continue his attacks on these and other questions, such as the possibility of
embedding in right-angled Artin groups. He will also further describe the
topology of hyperbolic manifolds with low volume.

The objects of study here, 3-manifolds, are spaces which look, in a
neighborhood of each point, like the familiar three-dimensional space in which
we live. Although their definition allows quite a bit of flexibility,
3-manifolds share with 2-manifolds (surfaces) the property that each admits a
unique best metric, a way of measuring the distance between two points in the
space. This property of low-dimensional manifolds, known in dimension 3 as
Thurston's geometrization conjecture and proven recently by V. Perelman, has
motivated an enormous body of work that uses geometry as a tool for
understanding 3-manifolds, and the project follows this broad theme. The study
of 3-manifolds has benefited from its interaction with many different fields of
mathematics, and the project additionally draws from questions and techniques in
the study of topological dynamics, geometric flows, geometric group theory, and
others. The project will help us better understand the classification of
3-manifolds and the relationships between them. This in turn has applications in
such diverse fields as cosmology (in determining the shape of the universe, for
example), biology (in understanding the knotting of DNA), and computer science
(through connections with families of graphs that certain families of
3-manifolds coarsely resemble), among others.
