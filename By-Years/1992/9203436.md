The principal investigator will extend the modeling of gene amplification to
situations in which there is new experimental evidence. Some of the aspects of
gene amplification to be considered are integration of extrachromosomal
fragments, unequal chromatid exchange, and variable length of repeats in
telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. The mathematical models to be used will
include branching processes and random walks. The models will be used to
estimate the probabilities and transition rates of the events. The principal
investigator will develop new mathematical models in genetics. The goals of this
work will be to test if mathematical models based on previously proposed
informal biological models are sufficient to reproduce experimental observations
in quantitative detail, to provide a better understanding of the molecular
processes, and to suggest new experiments which would be informative.
