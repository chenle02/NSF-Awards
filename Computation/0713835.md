The research in this project is based on the recent discovery of the PIs that
numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations can be based on variational
formulations that use function spaces where the divergence free condition is
enforced. This is made possible by combining classical nonconforming finite
elements for incompressible fluid flows and techniques from discontinuous
Galerkin methods. In this new approach the boundary value problems of the time-
harmonic (frequency-domain) Maxwell's equations are solved as elliptic problems,
and the performance of the new nonconforming finite element methods for both the
source (deterministic) problem and the eigenproblem (cavity resonance problem)
is comparable to the performance of classical finite element methods for
computational mechanics. In particular the discrete eigenvalues have neither
spurious modes nor nonphysical zero eigenvalues. The proposed research will
design and analyze many novel schemes for the Maxwell equations and the Maxwell
eigenproblem using this new approach. Fast solvers (multigrid and domain
decomposition methods) and adaptive algorithms will also be developed, with
applications to related electromagnetic problems.

The results of the proposed research will provide powerful computational tools
for the design and analysis of electromagnetic devices such as antennas, radar
sensors, waveguides, photonic crystals, magnetoresistive sensors and particle
accelerators, with applications to diverse areas such as telecommunications,
integrated optics, lasers, high energy physics, plasma physics, and
nondestructive damage detection.
