A major goal of biology is to identify the processes that shape the evolution of
form and structure. To pursue this important goal, this project will take an
innovative, comparative approach to investigate how evolutionary changes during
limb development (the process by which the limb forms) contribute to the
generation of the divergent limbs of three mammals: bats, opossums, and mice.
The mammal limb is an ideal system with which to pursue this goal because the
way that a mammal feeds, moves and behaves is dependent upon the form of its
limbs. As such, from the wings of bats to the flippers of whales to the hooves
of horses, the diversification of the mammal limb has been crucial to the
ecological and evolutionary success of the group. Through use of traditional and
next generation genetic analyses, this project will identify the specific
changes in gene expression (e.g., when genes are turned on and off, and at what
levels) that initiate and drive the divergence of limb form among mammalian
species. This knowledge will vertically advance our understanding of how the
process of development constrains and facilitates the evolution of certain limb
forms, and thereby impacts mammalian evolution. Furthermore, as humans are
mammals, this project will directly advance our understanding of the processes
that have shaped our own evolutionary history.
