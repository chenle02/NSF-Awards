9419277 Davis This award provides partial funding (33% of total cost) for the
acquisition of a scanning electron microscope system to be installed and
operated in the Department of Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago.
The institution is committed to matching funds for one-third of the costs and
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will provide the remaining
one-third of the funding needed. The new capabilities of a modern scanning
electron microscope will be used to benefit research and education in the areas
of mineral physics, paleontology, stratigraphy, igneous and metamorphic
petrology, geochemistry, cosmochemistry, interstellar grain studies, and studies
of the origin of the elements. ***
