A vertex operator algebra is an algebraic structure that plays an important role
in conformal field theory and string theory in physics. In addition to physical
applications, vertex operator algebras have connections with many branches of
mathematics. Rational vertex operator algebras, which are closely related to
classical objects of symmetry known as Lie algebras, form the most important
class of vertex operator algebras. The proposed research will solve some
fundamental problems concerning rational vertex operator algebras. The research
will lead to important progress in the theory of vertex operator algebras and
its connections with other branches of mathematics and should have applications
in conformal field theory in physics.

This proposal deals with various topics on rational vertex operator algebras.
The proposal consists of four parts. The first part is dedicated to the study of
quantum dimensions. The quantum dimensions, which are analogues of dimensions of
vector spaces, are important invariants of vertex operator algebras. The PI will
use the quantum dimensions and global dimensions to study orbifold theory and
classify the irreducible modules for orbifold vertex operator algebras. The
quantum dimensions will also be used to give a characterization of rational
vertex operator algebras. The second part of the proposal investigates the
relation between the modularity of trace functions and rationality for vertex
operator algebras. The PI will establish that a vertex operator algebra is
rational if and only if the q-characters of the irreducible modules are modular
functions. The third part on mirror extensions suggests a new way to construct
vertex operator algebras which are not simple current extensions in general.
Finally, in the fourth part the PI will give characterizations of the E-series
of the rational vertex operator algebras with central charge 1 and complete the
classification of rational vertex operator algebras with central charge 1.
