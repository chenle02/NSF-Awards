9502015 Wilhelm The proposed research lies in the general area of Riemannian
geometry. More specifically, the proposer wishes to find new examples of
Riemannian manifolds with positive and negative sectional curvature, and to
study various questions related to finiteness theorems; the proposer seeks to
identify Riemannian manifolds by means of values of geometric invariants such as
sectional curvature and packing radius. This project is supported by the NSF's
CAREER program, which emphasizes the development of full and balanced academic
careers including both research and education. The education plan in this
proposal aims to move away from the standard lecture format by having students
give presentations in class and holding group discussions.
