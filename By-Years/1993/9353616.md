NCES is conducting the second cycle of the National Study of Postsecondary
Faculty. The first cycle was conducted in 1988. The study will provide a
national profile of faculty in 4-year (doctoral-granting and other 4-year) and
2-year higher education institutions. Information on the backgrounds,
responsibilities, workloads, salaries, benefits, and attitudes of both full- and
part-time instructional and noninstructional faculty in their many and varied
higher education institutions will be ascertained. Because faculty directly
affect the quality of education in colleges and universities and perform much of
the research and development work upon which the nation's technological and
economic advancement depends, it is essential to understand who they are, what
they do, and whether, how, and why they are changing.
