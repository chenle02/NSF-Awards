This is a project to offer the Forum on Inclusive STEMM Entrepreneurship (FISE),
a novel effort to broaden the participation of underrepresented minority women
in STEMM entrepreneurship and to enhance the diversity of the science and
engineering workforce. Through a convening of educators, entrepreneurs, aspiring
entrepreneurs, industry leaders, investors and policy experts, entrepreneurial
education thought leaders, and inter-sectionality scholars the PI proposes to
use this conference as a platform for building capacity in the preparation and
development of future entrepreneurs from underrepresented groups. The PI also
seeks to contribute to the emerging field of research that bridges tech
entrepreneurship and education policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed forum
has the potential to advance knowledge in the field of entrepreneurship
education and engineering education. Given the dearth of research-based
interventions to broaden participation in tech entrepreneurship, this conference
offers an opportunity for participants to contribute to the leading edge of
research and interventions in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The convening and
associated activities will leverage the social capital of knowledgeable experts
in the academy and industry, investors, entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs
to address critical needs of the nation that relate to enhanced global
competiveness, an improved national economy, and the participation of
underrepresented cohorts in entrepreneurship and commercialization
