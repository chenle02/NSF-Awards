This project deals with the control of discrete-event systems(DES) which are
characterized by event-driven dynamics through which jobs contend for resources.
Typical examples of these systems include production, communication,
transportation and service systems. Since a major objective of DES control is
the coordination of complex interactions among a large number of individually
simple operations, an effective intelligent control can be implemented through a
set of simple distributed rules. This project integrates the concepts from
control of stochastic processes and the analysis of greedy algorithms in
combanitorial optimization. Additional work includes the extensions of monotone
structure to a broader class of DES, an investigation into distributed, token-
based realization of controls, and an examination of the duplication of monotone
structure for supervisory control in deterministic setting, and system stability
in a stochastic setting.*** //
