This proposal for services over 3 years in support of the Division of
Networking and Communications Research and Infrastructure includes: efforts in
the area of architecture analysis and performance evaluation of the lastest
configuration of the NSFNET backbone network; maintenance of timekeeping
services for gateways on the network; and attendance at designated meetings. It
continues the effort begun in a previous NSF grant for services in support of
the foundation's program for supercomputer networks (an earlier configuration of
the NSFNET backbone network). The services provided included: advanced
architecural planning; identification and study of related technical problems;
and performance evaluation and assistance on internetwork configuration and
protocol convergence issues.***
