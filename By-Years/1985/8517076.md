This work will study indepth the factors that influence the formation of snow
drift loads on multilevel roofs. Two type of factors will be examined: the
geometric properties of the building, e.g., ratio of buildings windward face,
ratio of building light to upper roof's length, etc.; environmental factors,
e.g., ground snow load, windspeed during and after snow falls, etc. The
objective of this work is to improve the knowledge related to these factors, to
assess the current state-of-the-art for determining drift loads on multilevel
roofs, and to formulate models for predicting the 50-Year Mean Recurrence
Interval Drift Load. The results of this project will be of use to building
codes and load standards so as to investigate structure failures due to snow
drifts.
