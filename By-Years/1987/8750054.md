The effectiveness of teaching concepts of spectroscopy has been improved by the
Chemistry Department at Samford University through the recent acquisition of a
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. Students are learning NMR
principles and applications of magnetic resonance to chemical structure, first
hand, by obtaining NMR information on different types of compounds and
correlating this data with NMR theory as well as other spectroscopic
information. This results in a composite "picture" of the molecule, and teaches
students how chemical structure can be investigated. The instrument is used
exclusively by undergraduate chemistry majors and minors in a number of
chemistry courses in which a carefully planned group of experiments teach
various aspects of the technique in a logical sequence that builds on what
students have already learned. This equipment complements existing instrumental
holdings and gives the department a more complete arsenal of analytical tools
through which to teach spectroscopic methods.
