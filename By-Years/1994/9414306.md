9414306 Weidner The PI will organize and run a topical workshop to discuss and
refine current earth models based on present data from geodynamics, mineral
physics, and seismology. The workshop will involve participation of interested
researchers from all three communities, and will focus on the criteria needed
for a satisfactory model, assessment of the real constraints provided by seismic
and mineral physics data, and the extent to which such a model should
incorporate lateral heterogeneity. It is anticipated that the conference will
result in the formation of several working groups that may prepare CSEDI
collaborative research proposals for NSF. ****
