9615688 Raviv Supports initial exploration of an analog VLSI design for a novel,
reduced-complexity task specific visual retina. The proposed retina generates
specific quantitative information about imminent threat of collision in real
time, which can be used as a powerful sensory feedback signal in closed-loop
control for autonomous navigation (e.g., collision avoidance) as well as other
tasks. When dealing with a moving camera-based autonomous navigation system, a
huge amount of rapidly varying visual data is captured. Processing all these
data in real time is a difficult task. There is a need to reduce the rapidly
varying video-rate images to a few signals that are relevant to the tasks at
hand. The PI's ongoing research has resulted in identification of several
relevant visual motion cues, one of which is the Visual Threat Cue (VTC). This
cue can be viewed as a mechanism to reduce the vast rapidly changing visual data
to one slowly-changing signal. The proposed retina extracts the VTC in a
singlestage parallel operation. It employs raw gray level data directly to
extract the VTC, i.e., without the need for pre processing such as edge
detection, segmentation, feature tracking, optical flow, etc. Potential
applications include realtime autonomous navigation, aid to visually-impaired
people, behavior-based robotics, and multi-eye agents.
