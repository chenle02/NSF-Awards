9529800 Boitnott Many fundamental bulk properties of rock such as permeability,
electrical resistivity, and elastic constants are highly dependent on details of
the pore structure. Attempts to infer properties such as permeability from
measurements of electrical resistivity and acoustic velocities (common in
borehole geophysics) require a thorough understanding of the inter-relationships
between these and other bulk properties and the underlying pore structure which
controls them. While a number of models have been developed which predict the
inter-relationships between fundamental bulk properties and pore structure,
validation and routine use of these models require a means of making a large
number of diverse measurements on core in a routine fashion. Permeability and
electrical resistivity are two of the most important properties for
understanding pore structure. While laboratory measurement techniques for these
properties are well developed, simultaneous measurement of permeability and
electrical resistivity has been difficult to perform, inhibiting routine and
integrated measurement. In addition, permeability measurement during sample
deformation has been difficult for a number of reasons. Here newly developed
methods for permeability measurement will be applied in order to construct an
apparatus for routine and automated measurement of permeability, specific
storage, electrical resistivity, and deformation. The apparatus and techniques
to be developed here are well suited for routine measurements as well as
experimental studies of pore structure and its relationship to the fundamental
bulk properties of rock. The project has commercial potential in the petroleum
and geotechnical industries and perhaps in the rock-testing service industry.
