9453447 David G. Schatz This research focuses on understanding how vertebrate
organisms change the structure of their DNA, particularly through site specific
recombination. Specifically, the PI will examine the process by which
lymphocytes assemble their antigen receptor genes, studying both the enzymology
and molecular basis of this site specific recombination reaction. This work has
implications beyond immunology, because the PI will analyze what other cell
types besides lymphocytes may make use of such site specific mechanisms to
encode genetic information. In particular, he will also study processes in the
nervous system. Dr. Schatz Proposes to create transgenic mice in which the
expression, but none has been adapted successfully for use in a living mammal.
Such a system would provide a powerful new tool for the study of development and
gene function. Analyses of these mice will provide a variety of insights into
several different biological realms: (1) the immune system; (2) the enzymology
of site specific recombination in vertebrates; (3) the integrity of the genome;
and (4) the discovery of other site specific recombination processes in
vertebrates. These experiments will provide a new vantage point from which to
view the vertebrate genome, the forces that protect it, and the processes that
alter it. ***
