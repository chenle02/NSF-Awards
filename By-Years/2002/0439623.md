Electrical conductivity of minerals is sensitive to temperature and
&lt;br/&gt;defect chemistry (such as the concentration of hydrogen-related
&lt;br/&gt;defects), but less sensitive to major element chemistry or pressure.
&lt;br/&gt;Consequently, a comparison of geophysically inferred electrical
&lt;br/&gt;conductivity with laboratory data will provide important constraints
&lt;br/&gt;on temperature and water content. However, experimental studies on
&lt;br/&gt;the role of hydrogen-related defects on electrical conductivity are
&lt;br/&gt;challenging and very few data are available to provide a basis for
&lt;br/&gt;such studies. To achieve such a goal, the PI and his colleagues have
&lt;br/&gt;recently determined the relation between electrical conductivity and
&lt;br/&gt;water content in wadsleyite and ringwoodite. However, such
&lt;br/&gt;relationship has not been determined experimentally for another
&lt;br/&gt;important mineral, majorite garnet, and consequently, the
&lt;br/&gt;relationship between water content and electrical conductivity in the
&lt;br/&gt;transition zone is uncertain. In this project, an experimental study
&lt;br/&gt;on the role of hydrogen-related defects in the electrical
&lt;br/&gt;conductivity in majorite will be conducted through high-pressure,
&lt;br/&gt;temperature experiments. The results will provide a solid basis for
&lt;br/&gt;inferring water (hydrogen) content and temperature in Earth's
&lt;br/&gt;transition zone.
