The College of Education and the College of Engineering at Auburn University
(AU) propose to develop a comprehensive four part program to enhance physical
science education at the K-12 level. The effort is based on a course entitled
"Engineering Physics for Teachers" newly developed by the two principal
investigators at AU. The course is designed to prepare teachers to meet national
science standards via problem solving using dimensional analysis, appropriate
graphing, logical reasoning and teamwork. The course theme of energy is taken
from the 1995 "Alabama Course of Study: Science" developed by the State of
Alabama Department of Education. Problems, demonstrations, and projects use
energy-related technologies to which the general public can relate. The four
efforts of this project are: (1) to refine and improve the existing course, (2)
to expand the target audience to future and practicing teachers in Birmingham
using real time video link with the University of Alabama at Birmingham, (3) to
develop accompanying resource materials in the form of printed matter and CD-
ROM, (4) to incorporate and integrate resources developed in the course into the
"Science in Motion" van program, a successful state-wide K-12 outreach effort.
The reform is aimed at: (1) providing teachers with information on state-of-the-
art technologies so they can describe 21st century science in their classrooms,
with special emphasis on energy usages in homes and automobiles, (2) integrating
physics, mathematics and engineering with methods of teaching, (3) enhancing
interest in science through projects that involve energy and engineering
concepts, and (4) providing teachers with a systematic approach to quantitative
problem solving. Implementation of the project tasks will benefit both pre-
service and in-service science teachers throughout the state of Alabama.
