AST 0205902&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Wood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set of
interacting binary star systems called cataclysmic variables serves as a
marvelous laboratory to study how astrophysical accretion processes work. In
that group of binaries are a number of broad categories of objects, each
category further divided into classes of objects of different outburst and
quiescence behaviors. Significant amounts of observational effort has been
expended in an attempt to understand the underlying accretion physics in these
systems Now once seemingly intractable computational problems are accessible via
better algorithms and desktop supercomputing with 3-dimensional hydrodynamic
codes, and progress has been made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
advance efforts to model a particular, and for a long-while puzzling, phenomenon
observed in SU Ursa Majoris-type systems: so-called superhumps observed during
especially bright outbursts. The PI has successfully modeled approximate
superhump behavior using his smoothed particle hydrodynamic code in a fully
3-dimensional mode. The superhumps in light curves are true instabilities of
tilted accretion disks. This project will expand the work by adding disk
viscosity due to magnetic fields and creating a grid of light curves and modeled
disks that will be delivered to the astronomy community as an
atlas.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
