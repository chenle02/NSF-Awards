This project is investigating the seasonal fluxes of biogenic volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) from grass and agricultural lands. Biogenic VOCs are important
because they can have a significant influence on tropospheric chemistry and the
formation of photochemical oxidants in the atmosphere. The educational component
of the program includes an outreach component in association with five local
high schools for the collection and analysis of leaf-level samples for use in
making detailed seasonal and regional biogenic VOC emissions estimates for the
area surrounding the Black Hills in South Dakota.
