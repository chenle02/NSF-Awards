This award to the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) proposes a program
which combines formal training in the efficient use of supercomputers with
extended work on a research computing project to prepare undergraduates for a
research career which includes significant amounts of computation. The
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center is one of the five NSF/DASC supercomputer
centers. The program will provide research experience for undergraduates on an
interactive basis with the research scientists at the center. This will
familiarize and educate the students in a wide variety of computer hardware and
software. Program recommends support in the amount of $40,000.//
