This project advances hydrologic science and water resource management by
uniquely leveraging cloud computing for modeling and managing large watershed
systems. The first project task creates a cloud-enabled hydrologic model, the
second project task creates generic cloud-based data processing workflows needed
by hydrologic models and other domains, and the third project task applies the
hydrologic model and data processing workflows to model a large watershed system
at detail and scale to address research questions related to quantifying impacts
of climate change on water resources. This research project addresses
fundamental issues with regard to understanding how a cloud computing paradigm
can and should be used to model hydrologic systems and other scientific
applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has the potential to produce broad
impacts because of the importance of clean water to society, the need for
interdisciplinary education between the hydrologic and computer sciences, and
through the creation of open source software that will extend existing software
provided through the NSF-funded CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System (HIS)
project. This research provides important and timely interdisciplinary training
for a graduate student and a postdoctoral scholar so that they are able to
address complex water resource problems using cutting edge computer science
techniques.
