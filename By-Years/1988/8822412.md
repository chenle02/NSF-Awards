This grant in the Organic Dynamics Program provides the 1988 Alan T. Waterman
Award of the National Science Foundation to Professor Peter G. Schultz of the
University of California at Berkeley. Professor Schultz's recent work has
pioneered new approaches to the study of molecular recognition and catalysis,
and the application of these studies to the design of selective catalysts. This
work, which bridges chemistry and biology, includes the generation of catalytic
antibodies ("abzymes"), the synthesis of hybrid enzymes, and the developmemt of
methods for introducing unnatural amino acid analogs selectively into proteins.
