This NSF CCLI Phase 1 project develops innovative mathematics teaching and
learning videocases based on actual classroom practices, and then are used in
methods courses for preservice high school mathematics teachers. In addition,
the project conducts research on the influence of the cases on preservice
teachers' learning. The High School Mathematics Teaching and Learning Videocases
are defined as records of practice that include video and text documents that
depict actual high school mathematics classroom situations in order to promote
preservice teacher learning through the analysis of issues related to
mathematics, teaching practice, and student thinking. Specifically, the cases
are used to create contexts that facilitate preservice secondary teachers'
development of mathematics knowledge for teaching, understanding of their
implicit assumptions about mathematics, and mathematics teaching and learning
while at the same time broadening their knowledge of the work entailed in
teaching mathematics and supporting students' mathematical thinking.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current research demonstrates the potential of videocases
to foster teachers' ability to attend to student thinking, explore mathematical
concepts, and to develop teachers' professional vision. In addition, in the last
decade there has been a proliferation of case-based materials for teacher
education, primarily aimed at the elementary and middle school levels. There is
a considerable lack, however, of such cases focused specifically on high school
mathematics, grades 9 through 12, and that address educational goals specific to
preservice teacher education. This project contributes to the growing body of
case-based materials for secondary teacher education.
