This research will define the basic mechanisms by which surfactants in marine
waters affect the rate of gas exchange at the air-sea interface. Surfactants
reduce gas exchange by altering the hydrodynamic structure of near-surface
turbulence, and not by the formation of a monomolecular barrier. Reductions in
gas exchange up to 50% have been observed in a variety of samples from synthetic
surfactants to phytoplankton exudates and this reduction occurs under turbulent
flow conditions. This research is aimed at a two step examination of the
chemical and surface properties of surfactants as they relate to gas exchange
processes. First, an experimental model relating the gas exchange coefficient Kw
to the surface dilational modulus , the Schmidt number Sc and the friction
velocity U*w, will be explored in a laboratory wind-wave tank. Second, the
surface and organic chemistry of marine phytoplankton exudates will be described
in relationship to their retarding effect on gas exchange. The overall results
should improve our understanding of how surfactants of biogenic origin influence
physical processes such as gas exchange in the ocean.
