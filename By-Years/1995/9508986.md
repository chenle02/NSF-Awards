9508986 Shores Oxide scales that protect alloys during exposure to high
temperature oxidizing conditions invariably develop stresses which can be large
enough to cause the scale to fracture and spall. Scale origin, magnitude and
evolution with time is not well understood, yet mechanical damage to scales is
often the principal cause of failure. In this work, scale and substrate strains
are measured as a function of time and temperature for two nickel-base alloys.
This tests the hypothesis that stress evolution during oxidation is a dynamic
balance of stress generation resulting from scale growth and stress relaxation
from creep of the metal substrate. The research has several parts: (a) obtain
experimental stress history data to evaluate the extent to which substrate creep
or scale cracking is responsible for stress relaxation; (b) develop a computer
model to account for the evolution of scale stresses in terms of materials
properties and scale growth mechanisms, considering especially stress generation
during isothermal oxidation and stress relaxation by substrate creep; (c) input
to the model experimentally measured stresses and gradients in the scale
thickness direction; (d) characterize scale cracking at measured stresses in
terms of current theories. %%% This research project is important because of an
understanding of the origin of scale stresses. Knowledge of their magnitudes and
evolution with time is necessary to characterize scale cracking and spalling.
Such an understanding can provide a rational design basis for improving the
performance of scales on high temperature alloys. ***
