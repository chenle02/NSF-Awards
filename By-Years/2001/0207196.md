The activities of this proposal are aimed at exploiting the "Forbush decrease",
a region of suppressed cosmic ray density located downstream of coronal mass
ejection (CME) shock fronts, for the purpose of predicting with a lead time of
some 4-8 hours the arrival of a CME at Earth. Muon detectors and neutron
monitors will be utilized to detect the loss-cone anisotropy of energetic
particles which escape from the "Forbush decrease" plasma. From this
information, it is possible to infer useful constraints on the orientation and
extent of solar ejecta. The principal efforts will be to close a coverage gap by
constructing a full-size muon detector at the Southern Space Observatory, in Sao
Martinho, Brazil, and to add features to their website
(www.bartol.udel.edu/~neutronm/) giving real-time graphical displays of cosmic
ray density gradients, angular anisotropies, and bi-directional flows.
