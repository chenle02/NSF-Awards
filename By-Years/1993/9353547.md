9353547 Elizondo University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) proposes to continue its
Materials Research Center of Excellence. The UTEP Materials Research Center of
Excellence is emphasizing interdisciplinary research on the structure,
composition, properties, synthesis, processing, and performance of materials.
The center's goals are: (1) to establish a nationally competitive,
crossdisciplinary university research center in materials science and
engineering, supported by faculty with high levels of expertise and state-of-
the-art equipment and facilities, (2) to develop the university's capabilities
as a doctoral granting institution, and (3) to increase the number of
underrepresented minority scientists and engineers available to the nation in
the field materials science and engineering. The Materials Research Center of
Excellence was established in 1988 with funding from The National Science
Foundation under the Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) Program. The
Center of Excellence is the University's capstone program to attract minority
students to study in science, mathematics, and engineering. The Materials
Research Center of Excellence meets the goals of the MRCE Program especially (1)
to increase the minority presence in science and engineering by making
substantial resources available to upgrade the research capabilities of strong
and productive minority institutions, (2) to allow the institution to continue
the effectiveness of related science and engineering activities for minority
groups in its region, and (3) to provide opportunities for minority faculty and
students at UTEP and nearby institutions to engage in meritorious research that
leads to the publications of refereed journals. ***
