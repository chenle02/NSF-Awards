Polynomials are more than equations, they are functions of complex numbers that
describe motion and change. By repeatedly applying polynomials, one creates
dynamical systems, which may model weather patterns, economics, or ecological
changes. But there are many other functions that describe dynamical systems that
cannot be given by simple formulas, and are therefore much more difficult to
study. By adapting techniques used to study the symmetries of surfaces, the
principal investigator will study the dynamical properties of such functions.
The principal investigator will also continue her outreach efforts with
elementary and middle-school students, undergraduate research, and leadership in
professional development programs for graduate students.

These projects focus on the mapping class group, which is the group of
homeomorphisms of a surface up to homotopy. With a unifying theme of using
techniques from covering space theory and geometric group theory, this agenda
has two broad directions, one dynamical and one algebraic. In the dynamical
direction, the planned research will work towards developing an algorithm to
identify when a branched cover of the sphere is equivalent to a rational
function. The principal investigator and her collaborators have developed an
analogous algorithm for polynomials using techniques from the study of mapping
class groups, and these investigations will adapt the existing algorithm to
certain families of branched covers of the sphere. In the algebraic direction,
the planned research seeks to understand the algebraic structure and
representations of subgroups of the mapping class group that normalize a finite
group action.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
