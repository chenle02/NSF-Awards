9550752 Bauer The Shiprock Campus of Navajo Community College is operated by the
Navajo Nation and serves over 500 students per year in the largest population
center of the Navajo Nation. The College is requesting support from the National
Science Foundation to continue and expand the operation of a Science Honors
Program for Navajo students entering science fields. Support is requested for 1)
a full-time Project Coordinator, Student Support Coordinator, Academic Tutors,
and Secretary; 2) funds for staff travel to implement and coordinate the program
and for student travel for enrichment activities; and 3) scholarships for twenty
students per year. This support will result in the recruitment of fifteen
academically well-qualified students each year to the Shiprock Campus of Navajo
Community College in science fields (ten funded through NSF support, two through
Johnson & Johnson Environmental Scholarships, two from Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory's American Indian Program, and one additional Environmental
Scholarship funded through a Department of Defense program). These students will
be provided with financial assistance, travel funds to visit local industry,
national labs, and to conferences to make research presentations. They will
initially participate in a summer program to prepare them for college-level
coursework through academic enrichment, cooperative learning and study skills.
Subsequent summers will be spent in research placements in other university
programs, or at national laboratories or private industry (all expenses provided
through programs of these institutions). Math workshops for calculus classes are
modeled after successful programs at UC Berkeley and CalPoly. Partnerships with
four national laboratories two large corporations, and ten large regional
universities provide scholarship internships, long-term equipment loans and
networking assistance. This project has the potential of preparing a steadily
increasing number of you ng Navajo students to succeed in science because of its
location and the unique mission of Navajo Community college.
