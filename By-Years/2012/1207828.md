It is often useful to understand a class or sequence of spaces through its
geometric limits. The PI proposes five projects applying such asymptotic methods
to topology, geometry and group theory. First, the PI will study the large-scale
geometry of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds whose fundamental groups can be
generated by a fixed number of elements. Second, the PI will study algebraic and
geometric limits of convex cocompact handlebodies and their relation to the
extension of homeomorphisms of a 3-manifold's boundary into its interior. In
group theory, the PI hopes to investigate the quasi-isometric rigidity of
mapping tori of certain free group automorphisms and the asymptotic growth of
the index of the intersection of all index n subgroups of a group. Finally, the
PI hopes to promote and expand the exciting new topic of `invariant random
subgroups' of Lie groups, which he and Abert et al used to control the growth of
Betti numbers of higher rank locally symmetric spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
study of geometric shapes of 2 and 3 dimensions has rapidly evolved in the past
40 years, partly due to revolutionary work of William Thurston in the 1970's.
Thurston was one of the first to realize the particular utility of 'geometric
degenerations' in these low dimensions. A geometric degeneration can be thought
of as a deformation of a shape that possibly changes its type at the end: for
instance, a sphere with a shrinking radius degenerates to a point and a vertical
cylinder with fixed height and shrinking circumference degenerates to a line
segment. The goal of the proposed project is to use geometric degenerations to
analyze a variety of low-dimensional shapes, especially 3-dimensional manifolds,
of which our universe is an example.
