Microwave and analog engineering research is important to companies for the
development of advanced communication systems of the future. Planning activities
at Villanova University have developed a base of support for a research program
addressing components of advanced communication systems, i.e. specific antenna
configuration, high power and high efficiency devices, and the development of
equipment and techniques to characterize the microwave properties of materials.
Enough companies are supporting the research program to form a
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Microwave/Analog Engineering
at Villanova University. The initial research agenda of Villanova University's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Microwave/Analog Engineering
will address; 1) low profile antennas for communication links, 2) a high power
and efficiency amplifier, 3) theoretical electromagnetics, and 4) communication
satellite architectures. There are six company sponsors and five affiliate
company sponsors for the Center committing approximately $300,000. The Principal
Investigator/Center Director and his colleagues have the knowledge and
facilities to run this Center. This Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center is being coordinated with Dr. Lawrence Goldberg, Program Director,
Quantum Electronics Waves and Beams. The Program Manager recommends Villanova
University be awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing
award. Near the end of the first year the Program Director will review the
progress of the Center on a number of criteria, including the following: 1) the
extent to which the university- industry interaction is developing; 2) the
extent to which the support base is developing; 3) the extent to which a robust
research program is developing. If the review is satisfactory, the Program
Director will recommend support for the next period of this continuing award.
