Basic research activities are proposed to develop analytical combined with
numerical and experimental approaches to the study of wave propagation through
random media. Optical, acoustical, and micro- waves propagating through random
media experience random fluctuations and these interactions between the waves
and the scattering media affect a broad range of sensing problems. Random media
are common to many materials systems: snow, fog, atmospheric turbulence,
vegetation, and biological systems. The proposed research is fundamental in
nature and general in applicability. The proposed research focuses on
development of multiple scattering theories as applied to generalized space-time
interferometry and imaging in random media. Four topic areas are proposed for
investigation: (1) Ultra-wideband scattering by random media (2) Angular memory
signature and generalized polarization signature (3) Enhanced backscattering
with emphasis on clarifying the relationship between volume and surface
scattering especially when particle sizes are in the resonant region. and (4)
Imaging of objec ts in random media. Possible synergism exists within the above
topic areas.
