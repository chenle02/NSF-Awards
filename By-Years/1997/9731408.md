Two-dimensional stratigraphic models are limited since they assume that all
sediment is transported across the margin and fail to capture the inherent 3D
variability of most geological systems. 2-D models therefore cannot simulate
alongshore transport of sediments and formation of an onlap surface that defines
the lowstand systems tract. Across and along margin transport and deposition is
also controlled by advection and diffusion processes. Funds are provided for a
small grant for exploratory research so that the Is can verify the viability of
the Australian biostratigraphy as a high resolution correlation tool in the
Barrow Delta system and to attempt to model a clinoform package within the
Barrow with model predictions based on seismic reflection and litho- and
biostratigraphic data.
