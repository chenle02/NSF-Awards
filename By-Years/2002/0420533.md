Title: Gender HCI Issues in Problem-Solving Software&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project investigates the role software plays in supporting or inhibiting the
participation of women in information technology. The project involves empirical
studies on research questions about the impacts of gender differences in
confidence, of gender-conscious support mechanisms, of gender differences in
motivation, and of collaboration opportunities by males and females using
problem solving software. The investigators plan to produce guidelines to help
designers of problem-based software environments make design decisions that
account for gender differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of
this project lies in the potential contribution to human computer interface
research. The topic of gender barriers in software design merits significant
study. The project has thus has the potential to make a significant contribution
to human computer interface and software design research as well as to provide
insight into the barriers and possible solutions to the under-representation
issues in information technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project promotes
broader impacts in several ways. The investigation team is composed primarily of
females and three female high school students are involved in the research,
which may encourage more female participation in information technology. The
investigators plan to translate the empirical results of the study into a set of
model-based guidelines to be widely distributed to software developers. If
implemented, the resulting software could be instrumental in removing software-
related gender differences that will result in broader participation in
information technology careers by
females.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
