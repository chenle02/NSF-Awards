A sophomore quantitative analysis course that includes organic analysis, mixture
analysis, and physical/structural characterization, as well as current issues
such as regulatory requirements, quality assurance, and information management
is being developed. A key ingredient to achieve this result is the organization
of analytical concepts according to nuclear and electronic properties. Such an
approach is broad enough to encompass all modes of modern chemical
characterization and to incorporate the study of complex mixtures and sampling
strategies, and chemical separations.
