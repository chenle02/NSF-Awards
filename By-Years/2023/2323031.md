Solid-state thermionic energy conversion has been predicted to be more efficient
than conventional thermoelectric energy conversion based on bulk Peltier and
Seebeck effects, if the thermionic barriers can be properly engineered. However,
there have been relatively few experimental studies on solid-state thermionic
energy conversion, mainly because of the difficulty of fabricating interfaces
with the appropriate energy barriers, characterizing thermal transport across
these interfaces, and separating the bulk thermoelectric properties from the
interfacial properties. The proposed 2D Layered heterostructures enable these
difficulties to be overcome and can potentially create a paradigm shift in the
design of thermoelectric power generators and coolers with high efficiency. The
project will also encompass significant educational activities, including an
undergraduate research program and an outreach workshop for high school science
teachers.

The goal of the study is to develop a fundamental understanding of thermionic
transport and energy conversion in multiple-barrier heterostructures using
2D-layered materials. Since the thermionic barriers must be thin, each barrier
can have only a small temperature difference across it. Hence, macroscopic
cooling and power generation needs to be obtained using multistage devices. In
the proposed work, heterostructures are synthesized by physical vapor deposition
(PVD), which can be used to produce heterostructures with hundreds of periods
quite easily. These structures would be nearly impossible to fabricate by
mechanical exfoliation. Unlike molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), the material
synthesis approach proposed here is liftoff-compatible, enabling reliable
measurements of cross-plane transport phenomena (electrical, thermal, and
thermoelectric) using a new approach developed in the PIsâ€™ labs. This new cross-
plane measurement approach together with the configurable nanoarchitecture
(i.e., layer thicknesses and total thickness) will enable the bulk and
interfacial (i.e., thermionic emission) contributions to the thermovoltage to be
separated. A phenomenological model of the electron and phonon transport across
these novel devices will be developed using a thermionic emission transport
approach. The proposed heterostructure geometries open up new degrees of freedom
in the cross-plane transport with independent control of electrons and phonons,
which is essential for achieving efficient energy conversion devices.
