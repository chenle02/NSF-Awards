This research project focuses on fundamental fluid phenomena explored through a
combination of mathematical hydrodynamic theory and experiment. The majority of
this theoretical and experimental research will take place in and around the new
UNC Interdisciplinary fluids laboratory, which opened in June 2007. This project
will involve 2 mathematics faculty, 1 graduate student, and 1 undergraduate
student to perform experimental and theoretical research designed to better
understand mixing, entrainment, and flow properties of stratified and/or viscous
systems. Research will include assessing the regularization of Stokes flow
divergences through density stratifications, finite time enhanced diffusion with
rigid boundary conditions, the hydrodynamics of spheres in the presence of time
varying shear layers, and the analysis of singular non-self adjoint differential
eigenvalue problems. Applications of these techniques to the natural sciences
will be explored.

The environment in which we live and breathe is a complex coupled fluid system
whose dynamics possess phenomena occurring on a vast range of space and time
scales. From the smallest cilia in the lung which provide a hydrodynamic defense
mechanism against inhaled contaminants to the atmosphere, oceans, and our
climate, we interact directly with our fluid environment. The project seeks to
provide both improved scientific understanding, and, along the way, new
opportunities for research and educational experiences for undergraduate and
graduate students of the natural sciences and will have an outreach to middle
and high school students through tours and summer research internships. In
particular, this project is focused upon research in fundamental fluid dynamics
with emphasis on improved understanding of the interaction between immersed
bodies moving in stratified fluids in different environments such as in
atmospheres and oceans and in biological systems. Specific examples of such
behavior include the settling of "marine snow" in the ocean which is responsible
for sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as well as the formation of
underwater trapped oil plumes such as those occurring in the Deepwater Horizon
Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
