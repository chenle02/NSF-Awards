The objective of this research equipment effort is to support a broad,
aggressive research program in sensor-based robotics and automation. Purchase of
a laser range scanner and a robot arm will support several research projects,
including: sensor data fusion, object recognition, sensor-based reasoning in
controlled and uncontrolled environments, and combined manipulation and
mobility. This research methodology is firmly grounded in theory. Results from
elimination theory provide a general basis for relating sensor observations to
geometric models of curved objects. Constraint solving systems are used to
recover the parameters of these and other parametric models. Decision theory
provides a framework for developing task-directed sensor control and data
processing algorithms. The solution techniques advance two computational models,
specifically symbolic equation rewriting and interval-based constraint solving.
To validate these theoretical advances, they must be tested under realistic
conditions. Range sensing, providing a direct source of real-world geometry, and
a robot arm, providing sensor mobility and object manipulation capabilities,
will be employed to support the endeavors. This equipment will provide the
nucleus of a laboratory devoted to the construction of integrated automated
systems with the potential for a broad range of future applications.
