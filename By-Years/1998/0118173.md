For many recent applications, the concept of a data stream, possibly infinite,
is more appropriate than a data set. By nature, a stored data set is appropriate
when significant portions of the data are queried again and again, and updates
are small and/or relatively infrequent. In contrast, a data stream is
appropriate when the data is changing constantly (often exclusively through
insertions of new elements), and it is either unnecessary or impractical to
operate on large portions of the data multiple times. The goal of this research
project is to develop models and techniques for the management and processing of
data streams. Sampling, summarization, and online approximation algorithms will
be employed to facilitate query processing and data mining over streams. The
results of this project will provide efficient data stream techniques for data
management, memory management, query processing, data mining, and data analysis.
In addition, a software prototype will be developed for experimentation with
algorithms and query processing, and as a testbed for some sample applications
of significant scope, such as networking monitoring and traffic engineering, and
medical monitoring data.
