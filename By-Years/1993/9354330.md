9354330 Laubenbacher An innovative lower division mathematics course based on
studying original mathematical texts is being developed. The course provides an
introduction to mathematics by examining, through original sources, the
evolution of selected great problems which fueled the development of several
branches of mathematics. The course can serve as a general education course for
students in any major who have a good high school mathematics background,
providing a stimulating alternative to the standard "mathematics for liberal
arts majors" course.
