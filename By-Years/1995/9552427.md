Linear Systems and Circuits These laboratory exercises are designed to introduce
students to the fundamental properties of electro-optic devices, as well as the
properties of classical optics. The topics covered in the lectures and
accompanying experiments include semiconductor lasers, photodetectors, thin
lenses, diffraction gratings, beam splitters, polarization, and the basics of
ray-tracing. The motivation behind the exercises is the optical section of the
CD player. The final experiment includes design and construction of a large-
scale version of the CD optical system. This is used to demonstrate the various
optical signals that are read from the CD and to show how the optical section is
related to the electronics (digital audio signals) and servo (focus and tracking
signals) systems. Electromagnetics The goal of this group of laboratory
exercises is to bring a variety of electromagnetic fundamentals employed in CD
technology to the attention of the students. Optics and Optical Devices This
laboratory exercise is designed to introduce students to some of the properties
of continuous-time and discrete-time, linear, and time-invariant systems. Topics
covered in both lecture and laboratory exercises include Fourier analysis,
frequency response, Kirchhoff's and Ohm's laws, power transfer and impedance
matching, operational amplifiers, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog
conversion (ADC and DAC), quantization effects, sampling, and aliasing. Each of
these topics is motivated through the use of audio band circuits and computer
simulations.
