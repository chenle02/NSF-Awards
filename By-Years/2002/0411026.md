Title: Unified Data Replication
Architecture&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data replication is a fundamental
technique for improving the performance and availabil-ity of large-scale
distributed systems. However, current replication mechanisms are en-tangled with
policy decisions that make it difficult to re-use existing systems in new envi-
ronments and that restrict the effectiveness of systems built using these
mechanisms. The goal of this proposed research is to develop a unified data
replication architecture and toolkit for large-scale distributed services. If
successful, this work will will simplify building systems, improve the
availability v. consistency v. performance trade-offs avail-able to system
designers, and give the community a deeper understanding of the tech-niques at
the core of data replication. Specific research objectives include (1)
developing a novel architecture for data replication in large scale distributed
systems that separates replication mechanism from policy, (2) systematically
developing improved low-level replication mechanisms, scalable and flexible
consistency mechanisms, and self-tuning data placement mechanisms, and (3)
constructing a toolkit for technology refinement and transfer as well as using
this toolkit to develop several key case study replication
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Brett D. Fleisch&lt;br/&gt;Program Director,
