This effort will enhance the recruitment and retention activities on the part of
Tennessee State University for minority and female engineering students by
increased recruitment in rural communities and easing the transition from high
school to college. This effort will entail the purchasing and outfitting of an
"Engineering Laboratory on Wheel" and the enhancement of four existing
engineering laboratories that are now being utilized by pre-college participants
and engineering freshmen.
