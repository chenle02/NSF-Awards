Martin This project seeks to make the subject of ionizing radiation accessible
and understandable to students at levels from middle school to medical school
through semi-quantitative laboratory experiences. The vehicle for doing this is
a suspension of micro-droplets of a liquid, which are super heated at room
temperature, in a gel. The energy carried by the ionizing radiation triggers
bubble formation. The cavitation which initiates the bubble produces a "pop"
which can be amplified enabling easy counting of the event. In Phase II
experimental kits for each include vials of the suspension, electronic circuits
and appropriate instructional materials.
