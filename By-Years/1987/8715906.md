This doctoral dissertation award will enable geography graduate student Erik
Swyngedouw to conduct field work in the European Economic Community (EEC) in
connection with his study of technological change and innovation in the European
telecommunications industry. His project will combine analyses of statistical
data with interviews with executives of EEC telecommunications firms. The
candidate's research will focus especially on the role of the telecommunications
industries in "filieres:" flexible territorial production complexes that are
created in response to local and regional comparative advantages with respect to
the demands of the international economy. Learning how and why multinational
firms (particularly telecommunications companies) participate in and shape
filieres will enlarge our basic understanding of regional growth and development
and the relationships of regional production complexes to international economic
structures. The telecommunications industry is a case study that will be used to
test the validity of a new theoretical framework which ties interindustry
linkages among complementary firms to the regional and global strategies each of
the participating firms uses to compete in the international marketplace.
