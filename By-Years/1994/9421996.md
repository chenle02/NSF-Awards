ABSTRACT CTS-9421996 This is a study of the reactivity and dynamic behavior of
adsorbates appearing during the catalytic reduction of nitric oxide, and of the
interaction of silanes with alumina and with zeolites. In -situ infrared
spectroscopy coupled with transient kinetic approaches are used to study site
structure and dynamic behavior of various adsorbates during the reaction of
nitric oxide and carbon monoxide over rhodium-based catalysts, and during the
reaction of nitric oxide, methane, and oxygen over ZSM-5 containing cobalt or
copper. The interactions of silanes with catalyst surfaces and reactions on
silane-treated catalysts are investigated. The feasibility of using silanation
to improve the resistance of catalysts to sintering is assessed. Some novel
approaches to catalyst assessment and design are explored in this study.
Although this effort looks at systems used in control of nitrogen oxides from
both mobile and stationary sources, the results will have very broad
applicability. ***
