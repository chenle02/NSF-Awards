9506650 Anderson This award provides partial funding for the development of a
dilatometer to measure the thermal expansion of crystals up to temperatures of
1800K. The instrument design is based on the application of laser optical
interferometry, and a prototype built in the principal investigator's laboratory
has demonstrated capabilities up to 1000K. Upgrading the design for performance
at higher temperatures is important because the main applications of the
instrument will be to characterize the thermal expansion coefficients of mineral
phases stable under the high-temperature conditions of the Earth's crust and
upper mantle. ***
