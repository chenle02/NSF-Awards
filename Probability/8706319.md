This research will study the probability questions related to the sample re-use
procedure called the bootstraping. The investigator has already proved a number
of results in this area. Now he proposes to extend the results to the cases when
the variance is infinite. It will also investigate the behavior of the bootstrap
distribution of the mean when a smoothed and trimmed version of the empirical
cummulative distribution function is used for resampling. For the second part of
the research, critical simple branching processes are studied. The investigator
will find the limiting behavior of the mean of the maximum up to the n-th
generation when the variance in the branching process is infinite. The
investigator, who has been the originator of the idea of almost regenerative
processes, will continue his study of the same.
