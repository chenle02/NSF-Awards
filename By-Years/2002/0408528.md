0408528 Parker The Water Science and Technology Board is the focal point for
studies related to&lt;br/&gt;water resources and hydrologic sciences
accomplished under the aegis of the National Academy of Sciences and the
National Academy of Engineering. The Board's objective is to improve the
scientific and technological basis for resolving important national questions
and issues associated with the efficient management and use of ground and
surface water resources.&lt;br/&gt;In carrying out its responsibilities and in
serving the national interest, the Board&lt;br/&gt;responds to requests for
evaluations and advice through its ad hoc studies concerning specific and
generic issues in water resources, influences action by initiating studies of
issues that merit consideration by public agencies and others, identifies issues
and topics of research related to water resources, and cooperates with other
units of the National Research Council and groups with mutual interests outside
of the National Research Council.&lt;br/&gt;
