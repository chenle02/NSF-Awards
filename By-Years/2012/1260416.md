Methylmercury (MeHg) causes a variety of adverse health effects in exposed
humans and wildlife but its formation and cycling in oceanic waters have not
been fully characterized or quantified. This research program seeks to better
understand factors controlling the production, fate, phytoplankton uptake, and
transfer of MeHg in the marine environment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A combination of
laboratory, field studies and modeling efforts will investigate the
bioaccumulation, trophic transfer in aquatic food webs, and implications that
this may have on the global transport of this potent neurotoxin. Laboratory and
coastal field studies of MeHg interactions with different types of
phytoplankton, interaction with specific organic compounds, effects of light and
temperature are all expected to influence MeHg binding and or uptake into
phytoplankton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include:
&lt;br/&gt;1) provision of policy relevant information in support of monitoring
and evaluation efforts for control of anthropogenic mercury releases;
&lt;br/&gt;2) informing education on marine conservation and sustainability by
developing a case study on mercury in the marine environment; and &lt;br/&gt;3)
training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists
