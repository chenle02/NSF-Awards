Abstract: Problems in Algorithmic and Combinatorial Number Theory Carl Pomerance
DMS-0401422

Perhaps the most fundamental problem in arithmetic is that of distinguishing
prime numbers from composite numbers, and factoring composites into their prime
factors. Recent stunning progress by Agrawal, Kayal, and Saxena on the prime
recognition problem has led to a rejuvenation of the field. The Principal
Investigator proposes to find provable variants of the AKS test that achieve its
heuristic complexity, and do so with effectively computable tools in analytic
number theory. In addition, the Principal Investigator proposes to study normal
cycle lengths and the normal number of cycles of certain commonly used
pseudorandom number generators. More theoretical problems include gaps between
primes in a polynomial sequence, equations involving primitive roots, and the
number of divisors of a multiplicative function. The Principal Investigator has
plans to write a monograph on primality testing based on a graduate-level course
he recently taught at Dartmouth College.

Concerning broader impacts of the proposed research, the fields of cryptology
and information security depend heavily on algorithmic number theory, and
fundamental advances in the latter field are of intense interest in the former.
In fact, the naturally conservative field of information security would perhaps
prefer that there not be any more fundamental advances in algorithmic number
theory. That they still can occur at this late date may cause the security field
to rethink and broaden the underpinnings of their subject. The study of
pseudorandom number generators has many applications to cryptology and numerical
analysis. Surprisingly, we don't know the typical cycle length or the typical
number of cycles for certain basic and commonly-used generators, a topic
addressed by this proposal. The theoretical topics that will be considered deal
with certain basic and natural questions connected with prime numbers, and some
of these problems may well lead to practical applications. For example,
primitive roots are also closely connected to the field of cryptology, and a
deeper understanding of the possible relationships among them is of fundamental
interest.
