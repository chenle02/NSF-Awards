This award will cover the second US-USSR summer workshop in cosmology. It will
bring together 10 Soviet and 10 American young scientists to discuss topics in
three branches of cosmology: quantum cosmology, physical processes in the early
universe, and observational studies of the recent universe. The workshop will be
held at the Aspen Center for Physics. Cosmology is currently an exciting topic,
crossing normal disciplinary lines of science. This meeting will foster
collaboration between the two countries' best young scientists.
