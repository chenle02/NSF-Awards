9604923 Cheng Genomic instability causes genetic changes including chromosome
loss, translocation, recombination and point mutations and plays an important
role in genetic diversity and evolution. The long-term goal of the proposed work
is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that control genomic stability in
vertebrates. A unique screen, developed in this laboratory, creates an
opportunity to render heterozygous mutations homozygous in one step using
parthenogenesis in the zebrafish. A screen for genetic instability mutants (gin)
is based upon the detection of abnormally high rates of somatic loss of
heterozygosity (LOH). The screen allows frequencies of LOH as low as 10-5 to be
detected. Mutagenesis of male zebrafish with ethylnitrosourea has resulted in
1-2 mutations per average gene per 1000 haploid genomes. One gin mutant has been
identified and will be characterized, as will other such mutants as they are
isolated, by Mendelian inheritance, complementation testing, quantitation of the
effect of mutations and genetic mapping. Genomic instability mutants in
unicellular organisms gave the first significant insights into the mechanisms of
mutation. However, until now, such studies have not been possible in
vertebrates. It is now possible to identify new genes that may be specific to
vertebrates. The information to be gained from this study may enhance our
understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in genetic mechanisms
operative in vertebrates and also contribute to an understanding of some genetic
diseases.
