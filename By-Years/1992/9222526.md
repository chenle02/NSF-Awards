The howler (Alouatta), wooly (Lagothrix), and spider monkey (Ateles) are large
New World monkeys and exhibit diverse locomotor patterns ranging from above-
branch quadrupedalism to specialized suspensory progression below supports. For
a variety of reasons, their behaviors have come to be used as models for
interpreting the functional morphology of fossil catarrhine primates of the old
world, and our own ancestors. This research project will determine the adaptive
significance of the positional behaviors (locomotor, postural, and manipulatory)
of these three genera of New World monkeys, and the functional significance of
the postcranial morphology that generates those behaviors. The project
integrates several approaches; morphological analysis, quantiative skeletal
morphometrics, and radiography; motion analysis of video recordings; and
observations in natural habitats. The integration of these approaches will
produce a coherent body of results concerning relationships among morphology,
positional behavior and habitat structure.
