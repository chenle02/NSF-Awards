9316102 Rice This award provides partial funding to support a technician
assigned to the electron-microprobe and scanning electron microscope image
analysis laboratories in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University
of Oregon. The laboratories' analytical capabilities offer faculty and students
in the departments of geological sciences, chemistry and physics opportunities
to study minerals, rocks, and synthetic materials at state-of-the-art resolution
in chemical composition and imaging. Full-time technical support for the
laboratories is needed to maintain and operate the facility and to fully develop
the capabilities of the instrumentation. ***
