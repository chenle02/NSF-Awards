The principal investigator will study the random permutations of {1, 2, ....,n}.
During the planning period, she proposes to: 1) Look for closed form expressions
for lower moment of Xn(k) and bounds for more difficult higher moments. 2) Do
computer intensive simulation studies which will give empirical descriptions of
distributional shape and properties of Xn(k). 3) Develop algorithms for the
study of Xn(k) which fall within the framework of (2) above. 4) Develop
theoretical approaches to find an asymptotic distributions for Xn(k). In the
context of the above objectives, the principal investigator will consider the
following scheme: a) select a permutation at random (for n fixed) b) consider
all the increasing subsequences in this permutation c) select an increasing
subsequence, say 1n, at random. Let k be the length, i.e. k = Ä±1n!. d) What is
the distribution of k?
