Academic Research Infrastructure: Acquisition of Instrumentation for Testing of
Ultra-Wideband Wireless and Wired Communications and Design of Enabling
Instruments This Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the acquisition
of very high speed analysis and test equipment for research on high speed
communication networks. The research projects supported by the equipment are: 1.
The design and implementation of ultra-wideband wireless and wired computer
network systems. 2. An experimental research project on the design of an impulse
radio wireless network for Ghz bandwidth base stations. 3. A research program in
ultra high-speed circuit and test fixturing.
