This proposal is for partial support for an international conference on
reducing measurement errors in surveys. NSF support will defray costs of 20
special invited participants, noted experts in survey methodology and
measurement error. The conference will be interdisciplinary, as survey research
constitutes an important means of data collection in several of the social
sciences.
