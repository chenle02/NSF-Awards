The theoretical treatment of atomic and molecular systems has benefited greatly
in the past thirty years from the development and evolution of high speed
computing facilities. In particular, with the help of computers, scientists are
now able to explore the myriad implications of the quantum theory and
statistical mechanics, and analyze much more completely the information derived
from experiements. As a result, we scientists are much closer to realizing the
eventual goal of being able to understand and predict the structure, dynamics,
and reactivity of atoms and molecules. Electronic structure theory has been one
of the primary beneficiaries of the increased capacity and speed present in
modern computers. This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program
will aid the Chemistry Department at the University of Nevada - Reno purchase a
mini-supercomputer. This computer will be used in the following research areas
of study: 1. Electron Impact Ionization 2. Properties of Doubly Excited States
3. The Effects of Rotation on Vibrational Mixing 4. Quantum Dynamics and Non
Adiabatic Processes 5. Radiationless Relaxation of Excited Polyatomics in
Condensed Media 6. Intramolecular Dynamics of Transient Complexes in Chemical
Reactions.
