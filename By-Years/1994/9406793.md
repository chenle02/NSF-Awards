In principle, if an algorithm is given generalized input (e.g. a probability
distribution, a set of values, a list with no repeats, or values coupled with
CPU times)it should produce correspondingly general output. The `modular
semantics` studied in this project provides formal machinery for a transparent
implementation. For example, given code to produce random outcomes in
{x1,...,xn}, a simple declaration that the ambient environment is to be
probabilistic prior to calling the code is all that is needed to modify the
output from a random single output to an expression {{p1,x1},...,{pn,xn}}
wherein pi is the probability of the outcome xi. The underlying programming
system must be altered so as to replace standard function evaluation with
Kleisli evaluation with respect to a finitary monad in the category of sets.
Universal algebra allows for a uniform implementation using tree processing. The
primary research goal is to understand the process by which code is
transparently interpreted relative to a monad. While existing examples
demonstrate the viability of the project, most of the work remains to be done. A
secondary research goal is to develop creative applications of monad-driven
algorithms.
