This project explores sources and secondary materials to examine the historical
participation of ecologists in addressing whether and how the science should
produce results of immediate applicability to human problems. It examines the
nature and uses of the distinction between basic and applied science in ecology.
Taking as its endpoint a pivotal article, `The Sustainable Biosphere Initiative`
(SBI), published in the scientific journal Ecology in 1991, the research will
examine the theoretical, ideological, methodological and political conditions
that underlie the discussions between ecological scientists about the nature of
their science, the need for scientific autonomy, and the relationship of the
science to social decisions and environmental outcomes. The investigator will
study the extensive archives of the Ecological Society of America at the
University of Georgia, Athens, which contain the long-term records of ecological
debates. Two episodes will be particularly illuminating: the development of
systems ecology as 'applied science' and the debate among ecologists over a
scheme of certification. Several articles and plans for further research should
result from this award.
