ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CNS 0454404&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dirk C.
Grunwald&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Colorado at Boulder
&lt;br/&gt;Title: CRI: Wireless Internet Building Blocks for Research, Policy,
and Education&lt;br/&gt;Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research
Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project addresses sharing
in the radio spectrum; current estimates are that about 10% of allocated
spectrum is actually used. The PI's will address this problem with methods for
agile spectrum use, including use of non-contiguous spectrum, reservation of
spectrum as an alternative to ownership, and smart radios. This award will fund
equipment used for three broad purposes: measurement of spectrum use which will
enable developing models of use and diagnostic tools for experimentation,
research on wireless networking with a wireless testbed, and providing an
infrastructure for real-time capture and analysis of the wireless testbed
spectrum use. In addition to supporting several research activities at the
University of Colorado, broader impacts include possible impacts on
telecommunications policy through technology investigations and demonstrations
and impacts on education at the university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
