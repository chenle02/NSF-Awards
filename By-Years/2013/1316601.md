The Engineering for All project creates, tests and revises two-six week
prototypical modules for middle school technology education classes, using the
unifying themes and important social contexts of food and water. The modules
employ engineering design as the core pedagogy and integrate content and
practices from the standards for college and career readiness. Embedded
assessments are developed and tested to make student learning visible to both
teachers and students. Professional development for a limited group of teachers
is used to increase their knowledge of engineering design and to test
instruments being developed to measure (a) student and teacher capacity to
employ informed design practices and (b) teacher design pedagogical content
knowledge.

The project leadership is experienced at creating materials for engineering and
technology and in providing professional development for teachers. The
assessments and instruments are created by educational researchers. The advisory
board includes engineers, science and engineering educators, and educational
researchers to guide the development of the modules, the assessments and the
instruments. An external evaluator reviews the protocols and their
implementation.

This project has the potential to provide exemplary materials and assessments
for engineering/technology education that address standards, change teacher
practice, and increase the capacity of the engineering/technology education
community to do research.
