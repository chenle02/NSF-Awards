construction industry how the developing technology of multimedia can be
utilized to significantly improve certain functions of the construction process
and thereby bring benefits which should stimulate research and development. The
multimedia equipment requested will be used to support research on several
projects. The equipment will allow the researchers to position the school for
research activities that can utilize the promising technology of multimedia and
apply it to a major industry, construction. ***
