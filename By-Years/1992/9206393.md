Li will study the discrete spectrum of the restriction of the oscillator
representation to reductive dual pairs. He will relate this investigation to the
study of the discrete series of generalized Stiefel manifolds. The wave front
sets and asymptotic distributions of discrete series will play a vital role. The
results will be applied to the construction of unitary automorphic forms on
classical groups, including those with non- zero cohomology. They will also be
used to construct elements of the Rammanujan Dual. The theory of Lie groups,
named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the
major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for
exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie
groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in
analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum
mechanics and elementary particle physics.
