9521718 Dordick This conference is to cover both fundamental and applied aspects
associated with enzyme production, purification and immobilization. The program
is to include sessions devoted to biocatalyst structure, function, and design,
biocatalysis under extreme environmental conditions (e.g. organic solvents, and
high temperatures and pressures), the importance of in vivo protein synthesis
for new biocatalyst production, enzymes in organic synthesis, and bioreactor
design for large-scale enzyme processes. Participation at this conference will
be international, and include chemical engineers, biochemists, microbiologists,
physical and analytical chemists, and polymer chemists from industry, academia,
and government. ***
