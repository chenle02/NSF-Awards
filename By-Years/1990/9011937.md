The investigator proposes to study pictorial priming by using a task previously
investigated and published by him. In general, the subject under study will be
offered primes in a series of whole pictures and they will be tested using a
series of degraded pictures as target items. The subject will receive three
identical primes, three similar primes and three pictures that have not been
presented during the priming portion of the task. Male and female subjects and
the picture feature types contour will be used in the study. The pictures a
subject receives during the target series will be either identical in spatial
orientation to the prime offered in the first portion of the task or will be a
mirror-image in terms of spatial orientation. The subjects performance will be
recorded in terms of time to solve the degraded form and the number of
keystrokes to solve the degraded form. The investigator hopes to determine if
performance is affected by the slowing of the visual system that might occur
with aging.
