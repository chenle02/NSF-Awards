This project will investigate the properties of ultrafine (particle diameters
less than 0.1 micrometer) aerosol aggregates in the atmosphere. Aerosol
aggregates with high carbon content may significantly affect light absorption
and scattering and hence the global radiation balance. Particles in this size
range are also of public health concern. The morphology of aerosol aggregates in
the atmosphere will be studied, including the fractal dimension and number and
size of the primary particles that compose the aggregates, concentrations and
size distribution of the aggregates, and fraction of total ultrafine particles
that are aggregates. These properties are important because aerosol transport
rates and gas-particle partitioning factors can vary as a function of aggregate
morphology, affecting the atmospheric residence time and patterns of deposition
of aerosols in the lung and on other surfaces.
