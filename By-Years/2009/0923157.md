"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract for &lt;br/&gt;MRI:
Acquisition of Deterministic Polishing Tool&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for
Applied Optics (CAO) at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) seeks
support to establish a transformational environment for education and research
in the design and fabrication of advanced optical systems. In this pursuit, CAO
proposes to integrate novel optical fabrication capabilities into its graduate
and undergraduate optical engineering programs. Recent advances in optical
fabrication equipment particularly with deterministic polishing tools have
enabled the making of non-traditional optical components such as ?free-form?
(not rotationally symmetric) optics. The ability to reliably produce complex
wavefronts will in turn alter the paradigm of optical design. Specifically, UAH
will acquire a novel jet fluid optical polishing tool from Zeeko Inc.
&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the activities entails creating a resource
for industry, government, and academia to optimize the implementation of
advanced fabrication concepts into current and future optical applications. The
broader impacts of the proposed activity would include providing undergraduate
and graduate students pursuing degrees in the optical sciences (through existing
optics programs at the University of Alabama in Huntsville) an opportunity to
obtain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art and evolving optical
fabrication equipment. The primary research activities will specifically focus
on optics/optical systems that are very difficult or impossible to fabricate
using traditional optical fabrication techniques. These types of optics include
free form optics, high aspect ratio optics (such as adaptive optics and light-
weighted optics), very high precision optics (including aspheres, spheres,
prisms/ corner cubes, etc.), and associated optical testing.
