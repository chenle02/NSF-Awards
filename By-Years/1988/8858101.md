This grant of a PYI award to Professor Marsha Berger is based on the unanimous
recommendation of the review panel. Her use of adaptive grids in the numerical
solution of partial differential equations, especially for fluid flow, has
brought her to the forefront of her field. She has now begun to stress the links
between the computer and computational scientists that are necessary in order to
most efficiently utilize the new parallel architecture machines now appearing.
