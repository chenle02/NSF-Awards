This proposal is directed towards growth, characterization, and device
fabrication of InAs1-xSbx grown on InSb substrates by molecular beam epitaxy
(MBE). InAS1-xSbx alloys with x=0.6 offer an attractive alternative for
detectors covering part of the 8-12um spectral range since InAs0.4Sb0.6 has the
lowest band gap among the III-V compound semiconductors (Eg 0.1eV at room
temperature). The detectors built from this InAsSb alloy have a cut-off
wavelength of about 12um and 9um at room temperature and at 77K, respectively.
In this work, further reduction in the band gap of InAs0.4Sb0.6 will be achieved
utilizing a net tensile strain in a strained layer superlattice structure. A new
superlattice structure will also be used as a buffer layer to eliminate defects
resulting from lattice mismatch between different components.
