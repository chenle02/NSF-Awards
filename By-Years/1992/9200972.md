The Fellow will study trace element and isotopic composition of mantle xenoliths
in order to determine the mechanism for modification of the mantle by
dubduction-derived fluids and mantle melts. Studies will be conducted in island
arcs of Japan and the Cascades through examination of whole rocks and minerals
for trace elements and radiogenic isotopes. The Fellow will work at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the tenure of his fellowship.
