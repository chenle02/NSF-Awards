Workload consolidation on virtualized datacenters is one common
&lt;br/&gt;technique used to manage the power usage and energy efficiency of
&lt;br/&gt;cloud platforms. However, current solutions limit the available
&lt;br/&gt;insight into exactly how energy is consumed by the various cloud
&lt;br/&gt;tenants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to address this gap, this
research develops PowerMeter ? a &lt;br/&gt;set of mechanisms and tools that
make it possible to track energy &lt;br/&gt;usage in virtualized cloud
infrastructures, on granularity of &lt;br/&gt;individual VMs, or sets of VMs
corresponding to a specific cloud &lt;br/&gt;tenant, e.g., a customer or an
application. PowerMeter is developed &lt;br/&gt;for a 3000-core fully
instrumented datacenter prototype and a 1000- &lt;br/&gt;core system based on
newest-generation technology, and is evaluated &lt;br/&gt;using representative
workload mixes based on popular cloud &lt;br/&gt;applications and publicly
available cloud traces. PowerMeter will &lt;br/&gt;provide currently missing
capabilities for dynamically assessing in- &lt;br/&gt;datacenter/in-cloud energy
usage, necessary to enable energy usage &lt;br/&gt;transparency and
accountability to cloud customers, to understand the &lt;br/&gt;opportunities
for improved energy efficiency in virtualized cloud &lt;br/&gt;systems, and for
further development of management methods for energy- &lt;br/&gt;efficient
datacenters.
