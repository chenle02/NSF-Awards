The Williams College Department of Physics is teachnig two optics courses
designed for students who are not majoring in the sciences. The first course,
"Understanding Light," is a one-semester course introducing the physics of light
and emphasizing modern optical technology. Students do 4 lab experiments,
including (1) building a HeNe laser and observing its transverse modes, (2)
building a fiber optics communication link, (3) observing atomic spectra with a
spectrometer, and (4) making a transmission hologram. The second course, "Light
and Holography," is an intensive 4 week course given during our Winter Study
Period. Students do 3 holography lab experiments, including (1) making a
transmission hologram, (2) making a reflection hologram, and (3) measuring the
deformation of a stressed object with holographic interferometry. They also do
an independent final project making a hologram of their choosing. Through these
appealing lab experiences, the department intends to make courses for nonscience
majors more stimulating. The college is matching the NSF funds with an equal
amount.
