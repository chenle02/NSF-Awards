This proposal requests continued CEDAR support to operate and analyze data from
the set of optical instruments at Peach Mountain Observatory (PMO), Michigan.
The program will address the following objectives: 1) the continued collection
of mesospheric and lower thermospheric geophysical data (neutral winds and
temperatures for airglow layers corresponding to hydroxyl and atomic oxygen) to
establish a long-term, mid-latitude climatology; 2) the coordination and
operation of experiments through the comparison of data sets acquired
simultaneously by the FPI, ASI, and FTS; 3) the training of graduate student in
the operation of the optical experiments plus the interpretation of the data
sets; 4) the submission of the collected geophysical data sets to the CEDAR NCAR
data base; 5) the analysis and publication of results. In particular, data from
the PMO will be used to characterize gravity-wave and tidal behavior in the
mesosphere and the lower thermosphere in an attempt to determine the
significance of the background neutral-wind bulk flow in the interpretation of
gravity- wave fluctuations.
