The investigators address three major national needs for non- majors courses
oriented to physiology and anatomy: 1) well designed modules to serve classes
based on investigative laboratories, 2) a means to decrease reliance on
experimental use of vertebrates, and 3) a means to decrease the cost of
laboratory equipment so all students can have some hands-on experience. The
proposal requests funds to design and implement a set of microcomputer-based
laboratories (MBL) that will: 1) allow measurement of basic physiologic
processes, 2) facilitate direct interface of the data with microcomputers, and
3) enable students to easily record, graph and present results. The MBL modules
will cover 3 basic systems; sensory (how to measure skin temperature, response
time and heat flux), effector (how to measure reflex arcs, performance and rates
of fatigue) and cardiopulmonary (measure heart and respiration rate). The
expected outcomes are: 1) an investigative laboratory based second semester non-
majors biology course, and 2) a text describing how to build similar inexpensive
equipment so that the MBL can be implemented at other institutions.
