The galaxies we see in the sky are only a small part of the material that makes
up the universe. The vast majority of matter is “dark matter,” and each galaxy
forms, lives, and dies in a massive clump of dark matter. Thus, the dark matter
must have a profound influence on creating the diverse population of galaxies
that we see today. Since dark matter isn’t directly observable, understanding
this influence requires new methods to indirectly measure the connection between
the dark matter and the galaxies that we see. Scientists at New York University
will develop a new statistical method for quantifying this relationship and will
apply it to data from the Bright Galaxy Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI). As part of this project, the PI will advise undergraduate
students in research and will incorporate results from this research into
undergraduate coursework.

The technique in this proposal is to use a galaxy group finder that assumes that
all groups live in a common dark matter halo, and that the population of dark
halos is well-predicted by numerical simulations of structure formation. The
properties and formation histories of halos is imparted on their spatial
distribution, thus it is possible to map the observed properties of galaxies
back onto the unobservable properties of dark matter halos in an iterative
process, converging on a correlation matrix between halo properties and galaxy
properties. This project will use new data from the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey,
nearly a factor of ten larger than the SDSS spectroscopic catalog, to break new
ground in our understanding of the influence of the dark sector on galaxy
formation.
