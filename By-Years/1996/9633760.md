ABSTRACT OPP-9633760 WILK/ZIMMER A definite relationship has been found between
the commercialization of archaeological finds and the destruction of
archaeological sites. In spite of worldwide public attention to archaeological
heritage preservation, site destruction continues to increase. The objective of
this dissertation study is to analyze the rules, values and practices that
affect the use of archaeological resources on Saint Lawrence Island in the
Bering Straits of Alaska. The Native village of Gambell is a unique case of a
legal archaeological market. Many residents recover and sell marketable
artifacts as a means of meeting subsistence needs in a cash economy. Other
residents oppose this practice. This project addresses the dilemma of selling
cultural heritage property, protecting archaeological resources, and the clash
between cultural resource managers and local people with limited sources of cash
income.
