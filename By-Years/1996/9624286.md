This research investigates the algorithmic and systems issues that arise in on-
line and off-line distributed manipulation and organization tasks with
cooperative teams of robots. The objective is to develop a framework in which it
is easy to synthesize and reason about complex strategies for manipulating and
organizing objects in structured and unstructured environments, with teams of
robots. Distributed manipulation systems can be used for tasks that require
reorganizing large objects in an environments, for example waste cleanup, mine
sweeping, and furniture moving. Manipulation and organization can be formulated
as placement problems. In a distributed placement problem multiple robots
combine their skills cooperatively to move objects so as to satisfy a desired
global property of the environment (for example, all the movable objects are
placed in a designated area.) The research agenda is to develop (1) models for
the information requirements of robot tasks; (2) algorithms for single robot
manipulation strategies that relay on given information requirements; (3) a
method of analyzing the structure and power of such algorithms; (4) a method for
composing reliable single robot manipulation algorithms to obtain fault-tolerant
cooperative manipulation protocols with performance guarantees; (5) a method for
establishing trade-offs between sensing, communication, planning, and learning
in distributed systems of robots; and (6) to implement, design, and test
distributed manipulation systems that use (1-5)
