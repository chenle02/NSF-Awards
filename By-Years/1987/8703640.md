The proposed research will further develop our understanding of the dynamics of
coherent structures in turbulent flows. In particular, it is proposed to analyze
the evolution of a pair of structures, aligned with the stream direction and
parallel to a neighboring wall, of infinite extent in the stream direction and
containing streamwise vorticity of opposite signs (a counter-rotating pair). The
analysis will include the effects of viscosity throughout the whole flow field,
and will thus be valid for weakly rotating structures as well as structures with
large circulation. The proposed work will give an indication of the importance
of neighboring walls and structures in the instability mechanism. Accurate
modeling of these instabilities will lead to a better understanding of the
laminar-turbulent transition and of mixing processes in fully turbulent flows.
This is likely to have direct application in areas of engineering interest such
as heat transfer and turbulent drag reduction.
