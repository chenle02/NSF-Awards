This project aims at developing efficient methods for protecting the privacy of
computations on outsourced data in distributed settings. The project addresses
the design of an outsourced storage framework where the access pattern observed
by the storage server gives no information about the actual data accessed by the
client and cannot be correlated with external events. For example, the server
cannot determine whether a certain item was previously accessed by the client or
whether a certain algorithm is being executed. This property provides a high
level of privacy protection that goes far beyond standard data encryption. The
project also deals with advanced methods for verifying the correctness of
outsourced computations, focusing on keyword searches and graph algorithms. The
educational component of the project includes a curricular development effort
for introductory computer security courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has
applications to a broad range of web services widely used by business and
consumers. Privacy-preserving access for outsourced data is relevant to web-
based email and office applications. Also, it is especially important for the
management of proprietary business data, medical data, and other sensitive
personal data.
