ABSTRACT OPP-9727899 FLANDERS, NICHOLAS ARCTIC RESEARCH CONSORTIUM OF THE U.S.
The Arctic Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS) proposes to renew the current
Cooperative Agreement to support a variety of activities intended to enhance NSF
arctic research programs. ARCUS will continue to provide a mechanism for the
science community to identify new research objectives, logistical requirements,
and educational activities that will benefit both planning and implementation of
NSF-supported science initiatives in the Arctic. Specific activities include:
science planning in the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) and Arctic Social Sciences
(ASSP) Programs, information systems such as a brochure and newsletter for ARCSS
and a World Wide Web page for dissemination of information to all those
interested in arctic research, facilitation of science steering committee
meetings for ARCSS and ASSP, development of arctic educational activities, and
continued examination of logistics requirements for providing increased access
for all researchers in the arctic. The Cooperative Agreement with ARCUS provides
a mechanism for enhancing community input to science planning in NSF and for
disseminating the results of that planning to the science community.
