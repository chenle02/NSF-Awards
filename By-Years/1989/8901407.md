This project provides graduate assistant support for the completion of three
graphics-based, interactive nonlinear analysis computer programs. Efforts will
be made to convert the software to engineering workstations for broad
applications. The technical documentation to be finalized requires the editing
of user documentation in "how to get started" form, the compilation of materials
from scattered sources and the assembly of programmer's documentation for later
expansion and modification. This award is supported under the ENG provisions for
the "Expedited Awards for Novel and Exploratory Research".
