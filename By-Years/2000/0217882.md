Mode-locked lasers can produce a comb of regularly spaced modes in frequency. We
propose to investigate new approaches to stabilize frequency combs provided by
mode-locked ring and linear solid state lasers, as well as locking the comb to
an atomic standard. The stability is achieved by locking the frequency and
repetition rates to a reference cavity. We have recently demonstrated that
femtosecond laser stabilization to reference cavities provides an exceptionally
fast feedback control to ensure stable operation on short time scales. Accuracy
will be achieved by locking the reference cavity to atomic resonances provided
by lambda (L) structures. A first part of the work will be an extension of our
previous work involving Ti:sapphire mode-locked lasers, improving the present
performances, and developing the methods and tools for long term stabilization
and accuracy.

In parallel, we will start the development of a compact system based on optical
parametric oscillators, which has the advantages of orthogonal controls of
wavelength and repetition rate, as well as offering access to a broad range of
visible and infrared wavelengths.

We will evaluate applications for these stabilized mode-locked lasers. In
particular, the stabilized ring optical parametric oscillator will enable the
measurement of phase shifts with a much better sensitivity than the value of
10-9 that we obtained with unstabilized ring lasers. A specific application is
as a laser gyroscope that could be used for geodesic applications. Having at the
end of the program simultaneously stabilized at least two independent mode-
locked lasers, we will be able to study the synchronization of these lasers
through injection lock-in. This will answer a question for ultrafast
telecommunication: how much (or how little) optical power is required to phase
lock two independent sources, once their modes coincide to a few Hz?
