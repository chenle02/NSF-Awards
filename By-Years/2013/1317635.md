Simonian(1317635). This proposal explores a new approach to cascading-reaction
sensing using CNTs and enzymes to enable a LbL construction of the cascading
layers on a single electrode. Previously, the common method for multianalyte
detection and multiplexing used a combination of multi-electrode arrays, using
complicated microfluidics, multi-spot biorecognition elements, and signal
processing via heavy computing. The simplified approach should enable greater
efficiencies, reliability, and scale-up potential. The presence of different
enzymes at each layer will provide a unique capability to recognize substrates
that are down-stream of cascade reactions. The intermediate products may also be
detected, based on differences in individual oxidation potentials for each
enzyme, enabling simultaneous detection and discrimination of several target
analytes from one electrode.
