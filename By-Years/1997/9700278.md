*** 9700278 BEYERLEIN This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities (CRIF) Program will enable the Department of Chemistry at Clemson
University to acquire a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.
This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the
following: (1) prodrug: DNA interactions of bifunctional enediynes, (2)
asymmetric organocopper conjugate additions, (3) novel fluorinated polymers and
materials, (4) main group clusters and their transition metal complexes, and (5)
preparation and characterization of highly water-soluble fullerene materials.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology. ***
