This research addresses open questions on the interaction of aging, financial
security in an information society, and elder perceptions of the risks of
digital information technologies. The end technological goal is to improve the
design of security and privacy technologies for older Americans. Note that
security on the Internet is designed by younger, risk-seeking technologists who
are primarily male. Those over 65 who require a secure Internet are by
definition older, also risk-averse, rarely technologists, and more often than
not female. It is not surprising that there is a mismatch between the mental
models of secure system designers and this growing group of users. In terms of
method, this research will include an examination of the value of multimedia
combined with the scale enabled by traditional surveys. Specifically, the
research will evaluate the inclusion of multimedia interactive technologies in
terms of enabling inclusion of the nuance previously possible only in smaller
scale qualitative work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The implications of computer
security being systematically ill-suited for elders are profound, and improving
this mismatch is the broader implication of this work. Never has so much wealth
been accessible with such ease by so many predators. Organized crime reaches out
from remote jurisdictions, where American law enforcement cannot reach back. The
combination of the concentration of wealth among Americans over age 65, the
global unsecured network, availability of personally identifiable information
used for authentication, increasingly organized online crime, and the
disproportionate lack of technical expertise among elders can create a perfect
digital storm. Yet this problem is profoundly under-studied. Without computer
security technology built to serve elders, these risks cannot be effectively,
systematically addressed.&lt;br/&gt;
