Dr. Darrell J. Woodman and other members of the Chemistry Department of
University of Washington are being supported to continue a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects cover all areas of chemistry- analytical,
inorganic, organic, organometallic, bioorganic, biophysical, environmental,
nuclear and chemical physics. A unique feature of this program is that at least
half of the participants will be chosen from smaller schools in the region to
work under the joint supervision of department faculty together with faculty
mentors from their home institution. In addition special emphasis will be given
women, minorities and the physically disabled.
