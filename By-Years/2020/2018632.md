Why do consumers willingly pay more for brand name products compared to non-
branded products even though the two have the same attributes. This doctoral
dissertation research in economics (DDRIE) research project will use economic
theory and experimental methods to investigate the social network source of
value for a product. The researchers argue that people pay more for a product to
signal prestige or because people they look up to consume that product. The
researchers will collect data on a number imported and domestically produced
consumer goods to test this theory. The results of this social learning approach
to product value has important policy implications: it could help businesses to
market their products both domestically and abroad. Second, by helping to
disentangle social interaction sources of value from the social learning source,
it provides a guide to producers in targeting their products effectively. The
results of this research therefore contributes to economic growth, increased
employment, and improves the wellbeing of Americans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project uses an experimental game to study how social interactions affect
consumers’ perception of the value of goods they buy. The proposal develops an
endogenous network-dependent definition of product quality based on social
network signaling and social learning and develops a model to explain this
social signaling value determination. The main hypothesis is that the demand for
a product is partly determined by the consumer’s desire to signal status or
because the product is consumed by aspirational peers. The researchers will then
use both survey and experimental methods to test this hypothesis on a set of
goods. The results of this innovative DDRIE make significant contributions to
the IO, development economics, and trade literatures as well as point the way
for researchers to seriously consider social signaling when modeling the demand.
The result of the project will help researchers distinguish social leaning from
shared utility and social signaling. The results of this research project has
policy implications for both consumers and producers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
