The Antarctic cryosphere is a key component of the global climate system, being
linked to global sea level through ice sheet mass balance, and to the global
ocean overturning circulation through sea ice driven production of Antarctic
Bottom Water. This research seeks enhance understanding of cryosphere-climate
models interactions in the Antarctic, thereby allowing for attribution of
recently observed changes, and for improved quantification of the physical
drivers of model-simulated future climate. The project also seeks to contribute
to the education and professional training of a graduate research assistant.
Educational outreach will occur by partnering with local high school science
teachers and students as part of the Secondary School Field Research Program
(SSFRP). This partnership with the SSFRP will develop a 4- week curriculum on
climate modeling that will be suitable for use in high school Earth Science or
Physics courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three objectives. First,
the cryospheric response to changes in the top-of the-atmosphere (TOA) absorbed
solar radiation (ASR) at high southern latitudes will be assessed. The second
objective of the project is to quantify the effect of ozone depletion and
recovery on the mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet. This will be
accomplished both by analyzing the (Whole Atmosphere Community Climate) WACCM
simulated surface mass balance, and by performing a series of sensitivity
simulations with a stand-alone ice sheet model (the Ice Sheet System Model, or
ISSM) forced by WACCM output. A third objective is to determine the atmospheric
response to Antarctic sea-ice changes. This will be achieved by running WACCM
with prescribed sea surface temperatures and sea-ice concentrations in order to
examine the impacts of different sea-ice anomaly
patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
