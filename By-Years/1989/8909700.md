Hybrid, or mixed-use, housing are residential structures wherein both
residential and commercial/retail spaces and activities are located, residents
of those structures occupy and manage both spaces; and such housing is
intentionally designed to incorporate both spaces. Given the increasing
population of homebased workers, a future market demand for such homes is
likely. In order to undertake a research study of the development and design of
such homes nationwide, certain preliminary activities need to be developed and
refined in a planning study: locating cases (which is currently an on-going
activity), gathering information of such cases from documents and site visits,
and developing a coding instrument for analysis of such sites on characteristics
of architectural design and layout, materials, construction techniques,
sociodemographics, financial arrangements, codes and ordinances, insurance
factors, etc.
