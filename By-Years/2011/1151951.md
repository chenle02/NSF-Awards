The workshop aims to identify the research challenges and opportunities for
transforming the scientific discovery process through advances in computing and
information sciences in general, and intelligent systems in particular. It seeks
to define a research agenda in Discovery Informatics. The workshop is organized
around three themes: (1) efficient experimentation and discovery processes, (2)
practical issues in building and refining predictive models from scientific
data, and (3) social computing for science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
participants include experts and visionaries in the areas of knowledge
representation and inference, machine learning and data mining, experiment
design and planning, information integration, computational models of discovery,
collaborative technologies, robotics, social networks, visualization, and
representative application (science) domains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in
Discovery Informatics is expected to integrate advances in multiple
subdisciplines of artificial intelligence and cognitive science to develop the
next generation informatics driven exploratory apparatus for scientific
discovery. The resulting formal frameworks and computational tools have the
potential to not only accelerate discovery but enable new modes of discovery by
providing the tools that empower scientists to reach across disciplinary
boundaries. Such tools can also contribute to enhanced modes of teaching and
learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the workshop (including the
workshop report) will be freely disseminated to the larger scientific research
and educational community.
