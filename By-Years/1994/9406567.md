9406567 Gordon The PI will continue his research using the shapes of marine
magnetic anomalies due to seafloor spreading for estimating accurate
paleomagnetic poles for oceanic lithosphere. These new, more accurate, poles
permit testing of plate reconstructions, testing for the motion of hotspots
relative to the spin axis and to one another, testing of the axial geocentric
dipole hypothesis and estimating the time-averaged quadrupole component of the
paleomagnetic field, and investigating other problems of global tectonics,
geomagnetism, and geodynamics. ****
