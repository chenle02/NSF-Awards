This grant funds a one-day workshop for researchers who aspire to participate in
NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program. The workshop is by
invitation or submission only, and is open to people with research interests in
secure and trustworthy computing who are not currently funded by SaTC or any of
its predecessor programs (Trustworthy Computing and/or Cyber Trust). The goal of
this workshop is to help aspiring SaTC PIs understand what NSF (and NSF review
panels) are looking for in reviewing SaTC proposals, with the goal of increasing
the quality of submitted proposals and, in turn, the percentage of proposals
funded.
