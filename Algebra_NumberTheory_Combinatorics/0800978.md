ABSTRACT

Principal Investigator: Billey, Sara Proposal Number: DMS - 0800978 Institution:
University of Washington Title: Computational/Combinatorial Considerations In
Topology, Coxeter Groups, and Representation Theory



This proposal outlines an ambitious research program attacking problems in three
areas: the affine Grassmannian, fundamentals of permutations, and representation
theory inspired by complexity theory. The central theme is to facilitate
computation and understanding in these areas through study of very specific
posets, Weyl groups, generating functions, and partitions controlling the micro
level structures which we often overlook on the first glimpse of the subjects.

At the heart of algebraic combinatorics is the philosophy that every aspect of
mathematics can be made more precise, more concrete and more computationally
feasible by identifying key combinatorial structures. Borrowing a term from
analysis, this proposal is about ``micro local mathematics''. All of the work
proposed will have a broad impact in several areas of pure math and theoretical
computer science. All of the proposed work will have a computational focus which
will further develop computer proof techniques. All of the proposed work will
have a human impact component. The PI has a strong track record of mentoring
students at all levels and junior faculty. This grant will greatly enhance the
vertically integrated research environment in the Combinatorics Group at the
University of Washington and give the group the resources needed to attack these
hard problems.
