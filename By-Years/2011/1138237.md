The goal of this NUE in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Transforming
Nanoscale Science and Engineering Undergraduate Education", at Columbia
University, under the direction of Dr. Chee Wei Wong, is to create an
institutionalized cross-disciplinary nanotechnology undergraduate program,
reaching across multiple departments to serve a targeted ~90 (25% of cohort)
undergraduates. Seven laboratory modules on nanoscale science and engineering
will be developed, based on scientific advances by the project team such as in
graphene, nanomechanics, nanostructured solar photovoltaics, and
nanoelectronics. These hands-on modules &lt;br/&gt;will be taught in conjunction
with a theoretical numerical simulations class on the foundations of
nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classes will reach out across Columbia
University and Barnard College (an undergraduate women's college), and the
laboratory modules can further serve as stand-alone experiments in other
nanoscale related curricula. In addition, research experiences for
undergraduates will be provided under this program, as well as summer
internships at GE Global Research and the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at
Brookhaven National Laboratory. All course materials will be made freely
available online for broad dissemination. Lectures in the theoretical
foundations class will be recorded and made available for asynchronous download.
