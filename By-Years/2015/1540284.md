Complexity theory, through such concepts as NP-completeness, distinguishes
between computational problems that have relatively efficient solutions and
those that are intractable. Complexity theory has the potential to become a real
guide for algorithm design, identifying precisely what algorithmic performance
is obtainable. A fundamental model of computation is the Boolean circuit,
composed of interconnected logic gates. Complexity theory studies the
capabilities of Boolean circuits when limits are placed on circuit size and
circuit depth.  Recently, in what seems to be a paradox, breakthroughs on lower
bounds in circuit  complexity  have been derived from the discovery of
remarkably efficient algorithms.  The precise time complexity of SATISFIABILITY
and other NP-complete problems is now linked to progress on a variety of
fundamental questions in the theory of computation, many in surprising and
counter-intuitive ways. These connections involve the exact complexity of basic
polynomial-time solvable problems such as matrix multiplication and triangle
detection.

The workshop, which will be open to the public,  will gather researchers from
computational complexity and algorithm design to discuss and extend these new
developments.  This workshop will foster discussions that could lead to new
algorithmic ideas for basic problems (often utilizing techniques from lower
bounds), as well as new circuit lower bounds (utilizing improved algorithms).
Students will be encouraged to participate in the workshop.
