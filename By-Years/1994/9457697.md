9457697 Yu Conceptually new multifunctional polymers and new polymerization
methodology will be developed. New conjugated photorefractive polymers with
enhanced quantum yield and charge carrier's mobility will be thoroughly
investigated. New conjugated liquid crystalline (LC) polymers and their unique
properties will be studied. %%% ***
