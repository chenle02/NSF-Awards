Dr. Jeffrey R. Long has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Long received the doctoral degree from Harvard University under
the supervision of Professor Richard H. Holm. Dr. Long will continue research at
the University of California at Berkeley under the sponsorship of Professor Paul
Alivisatos. The postdoctoral research consist of a range of studies involving
the role of external ligands in tuning the properties of semiconductor
nanocrystals. The extent to which crystallite properties may be altered or
controlled by manipulating ligands on the surface of the inorganic core of
nanocrystals is examined. The long term goal is to develop a detailed
understanding of the processes involved in solid formation. The Postdoctoral
Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
