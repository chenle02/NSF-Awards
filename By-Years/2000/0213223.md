Rigoberto Hernandez of the Georgia Institute of Technology is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop models that describe
nonstationary dynamics in chemical reactivity. The major objectives of this
research are (1) to develop non-phenomenological formulations of existing
irreversible generalized Langevin equation (iGLE) models and direct isomorphisms
between the latter and nontrivial chemical systems; (2) to explore nonstationary
models that do not have the multiplicative structure of the iGLE; and (3) to
explore chemical applications to polymerization and protein folding dynamics of
the nonstationary models with new chemical insights and techniques.

The expected outcome of this research is an improved understanding of the
chemistry that takes place under heterogeneous nonequilibrium conditions. For
example, the reaction conditions in solid-state polymerization strongly
determine the final polymer distribution. Similarly, the time-dependent
viscosity of a thermosetting polymer is an important characteristic in the
reaction injection mold processing of encapsulants.
