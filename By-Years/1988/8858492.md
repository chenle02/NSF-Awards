For some genes, alternative splicing is a major control point for gene
expression. That is, splicing patterns change with differences in cell-type, or
during the development of an organism. The biochemical mechanism and the
biological strategy by which mRNA splicing event will be the focus here. A model
system, the preprotachykinin gene, has been chosen for investigation. It
produces a single pre-mRNA that is spliced differently in primary sensory
neurons compared to other cell types. Studies will be aimed at the interaction
of pre-mRNAs with cellular factors isolated from extracts of different cell-
types. Intact cells will be explored, Established cell lines will be used, some
of which exhibit a neuronal phenotype and others which differentiate into
primary sensory neurons in culture after induction with nerve growth factor.
