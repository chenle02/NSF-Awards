Dr. Carl Woese of the University of Illinois is continuing his pioneering
studies on the evolution, phylogeny, and classification of bacteria, by using
nucleotide sequence data from ribosomal RNA to quantify genetic differences
between bacteria. By comparing the sequence of ribosomal RNA from a variety of
organisms, a branching pattern of genealogical affinity can be constructed; few
nucleotide differences between species indicate close evolutionary relationship
(the sharing of similar genomes from a close common ancestor) whereas greater
gene differences indicate more ancient divergence between lineages. Dr. Woese is
concentrating on clostridial and flavobacterial organisms, and other groups
traditionally called Gram-positive types. An added dividend to this phylogenetic
analysis of bacteria is the use of ribosomal sequences to design species-
diagnostic oligonucleotide probes. These probes have been successfully employed
in both medical and ecological studies to identify bacteria that have otherwise
proved difficult or impossible to culture in the laboratory. In addition, the
phylogenetic relationships revealed through comparative nucleotide sequences
provide an evolutionary framework for interpreting and studying other aspects of
the physiology, biochemistry, and ecology of microbial organisms.
