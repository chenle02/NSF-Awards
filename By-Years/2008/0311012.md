0311012&lt;br/&gt;Parks&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the PI and students from
Harvard University, in a collaboration with Manfred Kappes of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Karlruhe, Germany. Through the collaboration, the
researchers will study the structural properties of nano-sized metal clusters
using electron diffraction on cluster ions stored in ion quadrupole traps. The
US and German groups will correlate structural properties measured for gold,
silver, copper, and indium clusters of varying size with their melting
temperature. The added capabilities of the German lab will be indispensable to
understanding the unique temperature dependence of the structure of nano-sized
metal clusters, and essential for the design and application of new structures
based on the chose class of materials. This award enhances the collaboration
between two strong cluster science groups with complementary expertise and
capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also advances international human
resources through the participation of graduate students and post-doctoral
fellows, thereby contributing to the development of a globally engaged work
force.&lt;br/&gt;
