9701001 WELLER Tiger moths are known for their brightly colored adults and
woolly bear larvae. These moths also have fascinating life history traits such
as complex associations with toxic hostplants, extreme mimicry of wasps and
other insects, and elaborate courtship sequences involving both scent and sound.
An understanding of the phylogenetic history of tiger moths is critical if
scientists are to understand when, how and why these traits appeared. For many
groups of moths, however, phylogenetic histories are not, or are poorly,
understood. In this research, Susan Weller and doctoral candidate Rebecca
Simmons will investigate the phylogenetic history of wasp mimicry and male scent
structures in a group of tiger moths called the Myrmecopsis group
(Euchromiinae). The phylogeny of the group will be reconstructed from internal
morphological characters not associated with mimicry and courtship. Data will be
gathered by examining specimens borrowed from museums with major holdings. Once
the phylogeny of this group is determined, the history of mimicry and courtship
structures will be traced on this framework. This study should yield information
leading to an understanding of how, when and why complex behaviors appeared in
various groups of animals.
