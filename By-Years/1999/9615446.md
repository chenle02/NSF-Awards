This study continues investigating the equilibrium structure of intense magnetic
flux tubes, as calculated by solving the magnetostatic equation sin the thin
flux tube approximation. Most significant about past studies was the inclusion
of multistream radiative transfer in cylindrical geometry, and the continuous
transition between radiative and convective energy transport. The flux tube's
influence on the ambient medium was not taken into account, however, thus
limiting previous work. This effect is important for examining the horizontal
temperature variation, especially at the interface between the flux tube and
external medium. In this study, the PIs will use a multidimensional treatment of
radiative transfer in cylindrical geometry to include this effect.
