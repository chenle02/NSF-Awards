This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2008.
The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for
the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The
title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Beverly C. Ajie
is "The developmental and evolutionary origins of phenotypic modularity in
threespine stickleback." The host institution for this research is the
University of Oregon and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Steven Arnold and
William Cresko.

The complexity of organisms, how their many physical and behavioral traits come
together to produce a functional whole, has fascinated ecologists and
evolutionary biologists alike for hundreds of years. Nevertheless, the origins
and implications of organismal complexity, or modularity, as is it often
referred to, are not yet well understood. This project is examining how the
internal processes of development that unfold over organisms' lifetimes and the
external process of natural selection interact to give rise to modularity. The
simulation modeling makes it possible to 'observe' the evolution of modularly,
which in reality occurs very slowly, in just days. The experimental work
leverages the unique biology and molecular genetic tools of the threespine
stickleback fish system, to better understand the developmental and genetic
bases of modularity.

The training objectives for this research include techniques in molecular
genetics, genomics, population and quantitative genetic theory, and computer
programming. Furthermore, because organisms' complexity or modularity is an
important determinant of their future evolutionary trends, the findings of this
work will bear on some of today's most pressing scientific issues including
genetically modified organisms, biodiversity conservation, targeted drug
therapy, and the evolution of antibiotic resistance.
