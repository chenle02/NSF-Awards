The main objective of this research is to develop new decomposition schemes for
decentralized control and computations of complex systems. The schemes serve to
identify weakly coupled groups of variables (subsystems) that can be considered
independently as subproblems and their solutions combined in some way to come up
with the solution of the overall problem. Epsilon decompositions will be applied
to large plants composed of overlapping subsystems. The main motivation is that
the decompositions can help in formulating decentralized control laws with
overlapping information sets, which are superior to disjoint control laws,
especially when control of complex power systems is considered.
