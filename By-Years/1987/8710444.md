With assistance from the International Palm Society and NSF, Cornell University
and its Bailey Hortorium will host an international symposium on the biology and
evolution of palms. Fields of coverage include systematics, biogeography,
palynology and anatomy, pollination and hybridization, preliminary DNA analyses,
ecology, and economic uses. A major goal of the meeting is to chart new paths of
research on this important group of tropical plants. Further, the meeting will
coincide with publication of a monumental encyclopedia of palm biology, Genera
Palmarum, research for which has been supported by NSF for several years. The
travel grant will help cover expenses for nine foreign scientists from Europe,
Africa, Asia, and South America, a truly international gathering, all of whom
will give presentations at the meetings. The symposium is organized by Drs.
Natalie Uhl, a world-recognized expert on palm biology, and David Young, the
director of the Bailey Hortorium, a major center for many years of palm
research.
