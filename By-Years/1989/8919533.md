This is a proposal to support a Conference on Tissue Engineering. Tissue
Engineering has been identified as an area of a special initiative within the
NSF, and this conference is an outgrowth of an NSF workshop that was held in
1988. The conference is to be held in Keystone, CO during the spring of 1990.
The meeting has been widely publicized, and a large group of invited speakers
has been assembled. The budget is to defray the conference-related costs of some
of the invited speakers.
