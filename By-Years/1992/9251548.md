The aim of the project is to provide a hands-on laboratory experience to
introductory psychology students in the following areas: animal behavior
analysis, perception/cognition, neuroscience, and developmental psychology. By
particpating in these laboratories both majors and non-majors become familiar
with a variety of research techniques and conceptual issues. The psychology
curriculum is being revised to take advantage of and build upon this early
introduction to experimentation and experimental thinking.
