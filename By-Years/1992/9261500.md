The PI will prepare environmentally degradable radar chaff made from aerogel
solids. The chaff will have wing loadings, grams per square meter, tailored to
be one of two orders of magnitude less than is possible with present thin film
coated chaff. The design flexibility of the novel chaff will allow more
extensive and stable measurements of atmospheric phenomena than are now
possible. The capability to control the fall rate will enhance the ability to
make reproducible measurements. The benign coated aerogel chaff is naturally
degraded by environmental moisture and does not require bacterial action or
special treatment to assure biogradability.
