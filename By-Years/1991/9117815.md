Volcanoes are an important source of trace metals and gases to the atmosphere.
However, the volume of these gases and aerosols emitted annually is unknown. The
principal objective of this project is to determine the emission rate of SO2 and
trace gases and metals from volcanoes in Kamchatka, USSR, especially volcanoes
of andesitic composition. The emission rate of SO2 will be measured by a semi-
automated correlation spectrometer (COSPEC V). Aerosols will be sampled using a
quartz crystal microbalance cascade impactor and examined by scanning electron
microscopy to characterize their size and composition. Logistical support will
be provided by the Institute of Volcanology on Kamchatka. the project should not
only provide new data and insight into the aerosols emitted by andesitic
volcanoes, but will also enable American scientists to study volcanoes in a
previously restricted part of the world.
