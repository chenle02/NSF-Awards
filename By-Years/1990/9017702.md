This research will support the post doctoral investigator John Kao, who will
work with the principal investigator, Volker Wihstutz. They will study necessary
and sufficient and easy to check Hoermander type conditions for the simplicity
of the Lyapunov spectrum of a linear or linearized stochastic dynamical system.
These conditions will be related to the known conditions in terms of
irreducibility and contractibility of the system group.
