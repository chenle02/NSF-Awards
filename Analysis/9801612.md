Abstract Klimek The principal investigator proposes to continue and expand in
new directions an ongoing program of studying quantized spaces and dynamical
systems on such spaces by means of the techniques of operator algebras and non-
commutative differential geometry. The ultimate goals of the program are: * To
understand the mathematics of quantization of systems (involving both finitely
and infinitely many degrees of freedom) with complicated dynamics; * To study
the non-commutative geometric principles underlying the physics of the
microworld, and in particular possible implications for quantum chaos; * To
explore new mathematical phenomena relating operator theory to other fields of
mathematics. Non-commutative geometry is a new direction of mathematics created
in the eighties. Its prime objective is to study objects, called non-commutative
spaces or manifolds, which are not ordinary geometric objects but still have a
geometric flavor. Examples of structures of this sort arise naturally e.g. in
physical theories of subatomic phenomena. Methods of non-commutative geometry
became a powerful tool in studying various problems in modern analysis and
understanding the fundamentals of the physics of the microworld. It is proposed
to study examples of non-commutative manifolds and dynamical systems on them
with emphasis put on applications to quantum physics and operator theory.
