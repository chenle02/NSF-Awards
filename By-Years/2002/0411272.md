This international conference will provide a forum for scientists and engineers
in Metabolic Engineering and related areas to share progress, discuss
challenges, and debate issues. It will focus on the theme of systems
integration: from genome to product. Highly innovative Metabolic Engineering
research presentations and posters from both industry and academia will be
invited. This international conference will build on the success of previous
conferences (ME-I to ME-IV). After more than a decade, the field of metabolic
engineering has evolved and developed into a major thrust area across
engineering and biology. In particular, the advent of genomic analysis and high
throughput analytical methods has made it possible for the first time to begin a
large scale integration of metabolic and regulatory information. The field of
metabolic engineering has taken advantage of this progress and made significant
contributions to Systems Biology. ME-V will provide a forum for discussing new
developments in fundamental and applied aspect of Metabolic Engineering and
Systems Biology.
