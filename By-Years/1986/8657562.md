The PI is studying the complexity of parallel algorithms. One direction of the
research is to develop fast parallel algorithms for simple combinatorial
problems using an idealized model of parallel computation. The major issue is to
identify techniques that yield algorithms that are both fast and make an
efficient use of processors. A second direction of research is to study
realistic models of parallel computation. There is currently a large gap between
the theoretical models of parallel computation and feasible parallel machines.
An attempt is being made to close this gap by studying models that incorporate
features such as locality of reference, memory contention and varying degrees of
synchronization. The PI has been judged to be an outstanding computer scientist
by the Presidential Young Investigator panel.
