Due to the culmination of the recent reapportionment of FCC frequency bands and
the acceleration of wireless device complexity, simultaneous access to multiple
diverse wireless frequency bands is becoming more of a reality. Naturally, the
question arises: How can simultaneous access to a wide range of frequency bands
with distinct propagation and communication capabilities improve current
wireless network performance? In this CAREER research, a foundation is laid for
exploiting multiple frequency bands for multihop wireless networks from per-link
to network-wide decisions. To do so, this project uses experimental design,
measurement analysis, analytical modeling, and embedded programming on an array
of devices and testbeds from mobile phones globally reachable via application
downloads to in-lab and in-the-field wireless
infrastructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three key innovations to the
work: 1) An experimental characterization for multiple frequency band
propagation characteristics by leveraging mobile phone measurements and in-field
trials on a number of frequency bands, 2) A network planning framework for
scalable, multiband architectures that uses empirical and analytical models for
capacity prediction of heterogeneous topological formations across a diverse set
of frequency bands, and 3) Protocols that coordinate and adapt link parameters
across multiple wireless frequency bands, guided by real-time measurements of
channel variability, an understanding of environmental context, and on-line
training based on historical performance. As a result of work, multihop wireless
network researchers, developers, and infrastructure providers can leverage the
framework to exploit multiple frequency bands in a broad class of network
protocols, topologies, and environments via available experimental data,
analytical model development, and protocol design.
