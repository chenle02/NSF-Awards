Topological field theories arose in the 1980s through the work of mathematicians
studying low dimensional topology, including Donaldson, Floer, Gromov, and
others. In his effort to understand their work, Witten discovered that, in
dimensions 2,3 and 4, these theories could be viewed as a special kind of
supersymmetric quantum field theory. This combination of ideas has proved to be
a fertile source of new mathematics in a variety of fields, including geometry,
topology, and algebra. Parallel to this work, Atiyah and Segal presented an
axiomatization of topological field theories which allows their study using the
techniques of algebra, and in particular of homological algebra. Their has been
a great deal of recent work in this direction and the purpose of this conference
and its associated graduate student workshop is to survey the state of the field
and to explore directions for the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field theories
arise in physics to describe the behavior of sub-atomic particles, their
interactions, and the forces that act on them.&lt;br/&gt;Topological field
theories arise from string theory in physics and the observation that particles
may not be discrete objects, but one-dimensional, if still very small,
"strings". This has inspired a great deal of important mathematics; in
particular in the geometry of low-dimensional objects -- a field that has been
completely transformed in the past twenty-five years. The conference funded here
will bring together mathematicians and mathematical physicists in this and
closely related areas to gain a better understanding of where the most fertile
areas of interaction presently are. The conference will be preceded by a week-
long workshop intended to give new researchers to be exposed to the latest ideas
and techniques in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
