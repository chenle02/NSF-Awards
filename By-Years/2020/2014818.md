The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to increase the adoption of solar power by reducing the life-cycle
cost of solar energy. The proposed work is to use a novel approach to improving
the efficiency of any solar module with an additive manufacturing process. The
technology tunes sunlight to improve its absorption and maximize its conversion
into electric power. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed SBIR Phase I project
will advance the development of a high-precision additive manufacturing process
to create uniform optical layers for solar cells. A layer of nano-optical
coating is created on either a plate-glass or polycarbonate substrate. The
proposed coating restricts the wavelength distribution of incident photons to
match the bandgap of mono- and polycrystalline silicon solar cells. The coating
enhances coherence by embedding a nano-particle layer creating localized surface
plasmon resonance on the crystalline silicon solar cell surface. Photons are
scattered back to the solar cell with a one-dimensional distributed Bragg
reflector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
