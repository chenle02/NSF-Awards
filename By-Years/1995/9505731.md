The aim of this project is to obtain new results which will help reduce the
time and computational effort required when using the computer simulation models
for optimization found in many discrete-event systems. The focus is on the
enhancement of the Score Function and Likelihood Ratio methods to provide
accurate estimates for derivative and perturbation, respectively. The goals are
improvements of the existing variance reduction techniques, theoretical
unification, some extensions, and advancements in the practical implementation
of these `single run` methods. The project will develop procedures and
algorithms, investigate their accuracy versus execution time behavior, and
present numerical results for a wide variety of queuing, inventory, and
reliability models.
