Due to the consistency of the formation of rainbands, the Island of Hawaii is an
excellent natural laboratory for the study of the interactions of the larger
scale flow with mountainous terrain. An experiment held during the Summer of
1985 and subsequent numerical modelling studies have led to a new theory on the
formation mechanisms of the rainbands off the east coast of the Big Island. The
earliest work indicated that rainband formation was caused chiefly by the
interactions between sea/land breeze, mountain/valley breeze and the trade
winds. The more recent research, however, indicates that under strong trade wind
conditions, the island scale flow may be more complex and involves the dynamical
interactions between the strong trades and orography. As part of a larger
experiment, the Principal Investigators propose to collect data to test this new
hypothesis. In addition to furthering our understanding of the physics of these
rainbands, the simplicity of the physics associated with this process should
allow an unique opportunity to verify and test a mesoscale numerical model which
will have value beyond this experiment.
