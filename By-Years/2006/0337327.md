ABSTRACT

This three-day workshop will clarify the community needs and opportunities to:
1) apply high-resolution geochronologic calibration of the geologic timescale to
a variety of geological and evolutionary problems; 2) assess the current
analytical capacity and interest within the geological community; and 3)
formulate recommendations for addressing these needs, including opportunities
for outreach throughout the geological community. Participants will be drawn
from a variety of geochronological approaches, and a wide range of geological
and paleontological disciplines, including paleontology, chemo-, magneto-, and
biostratigraphy. A website is being prepared to facilitate discussion among
workshop participants. A report on the discussions at the workshop will be
presented to NSF by winter 2004.
