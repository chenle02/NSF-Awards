A grant has been awarded to Merrill Peterson, Western Washington University, to
study the evolution of premating barriers between two hybridizing beetle
species. The research combines lab and field studies to determine the costs of
hybridizing across a 75km-wide zone of hybridization. In measuring these costs,
the research will take into account the degree to which multiply-mating females
preferentially use sperm from same-species males, and measure material benefits
females may gain from hybrid matings. This study will also determine the balance
between selection against hybridization and the rate of genetic exchange with
populations outside of the zone of hybridization, a process that will tend to
counter the effects of selection. This research program will address long-
standing questions regarding the evolution of reproductive barriers between
species, using a novel geographic perspective. In so doing, it will provide
answers to fundamental questions in speciation research. The grant will also
support the training and mentorship of underrepresented undergraduates through a
summer internship program, Minority Opportunities for Research on Evolution
(MORE). Participants in MORE will get hands-on experience and training for
careers in biological research.
