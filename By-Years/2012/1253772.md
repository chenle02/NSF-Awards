Excessive energy consumption on a mobile phone irritates the user with short,
unpredictable battery life. Excess consumption in a datacenter hurts a
business's bottom line and has the potential to cause large-scale failures. This
research project develops energy tracking and monitoring techniques to enable
many parties -- such as the software developer, system engineer, and end user --
to audit and control software energy consumption.

This research aims to address four issues. The first investigates the low-level
software representations needed to understand, debug, and control a parallel
application's performance and energy consumption on heterogeneous architectures
(i.e., on a multicore with accelerators). The second develops a
hardware/software energy exception framework, whereby meeting expressed energy
targets is treated as a requirement for correct computation. The division of
labor in this framework tasks hardware with monitoring and reporting energy
consumption at fine temporal and spatial granularities, while software is
responsible for expressing energy targets and handling cases in which the
targets are not met. The third explores the system-wide impacts of this energy
monitoring framework using Javascript as a testbed. The focus of this thrust is
understanding and balancing the overheads and benefits of energy tracking in
real systems. Finally, the fourth examines programmer feedback and incentives
required to develop and optimize "responsible" software that runs faster and at
lower energy cost. This project will develop the abstractions and tools
necessary to bring visibility and control to software energy consumption,
important capabilities as energy becomes one of the most critical resources in a
computing system.
