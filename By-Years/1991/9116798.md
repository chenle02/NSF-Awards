The Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains the atomic structure of macromolecules. As
of October 1991 there were 790 structural entries (196 Mbytes), if current
growth rates persist, this number could grow to 10,000 by the end of the decade.
The data provide opportunities for understanding biological function through,
for example, comparative structural research. This work addresses several
challenges in first making the PDB more accessible to molecular biologists and
crystallographers in particular, and second assisting in the management of
increasing amounts of data. Several software developments are being undertaken
in parallel, but share the same class libraries. First, a new object-based PDB
storage format provides suitable access to the levels of substructure found in
macromolecules. Second, object-based software tools that interrogate and
manipulate structural data, and assist in structure verification are being
derived from existing structured programs. Finally, a high-level query language
provides intuitive and direct interaction with the PDB. Each aspect of software
development proceeds by prototyping followed by iterative cycles of testing in
the laboratory and code modification. This work integrates the state-of-art
database research results such as object-oriented databases and knowledge bases,
software engineering results such as component and glue collaborative work such
as extended transaction models to support cooperative scientific research. These
tools could potentially precipitate the discovery of new structure-function
relationships by permitting data query in a more intuitive fashion.
