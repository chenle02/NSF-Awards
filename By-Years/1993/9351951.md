9351951 Sohl A modern laser physics laboratory is currently being developed for
use by undergraduate physics majors. The laser lab will be used to modernize
three aspects of the curriculum at Weber State University: 1) Upper-division
Modern Physics Lab experiments; 2) Applied Optics Lab experiments; and 3)
individual research projects. Typically, 15 students per year are involved with
these courses. The Laser Lab also permits the future addition to the curriculum
of an advanced undergraduate modern optics course. The Laser Lab allows students
in the Modern Physics Lab to undertake experiments involving laser induced
fluorescence, and atomic structure, lifetimes and collisional processes. These
experiments demonstrate many of the fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics.
The Applied Optics course at Weber State University has a strong laboratory
component. The Laser Lab gives the students "hands-on" experience in the
assembly, alignment, operation, and use of various laser systems. Laser
spectroscopy is well suited for undergraduate research as both the basic theory
and the experimental apparatus are within the grasp of juniors and seniors. The
Laser Lab is expanding the undergraduate research options to include atomic,
molecular, and optical physics. Thus, students are being better prepared for
future industrial or graduate school work in this critical field. The laboratory
has been designed with individual workstations which which simultaneous
operation of several experiments. By inserting a mirror or two, the laser
beam(s) can be directed to each station as needed. ***
