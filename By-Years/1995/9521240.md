9521240 Fuiman Fluctuations in the abundances of fish stocks result from biotic
and environmental factors that affect the survival of early life stages.
Mortality from predation is a major regulator of year-class size and its
interaction with larval growth rate and the time at which larvae are vulnerabile
to predators may be the mechanisms most often operating in the sea. This
research focuses on an alternative to a generally accepted hypothesis for larval
recruitment, specifically, that growth rate and innate fitness, lot simply size,
influence survival potential of larvae. Data from ethological, modeling and
mesocosm experiments will provide a basis for understanding the importance of
predation on recruitment of larvae to adult stocks. ***
