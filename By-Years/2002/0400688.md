This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2004. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Investigating Intercellular and
Inter-kingdom Communication in the Phyllosphere." Quorum-sensing, or cell-to-
cell signaling mediated by secreted N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), occurs
between bacterial epiphytes of plant aerial leaf surfaces, in the habitat called
the phyllosphere. This research examines the regulation and disposition of
secreted AHLs in intercellular bacterial communication, and investigates AHL-
mediated inter-kingdom communication with host plants. The merging of
microbiology and plant biology research techniques are a primary training goal.
