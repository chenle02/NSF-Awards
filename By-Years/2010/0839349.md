This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a coherent
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light source for industrial application in support of
EUV lithography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broad impact of this project
represents an area of fundamental interest to optical science. The High Harmonic
Generation (HHG) process is the result of basic quantum physics at the extreme
of high energy and short time scales. The development of phase matching
techniques for HHG represents the precise coherent manipulation of matter on
unprecedented short length and time scales. A further understanding may make it
possible in future to generate coherent light at even shorter wavelengths,
suitable for ultrahigh resolution biological imaging.
