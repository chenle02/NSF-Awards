Biological networks are vital tools for modeling and analyzing complex phenomena
in systems biology. Computational network biology, an interdisciplinary field
encompassing biology, computer science, and modeling, has witnessed substantial
growth in recent years. The Eighth International Workshop on Computational
Network Biology: Modeling, Analysis, and Control (CNB-MAC 2023) will take place
in Houston, Texas, on September 3, 2023. This award will support conference
travel for a minimum of eight graduate students to attend CNB-MAC. By
participating in this workshop, students will gain firsthand knowledge of recent
advancements in computational network biology, which will have a lasting impact
on their research careers. They will also have the opportunity to present and
discuss their own research findings, benefiting from valuable feedback and
mentorship from established researchers. Furthermore, CNB-MAC will facilitate
networking and collaboration among attendees, fostering meaningful connections
within the computational network biology community. This travel support award
will offer graduate students valuable opportunities to engage with the
computational network biology community at CNB-MAC.

CNB-MAC 2023 will be held alongside ACM's Conference on Bioinformatics,
Computational Biology, and Health Informatics, the flagship conference of the
ACM Special Interest Group in Bioinformatics. The workshop aims to provide an
international scientific platform for presenting recent advances in
computational network biology while emphasizing the importance of rigorous
mathematical modeling in transforming large biomedical data into reproducible
and meaningful scientific knowledge. CNB-MAC invites original research papers
reporting new findings that have not been published elsewhere, highlights
abstracts showcasing recent journal publications' advancements, and poster
abstracts for rapid dissemination of the latest research results in
computational network biology. CNB-MAC workshops serve as an excellent venue for
young researchers in computational network biology to share ideas and engage in
deep scholarly discussions, ultimately contributing to the field's advancement.
This NSF award supporting travel to CNB-MAC for a minimum of eight graduate
students will provide essential networking and professional development
opportunities for the awardees, significantly alleviating the financial burden
associated with conference attendance, particularly for students whose mentors
are unable to cover registration and travel expenses.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
