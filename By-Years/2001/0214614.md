This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will synthesize
will demonstrate that a hybrid system combining the attributes of Jet Vapor
Deposition and Rotating Disk Reactors solves existing Silicon Carbide film
deposition problems and can be developed to create a superior film production
tool. The high speed "jet" convectively transports precursors directly to the
surface, overcoming diffusion-limited transport rates, and largely avoiding
unwanted pre-reactions in the gas phase; the rotation allows the "jets"to
uniformly "paint" the surface with precursor. Our Phase I efforts will focus on
proving that the hybrid tool will be a superior tool for Silicon Carbide epitaxy
--highly desired for microelectronic devices such as high-power, high-
temperature, high frequency devices.

Potential commercial applications of the research are expected in reliable,
micro-fabrication process. The successful development of Silicon Carbide film
deposition would represent an important advancement in metal thin film
deposition process.
