9307487 Johnson This proposal requests a continuation of core support to allow
analysis and interpretation of upper mesospheric and lower thermospheric
measurements obtained at high latitudes with the Sondre Stromfjord incoherent
scatter radar, in conjunction with complementary measurements obtained with
other ground-based instruments. The proposed studies continue and extend work
currently underway in support of the CEDAR Lower Thermospheric Coupling Study
and the Coordinated Analysis of the Thermosphere initiatives. Specifically, the
PI proposes to continue planning, analysis, and interpretation of measurements
obtained during LTCS experiments with the Sondre Stromfjord radar and
comparisons with other simultaneous radar and optical measurements and
theoretical modeling results. ***
