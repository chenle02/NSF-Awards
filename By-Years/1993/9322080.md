9322080 van Breemen This grant is for support of the 1994 FASEB Conference on
Smooth Muscle. This meeting is held once every three years and is unique in that
it is the most comprehensive meeting on smooth muscle. New developments in
techniques related to molecular biology, imaging, laser flash photolysis,
membrane permeabilization and patch clamping have contributed to important
advances in the understanding of smooth over the past three years. An organizing
principle of this meeting will be assessment of how far the field has progressed
towards answering a number of central questions as a result of this impressive
recent technical progress. The format of this meeting will particularly
encourage participation by junior scientists. ***
