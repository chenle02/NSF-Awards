Coordination and Learning in Market Entry Games In non-cooperative games with
multiple equilibria, a fundamental question is what causes players to expect
each other to implement a specific equilibrium. Stated differently, it is
important to understand what cues, in the context of the game, lead players to
focus or anticipate one equilibrium outcome out of the multiplicity, and thus
play so as to make their anticipations self-fulfilling. This study examines the
possibility that in iterated games, coordination on a specific equilibrium may
result through learning. To isolate the role of learning, other previously
identified means of producing coordination (e.g., pre-play communication, equity
considerations, and environmental cues) are controlled for.
