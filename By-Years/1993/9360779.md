9360779 Hawkins An external guided wave optical modulator is proposed which
provides the combination of high bandwidth, low insertion loss and linearity.
Apeldyn will design, fabricate, and test a novel multiple quantum well
electroabsorption modulator, designed to operate at an optical wavelength of
1300 nm, at microwave frequencies in excess of 40 GHz, with an insertion loss of
less than 3dB, a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 40dB, a composite triple beat
dynamic range of at least 55db and a two-tone spurious free dynamic range of at
least 80dB. The multiple quantum well layer will consist of indium gallium
arsenide phosphide wells with indium phosphide barriers. Our modulator design is
small, lightweight and rugged. ***
