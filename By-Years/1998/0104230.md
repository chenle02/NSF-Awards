0104230&lt;br/&gt;Gutierrez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program award
will provide support for cooperative research between Dr. Gaston Gutierrez of
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and Dr. Marcos A. Reyes Santos of the
Universidad Michoacana in Morelia, Mexico, on a project entitled "Search for
Glueballs in High Energy Central Reactions."&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental objective
of all particle physics research is to understand the interactions of the basic
forms of matter and their structure. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is currently
the leading theory governing the structure and interactions of particles subject
to the nuclear force. A unique feature of QCD is that the force carrier, called
gluons, may form bound states known as glueballs. At present, there is little
experimental evidence about such states. This proposal will allow the
collaborators to analyze existing Fermilab data (Experiment 690), which was
collected using an 800 GeV proton beam on a liquid hydrogen target. The results
of this analysis will serve to confirm the existence of glueballs in various
reactions and increase our understanding of elementary particle
physics.&lt;br/&gt;
