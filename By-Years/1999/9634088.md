The Louisiana Systemic Improvement Program (LaSIP) proposes to capitalize on its
first five years of NSF funding, by aligning recent reform projects with LaSIP
goals and strategies. New reform efforts include the Learn Commission, and a
USDE Technology Challenge award. LaSIP will use its position of strong influence
in the stateOs educational framework to implement systemic reform strategies at
the local district level, through the auspices of local Learn Commission funding
and the networking capabilities operationalized by the Challenge award. LaSIP
will further its inroads into the stateOs reform of education by continuing and
expanding its professional development opportunities for teachers and
administrators; by providing guidance for local curriculum development; and by
changing the way teacher education is structured in the state. Local efforts
will focus on leadership development among teachers; working with teams of
teachers and administrators; and using professional societies and organizations
as the bridge between state curriculum frameworks, and the development of local
curricula. The initiative will deploy its efforts through 8 Regional Partnership
Initiatives, which will be determined through a competitive grant process, as
well as the traditional and expanded professional development activities through
a competitive grant process. ***
