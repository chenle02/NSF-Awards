The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to address an important, yet unsolved
problem in solar physics: the heating of the solar carona. He starts from the
assumption that this heating is caused by the damping in the carona of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, which start from turbulence and the associated
fluctuations of magnetic fields in the photosphere. Two experiments are planned,
both of which make use of effects that the MHD waves have on extragalactic radio
waves as they pass through the solar corona and the solar wind very close to the
sun. In the first experiment, the PI will measure angular broadening of radio
sources viewed through the solar corona's turbulent plasma and attempt to obtain
information on the spatial power spectrum of the turbulence. In the second
experiment, the PI will observe extragalactic radio sources to measure Faraday
rotation that are due to the density and magnetic field irregularities in the
solar corona. This experiment will be an extension of observations by Hollwer et
al. of radio signals emitted by the Helios spacecraft transmitter.
