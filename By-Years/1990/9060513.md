Sputtered coatings of solid lubricating dichalcogenides such as molybdenum di
have received considerable attention, particularly due to vacuum and space
applications. Conventional magnetron sputtered films of these materials on most
surfaces have short sliding life. A significant enhancement of durability of
these films under sliding can be attained by high energy ion irradiation of the
sputter deposited films. The objective of the program will be to study and
optimize the enhancement of sliding life of sputtered dichalcogenides coatings
on sapphire, M50 steel and silicon nitride by high energy (MeV) light and heavy
ion irradiations. MeV ion irradiation is preferred over keV beams because of the
current and potential use of films with thicknesses in the micron range. The
experimental program in Phase I is directed toward optimizing the conditions and
gaining understanding of sliding life enhancement of molybdenum dis coating on
sapphire by MeV ion irradiations. Both light (H+, He+) and heavy (Ni+, Ag+) ions
at doses in the range of 1x1015 to 1x1016 cm_2 are used for this study. The
insight gained in Phase I will be used in developing a Phase II program that
will address further optimization and potential applications.
