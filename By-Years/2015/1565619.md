Software is responsible for many critical government, business, and educational
functions. This project aims to develop new methods for finding and repairing
some of the most challenging, poorly understood security vulnerabilities in
modern software that have the potential to jeopardize the security and
reliability of the nation's cyber infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first
objective of this project is to design and implement a robust program analysis
framework that is capable of finding exploitable semantic bugs in modern
applications, such as accidental omission of access-control checks,
unintentional exposure of sensitive operations such as native calls and database
queries to untrusted code or users, high-complexity control structures
vulnerable to denial of service, misconfigurations of security policies, and
other errors in programs' security logic.&lt;br/&gt;The second objective is to
develop methods for automatically repairing semantic vulnerabilities by applying
program transformations that insert correct implementations of appropriate
security logic.
