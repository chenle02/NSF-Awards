9614582 Marrett Fold and thrust belts the result of collisional tectonics, are
seldom straight. The salients and recesses observed on several scales in orogens
may be the result of different mechanisms, however it is commonly difficult to
determine the three-dimensional kinematic sequences of their development. This
project will examine two salients in the Sierra Madre Oriental fold-thrust belt
where preliminary information hints at significant across-strike kinematic
variation, and probably two different mechanisms of formation. The salients are
unusually well-exposed, and are expected to provide adequate controls for
rigorous modeling. Results should help clarify the processes that give rise to
the three-dimensional complexities curved fold-thrust belts.
