Devadas Research is on logic and behavioral verification of VLSI circuit
designs, and application of hardware verification techniques to software
verification. Topics include: 1. Use of Free Binary Decision Diagrams (FBDDs) to
find useful Boolean representations of circuits and efficient manipulation
methods for them. Algorithms for combinational and sequential, synthesis, test
and verification applications are being developed. 2. Automatic methods to
verify pipelined implementations against unpipelined specifications are being
explored. The methods ensure that each data transfer that takes place upon the
execution of any instruction in the unpipelined circuit also occurs in the
pipelined circuit. A symbolic simulation method is being developed that will
efficiently verify pipelined micro- processors against instruction set
specifications. 3. FBDD representations are being used to find symbolic
traversal methods which allow for automatic software verification. These are
also being used to debug software programs by verifying that the program
satisfies correctness properties.
