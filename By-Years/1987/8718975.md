This research deals with the theoretical investigation of learning algorithms
that use examples and additional information from a teacher. It is motivated by
the problem of knowledge acquisition in expert systems. The additional
information considered includes queries to the teacher and training sequences
devised by the teacher, that is, examples of similar or related phenomena
intended to guide and simplify the learning process. The extension of the
"probably approximately correct" concept to learning from positive-only
examples, and the study of its relation to pseudo-random number generators are
also proposed.
