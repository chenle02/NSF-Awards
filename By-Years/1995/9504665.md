Dr. Diana M. Watkins has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Watkins received her doctoral degree from the University of Texas
at Austin under the supervision of Professor Marye Anne Fox. Dr. Watkins will
continue research at Columbia University under the sponsorship of Professor
Nicholas Turro. Her postdoctoral research will focus on the investigation of
host-guest interactions between noncovalently bound donors and acceptors on a
series of dendrimer macromolecules. The studies will examine rates of electron
transfer and binding affinities under a variety of conditions. Transient laser
spectroscopy will be used in the studies of the electron transfer mechanisms and
surface binding characteristics. Knowledge of these systems will contribute to
the long-range goal of design of a macromolecular system which can build up
multiple long-lived charges on a single array to catalyze multielectron
reactions using light. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry
Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden
the knowledge and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful
careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
