9411523 Elliot ABSTRACT Joint Arizona Center for Manufacturing Education and
Training Arizona State University, the University of Arizona, Northern Arizona
University and seven high-tech industrial partners will create a Joint Center
for Manufacturing Education and Training to meet the needs of industry for
engineers with post-baccalaureate manufacturing education. The comprehensive
curriculum development process will rely heavily on engineers from industry to
produce a product which is responsive to industrial needs and requirements.
Industrial partners will also participate in teaching of courses. Using jointly-
developed educational modules and a variety of delivery systems, the Center
expects to reach at least 2,000 individuals, including unemployed, minority and
women engineers, in the three year grant period. Expanded outreach to minority
populations will be provided through Northern Arizona University's connections
with the Native American communities and the University of Arizona's relations
with the Hispanic population. ***
