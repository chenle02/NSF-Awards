This Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM)
program special project is designed to assist proposing Principal Investigators
(PIs) in developing more competitive proposals; thereby, enhancing the quality
of proposal submissions and broadening the participation of PIs from various
backgrounds and institutions. This proposal enhancement activity consists of
sponsoring a one-day workshop inclusive of presentations focused on effective
proposal writing as well as a forum for prospective PIs to discuss specific
questions related to their proposals with NSF Program Directors working in the
S-STEM program. The workshop is designed to accommodate fifty participants from
various institutions throughout the country. Universities that have
traditionally been unsuccessful in receiving S-STEM awards as well as
institutions that serve historically underrepresented students are targeted for
participation in the workshop.
