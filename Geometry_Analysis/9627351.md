9627351 Deligne This grant supports an interdisciplinary program in the
interface between mathematics and physics. The program is centered around the
current and anticipated developments in quantum field theory, especially string
theory, and the mathematics needed to express and to further those theories. The
central problem is that while there are strong indications that the different
string theories are one, physicists do not yet understand in what terms this one
theory should be formulated; this awaits a combination of new physical ideas and
new mathematical structures. Among the topics to be pursued in theoretical
physics are electric-magnetic duality, supergravity, non-classical symmetries of
string theory, soliton solutions in field theory, and quantum gauge dynamics in
four dimensions. On the mathematics side, mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau three-
folds and differentiable four-manifolds are among the topics to be investigated.
The program seeks to better enable mathematicians and physicists to think about
problems of common interest from the perspective of the other field. Thus the
program contains an interdisciplinary educational objective. The investigators
will train postdoctoral fellows in mathematics and physics who can look at
problems with the intuition and perspectives of the other. Special encouragement
will be given to women applicants. This project is funded jointly by the
Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Division of Physics, and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) within the Directorate for Mathematical and
Physical Sciences. (The OMA facilitates the support of multidisciplinary
proposals that fall within the normal responsibilities of a single division by
providing an appropriate home for their consideration.)
