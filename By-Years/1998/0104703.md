The Pacific Science Center, in collaboration and with support from the
Washington NASA Space Grant Consortium, proposes a three-year program to develop
and test a model for delivering mid-scale, astronomy and space-themed exhibits
and programming in a shopping center environment, especially in rural
locations.&lt;br/&gt;The program targets an audience that does not have easy
access to a science center or that may not be inclined to take advantage of such
a facility. The exhibits and curriculum for this project will be based on
Pacific Science Center's well-tested Space Odyssey Van Program, which presently
tours elementary schools in Washington State. Phase One of the project will be a
test delivery of the existing exhibits and programming to two malls. Phase Two
involves construction and testing of the final, larger exhibits and reworking
existing programming to better fit a mall delivery environment. Phase Three
takes the newly tested devices to ten malls in suburban and rural Washington.
