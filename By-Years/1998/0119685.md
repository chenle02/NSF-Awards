AST-0119685&lt;br/&gt;Carl Akerlof&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamma ray
burst sources have been observed by gamma ray sensitive instruments onboard
spacecraft for several years. The nature of these sources remain a mystery. It
has been known for sometime that there may be an optical event associated with
the source that emits the Gamma Ray burst. This optical event associated with
the Gamma ray burst source has not been confirmed. Light curves of this optical
event will reveal basic physical processes and the high spatial frequency
sampling will provide information sufficient to provide positions accurate
enough for rapid follow-up. This experiment may enable the detection and
characterization of the Gamma Ray burst source in the optical and infrared
region of the electromagnetic spectrum and thus lead to a critical analysis of
the engine responsible for the burst.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;
