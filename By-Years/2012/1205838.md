Investigation of molecular phenomena at cold and ultracold temperatures has
become a major area of research in atomic, molecular and optical physics in
recent years. This award supports theoretical investigations of a variety of
atom-diatom chemical reactions and molecule-molecule collisions at cold and
ultracold temperatures. Barrierless chemical reactions involving alkali metal
and non-alkali metal atom systems as well as tunneling dominated reactions will
be investigated. The research will shed insights into novel energy transfer
mechanisms in molecular collisions in the extreme quantum limit and explore how
van der Waals interaction potentials in the reactant/product channels may
influence reactivity at ultralow temperatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research will provide improved understanding of chemical reactivity at
temperatures close to absolute zero and may reveal new pathways for control of
chemical reaction dynamics. Computational algorithms developed during the course
of this research could also be applied to describe molecular processes in
diverse environments ranging from ultracold molecules to atmospheric chemistry
as well as astrophysics and plasma fusion reactors. Research performed with this
award will also contribute to future workforce development in Science and
Technology at a time when the overall interest in Science and Engineering is on
the decline in the United States.
