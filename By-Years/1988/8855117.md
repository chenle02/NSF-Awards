The Chemistry Department of Cabrini College will carry out a six week
residential program on the college campus to introduce sixteen high potential
9th and 10th grade high school students to the methods and instrumentation of
lab research in Chemistry /Environmental Science. The participating group of
students will be partially selected from a group previously "adopted" by this
Department during their eighth grade. The participants all would be from a
disadvantaged area of Philadelphia and would be composed of approximately 50%
minority and background and be approximately a 50-50 mixture of male and female
students. A lecture series of approximately 24 lectures in Environmental Science
and a second set of lectures on current Science and Society issues would be
presented with class meetings each day for six weeks. A set of familiarization
and support lectures in mathematical techniques, writing assignments of a
technical nature, and chemistry career options will be interspersed with the
regular lecture topics. The laboratory component of the program will consist of
12-15 hours weekly of student hands-on research under the direction of a member
of the senior staff. The research projects have been geared to allow maximum
student exposure to a variety of experimental techniques and instrumental
methods.
