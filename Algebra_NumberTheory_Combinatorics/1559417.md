This award supports the travel of US participants, in particular students and
early career researchers, to attend a graduate student workshop (Introduction to
Relative Aspects in Representation Theory, Langlands Functoriality and
Automorphic Forms, May 16-20, 2016) and/or a conference (Relative Trace Formula,
Periods, L-Functions and Harmonic Analysis May 23-27, 2016) at the Centre
International de Rencontres Mathematiques (CIRM) in Luminy, France. The workshop
will consist primarily of four series of four lectures given by some of the
leading experts in the area of automorphic representations and is aimed at
graduate students. The conference will include 10-15 invited talks by leading
researchers. In addition to the invited talks there will be ample opportunities
for young researchers to present and discuss their work in both formal and
informal settings.

Automorphic forms and Langlands functoriality are active and important areas of
research that involve applying the methods of representation theory to classical
problems in number theory and harmonic analysis. The workshop and conference
focus especially on matters that involve periods of automorphic forms and
harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces. Much of the impetus for the workshop is
derived from work related to relative trace formulas and the associated theory
over local fields. Additional information is available at the program web site,
