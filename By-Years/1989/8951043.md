A computer-based laboratory with a primary emphasis on research in cognition is
being developed. With multipurpose computer interfacing with lab instrumentation
and with comprehensive software packages, students are able to conduct
experiments, computer simulations, and exercises for lab classes accompanying
courses in cognitive psychology, physiological psychology, and psychology of
learning and for undergraduate independent study and senior thesis research.
Labs in cognitive psychology feature experiments on topics such as perception,
memory, and prose comprehension. Electrophysiological recording and other
equipment used in physiological psychology labs give students hands-on
opportunities to study electro-physiological and neuropsychological factors of
cognitive processing (e.g. evoked potentials.) The grant also upgrades and
improves current learning labs; for example, it incorporates simulations of
classical conditioning, experiments on concept formation, and biofeedback
research. Also, students interested in conducting their own research have far
more options than currently available. In summary, this grant gives students
opportunities to become familiar with the use of computers and modern scientific
equipment as well as helping them develop the scientific skills and
understanding necessary to participate more fully in the reserach process in
psychology. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of
funds.
