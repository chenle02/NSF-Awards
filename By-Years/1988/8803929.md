The Electronics Education Foundation of the American Electronics Association has
established a unique program providing opportunities for U.S. engineering and
computer science students to conduct research in major industrial research
laboratories in Japan. The long-term goal of this AEA Japan Research Fellowhip
Program is to increase the pool of American engineers familiar with Japan. This
award will allow two groups of students (20-25 fellows) to participate in nine-
week intensive Japanese language training during the summer prior to their
departure for Japan. Past experience suggests that language competency
determines, to a large extent, the depth of technical and cultural interaction
possible and the degree to which the visiting researcher is integrated into the
Japanese host laboratory. The support, to be jointly funded with AEA, will be
used to develop and deliver a course of Japanese language study tailored to the
technical student with an immediate need for survival-level Japanese language
skills and as a basis for continued formal training in Japan.
