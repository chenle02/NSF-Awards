This award is for an exploratory operation to investigate mineralogic changes in
Holocene and modern speleothems from caves in the Seito River Valley, Nepal, in
order to increase understanding of late Holocene Indian summer monsoon
variability. In well- vented, dolomitic caves, calcite stalagmites indicate
humid conditions while aragonite stalagmites record relatively arid cave
conditions and accompanying in-cave evaporation. In many cases, deposition of
calcite formed during precipitation-laden summer monsoons alternates with
aragonite formed from reduced drip rates at the end or between monsoons. In
order to better quantify the relationship between changes in speleothem
mineralogy and climate, the project will perform cage fluid chemical studies
(elemental and isotopic) and elemental analyses of the speleothems, as well as
increase the geographic coverage of sampled caves.
