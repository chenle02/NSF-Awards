The "Ninth Mississippi State - UAB Conference on Differential Equations and
Computational Simulations" will be held for two and a half days during October
4-6, 2012 at McCool Hall at Mississippi State University, Mississippi State,
Mississippi. The website for this conference is
http://www.ccs.msstate.edu/deconf/de2012. The mission of the meeting is to
provide a joint forum where mathematicians, scientists, and engineers from
industry, federal laboratories, and academia can exchange ideas on theoretical,
applied, and computational developments in differential equations. The emphasis
of this year's conference will be on reaction-diffusion equations with
applications. The primary objective of the conference is to optimally fulfill
the aforestated mission, while at the same time to promote research and
education in mathematical and computational analysis of differential equations
and associated simulations.

The conference is a collaborative endeavor between the Department of Mathematics
and Statistics and the Center for Computational Sciences (CCS), a High
Performance Computing Collaboratory (HPCC) member center, at Mississippi State
University, and the Department of Mechanical Engineering at University of
Alabama at Birmingham. This award provides travel support to graduate students
and recent Ph.D.s for an opportunity to present their work, meet other
researchers, educators and practitioners, learn about recent developments in the
proposed interdisciplinary field, and produce a new generation of mathematical
models and challenges.
