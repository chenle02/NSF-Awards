Dr. Julian Humphries is a fish biologist and museum curator at Cornell
University. He has developed a database software system called "MUSE" for
managing museum collection data with microcomputers, and more than twenty
natural history collections (mostly vertebrate) around the world have adopted
the system. Dr. Humphries proposes to continue development of the software
system by adapting it to new hardware platforms (Macintosh and UNIX machines),
and establishing inter-site connections using Internet. Dr. Humphries also plans
three workshops to introduce newcomer museums to collection computerization, to
train other curators and collection managers in the use of MUSE, and to develop
community-wide data standards for collection databases. The MUSE software system
has had great impact on the community of vertebrate biologists by making data
readily available from museum collections. Access to these data are having
important impact on research in evolution, biological diversity and global
climate change, and the community's reliance on these data will expand and
accelerate. The proposed extension of the MUSE Project will benefit the research
community in tangible, immediate ways.
