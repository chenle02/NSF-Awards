This award is expected to yield improved understanding of turbulence not only in
the interplanetary medium, but also in the solar corona, through interplanetary
and interstellar space, and to astrophysical plasmas throughout the Universe.
The project will combine theoretical investigations, numerical simulations, and
data analysis of spacecraft observations, contributing to the solar wind models
along with similar efforts from other research teams. The expected research
results will be broadly disseminated through conference presentations and
publications in peer-reviewed journals; making them fully accessible to the
international scientific community. Public talks to audiences such as high
school students will be given in order to convey specific project results in the
context of general space science education. The project will involve a junior
postdoctoral researcher supporting the NSF Strategic Goals in discovery,
learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.

The main thrust of this SHINE project is to study fundamental properties of the
short-wavelength turbulence in the solar wind, including processes by which
fluctuating energy is transferred among various possible turbulence fields, as
well as address the energy dissipation from those fluctuations into the heating
of solar wind plasma. The primary goal of this research project is to obtain a
comprehensive plasma physics description of the solar wind turbulence in
observed frequencies above 0.5Hz, which correspond to the short-wavelength
fluctuations of the order of or less than the proton inertial length. For such
fluctuations, velocity-space processes are essential for understanding the
physics of the solar wind plasma. The project team will use both hybrid and
particle-in-cell simulation techniques to pursue theoretical and computational
aspects of the research. The proposed observational studies will utilize data
from several different spacecraft flying in the near-Earth's space, and these
data will be closely related to the diagnostics of the numerical simulations.
