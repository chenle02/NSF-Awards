The junctions of a rearrangement in which DNA sequences which are noncontiguous
in the germ line genome are joined during development of the somatic nucleus
have been cloned. There is a long inverted repeat near the rearrangement
junctions which contains two different 19bp tandemly repeated sequences. The
19mers are also associated with each other at other rearrangement sites, which
suggests that they have a functional role in rearrangement. Molecular analysis
of the rearrangement junctions and of the products of rearrangements from the
macronucleus will be extended in order to determine the full length of the
inverted repeat and the nucleotide sequence at junction sites. Cis-acting
sequences for DNA rearrangement will be identified by analysis of DNA
rearrangement on constructs microinjected into developing macronuclei. Cis-
acting sequences will be used in gel-shift assays to identify sites which are
specifically bound by proteins during DNA rearrangement. DNA rearrangement is a
basic biological process which occurs in a variety of organisms ranging from
bacteria to mammals. The goal of the proposed study is to understand the
molecular mechanisms involved in developmentally regulated rearrangement in the
ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena.***//
