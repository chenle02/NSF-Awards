In this project of the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Prof. James Weisshaar of the University of Wisconsin at Madison will conduct a
broad program of fundamental measurements on the reactivities and electronic
structures of metal-hydrocarbon molecules as function of temperature, pressure,
and the electronic state of the neutral reactant molecule. Specifically,
research will be pursued in three areas: 1) a survey of the chemical kinetics
involving neutral transition metal atoms, 2) a study of the absorption and
desorption of small molecules on, or from, size specific clusters of transition
metal atoms by means of time-resolved bimolecular collisions, and 3) application
of the new technique of mass-analyzed threshold ionization to obtain mass-
specific spectra for small aggregates of metal atoms and clusters formed by
metal atoms and organic molecules. %%% Saturated hydrocarbon molecules, such as,
for example, methane and ethane, are abundant sources of carbon, but they are
rather inert. Their chemical reactivities can, however, be significantly
enhanced under low energy conditions by catalysts of transition-metal atoms such
as nickel, platinum, rhodium, and others. The physical chemistry of this
activation process is not well understood and this research is devoted to
improve our knowledge of the interactions between metal atoms and hydrocarbon
molecules. This will be done by conducting the experiments under controlled
conditions in the gas phase, in which the perturbing effects of possible
solvents are absent. This research is of an interdisciplinary nature and its
results will affect our understanding of solution-phase organo-metallic
chemistry, heterogeneous catalysis, and surface chemistry. Furthermore, the data
obtained in these investigations will be of use in the development of
theoretical models and techniques for the calculation of interaction potentials
between metal atoms and hydrocarbon molecules.
