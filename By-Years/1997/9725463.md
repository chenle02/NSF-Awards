UNIVERSITY CA-IRVINE PURDUE UNIVERSITY The project will determine the
atmospheric concentration of nitrogen compounds in the atmosphere by conducting
a field experiment at a field camp at the summit of the Greenland ice sheet. The
concentration of nitrogen compounds in the atmosphere will be compared to their
concentration in freshly deposited snow so that the record of atmospheric
chemistry that is retained in the permanent ice record at the site may be
interpreted for changes in the chemistry of the troposphere that have occurred
since human activities began to affect the atmosphere. That record will lead to
important conclusions about the human impacts of global change on the atmosphere
and will allow an examination of the natural cycles of atmospheric chemistry
over the past 100,000 years.
