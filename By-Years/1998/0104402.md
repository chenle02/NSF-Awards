DMS-0104402&lt;br/&gt;Lars Andersson &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is
concerned with the global existence and &lt;br/&gt;cosmic censorship problems
for the Einstein equation, and &lt;br/&gt;related issues in Lorentzian and
Riemannian geometry. One of &lt;br/&gt;the primary goals is to prove a nonlinear
stability result &lt;br/&gt;for the Einstein equation in the cosmological case.
For large &lt;br/&gt;data, global existence is a very hard problem, and here the
&lt;br/&gt;aim is to identify and study model problems as well as lower
dimensional problems derived by symmetry reductions. The &lt;br/&gt;structure of
cosmological singularities will be studied &lt;br/&gt;from the point of view of
the BKL proposal. For flat, &lt;br/&gt;spatially compact spacetimes, global
constant mean curvature&lt;br/&gt;foliations will be studied, in particular
their asymptotic &lt;br/&gt;behavior in the expanding direction and near the
singularity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Einstein equation, which describes the
interaction of &lt;br/&gt;matter with spacetime geometry, is one of the
fundamental &lt;br/&gt;classical field equations of modern physics. According to
the &lt;br/&gt;world view of modern physics, our universe is described on
&lt;br/&gt;large scales by one of the simplest solutions to the Einstein
equations, the Friedman-Lemaitre solution. According to this&lt;br/&gt;picture,
the universe has developed from a singularity (big bang) &lt;br/&gt;and is
expanding. The work in this project is concerned with &lt;br/&gt;the nonlinear
stability of this model, the behavior of spacetime &lt;br/&gt;in extreme
conditions near the big bang and its ultimate fate &lt;br/&gt;in the expanding
direction.&lt;br/&gt;
