In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Breckenridge will examine the spectroscopy and dynamics of van der
Waals clusters of the type MXn, where M is an atom, typically a Group II, III or
IV metal, and X is a rare-gas atom or a molecule. The complexes will be made in
a supersonic jet and will be characterized by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF),
resonant two-photon photoionization spectroscopy (R2PI), and laser pump-probe
`action` spectroscopy. One goal of this research program is to understand better
the nature of electronic interactions between atoms and C-H bonds in molecules
as a function of atomic electronic state. Particularly interesting will be the
transition region between physical and chemical interactions. One application of
this work is as a model for catalytic C-H bond activation at solid metal-oxide
sites.
