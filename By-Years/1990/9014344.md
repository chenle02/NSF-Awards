This research project will make use of Brillouin and Raman scattering to
investigate the incommensurate and lock-in phase transitions in several
dielectric crystals. The specific projects include: 1) studies of the
longitudinal acoustic anomalies in potassium selenate near the characteristic
temperature TI and controversial asymmetries in transverse acoustic modes in
potassium selenate and tetramethyltetrachlorozincate; 2) clearing up the
remaining controversy concerning the dielectric anomaly in thiourea with
Brillouin scattering; 3) studies of the glass transition with lithium chloride
solutions and other glass-forming materials; 4) a new study of surface acoustic
modes of crystals near the melting point in order to search for the onset of
surface melting.
