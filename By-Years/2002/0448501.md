ABSTRACT 0448501 Grigore Rosu University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign
TITLE: CAREER: Runtime Verification and Monitoring

This project addresses software development and analysis techniques that take
runtime monitoring as a foundational principle. The proposed research is based
on the idea that effective monitoring code is automatically generated from high-
level, human-readable system requirements specifications, and then used to
either detect or predict violations of requirements in software systems at
runtime. The proposed techniques aim at detecting errors in complex software
systems and at narrowing the gap between specification and implementation by
allowing the former to play an active role in the execution of programs via
monitoring and guiding.

Many aspects of the proposed research focus on designing and implementing
monitor synthesis and integration algorithms. A generic method to add new
requirements specification formalisms modularly and compactly to a runtime
environment is designed. Techniques to detect not only errors that happened, but
especially errors which were close to happen are developed, together with
techniques to monitor complex concurrent systems in a decentralized manner. The
proposed research is expected to lead to novel scalable techniques to detect
errors in software systems, as well as to programming methodologies for robust
and dependable software, thus having a direct impact on how high-quality
software is being tested and developed.
