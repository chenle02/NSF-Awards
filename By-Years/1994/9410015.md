9410015 Santos This work will establish a research program whose objectives are
to explore the materials science of InSb/AlxIn1-xSb heteroepitaxy, to study the
electrical properties of InSb quantum wells, and to develop novel electron
devices which exploit their unique attributes. Molecular beam epitaxy will be
used to deposit InSb and AlxIn1-xSb epitaxial layers on GaAs and InSb quantum
wells. Since InSb has the highest intrinsic electron mobility of all binary
III-V compounds, InSb quantum wells have potential used in both magnetic field
sensor and transistor applications. The use of AlxIn1-xSb is expected to be a
critical step in fulfilling this potential by serving as a suitable barrier
material. ***
