In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division
Martin Karplus of the Department of Chemistry of Harvard University will study
theoretical methods applied to biomolecular chemistry. Three problems in
biomolecular chemistry are investigated using a combination of quantum
mechanical methods to study bonds forming and breaking and molecular dynamics
and Monte Carlo simulations to account for the many body effects: (1) The
mechanism of transport through bacterial pores. (2) The mechanism of enzyme
catalysis. (3) The mechanism of protein folding. This study is done in close
interaction with experimental groups in the USA and in France ( Strassbourg) and
will help elucidate basic mechanisms of function in biological systems.
