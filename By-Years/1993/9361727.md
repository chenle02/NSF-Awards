9361727 Kang The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a
process for producing ceramic cell adhesion microcarriers with controllable
surface area, porosity, particle size, density, and weight. This is achieved by
a combination of sol-gel and aerosol techniques. A controllable monodispersion
of spherical seed particles is first produced to form the basis of the
microcarriers. These seed particles are then fused into larger spherical
agglomerates with the high surface area required for cell adhesion. Finally, a
coating is added for biocompatibility if required. In Phase I, process
feasibility will be demonstrated by producing silica-based microcarriers and
testing them for surface area, porosity, and biocompatibility. In Phase II,
optimization studies to control properties to produce particles optimized for
particular mammalian cell applications will be conducted. ***
