Radio frequency-based wireless communications plays a huge role in our modern
society. However, the significant growth in the wireless data traffic has
initiated the need for expanding the range of frequencies used for wireless
communication. Visible Light Communication (VLC), where light is used as a
medium for communication, has garnered significant attention over recent years
due to its potential for ultra-high speeds. However, with rapid advancements in
VLC, the communication speeds achieved so far are orders of magnitude less than
its potential Terabits-per-second (Tbps) capacity. There is an urgent need for a
breakthrough in VLC data speeds, and this project attempts to move toward it
through a novel system architecture to support ultra-high data rates. The
project will take advantage of industry meetings to disseminate outcomes and
provides a variety of appealing educational activities involving high school and
undergraduate students. This project makes an experimental VLC kit available to
the community and makes the hardware, software implementation and data generated
available to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical models estimate VLC
information capacity to be of the order of Tbps, however, practical limitations
in receiver designs have limited state-of-the-art VLC prototypes to data rates
that are lower by orders of magnitude. To achieve high-speed reception, this
project combines the fast sampling nature of photodiodes and the noise isolation
property of imaging array structures into a unified structure that emulates a
high-speed image sensing receiver. This project designs a novel VLC receiver
architecture integrating a photodiode and an LCD array that acts as a pixelated
shutter. Through this unified design, the receiver selects the exact area over
which the transmitted signal is detected on the array, thus isolating actual
light signal from ambient noise reaching the photodiode, resulting in a dramatic
increase in the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). The signal isolation and SNR
enhancement is enabled by the spatio-temporal mechanisms for selective signal
reception and tracking on the LCD array. To achieve a larger field-of-view for
reception, the receiver is fit with an 180-degree panoramic lens. This project
develops a model to understand the relationship between spatial mobility and the
light signal's location on the array and its strength and sets a baseline for
designing signal tracking mechanisms to address mobility in high-speed VLC
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
