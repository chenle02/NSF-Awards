The objective of this research is: (1) to determine the forcing mechanism of
the wet microburst using multi-Doppler radar and a 2 dimensional cloud model;
(2) to develop a technique to forecast the occurrence of wet microbursts, that
can be used as a guide to issue "wind shear" alerts; (3) to determine the
kinetmatic/dynamic structure of the bow echo. The microburst is an extreme wind-
shear event, often associated with thunderstorms, and characterized by small
spatial and temporal scales. Although it has on occasion caused tornado-force
damage at the surface, the most serious threat is to avaiation. Two field
projects, JAWS and MIST have been operated in recent years to study the
microburst.
