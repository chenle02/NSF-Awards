High-end distributed and distributed shared memory platforms with millions of
processors will be deployed in the near future to solve the toughest technical
problems. Their individual nodes will be heterogeneous multithreading, multicore
systems, capable of executing many threads of control, but with relatively
little memory per thread, low bandwidth to main memory and deep memory
hierarchies.&lt;br/&gt;A programming model that supports productive, portable,
efficient parallel programming both within and across the nodes of these
petascale systems is essential if their potential is to be realized. Since it is
easier for application developers and tool vendors to extend existing software
rather than adopt a new programming language, a programming model based upon a
familiar paradigm is highly desirable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OpenMP is
a widely supported shared memory programming model that provides ease of
maintenance. It is suitable for programming multicore nodes, but does not
address the needs of distributed memory platforms. This research will
significantly extend OpenMP so that it can be used to program all levels of a
high-end petascale system. In order to accomplish this, the investigators will
enhance its existing mechanisms for describing multiple levels of parallelism,
provide additional features for specifying synchronization and for achieving
high levels of locality, as well as develop a novel I/O interface. Moreover,
they will substantially improve the state of the art in OpenMP implementation
technology, enabling high performance between nodes as well as within them.
Results will be demonstrated via a state-of-the-art Fortran/C/C++ OpenMP
compiler, a highly optimized communications library, and a range of large scale
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
