In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the
Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professor Veronica Vaida
at the University of Colorado-Boulder studies the sunlight-initiated chemistry
of organic molecules. The research program addresses the following questions:
What role does sunlight-initiated chemistry in aqueous environments play in
altering organic molecules in the atmosphere? How do photochemical reactions
affect the molecules in the sea surface and atmospheric aerosol particles? What
are the non-biological mechanisms for particle formation, which use sunlight as
the energy source and aqueous interfaces as reaction media? To what extent can
laboratory data be used to model realistic environmental chemistry? By answering
these questions, students and postdoctoral fellows gain broad expertise and
skills in atmospheric chemistry. The students are guided by an international and
interdisciplinary team of colleagues with complementary knowledge base and skill
sets. The scientific exchange between investigators and interdisciplinary
international collaborators significantly broadens the educational experience of
all those involved in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work derives
molecular-level mechanisms and quantitative models for atmospheric
photochemistry that occur in different phases, including gaseous and aqueous
phases and at the surface of water. These photochemical reactions play an
important role in the formation and chemical evolution of atmospheric aerosols
with potentially important consequences to human health and climate change. This
investigation examines the basic scientific aspects of sunlight-initiated,
water-mediated, chemical reactivity of organic molecules. Using a combination of
laboratory and theoretical studies, the outcome of the research is an improved
understanding of the mechanisms, dynamics, and rates of photochemical reactions
occurring in clusters and on aerosol surfaces that are of importance in the
atmosphere.
