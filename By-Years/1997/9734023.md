*** 9734023 Tyson This project explores the interaction between code
transformation performed during compilation and instruction set design. Several
modifications in instruction set design are under investigation, each of which
attempts to improve overall processor performance by increasing the amount of
compile time information transmitted to the hardware at runtime. Some
modifications, such as probabilistic prefetch or branch table indexing, amount
to hints that may improve performance without requiring all implementations of
an architecture to use the information. Others, such as imposition of FIFO
semantics on one or more register identifiers, enable compilers to schedule
resources and require that all implementations comply with the scheduling. Each
of the modifications will be explored using both classroom projects for graduate
courses and individual research by graduate students. Simulation and other tools
arising from this project will be introduced into the undergraduate curriculum.
