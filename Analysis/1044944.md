This is a one year Research Training Group (RTG) type of project in Analysis and
Differential Equations at the Department of Mathematics of the University of
Chicago. The project funds graduate students and visitors and the organization
of a summer course aimed towards advanced undergraduates, graduate students and
young postdocs in mathematics, engineering and sciences. Analysis and
differential equations are central, deep and rich fields of mathematics. From an
applied perspective, differential equations are the most fundamental
mathematical models in all of science and engineering. They describe phenomena
from quantum mechanics to weather prediction and climate and are the basic
theoretical tools in science and technology. The exponential improvement in the
capabilities of modern computers allows for the practical use of increasingly
complex systems of differential equations. Although recent results have solved
numerous outstanding problems, many still remain open. The understanding of the
mathematical properties of these models is essential. The need in both academia
and industry for young, well-trained mathematicians in these areas is ever
growing.

The PIs along with others in the mathematical community believe that there is a
severe shortage of US PhDs trained in (applied) analysis and differential
equations. The goal of the proposed one year project is to provide the seed
towards developing a well-rounded and modern educational program to increase the
number of American researchers working in the applied analysis and differential
equations and to improve the quality of the training of future mathematical
scientists (working in either academia or industry). Having support for graduate
students working in this general area will increase the number of students
willing to work in applied analysis. The expectation is that the proposed summer
course will serve as a model of the type of educational activity needed to
attract more researchers to differential equations as well as to educate student
and postdocs in engineering and sciences.
