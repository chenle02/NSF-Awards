This award will support collaborative research between Prof. George Jiracek of
San Diego State University, and Dr. Art Raiche of the commonwealth Scientific
and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), New South Wales, Australia. The
investigators will work on the three-dimensional modeling of controlled-source
electromagnetic radiation. The response of the earth when irradiated can yield
important geological information, but modeling is necessary to enhance our
interpretation of this information. Earlier work of the U.S. investigator will
be extended to apply to inhomogeneous, irregular three-dimensional earth
geometries. The project combines the expertise of the U.S. investigator in
three- dimensional modeling using the Rayleigh-Fast Fourier Transform method,
with that of the Australian investigator in Rayleigh scattering experimentation.
The work has the potential to greatly facilitate minerals exploration, and would
also facilitate the interpretation of data on electromagnetic groundwater EM
response, toxic contaminant monitoring, and earthquake precursors.
