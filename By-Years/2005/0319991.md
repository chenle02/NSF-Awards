This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and
commercialize a new generation of low-cost, disposable carbon dioxide gas
sensors based on carbon nanotube sensor elements. The sensors will combine
cutting-edge nanoelectronics with recognition chemistry coatings to make
nanosensors that can measure carbon dioxide in breath (capnography). The sensors
will be small enough to fit into the respiratory tube or nasal cannulae of
patients requiring respiratory monitoring. This innovation will lower the cost
of many surgical procedures and facilitate capnography monitoring in mobile and
temporary settings by decoupling capnography from expensive, fixed monitoring
equipment. The net benefits will include improved patient care and lower costs
for healthcare providers. The project will take advantage of recent developments
in fabricating hybrid nanotube-silicon transducers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will help move nanotechnology out of research laboratories into the
commercial realm, thereby encouraging additional investment and overall R&amp;D
spending. Perhaps most important of all, the technology has the potential to
make a small but important move toward lowered healthcare costs with improved
patient care. &lt;br/&gt;
