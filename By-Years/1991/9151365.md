This project entails the addition of a mass spectrometer, a gas chromatograph,
and a particle beam LC/MS interface to an existing liquid chromatograph, a data
station, and a NBS/NIST spectral library for spectra comparison. Additional
hardware is needed to interface the system. The new instrument array will
upgrade undergraduate laboratory instruction and student research opportunities
at lower and upper levels. Students will be shown the new system in freshman
courses; will be given mass spectra exercises in intermediate Organic Chemistry
I laboratory; will experience some hands-on instrument instruction in Organic
Chemistry II laboratory; and will obtain further training in senior level
inorganic, instrumental analysis, and biochemistry laboratory courses. Many
students will use the techniques so learned in multi-disciplinary research
projects, including an extensive program in limnological studies. The grantee
will overmatch the NSF award by four-fold from non-Federal sources.
