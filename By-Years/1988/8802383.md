They propose in this project to carry out theoretical studies of strongly
correlated quantum systems. The properties of such systems are drastically
altered as a result of interactions among the constituents (spins or electrons
in their case). The importance of correlations in a system can be enhanced in
several ways: by the application of a strong magnetic field, by reducing the
dimensionality of the system or by increasing the strength of interactions
between these constituents. They propose here to study the three-dimensional-
electron-gas in a strong magnetic field, using knowledge gained through the
development of the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). The same
knowledge can be used with advantage in applying a class of variational wave
functions to study the properties of the one- dimensional electron gas. They
propose also to continue their studies of the two-dimensional electron gas in a
strong magnetic field. Additionally, the recently discovered copper oxide
layered superconductors are believed to be strongly correlated systems because
of the extremely strong Coulomb interactions between electrons on the same
copper site. These interactions may be responsible for their high-temperature
superconductivity and they propose studies aimed at understanding the dependence
of their properties on the interaction strength.
