The objective of this research is to establish a millimeter-wave high frequency
electronic device characterization system. To meet the demand for increased
information bandwidth and operating frequency, scientists and engineers are
trying to understand the issues associated with various electronic devices
operating at millimeter-wave frequencies. In the near future, the reduction in
device feature sizes will result in the use of millimeter-wave frequencies in
many communication systems and computers. University of Florida will use the
proposed electronic device characterization system, including a 67GHz network
analyzer, a 50GHz spectrum analyzer, and an existing high frequency probe
station to establish research and educational programs that will benefit our
nation's millimeter-wave industry for next 10 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
acquisition of the electronic device characterization system will benefit many
interdisciplinary research programs such as RF/High-Speed System-On-Chip
Integration, High-Performance Computer Architecture, Wireless Sensors, and
Advanced Devices and Circuits in Silicon and III-V Technologies. The equipment
will be used to advance knowledge of materials, devices, circuits, and systems
across multiple disciplines in different departments. The project will also make
impacts on advancing multidisciplinary research and training of graduate and
undergraduate students. Students from different disciplines will have
opportunities to learn how the new materials and device technologies improve
electronic device performance, and how to use the instrument to characterize
device performance. The project will benefit many minority students in UF and
reach out to state and nation's engineering community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
