The Tenth Dissertations Symposium on Chemical Oceanography (DISCO) will be held
November 18-23, 1991 at the East-West Center, University of Hawaii campus,
Honolulu, Hawaii. Twenty- six chemical oceanography candidates will meet for
five days in formal and informal sessions to present their theses dissertations,
contribute to discussions, participate in working groups, and meet with other
attendees and sponsors to discuss their work and future activities. The sponsors
will delineate the federal government programs in chemical oceanography and
present avenues of support. The proceedings will be published. This will be the
tenth in a series of symposia supported by the National Science Foundation
(NSF), Office of Naval Research (ONR), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA).
