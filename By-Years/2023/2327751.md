All around the world, governments and communities have worked to control the
spread of HIV/AIDS. However, despite dramatic progress, there are populations of
individuals in which epidemic control has been difficult. One of these
populations is composed of people who inject drugs (PWID). About one in five new
HIV infections outside of Sub-Sharan Africa are in PWID, and in the US the
number of PWID was estimated to be 3.7 million at the end of 2018. Hepatitis C
(HCV) is another virus that has had a disproportionate impact on PWID. To
eliminate or control HIV and HCV it is important to understand the factors that
drive transmission and learn how best to intervene to prevent transmission of
the viruses. These factors are difficult to identify among PWID because of the
complex social networks of PWID, including their injection partners and the
communities in which they live.

The goal of this work is to improve and develop interventions to control the
spead of HIV and HCV in PWID. This project integrates behavioral, socioeconomic
and mobility data with infectious disease transmission dynamics. The
interdisciplinary research team brings together epidemiology, clinical medicine,
behavioral science, engineering, and mathematical modeling. The project
leverages large international datasets to develop complex transmission models
and then uses machine learning and other novel data science techniques to fill
in missing data and train the models. These models can be adapted to be used in
any community to understand the factors that drive HIV and HCV transmission in
their local PWID community.
