The American Mathematical Society (AMS) has created the Mathematics Research
Communities (MRC) as a national program to support and guide young
mathematicians as they begin their research careers. In 2014, there are four MRC
conferences proposed, all to be held in Snowbird, Utah: Cluster Algebras, June 8
- 14, 2014; Algebraic and Geometric Combinatorics in Applied Mathematics, June
15 - 21, 2014; Mathematics of Quantum Phases of Matter and Quantum Information,
June 25 - July 1, 2014; and Network Science, June 25 - July 1, 2014. The topics
of the conferences to be held in 2015 and 2016 will be determined later by the
MRC Advisory Board, which evaluates proposals submitted by senior mathematicians
who wish to be organizers. Each of the MRC conferences will bring together a
diverse group of young mathematicians. The organizing committee for each
conference is composed of leaders in the field of the conference and includes
individuals with previous experience in organizing successful workshops and
conferences. The conferences will bring together senior and junior researchers
in an ideal environment to establish connections, which often last for many
years after the conference itself.

The goal of the Mathematics Research Communities program is to create research
cohorts of young mathematicians that will sustain themselves over time,
fostering joint research and coherent research programs that will, eventually,
reach all areas of mathematics. The Mathematics Research Communities program
strives to achieve this goal through the following activities in addition to the
summer research conferences: Special Sessions at the annual AMS-MAA Joint
Mathematics Meetings, mentoring and a discussion network. It is the formation of
research cohorts that sets this program apart from any other (national)
professional development programs for mathematicians that currently exist. The
creation of three to four new cohorts per year has the potential to lay a
foundation for decades of research, and will have an extremely positive effect
on mathematics research in the U.S. Most importantly, this program will focus on
mathematicians who are beginning their research careers; all program components
will help to train and connect the next generation of researchers in,
eventually, all research areas of mathematics. This proposal is requesting
support for an additional three years of this unique program. Conference topics
will include both pure and applied mathematics areas of research.
