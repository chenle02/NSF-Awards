The proposed research has three major objectives: (1) To investigate the
ecology of myxomycetes (Plasmodial slime molds) associated with forest floor
litter in temperate forest ecosystem. (2) To increase our knowledge of the
relative importance and exact role of myxomycetes as memebers of the detritus
food chain. (3) To assess the ecological significance of their interactions with
other organisms in terrestrial ecosystems. Emphasis on the proposed research in
on analyzing (using the techniques of multivariate analysis) patterns of species
composition and species diversity of myxomycetes in the litter microhabitat. The
proposed research, which is designed to include a number of undergraduate
biology majors at the P.I.'s home institution as active participants, will
provide important new information about a critical but poorly known component of
many forest ecosystem, and yield baseline data from which further studies of
myxomycete ecology can be launched.
