The long term objective of these studies is to further our understanding of the
molecular basis of the interaction between protein antigens and immune system
receptors. Dr. Paterson will use a model system consisting of monoclonal
antibodies to a structurally defined protein, cytochrome c. Dr. Paterson has
obtained a specific antibody, E8, and is collecting x-ray data on the free and
antigen complexed form in Dr. Elizabeth Getzoff's laboratory. Dr. Paterson
wishes to complete and extend these studies to other horse cytochrome c specific
monoclonal antibodies and anti-idiotypic antibodies to E8. She is also examining
the interaction of antibody/antigen complexes using hydrogen exchange and 2D
NMR. She has completed these studies on E8 and finds they agree well with
previous epitopic assignments and with the general nature of antigenic sites on
other proteins determined by other workers using x-ray crystallography. This
information from the antigenic epitopes on horse cytochrome c will be used to
modulate antibody/antigen affinity through single residue changes in the antigen
using site directed mutagenesis. Dr. Paterson will also extend these studies to
the lysozyme model antigen system for which x-ray structural data is known for
two monoclonal antibodies. single residue changes in the antigen using site
directed mutagenesis. Dr. Paterson will also extend these studies to the
lysozyme model antigen system for which x-ray structural data is known for two
monoclonal antibodies.
