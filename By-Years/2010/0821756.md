Objective:&lt;br/&gt;Terahertz (THz) sensing is emerging as a promising new
technology with application to a wide number of compelling problems in material
probing, medical imaging, and device design. THz imaging has several desirable
attributes such as distinctive spectral signatures, sensitivity to sub-
millimeter-scale features, safe operation for personnel screening, and the
ability to penetrate through materials. However, researchers are only beginning
to develop a rigorous understanding of the complicated THz signatures which are
influenced by both chemical composition and scattering from a material's
microstructure. The objective of this proposal is to support a concerted THz
measurement effort with the acquisition of a THz time domain spectroscopy
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;A core contribution
will be the development of electromagnetic scattering models appropriate for
characterizing THz wave interaction with complex random media (for example,
manmade or natural materials with randomly dispersed features such as cracks,
grains, or interfaces). The need to understand this interaction arises in almost
all potential applications of THz sensing and can only be rigorously addressed
with an integrated measurement effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The THz system will support a host of research and educational
activities by researchers at Portland State, neighboring academia, and industry
partners, resulting in increased collaboration and strengthening the
participation of women (both PI and Co-PI are female role models). Students will
have the opportunity to engage in cutting edge THz research and associated
multi-institutional activities. The potential societal benefits are truly
impressive, including the potential for a new medical imaging capability or the
ability to detect concealed explosives.
