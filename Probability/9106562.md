The principal investigators will study a number of asymptotic problems for
linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE's) and systems of PDE's
using their connections with Markov processes. Such topics as motion of wave
fronts, impulses and other structures in semilinear parabolic systems, coupled
elliptic and parabolic equations with small diffusivity will be considered. From
a probabilistic point of view the results will be of the averaging principle
type or of central limit theorem and large deviation type for the corresponding
random processes. The investigators also will study random perturbations of
evolutionary PDE's. The investigators plan to develop a theory similar to the
theory of random perturbations of finite dimensional systems. Many kinds of
limit theorems for the random fields defined by the perturbed PDE's will be
considered. The principal investigators will study a number of asymptotic
problems for linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE's) and
systems of PDE's using their connections with Markov processes. This work brings
together two fields of mathematical research, partial differential equations and
probability theory.
