The principal investigator intends to study limit distributions of eigenvalues
of random matrices of large, asymptotically infinite dimensions. Random matrices
are assumed to have i. i. d. columns. Dr. Yin has already obtained certain
results on the existence of limit distributions. He now intends to obtain
further results in that direction, and to study convergence to the limit
distribution when the matrix size goes to infinity, including the case when the
ratio of the number of rows to the number of columns tends to zero. The rate of
convergence will also be investigated, possibly using some preliminary numerical
calculations to get insight into the nature of the problem. Dr. Yin also wants
to study the limit value of the maximal and the minimal eigenvalues, where he
can employ some combinatorial techniques. Random matrices constitute an active
area of research in probability theory. Potential applications of random
matrices include signal processing, ecomomic games, computer science and other.
Problems studied under this project may be related to studies in signal
processing, in particular to those involving a large number of signals and
sensors in complex communication systems.
