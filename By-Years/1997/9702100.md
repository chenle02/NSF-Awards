This CAREER Award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports the research and education plans of Victoria J. DeRose at Texas
A&amp;M University. The goal of the proposed research is to use paramagnetic
resonance spectroscopic techniques to investigate the roles of divalent metal
ions in the phosphoryl transfer reactions performed by RNA and DNA polymerases
and catalytic RNA molecules. The paramagnetic ion, Mn(II), will be substituted
for Mg(II) so that EPR and Q-band ENDOR probes can be used. Biophysical studies
crossing the boundaries between biological, physical and analytical chemistry
will be used to probe basic questions of nucleic acid metabolism and provide
interdisciplinary training for both graduate and undergraduate students.
Biological topics will be integrated into undergraduate physical chemistry
courses and a biophysical/biomaterials course will be developed for graduate and
upper level undergraduate students.
