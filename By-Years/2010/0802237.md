This project will investigate lightweight oxidation products from anthropogenic
and biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as a source for secondary organic
aerosol (SOA) in urban Atlanta, Georgia. The mechanism through which SOA may be
formed involves partitioning of low carbon-number, water-soluble, secondary VOCs
to the particle aqueous phase where they are heterogeneously oxidized to lower
vapor pressure products. To investigate this process the Principal Investigator
(PI) proposes to undertake online measurements of a suite of small organic acid
and carbonyl compounds in the gas and aerosol phases, along with additional
ancillary measurements. These experiments will be conducted over an extended
period of time at a variety of sites to examine factors that influence the gas-
particle partitioning and its linkage to hydrophilic/hydrophobic fractions and
overall particle water-soluble organic carbon mass. The motivation for the
project is the unexpectedly high SOA concentrations observed in urban
atmospheres that cannot be explained by current SOA formation chemical
mechanisms.
