The objective is to investigate the use of fractal geometry in the
characterization of nickel aluminide microstructures. Various nickel aluminides
will be analyzed microscopically using digital imaging techniques, in
combination with the methods of multi-fractal geometry to produce a
characteristic set of "multiple-fractal dimensions" for each microstructure.
They can be used for both microstructural prediction and for relating to
macroscopic properties such as yield strength. Strong indications of "self-
similarity" exist in nickel aluminide microstructures, thus making them
candidates for fractal analysis, which is based on the concept of self-
similarity. The information which can then be related to macroscopic properties
such as yield strength. This represents a potential vast improvement over
currently used methods which relate yield strength to only one parameter, namely
grain size.
