This proposal outlined a novel composite structure which consisted a
ferroelectric core, such as BaTiO3, constrained by a shell formed by dopant
diffusion into the base material. This insured a smooth transition of
concentration gradient across the core/shell interface, and it resulted in high
internal stresses accompanied by low fatigue and no cracking. The former is a
distinct advantage and the latter two are disadvantages in sensing and actuator
applications. This proposal aims to investigate the core/shell structures and to
develop a basic understanding of the mechanisms for its formation. This study
will also investigate the electrical and mechanical response characteristics of
these core/shell composite structures. %%% This proposal aims to investigate the
mechanisms for the optimum formation of the core/shell type of composite
structures, and to explore their potential applications in sensing and actuator
applications. They are the Smart Materials types of applications. They have the
potentials to contribute significantly to the intelligent processing in
manufacturing.
