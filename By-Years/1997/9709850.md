This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of Georgia, studying how Brazilian Amazon subsistence farmers
adapt to ecological changes. Fieldwork in a `blackwater` (ecologically
impoverished) area will show how local farmers exploit different soil types
(floodplain and non-flood zones and a particularly rich soil known as `black
earth`) to accomplish their goals of sustainability. The student will study four
communities along a river, two on `black earth` and two on non-`black earth`
soils. The researcher will conduct soil analyses and fertility experiments,
record crop regimes and labor inputs as well as in-depth analyses of the
cognitive models farmers use to work the land. Botanical collections will also
be made to document land use. This research is important because the tropics
represent a zone of enormous potential agricultural productivity, and this
research will advance our understanding of how humans have learned to exploit
the potential of different soil types. The study will contribute to our
understanding of human adaptive potential by analyzing the variation in
agricultural exploitation in this important zone.
