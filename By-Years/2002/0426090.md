Yuri Dahnovsky of the University of Wyoming and J. Vincent Ortiz of Kansas State
University are supported by the Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials
Research under the Information Technology Research program to develop new
computational methods for understanding and predicting the properties of
molecular wires and devices, and for determining how conductance depends on
microscopic properties. Goals includes electron propagator calculations of
electronic properties of extended molecular bridges affected by metal leads,
Green's function treatments of metal surfaces modified by chemisorbed bridge
molecues, and development of a self-consistent matrix Green's function approach
including image forces to study molecular wire transport properties.

The expected outcome of this research is a reliable, rigorous, first-principles
computational approach for the study and optimization of molecular devices. Fast
elements such as molecular wires and devices are likely to play a crucial role
in the development of micro- and quantum computers.
