Basham 95-54344 Support is requested for initial implementation phases of the
Navajo Learning Network (NLN), a four-part project with the overall objective of
establishing a single virtual campus linking all educational institutions within
the Navajo Nation. Teaching, research and curriculum development activities will
be carried out collaboratively by K12 as well as NCC faculty and students. A
base level of connectivity between participating institutions will be
accomplished utilizing the wide-area network developed by the Navajo Nation
government that will connect participating Navajo Nation K-12 schools to Navajo
Community College's system and out to the Internet. The Navajo Learning Network
project team, together with trainers from the Los Alamos National Laboratory,
will provide training both on NLN and Internet access, and will work closely
with NCC and K-12 faculty to develop a effective strategies for utilizing
information technology as a teaching and learning tool in a way that is
sensitive to the learning styles prevalent among Navajo schoolchildren. The
planned information technology upgrade is necessary to provide expanded
education and support services to the entire NCC campus system, and ultimately
to all residents of the Navajo Nation, an area of approximately the size of West
Virginia (25,000 square miles), covering portions of Arizona, New Mexico and
Utah. Currently, over 200,000 Navajos live on or near the reservation.
