The Departments of Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of
Tennessee and the Mathematical Sciences Section of the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory will sponsor a special research year in numerical linear algebra in
1987-88. In addition to support from the National Science Foundation, there will
be major contributions by the State of Tennessee, the University of Tennessee,
and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. During this period leading researchers in
numerical linear algebra and related areas in scientific computation and
computer science will visit for research collaboration and workshops. The
solution of linear equations will be the main theme during the Fall, the
solution of eigenvalue and singular value equations will be the primary focus in
the Winter, and the Spring will be devoted to the solution of least squares
problems.
