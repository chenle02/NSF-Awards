This award provides participant support to the Annual New York State Regional
Graduate Mathematics Conference (ANYSRGMC) for the next three years. The 2019
conference is held at Syracuse University on Saturday, March 23, 2019. This
conference presented an opportunity for graduate students in New York State and
surrounding regions to come together, share current research, and interact with
other graduate students in a similar phase of their academic career.
Opportunities to speak at conferences are an essential part of training future
mathematicians. Unlike other graduate student mathematics conferences in the
region, at the ANYSRGMC graduate students in all areas of mathematics have an
opportunity to present their research. In many cases this is the first time a
graduate student will speak at a conference, giving them a valuable opportunity
to learn how to structure and deliver a talk. In addition, given the broad range
of topics covered, graduate students have the opportunity to learn about other
research going on in the region, as well be exposed to areas of mathematics that
they are less familiar. NSF funding increased access to this conference, giving
graduate students with fewer financial resources available to them an
opportunity to take advantage of this conference. The ANYSRGMC is a one-day
conference, the majority of which consists of 30 minute graduate student talks
given in parallel sessions. There are two invited guest speakers, an opening
address on Saturday morning and a Keynote address Saturday afternoon. The two
speakers are typically prominent mathematicians in two distinct areas of
mathematics who can speak to the diverse interests of the graduate students at
Syracuse University and surrounding regions. In addition to hearing interesting
mathematics, students have the opportunity to meet and learn from successful
mathematicians outside of their home universities. Breaks between the talks gave
graduate students a chance to interact with each other, potentially leading to
new collaborations. The website for the conference is at

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
