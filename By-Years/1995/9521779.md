Zweibel, Ellen 95-21779 Dr. Zweibel will study how the presence of a magnetic
field affects the oscillation spectrum. She will try to develop both forward and
inverse methods to allow specification of the magnetic field and to allow
magnetic field effects to be distinguished from temperature or velocity effects.
