The 18th ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), sponsored by ACM
SIGCOMM will be held in Boston, MA October 31 - November 2, 2018. This award
assists 12-15 graduate students from US institutions to attend this conference.
IMC is the primary venue for presenting new research results on collecting and
analyzing measurements of the Internet. Attending conferences such as IMC is of
paramount importance for graduate students pursuing research in the field.
Authors have the opportunity to present their work and all attendees have a
chance to interact with many others performing leading-edge research in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will serve to widen the audience
attending the Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), raising the level of
interaction and the potential for new collaboration, new investigations, and
higher quality research. Given the rising cost of travel, the grant will enable
students, who otherwise do not have sufficient funds, to attend the
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal, by enabling students to attend
who might not otherwise be able, will increase the dissemination of the
conference's research results to a larger and more diverse audience. It also
integrates research and education of graduate students by allowing students to
observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the
field. By giving preference in grant awards to women and minority students, the
awardees hope to widen the participation among these underrepresented groups.
Furthermore, by advertising to a wide range of colleges and universities,
participants from a more diverse set of institutions should be able to attend
and benefit from the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
