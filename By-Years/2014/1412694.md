With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program is
supporting Jason McNeill of Clemson University to develop new imaging methods
that will make it easier to visualize complex environments, such as individual
cells or living tissue. The research is focused on the development of specially-
prepared particles made from a certain kind of plastic that gives off light when
it?s stimulated. Some of the particles being developed in this work have the
capability of sensing other properties of the system being imaged, such as the
local pH or local ion concentration. This work is having a broad impact on the
biomedical field through the development of new devices and techniques that will
make it possible to see inside living systems in new ways. The work may also
help provide new tools for looking inside small devices such as semiconductors
in fast electronics. The knowledge gained from this research will help to
improve the functioning of a multitude of devices, such as light-emitting
displays and photovoltaic cells.

The project focuses on tunable fluorescent nanoparticles for sensing and high-
resolution bioimaging. New methods for the synthesis of customizable
nanoparticles from conjugated polymers are being developed. These particles
display a combination of optical properties and sensing capabilities. The work
also involves the development of microscopic imaging methods especially adapted
for use with these nanoparticles. The specific chemical structure of the
nanoparticles imparts high fluorescence brightness and unusual optical
properties such as single-step photoswitching, highly non-linear fluorescence,
and sensing amplification via multiple energy transfer processes. The particles
also exhibit lower toxicity compared to nanoparticles that contain heavy metals.
Imaging methods are being developed to take advantage of the optical properties
of the nanoparticles in order to obtain sharp images and chemical information
inside cells and tissue, with a resolution of a few nanometers. The
nanoparticles will also be tuned for sensitive chemical sensing applications.
