This project will develop software to simulate flows and configurations to give
insight into the dynamic mixing processes involved in wakes, jets and shear
layers. In particular numerical code will be developed for flows of importance
in aerodynamics. By basing the family of models for two-dimensional viscous,
incompressible flows on a Lagrangian formulation of fluid motion, the dynamics
of mixing can be studied as a function of the Reynolds number. Viscosity is
introduced by allowing the vorticity to diffuse as in the exact self-similar
solution to the Navier-Stokes equations describing the viscous growth of an
isolated vortex core.
