This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will examine the
feasibility of developing an improved set of research and education modeling
tools which can be used by ecologists, water resource engineers, biologists,
foresters, and others in related disciplines. These tools will help in the
examination of issues such as: biological responses to climate change; carbon
balance in tropical forests; agricultural productivity; water runoff, yield and
quality analyses; and development of sustainable land use and forest management
policies. The conceptual models which will guide the development of these new
tools are extensions of developments during the last decade in several fields,
including: energetics-based ecological modeling and gradient analysis,
geographic information systems applications to spatially distributed
hydrometeorologic modeling, object-oriented programming methodologies, and
complex data visualization. The research objectives provide for the application
of recent Object-Oriented techniques to the redesign of an integrated ecosystem
model. Successful completion of this research will produce a software design
document which will then be used to improve existing models, and to determine
the feasibility of generalizing the software tools for other applications.
Improved ecological modeling tools are needed by researchers, engineers, and
planners. Success of this research, followed by development of the newly
designed tools, will result in a product which will find a global market among
government agencies, universities, private engineering and planning firms, and
ecology-oriented foundations.
