The Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) program has achieved its primary
developmental objectives during its initial five years of operation, 2009 -
2014, and successfully transitioned to an operation and management phase with
renewed five-year funding, 2014 - 2019. Renewed funding will enable continued
operations and maintenance of this data management service. Work in the next
five years includes continued operation of core infrastructure developed in the
developmental phase of funding, as well as selected new enhancements and
activities designed to improve R2R's products and services in response to
Advisory Committee feedback and user's requests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Benefits of R2R will extend to key stakeholders including
vessel operators, research scientists, data management researchers, cyber-
infrastructure developers, funding agencies, and the public. R2R will provide
tools and feedback to help marine technicians improve data quality and
documentation and will free them from the need to maintain a local data archive.
A central cruise catalog for the academic fleet will ensure that original field
data from every cruise are routinely preserved and disseminated, improving
access for scientists and the public and simplifying funding agency efforts to
enforce data sharing requirements. Standardization of data acquisition
procedures across the fleet will facilitate integration with observations from
other platforms such as NSF's Ocean Observatories Initiative, while enabling new
synthesis efforts for a global ocean that is vast and sparsely
explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
