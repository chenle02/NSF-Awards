This workshop is designed for undergraduate college faculty who teach courses in
historical geology, paleontology, petrology, or related fields, and who have had
little or no experience in modern carbonates. Its purpose is to expand the
participant's understanding of modern carbonate sediments, precursors of ancient
limestones, and post-depositional changes that effect them. Specific topics to
be examined include carbonate- secreting organisms, sediments, environments of
deposition, carbonate digenesis, soil formation and interpretation of
Pleistocene deposits. The program involves daily field work, labs and lectures
and will be held at the Bahamian Field Station, San Salvador, Bahamas.
Laboratory exercises, which can be conducted at the participants home
institutions, will utilize samples collected on daily field trips. A guidebook,
approximately 100 pages in length, will be prepared and provided for each
participant.
