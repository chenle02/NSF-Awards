The Department of State's overseas Science and Technology Officers will attend
their annual meeting in Washington in late September. Past meetings of these
officers have been very successful in providing them with briefings on major
policy developments and initiatives. The Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of
the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, in a letter to Secretary
Shultz before his resignation, emphasized the importance the Committee places on
annual S&T Officer meetings. NSF maintains close liaison with these officers in
order to facilitate gathering information on developments abroad that are likely
to have significant impacts on U.S. science and engineering. Joint support of
the meeting with the State Department will provide an opportunity for useful
working-level conversations with these officers on NSF's special information
requirements.
