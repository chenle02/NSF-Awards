8902663 Li Most systems of n polynomial equations in n unknowns arising in
applications are "deficient", in the same sense that they have fewer solutions
than that predicted by the total degree of the system. A procedure is introduced
and will be examined in light of efficiency and applicability for finding all
the isolated zeros of deficient polynomial systems which need to be solved
repetitively with varying coefficients. The procedure is based on the cheater's
homotopy, a continuation method which follows paths to all solutions. All
solutions are found with an amount of computational work roughly proportional to
the actual number of solutions, while previous general methods normally require
an amount of computation roughly proportional to the total degree. The research
will further investigate the structure of the deficiency on a case-by-case
basis. The main concern is, in a specific case, to find an initial polynomial
system for the homotopy that is simple to solve and also produces few extraneous
homotopy paths.
