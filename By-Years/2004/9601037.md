9601037 Jaworski A meeting will be held to discuss the biochemical and metabolic
aspects of 3-ketocyl synthases. These moieties are significant in several
essential metabolic pathways in plants, animals, and bacteria. This is a unique
opportunity for these researchers to get together and share their ideas.
Participation of students and postdoctoral fellows will be emphasized. ***
