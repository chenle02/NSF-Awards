Much of today's information infrastructure makes use of
virtual&lt;br/&gt;machines (VMs). For example, consumer devices typically
contain VMs&lt;br/&gt;for Java, JavaScript, and Flash. VMs are often well suited
to roll out&lt;br/&gt;new capabilities to a broad range of target devices, which
is why new&lt;br/&gt;VMs are being created all the time. Unfortunately, most VMs
today are&lt;br/&gt;created from scratch, in spite of the fact that they are
broadly&lt;br/&gt;similar. This is a considerable waste of programmer time and
money.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to make creating VMs simpler, by
creating&lt;br/&gt;a "toolbox" of components from which new VMs can be
constructed&lt;br/&gt;easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical challenge is to
create building blocks that can be put&lt;br/&gt;together to work as well as the
custom-crafted VMs of today. In many&lt;br/&gt;cases, VM performance is
critical. For example, on mobile devices, a&lt;br/&gt;slower VM might force us
to run the processor at a higher speed,&lt;br/&gt;leading to faster battery
depletion. This research promises that &lt;br/&gt;one may one day be able to
create a competitively&lt;br/&gt;performing VM for Java, JavaScript and Flash in
which some parts are&lt;br/&gt;shared, so that the total size is much smaller
than three separate&lt;br/&gt;VMs. This is important for resource-constrained
devices such as&lt;br/&gt;mobile phones. Re-using components rather than
reinventing the wheel&lt;br/&gt;each time would reduce the entry cost for new
languages. Sharing&lt;br/&gt;components would also lead to pooling of debugging
resources, reducing&lt;br/&gt;errors and thereby leading to a safer and more
stable computing&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure.
