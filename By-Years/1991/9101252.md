This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research of Professor
Shevlin under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) Program. The
results of this research will give new understanding to the mechanism of
formation of the recently discovered C60 allotrope of carbon, which possesses a
geodesic (Buckminster Fuller) structure. In addition, reaction of C60 will be
studied. There is intense interest in the formation, reactions, and properties
of this allotrope of carbon (graphite and diamond are examples of other
allotropes of carbon). It is thought that atomic carbon forms small reactive
fragments, which then undergo further reactions to eventually produce C60. This
hypothesis will be tested in experiments designed to trap the smaller fragment
precursors to C60. Abstractable hydrogen will be added to the helium bath gas as
the trapping reagent, with the expectation that the size of carbon clusters
which are trapped will be directly proportional to bath gas pressure and
inversely proportional to the amount of trapping reagent. In addition, the
reactions of some reactive intermediates (carbenes and benzyne) with C60 will be
studied. Reaction of chromium hexacarbonyl with C60 will also be explored.
