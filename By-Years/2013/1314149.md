The 2013 Microbial Population Biology Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and
Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will promote interactions among scientists from
diverse disciplines, including biochemistry, microbial and molecular genetics,
bioinformatics, virology, mathematics, evolutionary biology, biomedicine and
environmental microbiology. Abundant time will be permitted for informal
interactions among attendees, and everyone can present either a poster or
invited talk. The 2013 meeting creates an associated Gordon Research Seminar
immediately preceding the GRC, designed to foster interactions among younger
scientists, who are mentored by two established investigators that provide
valuable feedback on oral and poster
communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recognizing that strong recruitment of
young minds is vital to the field, speakers in the 2013 conference will include
postdoctoral researchers and early-career investigators, as well as
internationally-renowned senior scientists, also broadening participation by
fostering gender and ethnic diversity at the podium. Meeting results will be
disseminated through primary-journal articles, as well as reviews and lay-public
magazine articles. The proceedings will have broad societal impact due to their
relevance to biomedicine and industrial microbiology.
