Although it is widely accepted that plant characters such as secondary
chemistry, trichomes, and tough leaves have evolved primarily as defenses
against herbivores, particularly insects, little direct evidence exists
indicating that herbivorous insects impose natural selection on such resistance
traits. the goal of the research proposed here is to determine whether insects
exert natural selection on genetic variation for resistance in the morning
glory, Ipomoea purpurea. The basic technique will be to examine how the
experimental removal of four types of insects (the corn earworm, flea beetles,
tortoise beetles, and generalist folivores) affects the magnitude of selection
these insects impose on resistance to herbivory. In addition, whether resistance
is due at least in part to tolerance or compensation (the ability of a plant to
maintain a constant seed production despite herbivory) will be determined.
Finally, the physiological and morphological characters that are responsible for
resistance in insects in I. purpurea will be identified. Once these characters
are known, whether and how insects exert selection on such characters will be
examined.
