NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) and the
National Science Foundation (NSF) are currently planning to perform a Phase I
Environmental Due Diligence Audit (EDDA) regarding the transfer of the National
Scientific Balloon Facility (NSBF), Palestine, Texas, property from NSF to NASA-
WFF under the General Service Administration (GSA) Real Property Disposal
Process. The purpose of the Phase I EDDA is to identify areas of hazardous waste
contamination and any environmental liability associated with a property to be
transferred. The scope of the work shall be in accordance with accepted protocol
with the ultimate goal of defining and minimizing environmental liabilities to
the NSF and NASA.
