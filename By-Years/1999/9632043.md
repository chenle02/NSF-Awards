9632043 Murty This GOALI grant supports an engineering student for a one year
period in industry to investigate the effects of alloy chemistry and process
factors on specific intermetallic phases which influence zirconium alloy
(Zircaloy) properties and performance. Intermetallics undergo changes in
structure that affect mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. The
structural include phase nucleation, growth and restructuring during material
processing, and these changes are strongly influenced by the concentrations of
the alloying elements. Variables include beta-quench temperature and quench
rate, post-beta-quench cold-work and annealing, and subsequent cold-work/anneal
cycles to control final precipitate morphology. The research examines corrosion
(nodular and uniform), microstructure (with particular attention to
intermetallics), mechanical properties, and manufacturability, evaluated using
automated ball indentation. Zirconium alloy sheet material is used to simulate
tubing for ease of fabrication and testing. The study is performed in
collaboration with the General Electric Company's Zircaloy manufacturing center
in Wilmington, NC, and Vallecitos nuclear center in California. %%% Zircaloys
are widely used in fission reactors as thin-walled tubing for cladding nuclear
fuel, intermediate grids, channels (BWRs), and calandria tubing (PHWRs). The
research program allows a student to learn on-site the metallurgical factors
associated with the application of this alloy. ***
