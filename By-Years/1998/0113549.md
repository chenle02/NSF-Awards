This program provides an opportunity for faculty from other universities to
receive education in information assurance with the focus on being able to teach
the core concepts to their students. The target audience is faculty members from
4 year colleges and universities who are teaching computer science, information
systems, or related fields and have a working knowledge of computers. They
participate in a summer workshop to help them integrate the material into their
courses or to help them develop new courses. Participating faculty take two
courses offered via distance education. They also receive support material to
help them integrate the subject material into their existing courses. The
delivery consists of video taped lectures and on-line support through chat-
rooms, emails, and phone. Several of the courses offer a hands-on learning
experience where the faculty perform experiments and use software systems
remotely through the Internet.
