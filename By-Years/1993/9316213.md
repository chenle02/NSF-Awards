ABSTRACT Hoffman, G. Lyle AST-9316213 Radioastronomical observations and
analyses will be made to continue a long-term study of how galaxies aggregate on
various scales from small groups through superclusters, of the nature and
properties of particular morphological types of galaxies, and physical processes
affecting the outermost edges of HI disks. Data from the Arecibo Observatory for
two samples of galaxies will be analyzed. Observations of faint candidate
members of all groups within the declination range of the Arecibo telescope will
be observed and analyzed to study the extension of the Tully-Fisher relation to
fainter objects, to obtain even more precise distances to the groups, and to
investigate the dynamics of the individual groups as well as the tidal
influences on them produced by the Local Supercluster and more distant mass
concentrations. ***
