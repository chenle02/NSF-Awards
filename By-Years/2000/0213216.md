The research is focused in two connected directions. First, new carbonylative
carbotricyclizations and related reactions will be developed. The method
provides an efficient method for the production of fused polycyclic systems.
Second, enantioselective and regioselective hydrocarbonylation reactions will be
carried out with fluorous catalysis using fluorinated solvents and with fluorous
catalysis using supercritical carbon dioxide. The prospects are high for
developing methodology wherein catalyst recovery and reuse are possible, thereby
leading to practical green chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research efforts
of Dr. Iwao Ojima of the Department of Chemistry at SUNY, Stony Brook. Professor
Ojima will focus his work on developing methodology to affect carbocyclization
and carbonylation reactions. He will also develop green chemistry in catalytic
organic synthesis promoted by transition metal catalysts. The research has
broader impact for the training of students and for use in the pharmaceutical
and agricultural industries. Collaboration between academia and industry are
already in place.
