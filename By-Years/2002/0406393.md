The cell biology community at Case Western Reserve University will organize a
two-day meeting that focuses on regulation of nuclear function. Topics include
structure and biogenesis of the nuclear pore complex, membrane-associated
factors that regulate transport, and transport of proteins or RNAs into and out
of the nucleus. Presentations will encourage interaction between students and
invited speakers.
