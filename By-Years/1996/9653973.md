The purpose of the New Mexico Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher
Preparation (CETP) is to improve the science, mathematics, and technology
preparation of future K-12 teachers and their effectiveness as educators in
these vital areas. The goal will be achieved by accomplishing five exciting
objectives: Reforming content and teaching by designing an innovative,
integrated curriculum Developing policies which require improved math and
science preparation of teachers Supporting novice teachers through a strong
support system during critical early years Increasing diversity in the teachin
profession through innovative recruiting, retention, and instruction which serve
diverse groups, particularly American Indians Disseminating results - including
innovative materials - to instutions nationwide The New Mexico CETP represents a
partnership of five universities, four community colleges, 11 public school
districts, two state agencies, and two national laboratories. This proposal is
the result of a two-year planning effort by these partners. Among the innovative
features of the New Mexico CETP are novel plans for: 1) Science, mathematics,
engineering, and technology (SMET) departments to integrate future teachers into
their culture; 2) Teacher placement in the schools and early professional
development, and 3) Mechnisms to recruit individuals who already have degrees
but either are not certified to teach or lack a strong SMET background. The
collaborative's partners believe this program will provide a grand change in
teacher education in New Mexico by improving the preparation of teachers in SMET
fields.
