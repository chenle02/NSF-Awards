Chemistry (12)

This project is focusing on the concept of molecular structure within the
chemistry laboratory curriculum. The overall goal of the project is to
strengthen student understanding of molecular structure through use of nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) as an essential method for obtaining structural
information. With the revised curriculum, students are developing expertise
using NMR through a systematic introduction to NMR theory and concepts.
Furthermore, the vertical integration in lab courses is allowing students to
build on previous experiences with NMR to develop increasingly richer
understanding of molecular structure.

This new laboratory curriculum is being assessed using the "Perspectives of
Chemists" framework, a set of tools designed by previously supported NSF
initiatives. This framework divides chemistry into overarching ideas that
permeate the curriculum and allows for assessing the progression of student
understanding around these "perspectives". Applying these classroom curriculum
models to the laboratory setting represents a new extension of the framework.

By explicitly demonstrating the use of NMR in practical applications and by
allowing hands on access to the instrument, students are gaining insight into
chemical problem solving and confidence in their abilities to gather, analyze,
and interpret structural features of molecules.
