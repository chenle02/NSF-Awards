Since its founding in the mid-nineteenth century, Mt. Holyoke College strongly
supported science and contributed to the development of a place for women in
science and of a scientific community that reached far beyond the walls of the
college. In their study, Drs. Mack and Levin take a broad view of the
development of science education in America and the contributions women have
made to it. Their work sheds light on the way in which science at Mt. Holyoke
was affected by the professionalization of science, changing attitudes in the
larger society towards the role of women, and shifting economic and social
circumstances in which liberal arts colleges operated. Specifically, Drs. Mack
and Levin are pursuing three lines of inquiry. The first is concerned with the
ideology and policies of the school's administrators, trustees, and faculty, the
social and economic circumstances within which these ideologies and policies
were formulated, and the manner in which they changed over time; the second,
with the actual programs, activities, expansions, and reforms that were enacted;
and the third with exploring the results of these policies and programs and
assessing their possible influence on the scientific community and the
interested public for science. Not only will the study contribute to our
understanding the historical processes that account for the participation as
well as the lack of participation of women in American science in the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries, but in doing so, it will also add to our comprehension
of the circumstances under which we can expect women to respond to opportunities
in science. This funding of this project is being shared with the Science
Engineering Education Directorate.
