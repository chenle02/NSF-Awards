Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas that retains heat 300 times more
efficiently than carbon dioxide. Thus while nitrous oxide is 1000 times less
abundant than carbon dioxide its contribution to global warming is significant.
Emissions of nitrous oxide from agricultural soils may have a greater impact on
global warming than those from carbon dioxide. We do not, however, yet
understand how to manage soils to reduce emission of nitrous oxide. This depends
on understanding the relative importance of the two predominant processes by
which soil microbes produce nitrous oxide, denitrification and nitrification. In
this proposal we are the first to apply isotopomers, the measurement of both N
atoms in nitrous oxide, to evaluate the origins of this gas. We have
demonstrated that such information can distinguish nitrous oxide produced by
denitrification and nitrification and will apply isotopomers in a variety of
terrestrial environments.
