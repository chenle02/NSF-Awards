The proposal addresses the problem of simultaneous control of a machine - e.g. a
robot - by a number of independent operators. Such situations are likely to
appear, for example, when robots are controlled via Internet from various
locations, and also in tele-immersion and teleworking. As a possibility, inputs
from the participants may be combined to generate a single control stream -
which is equivalent to the participants collaborating rather competing with each
other. New fundamental reaserch issues that appear in systems with multi-user
control of a single device - in the context of theory, algorithms, and system
implementation - will be investigated.
