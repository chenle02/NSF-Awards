9502450 Love This is an award to provide the support this investigator requested
in response to NSF 94-101, the National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career
Development (CAREER) Program which has the intent of encouraging the early
development of academic faculty as educators and researchers. The research this
investigator plans to conduct is directed toward improving our fundamental
understanding of the biodegradation patterns of benzene, toluene and xylene
compounds in an anoxic/aerobic sequencing batch, suspended biomass reaction
process for treatment of wastewater containing these pollutants. The
investigator's education plan involves incorporating the research procedures
into courses to illustrate the beneficial attributes of combining physical and
biological approaches to the engineering design of systems to accomplish useful
environmental goals and objectives. Results of this investigator's research are
likely to improve the approaches taken toward engineering design of sequencing
batch reaction processes for removal of benzene, toluene xylene compounds from
wastewater. The teaching plan she plans to pursue is likely to produce
innovations in the way that environmental engineering undergraduate courses are
taught. ***
