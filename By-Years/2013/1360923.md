This grant funds student travel to the International Conference on Software
Engineering (ICSE 2014), to be held in June 2014 in Hyderabad, India. This is
the flagship conference in the Software Engineering field for researchers,
practitioners and educators to present and discuss the most recent innovations,
trends, experiences, etc. Funding for student travel has significant broader
impacts because of the the opportunity it gives the students to become part of
the research community, discuss their research with others, meet leaders in the
field, and have experiences toward building the future, global workforce. The
funds are for US-based students with attention to broadening participation from
underrepresented groups.
