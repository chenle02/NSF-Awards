Large loops and filaments of ionized gas have been observed lying outside the
boundaries of HII regions in some irregular galaxies. The origin and source of
ionization of these features is not known, but they could be involved in star
formation feedback processes and in dispersing heavy elements throughout
feedback processes and in which they are observed. The Principal Investigator,
explore the physical nature of these structures to elucidate their role in star
formation activity.
