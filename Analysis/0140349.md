The proposal deals with several topics in low-dimensional dynamics. The PI
plans to investigate the topological dynamics of laminations; in particular he
would like to further develop the dynamics of growing trees and use it to study
the behavior of the vertices of the Julia set. He also wants to consider classes
of non-analytic plane maps for whom analogs of well-known results for
polynomials can be proven. Other directions of his research are related to
attractos for classes of rational maps and to further developing the rotation
theory which studies coexistence of cycles depending on their characteristics
similar to rotation numbers for circle maps of degree one.

The theory of dynamical systems gives tools to study complex systems, for
example the evolution of a complicated deterministic process over time. There is
a rich and distinguished tradition of using these powerful tools in other
sciences like communication theory, statistical physics, and chemical kinetics.
