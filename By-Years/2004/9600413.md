This is a project submitted under Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER).
It is designed to obtain public opinion data prior to the 1995 Russian
legislative election during a period of rapid social change in Russia and the
potential emergence of new obstacles to democratization. The research will make
significant substantive and theoretical contributions to our understanding of
how major social changes, including the creation of new institutions, lead to
social dislocations and rising tensions related to regional, urban/rural, and
ethnic and religious cleavages. It is a follow-up of a survey conducted around
the 1993 election, enabling the researchers to measure changing public
perceptions and levels of discontent. Analysis is based on a national survey of
4,000 respondents. %%% This research will contribute to sociological
understanding of the process of democratization and its effects on diverse
population groups. An examination of public reactions to rapid social changes
and to the opportunities for expressing political choices will demonstrate the
ways in which the Russian situation is similar or different from that of other
countries undergoing a transition to democracy. In addition to the scientific
gains from this research, the project will encourage scientific ties with
researchers in Russia.
