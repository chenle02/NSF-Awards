The proposed research will focus on the investigation of non-supersymmetric
string theories and time dependent dynamics in string theory. It explores the
relation of nonsupersymmetric string theories to supersymmetric string theories
as well as M-Theory. The focus will be on using tachyon condensation to relate
these theories. The methods that will be used are conformal field theory and
renormalization group Another focus of the research is the resolution of space-
time singularities in string theories that are defined on spaces that are
geometrically singular such as orbifolds and conifolds. To understand
cosmological and other space-like singularities new tools will need to be
developed. We propose to study time dependent dynamics in string theory in order
to understand whether there are viable alternatives to the inflationary paradigm
of cosmology.
