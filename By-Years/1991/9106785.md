Several frameworks have been applied to organization of communities under
natural selection. Of these, the concept of Evolutionarily Stable Strategies
(ESS) provides a powerful framework evaluating the consequences of density-
dependent and frequency-dependent selection within and among species. Here, the
ESS concept will be applied to the investigation of three evolutionary scenarios
relevant to natural selection's influence on properties of communities: 1)
predator-prey coevolution, 2) evolution of habitat and diet selection, and 3)
evolution in spatially heterogeneous environments. The predator-prey model
breaks the traditional dichotomy between the coevolution of competitors and the
coevolution of predator-prey by permitting coevolution among species within and
between trophic levels. Habitat selection as an evolutionary game considers the
prevalent role of habitat and diet partitioning in promoting the evolution and
coexistence of competitors. In all three scenarios, the emphasis is on
determining evolutionary and ecological properties of communities that promote
or inhibit species diversity.
