This project is based on two theses: (1) autonomous robotic manipulation
requires a large repertoire of actions; and (2) autonomous manipulation does not
decouple into separate arm and hand functions. The project's goal is to
establish the principles and techniques to endow a robot with a large repertoire
of manipulative actions, many of them involving an intimate coordination of arm
and hand. The approach is to develop these principles and techniques using
physics-based models as well as machine learning of empirical models. The
project is developing and testing these principles and techniques by attacking
several challenge tasks. The work is organized to address three primary
challenges: (1) identifying actions; (2) modeling actions; and (3) orchestrating
actions. For the first challenge, identifying actions, the project is adapting
previous physics-based manipulation research, along with ordinary robotic
engineering of behaviors inspired by humans and existing robotic systems. For
the second challenge, modeling actions, the project is augmenting physics-based
models work with empirical stochastic modeling drawn from previous applications
of machine learning. For the third challenge, orchestrating actions, the project
is adapting previous work on sensor-based planning and control. The project's
expected broader impacts includes more capable robots, which will simplify
deployment, enable new applications and improve existing applications, which
ultimately serves to improve productivity, services, and national economic
competitiveness.
