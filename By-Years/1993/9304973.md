This action provides funds for Research Planning Grant to study pseudotachylyte
formed in an extensional tectonic regime. Pseudotachylyte is more commonly
studied in compressional, transpressional or strike-slip regimes, and this study
will characterize features of pseudotachylyte from the extensional Southern
Mountains of Arizona. Results will be applied as a foundation for later, more
detailed studies.
