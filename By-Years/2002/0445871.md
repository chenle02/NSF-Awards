Our world is composed of an infinite expanse of objects, events, and object
properties that must be meaningfully organized by anyone attempting to survive
in it. Remarkably, even infants easily categorize this complex environment into
meaningful units. How do they succeed at this seemingly overwhelming task? With
support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Amy Booth will conduct
research designed to answer this fundamental question. Specifically, she will
consider whether and how infants' natural curiosity about how objects function
might facilitate their learning of new categories. The research will be
conducted on 14-month-old infants who will be introduced to novel categories
under a number of different conditions. Variations in learning success should
reveal the components of object function that provide support for forming new
categories, as well as the mechanisms by which they do so.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Booth's project will have important implications for
theories of early categorization and conceptual development. More broadly, the
impacts of this project include applications to early education and intervention
programs. The better we understand the mechanisms underlying early conceptual
development, the better we will be equipped to identify the experiences that
will foster optimal cognitive and linguistic development in children. In
addition, this project provides opportunities for several undergraduate and
graduate students to directly participate in research.&lt;br/&gt;
