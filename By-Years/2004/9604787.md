Funds are requested to replace an existing Varian VXR 500-S 500 MHz NMR
spectrometer console, which is part of the Chemistry Department NMR Facility at
Florida State University. Our objective is to replace the existing console with
one having three independent radio frequency (rf) channels, waveform generators
for each rf channel, and a three-axis pulsed-field gradient accessory. To take
advantage of the additional hardware capabilities, we will also purchase a total
of three new double- and triple-resonance probes and an off-line Silicon
Graphics Indy workstation out-fitted with an external hard-drive and a CD
recorder. The 11.7 T Oxford super-conducting magnet, which has very good drift
and lineshape specifications, will not be replaced. To optimize the lineshape of
the water resonance in biological samples, a new room-temperature shim set will
be purchased. This course of action will substantially enhance the overall
capabilities of the instrument in a cost-effective manner, while retaining the
desirable functional components of the existing system. The replacement
spectrometer console will be used for solution studies of ( 1 ) glycoprotein
structural biology, (2) protein folding, (3) protein-solvent interactions, (4)
RNA structure, (5) structures of RNAprotein complexes, and (6) larger organic
molecules.
