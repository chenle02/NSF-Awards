This three year project for the special initiative, "Projects to Promote the
Use of Technology in the Teaching of Science and Mathematics", is designed to
effect change in mathematics education by integrating technology into the
classroom. The project will focus on graphing calculators and symbolic
manipulators, and will include the use of spreadsheets, CD ROMs, and state-of-
the-art software in teaching and learning statistics, discrete mathematics,
number theory, computation, geometry, algebra, and advanced mathematics. The
project aims to alter instructional and learning strategies by incorporating
technology with content knowledge and cognitive skills. The program will develop
instructional materials and classroom models for effective integration of the
technology. Participants will be selected in teams of five grade 6-12 teachers
to facilitate coordination between middle and secondary schools. The ten teams
selected will participate in three-week summer workshops for three summers and
in follow-up activities during the subsequent academic years. Set in
southeastern Wisconsin, the targeted schools are in areas with large minority
populations, and special attention will be paid to stimulating the interest of
under-represented groups in mathematics. The project will promote the ownership
of the teachers' role as effective change agents for mathematics education
within and across districts. This project is mainstream - oriented squarely in
the direction currently advocated by the mathematical community.
