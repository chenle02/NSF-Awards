Recently several hundred kilometer of high quality multichannel seismic data
were acquired in continental margin of Central California by DIGICON with their
State of the art acquisition system. The project was funded by a consortium of
industrial, academic and research organizations. This award will enable the
principal investigator to process and interpret two key seismic profiles
acquired in this project. The new data will help to investigate the deep
structures off central California. Several vital questions, such as, the
strutural style of the deeper strata, the configuration of the boundary fault,
structure beneath the major fault blocks and the structure in the upper mantle
will be answered when this project is sucessfully completed. Dr. Silver is well
known for his expertise in structural geology and is a suitable investigator for
this project.
