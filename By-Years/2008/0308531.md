Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is one part of a collaborative
research effort between Dr. Yeung of Georgia Tech (CTS-0120030) and Dr.
Sreenivasan of Yale University on the Reynolds and Schmidt number scalings in
turbulence and turbulent mixing. The research will include simulations and
experiments. Dr. Yeung who has access to the Teraflop IBM SP at the San Diego
Supercomputer Center under NPACI will make direct numerical simulations of the
flow. With Teraflop capability, simulations will be carried out at much higher
resolutions than here-to-fore. Dr. Sreenivasan will carry out experiments in a
tunnel using cryogenic liquid helium or nitrogen as the working fluid, which
will result in much higher Reynolds number flows. The data generated at high
Reynolds numbers both by DNS and cryogenic experiments will be used together
with existing data at lower Reynolds numbers to test the scaling laws. Both
proposals were sent to the reviewers at the same time, and they were requested
to return a single evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;
