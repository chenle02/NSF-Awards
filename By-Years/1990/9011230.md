This research project consists of a study of several types of ion-solid
interactions and their application to the characterization, analysis, and
processing of advanced electronic and photonic materials. Million electron volt
ion implantation will be utilized in the fabrication of high performance single
mode solid state lasers. Studies will be conducted to understand at a
fundamental level the ion-solid processes involved, and the causes of ion
implantation induced changes in optical and electrical properties in III-V
semiconductor materials. Additionally, heavy-ion Rutherford backscattering with
time-of- flight detection will be further developed to solve the current problem
of quantitative analysis of particular III-V material combinations such as
Indium in Indium Gallium Arsenide and Indium Gallium Nitride. Certain aspects of
sputtering and related processes are also included as part of this research
effort to provide greater understanding of materials and processing fundamentals
important to the fabrication of high performance electronic and photonic devices
and circuits.
