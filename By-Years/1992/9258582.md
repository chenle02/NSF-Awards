This NYI award will support the research of a promising and accomplished young
investigator. His research will include studies of string theory and particle-
astrophysics. In string theory he will study aspects of spacetime duality (in
particular, mirror symmetry), topological field theory, thermal and cosmological
string physics. In particle-astrophysics he will study aspects of phase
transitions, nontopological solitons, thermal field theory and astrophysical
signatures of extensions of the standard model.
