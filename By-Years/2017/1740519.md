A central endeavor of theoretical computer science is to classify computational
problems according to the resources (such as running time and storage space)
needed to solve them.  Although the field of algorithm design has been highly
successful in discovering efficient, polynomial-time algorithms for problems of
practical interest, little evidence has been shown for the optimality of most
algorithms.  The goal of this project is to build a useful complexity theory for
the class of polynomial-time solvable problems (called P), by proving
equivalences between problems and proving conditional lower bounds on specific
problems, assuming the validity of certain plausible mathematical conjectures.

Known lower bounds for specific problems in P are conditioned on some
complexity-theoretic assumption such as the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis
(concerning the complexity of k-CNF-SAT), the conjecture that dense all-pairs
shortest paths (APSP) requires cubic time, or that 3SUM requires quadratic
time.  The goals of this project are threefold.  The first goal is to establish
conditional lower bounds on problems in diverse areas (such as graph
optimization, string matching, geometry, and dynamic data structures) using
standard hardness conjectures. The second goal is to search for better hardness
conjectures that are both plausible and versatile, and to discover relationships
(implications or equivalences) between nominally unrelated conjectures.  The
last goal is to investigate the plausibility of these conjectures by attempting
to disprove them.

The curricular portion of this project involves developing lecture material
suitable for introductory algorithms and complexity courses at both the
undergraduate and graduate level.
