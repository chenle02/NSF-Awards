The Divisions of Chemistry (CHE) and Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and
Transport Systems (CBET) jointly fund this award to the National Academy of
Sciences to support the core activities of the Board on Chemical Sciences and
Technology (BCST). The BCST serves as the locus of chemical and chemical
engineering expertise within the National Research Council, an institution
recognized and respected for the independent technical advice it gives federal
agencies. BCST has broad representation from academe, industry and non-profit
organizations, and uses the collective expertise to identify the needs for
topical studies, brings this to the attention of decision-makers, and works with
them to obtain funding and needed technical advice to address these issues. BCST
responds via peer reviewed consensus reports, workshops and symposia, and has
broad outreach into the chemical community and beyond.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three primary goals of the activities proposed:
(1) BCST will meet three times a year to identify areas of particular importance
to the well being of the nation and/or the chemical sciences and to discuss
topics that chemistry and chemical engineering might impact; (2) BCST will
increase its outreach to new audiences to expand general knowledge of the
capabilities of chemists and chemical engineers to society, and; (3) BCST will
continue its oversight of studies carried out under its authority to ensure that
the study task is appropriate, that the experts tapped for committee service
have the best qualifications, and that the reports are of the highest quality
and well-grounded in objective scientific reasoning.&lt;br/&gt;
