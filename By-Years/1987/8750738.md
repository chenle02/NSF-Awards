Under this project, computer aided design will be integrated into the mechanical
engineering curriculum. The laboratory will be built around the Tektronix 4125
and 4129 color graphics workstations with graphics terminals. These in turn will
be networked on a Data General MV 4000. Among the improvements planned are: the
incorporation of solid modeling techniques into the freshman engineering
graphics, kinematic movements of linkages, thermal analysis using ANSYS, the
analysis of beams using an in-house developed package, and the use of ANSYS as
an analytical tool in experimental data analysis. It is expected that the
laboratory will impact all four years of the students training through various
exercises.
