Research focuses on extraction processes. Some recent preliminary experiments
indicate that, contrary to the established widom, alkaline extraction solutions,
with suitable modifiers, may have clear advantages in the recovery of gold and
several semi-precious metals including tungsten, rhenium and chromium from
solution. Verification of the indicated phenomenon could open new possibilities
in separation by complexation methods.
