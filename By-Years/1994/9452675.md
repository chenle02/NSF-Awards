9452675 Carluccio The Central Connecticut State University will initiate a
three- week, residential, multi-disciplinary Young Scholars project which will
provide science enrichment activities for 50 students entering grades 9 and 10.
This summer program will emphasize research participation in biology, chemistry,
the earth sciences, and physics. The students will be involved in a combination
of laboratory and field experiences and experiments, a research project,
demonstrations, lectures and discussions to encourage participants to pursue
careers in science and engineering education. The program provides intensive
interdisciplinary exposure to science concepts and methods as students design
and conduct their own experiments.
