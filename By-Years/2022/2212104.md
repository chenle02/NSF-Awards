The 27th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (ACM
MobiCom 2021) will be held from Jan. 31, 2022 through Feb. 4, 2022 in New
Orleans, Louisiana, and the 28th Annual International Conference on Mobile
Computing and Networking (ACM MobiCom 2022). MobiCom is dedicated to addressing
the challenges of mobile computing and networking and has emerged as one of the
leading conferences covering networks, systems, algorithms, and applications
that support the convergence of mobile computers and wireless networks. MobiCom
attracts world-leading researchers and practitioners to attend and present their
work and participate in panels and keynote sessions. In addition to the regular
conference program, MobiCom 2021 and 2022 will include a set of workshops,
panels, research demonstrations, and a poster session that includes the ACM
Student Research Competition (SRC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF travel grant
will encourage more students to attend the conference and avail the benefits of
interacting with leading researchers in the areas of mobile computing and
networking and get motivated by the high-quality research work and discussions
in the conference. The travel grant program has a proven record of providing
minority and underrepresented students the means to benefit from this
educational experience. Participation in MobiCom is an extremely important part
of the graduate school experience, provides students with an opportunity to
interact with more senior researchers, and exposes them to leading-edge research
in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
