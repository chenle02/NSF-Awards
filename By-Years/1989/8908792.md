This study addresses the effect of income support, in the form of Aid to
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), on the poverty of children in single-
parent families. The Principal Investigator draws on a large, longitudinal data
set (the Panel Study of Income Dynamics), collected over twenty-one years, to
test the hypothesis that generous welfare benefits undermine the work ethic of
recipients and thereby contribute to the growth of an underclass in the United
States. Since the AFDC guarantee (the amount of money paid to single-parent
families with no other source of income) varies by state and within states over
time, this research can investigate whether higher AFDC guarantees ameliorate or
perpetuate poverty, and the conditions under which either outcome is likely. The
findings from this study can contribute information as to the optimal level for
welfare benefits. It can also shed light on an issue of vital concern among
policy makers, that higher welfare benefit levels may hurt rather than help the
poor in the long run.
