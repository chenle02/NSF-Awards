9322834 Kay The objective of this research is to develop a system to control
multiple free-ranging automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) by monitoring the travel
areas of the vehicles in a facility. The monitoring process is to be achieved
through the use of overhead cameras to cover large areas of heavy traffic and
other types of sensors for areas where the use of cameras is considered to be
uneconomical. Travel area monitoring can fully exploit the potential
capabilities of these vehicles to provide low-cost, flexible, and safe long
distance materials handling in a dynamic indoor environment. Area monitoring
will ensure the identification of short travel time routes for vehicles moving
between points. The research addresses a problem that has significant
implications in material handling and the operation of the factories of the
future. It is particularly useful in environments where the aisles are shared by
different mobile devices, including operating personnel. The use of free-ranging
AGVs offers some flexibility that wire-guided AGVs do not offer. Their control
in the work area is more challenging, data intensive, and taxing in terms of
computational requirements.
