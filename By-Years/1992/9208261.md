This project continues the planning and implementation of the U.S. Joint Global
Ocean Flux Program (U.S. JGOFS). The principal theme is to identify and quantify
the physical, chemical and biological processes controlling biogeochemical
cycling in the ocean, and their interaction with the global atmosphere. The goal
is to understand the processes governing the production and fate of biogenic
materials in the sea well enough to predict their influences on, and responses
to, global scale perturbations. In order to achieve these complex goals, the
Planning and Coordination Office serves the needs of coordination,
implementation, communication, publication, planning and representation of the
scientific issues involved, both nationally and internationally. A major process
study in the Equatorial Pacific is underway, as well as planning for subsequent
studies. Measurements at the Bermuda and Hawaii Time-Series stations continue
during the next three years, and a JGOFS global survey of CO2, pigments and
optics measurements is a continuing element on the WOCE Hydrographic Program
cruises.
