Cyber Trust: Real-Time Internet Routing Anomaly Detection and
Mitigation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zhuoqing Mao, University of Michigan Ann

0430204&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
investigating the detection and mitigation of routing anomalies, defined broadly
to be any unexpected Internet routing behavior resulting in data packets unable
to reach the actual destination with reasonable performance or not following the
advertised routes to reach the destination. This work involves designing a novel
distributed routing Intrusion Detection System (Router IDS) for performing real-
time routing anomaly detection and mitigation. The Router IDS detects routing
anomalies by combining publicly available routing data from multiple vantage
points to check consistency and identify deviations from past routing behavior.
It disambiguates uncertainties by correlating routing data with both passively
collected traffic data as well as actively triggered lightweight probe packets.
In response to detected routing anomalies, routing policies are modified or the
suspicious routing updates are filtered. Overlay routing can also be used to
bypass the router using the incorrect route.&lt;br/&gt;This project is building
a prototype to test the effectiveness of the detection and mitigation
algorithms. The prototype can be deployed at any network domain to achieve
protection from external routing anomalies. The project involves ongoing
collaboration with researchers at research labs, industry, and the operator
community, in order to provide practical insights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
