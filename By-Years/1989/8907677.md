This instrumentation will support research in the following areas: 1) Networks
in the Retina and Lateral Geniculate Nucleus, and 2) Information Processing in
the Visual Cortex. Experimental results on neural mapping will be sought from
single and multi- unit recording with microeletrodes placed in the optic pathway
and cerebral cortex of anesthetized monkeys. The research plan includes
exploitation of new mathematical and computational methodologies for mapping
receptive fields. These use theories of nonlinear systems analysis and require
the capability of generating complex, pseudorandom patterns and then analyzing
neural responses with mathematical transforms that require substantial computing
power. Other projects in the research plan required image stabilization for
precise mapping from the retinal image to the neural image on the cerebral
cortex. This proposal requests a workstation with graphics display hardware and
software for creating complex visual images, and a Fourward Technologies eye-
tracker and image stabilization instrument for precise control of image location
and of stimulus dynamics.
