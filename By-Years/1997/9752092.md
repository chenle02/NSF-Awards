The project "Scientific and Technological Education in Photonics" (STEP) is
being conducted by a national alliance of community colleges, tech-prep schools,
universities, industry leaders, scientists from government labs, photonics
societies, and non-profit organizations. Photonics is a very fast growing
technical area that employs many technicians. STEP is meeting the challenge of
technician training for the 21st century in rapidly expanding photonics
industries and other industries who use photonics as a key enabling technology.
A consortium representing above all of the partners is developing and validating
an industry-driven curriculum for an Associate of Science Degree in photonics.
The photonics societies, OSA and SPIE, is providing a forum for industry leaders
to determine the skill standards. Two-year college faculty, supported by
university researchers to maintain technology currency, are creating the
detailed curriculum. This project is also producing, field testing, and
disseminating the introductory course, Fundamentals of Photonics in what is
expected to be an eight course sequence. The courses meet both academic and
voluntary industry skill standards and are articulated with preparation of
secondary school students and with courses in four year colleges and
universities. The course is being evaluated by pre- and post- instruction test
to continuously improve and implement the curriculum content and educational
cognitive psychology. *
