This collaborative research project between the Exploratorium and Utah State's
Department of Instructional Technology and Learning Sciences investigates online
evaluation approaches and the application of educational data mining to
educational digital libraries and services. Much work over the past decades has
focused on developing algorithms and methods for discovering patterns in large
datasets, known as Knowledge Discovery from Data (KDD). Webmetrics, the
application of KDD to web usage mining, is growing rapidly in areas such as
e-commerce. Educational Data Mining (EDM) is just beginning to emerge as a tool
to analyze the massive, longitudinal user data that are captured in online
learning environments and educational digital
libraries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses EDM to examine data from the
Exploratorium's Learning Resources Collection and the Instructional Architect at
Utah State University. The results are combined with more traditional evaluation
data (e.g., surveys, interviews) as part of a comprehensive strategy to
understand science teachers' behaviors, motivations, and learning experiences
with digital library resources &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of this
targeted research promise to contribute new knowledge regarding Knowledge
Discovery from Data and the application of Educational Data Mining to digital
libraries. The project informs improvements in the design of the user
experience, as well as tailored teacher professional development, contributing
to a growing body of research on teacher learning by using cyber-enabled
approaches.
