Assessment developers, state departments of education, and national consortia
have focused extensive efforts on including Technology-Enhanced Items (TEIs) on
summative and formative assessments. TEIs have a number of potential benefits
over traditional, selected-response (SR) items, including the potential to
measure higher-level constructs, the reduction of the effects of test-taking
skills and guessing, the capture of rich diagnostic information, the reduction
of cognitive load from non-relevant constructs, and the engaging nature of their
design. The first three benefits are true of constructed-response (CR) items,
but TEIs have the added benefit of being automatically scored by computer.
Despite the potential benefits of TEIs, and the strong push to include these
types of items in assessments, there is a death of research on the validity of
inferences made by TEIs and on whether TEIs provide improved measurement over
traditional item types. The Validity of Technology-Enhanced Assessment in
Geometry (VTAG) project contributes to the small research base by exploring the
validity of TEIs in the context of elementary geometry.

The project addresses three research questions:

RQ1: To what extent are TEIs a valid measurement of geometry standards in the
elementary grades? RQ2: To what extent do TEIs provide an improved measurement
compared to SR items? RQ3: What are the general characteristics of mathematics
standards that might be better measured through TEIs?

To address these research questions, the researchers develop 20 items (ten SR
items and 10 TEIs) for each of the seven Common Core State Standards in fourth
and fifth grade geometry. The researchers collect validity evidence using expert
review, cognitive labs, and classroom administration of the items. The first two
research questions are addressed by evaluating the validity of the items based
on a variety of sources, including test content, internal structure, the
relationship to other variables, and student response processes. To address the
third research question, informed by the results of the prior two, the
researchers use qualitative analysis to identify common themes of the standards
that were identified as being better measured through TEIs.
