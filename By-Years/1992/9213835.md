This Science in Developing Countries award will support travel for 7 U.S.
participants in a Statistics Workshop to be held at the University of Campinas,
Brazil, January 18-23, 1993. The U.S. organizer is Lynne Billard of the American
Statistical Association, which is sponsoring the Workshop jointly with the
Inter- American Statistical Institute and the Brazilian Statistical Association.
The Workshop provides three forums in which internationally recognized
statistical experts will present lectures and seminars on the latest, cutting-
edge topics to participants who are primarily from Latin America. These forums
will be a school of regression models, seminars on biostatistics, health, and
environment, and a short course on repeated measures and longitudinal analysis.
The potential benefits of the Workshop include the development of future
collaborative research ties among statisticians from North and South America.
