Interdisciplinary (99)

The project ASPIRE at the Polytechnic University of New York prepares a cadre of
SFS scholars who can integrate technical, legal, financial, and behavioral
aspects into practical, cost effective solutions that people can depend on; who
can help develop laws and public policies relating to information security and
privacy that properly reflect the capabilities, limitations, and implications of
technology. A graduate from the ASPIRE program is able to translate the
foundational principles of security and privacy into information technologies
based on a deep understanding of societal, economic, behavioral and public
policy implications and requirements.

To ensure success of this vision, ASPIRE includes: an inter-disciplinary
education and research agenda; training to identify and solve security and
privacy problems from technical, legal, ethical, policy, and business
perspectives; a sense of community by means of a buddy system, quarterly boot
camps and weekly meetings; and a community service to mentor middle school
students and to help non-profit organizations with their IT security problems.
The ASPIRE team consists of researchers from NYU-Poly, and other schools in NYU
with diverse expertise in areas that include Computer Science; Electrical and
Computer Engineering; Public Policy; Law, Ethics and Politics; Economics and
Business; and Psychology.

NYU has a large number (60%) of women students and ASPIRE partners with local
and national minority institutions to recruit high quality fellows. The partners
include the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, National
Society for Black Engineers, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and the
Society for Women Engineers.
