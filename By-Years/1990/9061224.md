The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of increasing the
efficiency of production of ozone by use of gas discharge type ozone generators.
Current efficiencies limit the broader use of this powerful oxidant and
disinfectant. The Phase I objective involves approaches to increase the yield of
ozone by modification of conditions used during its generation which, if
successful are planned to be incorporated into design of a high-yield generator
module during the next phase of this research. This is a Phase I award made in
accord with Program Solicitation NSF 90-31, Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR). The project deals with an innovative concept for increasing the
efficiency of producing ozone, a water/wastewater disinfectant.
