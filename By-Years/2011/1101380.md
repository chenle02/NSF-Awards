Géométrie Algébrique en Liberté, also known as GAeL, is an annual workshop
organized by and for young algebraic geometers. It gives these young
mathematicians an opportunity to explore concepts from algebraic geometry they
are not yet familiar with, discuss recent developments in their subspecialities,
and present their work to their colleagues. The upcoming 19th edition of GAeL
will take place in Berlin, Germany from July 18th until July 22nd. All
participants give talks or present posters. Participant talks will be
supplemented by short courses on the topics of Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-
Thomas invariants, the minimal model program, and theta
characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop provides a unique
opportunity for young mathematicians to present research to their peers and
experts as well as widen their mathematical horizons through the short courses.
Support from the National Science Foundation will cover the costs of up to
&amp;#64257;ve US-based participants each year for the next three years. The
other participants come from a wide range of countries, and the communications
and collaborations started at GAeL will serve to strengthen ties between young
researchers in the US and their international peers.
