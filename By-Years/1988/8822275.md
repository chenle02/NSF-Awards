The primary objective of this U. S.- Hungary cooperative research project
between Dr. Harold Scheraga of Cornell University and Dr. Istvan Simon of the
Institute of Enzymology, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, is to pursue theoretical
studies of protein folding. A promising statistical approach, characterized as
"build-up," will be employed to combine conformational energy calculations on
oligopeptides with statistical analyses of amino acid sequences and of three
dimensional protein structures. Results may yield a rational, effective approach
for determining the conformation of low-energy peptides. This project in
biophysics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
