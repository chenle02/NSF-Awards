This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project develops a low-cost,
software-oriented, distributed fault tolerant mechanism. The approach taken is
through process monitoring, fault detection, checkpoint and recovery. The system
is implemented on a distributed system to capitalize on the inherent fault
tolerance of a distributed system. Communication mechanisms, process migration,
and distributed monitoring methods are developed. This project proposes an
object-oriented software methodology for developing fault tolerant applications
and a software developer's toolkit to facilitate programming. This project
investigates an open process communication architecture to enhance the
interoperability of the system and to develop a high-level command language with
which users can specify system parameters and control the system actions. The
system will handle both hardware and software faults that are not handled at the
hardware and operating systems levels. A prototype will be developed to
demonstrate the feasibility of the concepts.
