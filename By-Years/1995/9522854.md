9522854 Dulikravich The research conducted under this award will develop a
design system for constrained optimization of three-dimensional cooled turbine
blade configurations. The system will take into account the interaction of the
hot gas flow field, heat transfer in the blade material, and the internal
coolant flow field by utilizing a complete mathematical formulation, numerical
solution algorithms and accompanying software packages. This modular design
optimization tool, if successful, will provide many benefits to the industry.
These benefits include reduction in design time; lower manufacturing, testing,
and modification cost; higher aerodynamic and thermodynamic efficiency of the
turbine; and longer blade life expectancy.
