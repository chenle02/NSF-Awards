Monomethyl mercury (MMHg) is a highly toxic form of mercury in the marine
environment, with the ability to bio-concentrate in aquatic food webs and
threaten human health. Recent studies have indicated that fog deposition of MMHg
may represent an important source of this toxic compound to terrestrial
ecosystems that are impacted by fog, however these processes are poorly
understood. Researchers from the University of California Santa Cruz, California
State University Monterey Bay, and San Jose State University will conduct
experiments using a network of fog observation sites (FogNet) along the
California coast to examine the spatial and temporal distribution of MMHg in fog
and its potential sources. Results from this study will help to better elucidate
the role of fog in transporting MMHg to terrestrial ecosystems.

Broader Impacts: This study will provide scientific training for undergraduate
and graduate students, including individuals from underrepresented groups, in a
number of universities in California. FogNet will create a collaborative
research network between state universities, federal entities, and non-
governmental organizations. Results from this study will benefit society at
large through furthering general knowledge on the cycling of toxic mercury.
