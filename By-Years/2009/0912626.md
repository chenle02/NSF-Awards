This SBIR Phase I research proposal will develop intelligent sensors for
structural state sensing. It will demonstrate the feasibility of a successful
intelligent structural state sensor concept. The advantage of this approach is
that, unlike traditional sensors, this technology does not require lead wires
for signal interrogation, which overcomes one of the limitations for distributed
sensing arrays required for structural health monitoring. The proposed sensors
can be queried in real-time, making real-time strain or damage state monitoring
possible. Furthermore, these sensors can be customized to sense various
parameters including strain, temperature, moisture, and damage. The sensor size
and distribution can be easily varied to create very large scale, distributed
sensing systems. Finally, the separation of the sensors from the sensing system
permits lower-cost solutions by making the sensors easily replaceable while
keeping the sensing system in a protected environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of structural health monitoring (SHM) in aerospace applications is to use
in situ sensing of internal and external state variables for optimizing real-
time structural performance and for condition monitoring based maintenance. This
technology allows for a new range of sensors to be developed for a host of
parameters of interest and for a variety of applications. Such SHM systems can
lead to lower maintenance costs, increase performance envelops, and prevent
catastrophic failure. While initial commercial applications will be in the
aerospace sector, the technology can be easily adapted for other
structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American
