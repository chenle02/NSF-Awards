ABSTRACT: 9312537, PI-Krishnamurti, "Numerical Weather Prediction Over the
Tropics": Dr. Krishnamurti will continue research on a number of topics relating
to the improvement of numerical weather prediction in tropical regions.
Specifically, five broad tasks will be pursued under this award. The first is
physical initialization which involves ensuring that the initial description of
the atmosphere as represented in the model thermodynamic fields at the beginning
of a forecast is consistent among various physical processes that is, the
humidity fields, rainfall, clouds, etc. are consistent with the earth's
radiation balance. Representing clouds in large numerical models is complex and
difficult. The second task involves the testing and comparing of two promising
cloud schemes. The third and fourth tasks involve research on improving
forecasts of two tropical phenomena the tropical cyclone and the large scale
monsoon circulation. Finally, the PI and his colleagues will continue an
investigation of the low frequency portion of the monsoon circulation and the
characteristics of the energy exchanges that are required to maintain the
circulation. Each of these tasks will contribute to the overall improvement of
numerical prediction over tropical regions which, in turn, contributes to
improve global predictions.
