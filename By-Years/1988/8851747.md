It is intended to integrate the design and manufacturing functions together so
that problems inherent in increasing productivity can be solved effectively and
efficiently. Equipment is needed to train undergraduates students in modern
technology such as CAD/CAM and CNC (Computer Numerical Controlled) machining.
Ten CAD/CAM workstations together with associated CAD software packages are in
the process of being acquired. A turning center will be acquired and interfaced
to CAD/CAM stations to form a truly integrated CAD/CAM manufacturing cell. In an
integrated three course environment, the students will be introduced to CAD and
CNC. Senior students will receive hands-on experience in design with CAD systems
and then will transfer their design to the turning center for CNC machining.
