9452750 Krasny Cornell University seeks to initiate a six-week, residential
Young Scholars program in the environmental sciences for 20 students entering
twelfth grade. The program will include a one- week orientation at Cornell's
Arnot Forest, a five-week on-campus component focusing on research, careers,
community outreach, multimedia computer presentations, science ethics, follow-up
activities in schools, after-school science clubs, 4-H clubs, and other informal
educational settings. A six-week Mathematics and Science Teaching Perspectives
component will be included, through which four high school science teachers will
engage in composting and environmental toxicology research and science education
activities at Cornell. Teachers will design research curricula and kits that
will enable them to continue their research with students in classrooms and
after-school science clubs. ***
