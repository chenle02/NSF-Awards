Abstract #1229929 Newman, Kimberly

Through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Scholar in Residence
program, they propose to conduct a study of the characteristics of the wireless
communication channel used by commercially available medical devices to transmit
data to medical monitoring services. Characterization of the wireless
communication links is needed for FDA regulatory review of medical devices
integrated with smart phones. The purpose of the project is to establish a
testing procedure for evaluating mobile communication required for transport of
medical information, using a range of wireless devices from simple 3G cellular
phones to leading smart phone platforms. The research is conducted in two
phases, the first one in an anechoic chamber where statistical measures of
connectivity from a medical device to the phone are performed. In the second
phase, a set of test procedures in specific natural environments that
incorporate base station communication are generated.
