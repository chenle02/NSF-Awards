Although all hydrogenases oxidize molecular H2 and most also reduce protons,
there are differences in the way the processes occur as reflected in their
different cellular functions. Dr. Mortenson proposes to study three difference
hydrogenases: a cytoplasmic Fe hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum that
catalyzes proton reduction to H2 oxidation during fermentation, a membrane NiFe
hydrogenase from Azotobacter vinlandii that catalyzes H2oxidation coupled to
electron transfer and energy generation, and an Fe hydrogenase from Clostridium
pasteurianum that preferentially catalyzes H2 oxidation. Using biochemical,
biophysical and molecular genetic techniques, he proposes to determine whether
these enzymes use similar or different mechanisms when they react with or
produce H2. These studies will determine the number of genes required, the
function of their products in the synthesis and regulation of the hydrogenases
and the biochemical and biophysical properties of the gene products. Results
from these studies will be used as a basis for determine changes in properties
of the hydrogenases when functionally important amino acids are changed. From
this information, a detailed model of the active site will be constructed. In
addition, a model demonstrating how the H2- activating center couples with its
electron transferring centers during either H2 oxidation or proton reduction
will be produced.
