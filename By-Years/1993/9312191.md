9312191 Reynolds The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County requests
support in the form of hardware, software, and communication services to provide
their facilities with a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the Los Nettos
regional network. Direct connection to Los Nettos, a mid-level network, will
provide the museum with improved access to Internet resources. By linking to the
midlevel and national networks, the Museum will be able to maintain and enhance
a position of leadership in research and educational innovation with remote
access to computational resources such as super computing facilities, data bases
and information services, high speed communication, file transfer and remote
login, and access to library resources. This also a unique opportunity for the
Museum to explore innovative educational resources. Museum educational programs,
collection management and curatorial research will benefit from the link. ***
