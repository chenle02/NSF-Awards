Descriptive Complexity measures the richness of a language or sentence needed to
describe a given property. The languages are variants of first-order logic and
their targets are finite, ordered structures. There is a profound relationship
between the traditional computational complexity of a problem and the
descriptive complexity of the problem; indeed, all major complexity classes have
been shown to have natural descriptive characterizations. This means that
complexity can be understood entirely from a logical point of view. As a
consequence, important new understandings about complexity have arisen from the
descriptive point of view.

The current research involves three major topics: (a) The theory of dynamic
complexity, which is especially appropriate for database complexity, is being
studied. Complete problems for dynamic complexity classes are being developed
and the complexity of important dynamic problems such as graph reachability are
being investigated; (b) Promising new methods for proving lower bounds
techniques on the descriptive complexity of problems have been developed and are
now being extended; and finally, (c) A Descriptive Programming environment is
being developed in which the computational complexity of checking whether an
input satisfies the properties being described can be read from the face of the
description.
