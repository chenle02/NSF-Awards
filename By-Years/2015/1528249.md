Southern Africa is the world's largest emitter of biomass burning aerosols.
Their westward transport over the remote southeast Atlantic ocean co-locates
some of the largest planetary aerosol loadings with the least examined of the
Earth's major stratocumulus decks. While much of the aerosol resides above the
boundary layer cloud, free-tropospheric subsidence and marine boundary layer
deepening as sea surface temperatures warm imply that absorbing aerosol can also
be entrained into the boundary layer. Model representations of the solar-
absorbing aerosol cloud- atmosphere-ocean system must consider not only the
direct radiative effect, but also radiative changes arising from cloud
adjustments to the atmospheric warming and from aerosol cloud microphysical
interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ONFIRE (ObservatioNs of Fire's Impact on the
southeast atlantic REgion) is a field campaign; the intensive five-week
deployment of facilities in the southeast Atlantic is scheduled for September
2017. A coordinated set of hypotheses that improve understanding of biomass
burning aerosol composition and absorption, their relationship to cloud-top
entrainment, and impact on cloud microphysics, are being examined. The award
that is being funded is considered a Scientific Planning Overview document and
serves as the scientific basis for the campaign. Individual science proposals
will be reviewed separately.
