This project is aimed at contributing to the development of a mechanics of
modern engineered material in the following three areas: (i) interfacial
fracture mechanics, (ii) failure modes in thin films and coatings, and (iii)
nonlinear composite theory with emphasis on reinforcement of ductile materials
against plastic flow and creep. A wide variety of techniques are being tried to
improve bonding between dissimilar materials with applications to composite
materials, layered electronic packages, and protective coatings. Research is
proposed to study the role of plasticity in increasing mixed mode toughness of
interfaces and thin ductile adhesive layers. The initiation of through-cracks
and interface debonding from small crack-like flaws in thin films and coatings
bonded to substrates will be analyzed. Buckling-driven decohesion, which is the
primary mode of failure for thin films and coatings under residual compression,
will also be studied. Particulate reinforcement of ductile materials has emerged
as an important strategy in the development of new structural materials with
high specific stiffness or high temperature creep resistance. The goal of our
work is to provide a mechanics for predicting the effect of particle shape,
volume fraction and distribution on the overall plastic or creep behavior of the
reinforced material.
