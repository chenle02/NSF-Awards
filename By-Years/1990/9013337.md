Boron-doped Niii3Al is used as model material to study the basic mechanisms of
deformation and failure in superplasticity of intermetallic compounds.
Experimental measurements of grain boundary sliding are made by means of
internal markers. Internal friction due to grain boundary sliding is measured
and the parameters from damping capacity and mechanical testing are correlated.
Effect of hydrostatic gas pressure on cavitation in superplasticity of nickel
aluminide is studied.
