9307225 Thorp Factors regulating biotic communities in large rivers are poorly
known both because of the dearth of research on large rivers in general (4% of
stream studies) and because of the lack of experimental techniques to study
these ecosystems. The PI's hypothesize that riverine plankton, or
potamoplankton, in the Ohio River are physically controlled during period of
high river discharge and turbidity (Phase I) and relatively biologically
controlled at other times of the year (Phase II). This research will examine
experimentally the importance of vertebrate planktivory by emerald shiners and
rotifer-copepod interactions in Phases I and II. To do so, the PI's will employ
unique "potamocorrals" (in situ floating nitex enclosures) in four drift
experiments in the Ohio River. During these studies, data will be collected to
test the efficacy of these enclosures relative to ambient conditions. %%%
Potamocorrals should prove useful for both basic and applied research, such as
the effects of energy byproducts on riverine plankton. Also, this research will
add much needed data on the effects of different disturbance agents on the
biodiversity of large river systems. ***
