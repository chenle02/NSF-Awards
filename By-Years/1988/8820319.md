Drs. Klein and Cruz.Uribe will analyze faunal materials collected at three
Pleistocene sites located in the western Cape Province of South Africa. The
largest of these, Elandsfontein, is a large stratified site which over several
decades of examination has yielded thousands of faunal items, as well as a
hominid skull and stone tools. Although the site cannot be precisely dated, its
earlier component falls within the Middle Pleistocene, roughly 500,000 years
ago, while its upper unit postdates this time. Some of the materials probably
result from human activity while others can be attributed to other causes such
as carnivore kills. At two other sites in the region, Duinefontein and
Springfontein, smaller assemblages have also been recovered. In their analysis,
Drs. Klein and Cruz.Uribe will identify species represented. They will also
study the break, cut and other marks on the bone in an attempt to determine
causal factors. The work will accomplish several important goals. First, it will
increase understanding of mammal evolution in Africa over the last million years
and provide a basis for relative correlation with sites. Second, it will shed
additional light on early human activities in Africa and clarify the role of
hunting in these societies. Finally, it will help develop standards to determine
whether humans played a role in the accumulation of specific bone assemblages.
This research is important for several reasons. These collections constitute an
important archaeological and paleontological resource and have not been properly
studied. This work will remedy that situation. It will also help archaeologists
to develop an important set of analytical tools which will be useful in many
parts of the world.
