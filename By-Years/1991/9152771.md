The Chemistry Department is equipping a laboratory for polymer studies to
introduce mechanical testing, surface analysis and elementary processing
techniques into the curriculum. The new instruments are increasing the hands-on
experience by undergraduate students with state-of-the-art instrumentation and
increasing the diversity of the polymer-related experiments performed. Chemistry
majors taking analytical and physical chemistry laboratories are also
benefitting from exposure to experiments involving polymers which utilize the
equipment.
