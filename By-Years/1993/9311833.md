9311833 Chow The PI at North Carolina State University and his graduate student
will join with a Co-PI from Duke Power Company to investigate an important
company problem. This is to develop an automated system for the identification
of distribution fault causes. Currently an experienced person can do the job.
What is sought is a neural net realization of that same high level skill. This
project is being undertaken under the Engineering Faculty Internship Initiative.
