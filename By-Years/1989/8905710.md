The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are awards to
recent recipients of doctoral degrees. The fellowship is designed to provide 24
months of support divided into 18 academic months and 3 periods of two summer
months. The recipient has the option of a Research Instructorship which allows
the 18 months of academic support to be taken as 9 months of full-time support
and 18 months of half-time support. Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship awards allow fellows to choose research environments that will have
maximal impact on their future scientific development. Christopher Stover
received his doctoral degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and
will pursue research in the area of pure mathematics, specifically, constructing
a space with specified homotopy groups and specified action on these groups by
the primary homotopy operations, under the guidance of J. Peter May at the
University of Chicago.
