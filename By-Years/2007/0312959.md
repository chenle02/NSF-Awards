Thomas Keyes, John Straub, and Steven Homer of Boston University are supported
by the Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research under the
Information Technology Research program to develop and apply algorithms for
multiple time scale simulations of supercooled liquids and biomolecules. Three
different algorithms are being developed for acceleration of transitions between
different local minima. All three depend on methods for identifying local
minima, transition barriers, and pathways in complicated molecular systems.

Biologically interesting processes may be characterized by slow transitions
between dissimilar molecular configurations. Dynamical processes on a much
faster time scale occur rapidly within each of the configurations and during the
slow transition between the two configurations. A simultaneous accurate
accounting of both slow and fast processes represents a significant challenge to
computational chemists and materials scientists. This work merges techniques for
mathematically describing landscapes near a local minimum with information
technology methods to allow for modeling of such slow events. The research is
strongly coupled to educational activities that are designed to expose young
researchers to the multiple time scale problem.
