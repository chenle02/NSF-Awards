In order to cope with time-varying input characteristics and demand for
upgradability in new-generation communication systems and multimedia
applications, embedded systems are being driven to provide tremendous
flexibility through extensive configurations. Hence, along with performance,
power, and reliability requirements, embedded systems now require hardware
reconfiguration and self-adaptive system methodologies. In order to provide an
effective, affordable, and seamless (from the application layer) transition from
one configuration to another, system synthesis plays a crucial role. To achieve
this, there is a need for the right balance between static compilation and
dynamic configuration management. This project develops adaptivity-driven system
synthesis tools coupled with a dynamic configuration management layer for
adaptive embedded system with hardware configuration support. The research
focuses on design of novel algorithms and optimization methods for design tools
supporting self-adaptive systems. This project 1) develops holistic task
scheduling and resource management methods which are adaptive-aware and consider
the reconfiguration overhead, 2)develops system level layout planning for
resource upgradability and configuration sequence awareness, and 3)develops
efficient dynamic design making methods for configuration management layer which
evokes the right configuration based on the current system state. The broader
impact of this research is that the developed design tools can be deployed in
future self-adaptive systems for software-defined radio and multimedia
applications where programmability and flexibility are as crucial as computation
power. The PI plans to develop new courses, recruit under-represented groups
into her research, and facilitate outreach to other researchers and industry by
providing online access to the developed design tools.
