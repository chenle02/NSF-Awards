This project develops and realizes efficient and large scale mapping and 3D
reconstruction on mobile robots. We develop a new optimization paradigm which
combines the advantages of both direct and iterative methods by (1)
investigating a novel class of optimization methods for robot mapping problems:
subgraph-preconditioned conjugate gradients (SPCG) that combine the advantages
of direct and iterative methods while minimizing the disadvantages, (2)
investigating subgraph preconditioner selection and quality analysis, (3)
applying the above techniques to large-scale 3D reconstruction problem mobile
robots, and (4) investigating on-line versions of these algorithms. We adapt the
SPCG for this setting by incrementally building the graph sparsifier that gives
us a good preconditioner.

Beyond robotics and vision, we show that similar bounds can be derived for the
general problem of approximating distributions. A concrete deliverable of the
proposed work is a software package that embeds the new hybrid approach to
solving the mapping/reconstruction non-linear optimization problem, and is
easily deployable to a wide range of mobile robotic platforms: terrestrial,
aerial, underwater, or underground, acting individually or in teams. The
robotics research community has access to this technology, which provides great
improvement over the capabilities of current mapping/reconstruction software,
both in terms of the size of the problem, as well as in terms of speed and
online applicability. Finally, at a more local level, this research impacts
education of both graduate and undergraduate students at Georgia Tech.
