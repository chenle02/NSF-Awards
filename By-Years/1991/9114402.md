This research draws on ideas from spatial statistics and from Bayesian image
analysis to devise experimental designs for agricultural field experiements or
other experiments on experimental material that can be thought of as lying on a
map. This research has wider implications for mapping of incidence, for
representation of patterns, and for robustness of Bayesian inference
particularly in the presence of spatial correlations.
