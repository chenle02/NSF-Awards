0102277&lt;br/&gt;Di Ventra&lt;br/&gt;This Nanoscale Exploratory Research award,
which results from the Nanoscale Science and Engineering solicitation (NSF
00-119), supports theoretical research on shot noise in nanoscale conductors.
The PI will develop theoretical and computational tools that use the
wavefunctions of density functional theory-based calculations for molecular
devices in an external bias to calculate current flow and current fluctuations.
These tools would be applied to study shot noise in nanoscale conductors
composed of atomic and molecular chains with the further aim to innovate new
designs for reduced noise electronic devices with dimensions on the nanoscale.
The proposal has an additional educational component that aims to incorporate
the research approach into the graduate Computational Physics
course.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This Nanoscale Exploratory Research award, which
results from the Nanoscale Science and Engineering solicitation, supports
theoretical research on shot noise in nanoscale conductors. The PI will develop
theoretical tools based on modern electronic structure methods to describe the
flow of electric current in molecular devices. A particular focus of the
research is to calculate self consistently electronic currents and current
fluctuations in these nanoscale devices. The PI aims to use these tools to
innovate new designs for reduced noise electronic devices with dimensions on the
nanoscale. The proposal has an additional educational component that aims to
