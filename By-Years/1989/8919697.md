Using aircraft and radar observations from current field programs and those in
1984 and 1987, we propose to look for downdrafts that carry charge near cloud
boundaries, which is a basic prediction of one hypothesis of electrification.
For another hypothesis, which involves ice pellets and ice crystals, we propose
to build the facilities required to find out whether or not ice pellets carry
sufficient current toward the main region of negative charge to account for the
growth of the charge. From telemetered airplane data we will calculate and
display during flights the approximate locations of charge along with radar
reflectivity in order to guide the airplane to regions where ice particles are
postulated to be carrying current toward the main region of negative charge. Our
present vertically- scanning 3-cm radar will be modified so that aircraft data
can be superimposed upon the radar reflectivity. We also propose to build a
charge sensor that is specifically designed to be compatible with existing
probes that record the images of particles.//
