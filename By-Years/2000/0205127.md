The proposal requests funding for partial support for U.S. scientists to attend
two sequential high energy physics conferences in Les Arcs, Savoie, France. The
first conference addresses Electroweak Interactions and Unified Theories. The
subjects are CP violation, heavy flavor physics, neutrino physics, tests of the
Standard Model, searches for new particles and theories beyond the Standard
Model.

The second conference concerns Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and High Energy
Hadronic Interactions. The topics to be covered include heavy flavor physics,
structure functions, diffractive phenomena, low-x physics and saturation, tests
of perturbative QCD, heavy ion collisions, the search for new phenomena and
physics at future accelerators.
