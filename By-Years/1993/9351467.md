This project is upgrading the archaeological teaching laboratory in the Washburn
Undergraduate Anthropology Laboratories at the institution. Based on the
premises that modern archaeology is as much a laboratory as a field science, and
that existing, extensive museum collections should be efficiently used in
teaching, the project is also upgrading the existing large teaching room in the
Washburn Labs through the installation of student workstations. Each station is
comprised of a constellation of computer workstation (with relational database
software), balance, calipers, and microscope. The workstations are also
networked, and connected via a server to the campus-wide fiber optic network.
Dissemination of results includes preparation of laboratory manuals, and
presentation of papers and reports to colleagues at professional meetings.
