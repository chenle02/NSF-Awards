New automatic theorem proving techniques are examined and evalu- ated by
foundationally verifying well known theorems in pure mathematics. The
investigator has already used object-oriented inference techniques to verify the
Stone representation theorem for Boolean lattices from the axioms of set theory.
The new inference techniques are evaluated by measuring the amount of user-given
detail needed to foundationally verify Bledsoe's ten challenge problems. The
inference techniques to be evaluated include new forward chaining constraint
propagation techniques, a forward chaining mechanism for mathematical induction,
automated focus control for object-oriented inference, and a sound mechan- ism
for verifying and applying user-defined algorithms. Automatic reasoning is one
of the central problems of artificial intelligence, with potential for
application in software and hardware verification, deductive data retrieval,
online docu- mentation systems, and computer-aided instruction in mathematics
and the sciences. This research seeks to establish that auto- matic inference
can be used in practice and that progress is being made toward ever more
effective methods.
