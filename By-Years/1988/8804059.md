The Indiana University Cyclotron Facility (IUCF) will provide eight
undergraduates with research experiences at the IUCF. Students will be selected
from Indiana University and surrounding states in the Midwest with particular
attention to smaller institutions and women, minority and disabled students.
Students will be assigned to ongoing research programs in nuclear and
accelerator physics. All students will have the opportunity to participate in
accelerator-based experiments. Students will be supervised by faculty members
and senior professional staff. Special programs for the students will be
arranged, including orientation sessions, weekly seminars, a machine shop
course, and a closing symposium. This project is supported under the Program of
Research Experiences for Undergraduates to help ensure an adequate supply of
scientists for the future.
