The inaugural ACM HotWireless 2014 workshop aims to become a premier venue for
publishing early-stage work on disruptive wireless technologies and systems that
can enable orders of magnitude improvements in wireless performance and novel
wireless applications. The workshop features a high-quality technical program,
with a combination of invited and peer-reviewed papers. It has a single-track
session, which offers significant opportunities for individual and small groups
that foster technical and social interactions among a diverse set of
participants. Being held in conjunction with ACM MobiCom, which is the premier
international conference in the area of mobile computing research, also helps
boost the networking opportunities for the participants of this workshop.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will help increase the representation and
participation of United States-based students at the conference by providing 5
travel grants. By creating new opportunities for graduate students, especially
those from under-represented groups, to attend a high-quality workshop, this
award will benefit the students by giving them an opportunity to interact with
world-class researchers, inspire them to try new research directions, provide
them new mentoring opportunities, and offer them the chance to seek out
internships and post-doctoral positions which will help them advance in their
research careers.
