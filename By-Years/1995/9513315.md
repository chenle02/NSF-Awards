This award supports Professor Jane Vanderkooi and two graduate students from the
University of Pennsylvania to collaborate in biochemistry research with
Professor Josef Friedrich and his graduate students in the Physical Chemistry
Institute of the University of Bayreuth. They are combining their complementary
expertise in EPR and optical hole burning to study dynamic aspects of protein
structure. Proteins are organized and random at the same time, giving rise to a
complex energy landscape which, in turn, results in a variety of possible
substates. Direct observations of protein structural dynamics near
physiologically relevant temperatures is very difficult by conventional methods.
This research suggests that conformational states, or structural organization,
of protein can be identified by characteristic patterns of spectral holes in an
electric field combined with other measurements. By performing comparative hole
burning spectroscopy on metal derivatives of cytochrome c , porphyrin, and
glasses, under various conditions of pH and pressure, these investigators expect
to observe changes in various bonding states of proteins which will improve the
understanding of structural organization and randomness in proteins.
