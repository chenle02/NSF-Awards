Gregory Galloway will continue his studies of Lorentzian geometry. This is an
area which overlaps both physics and mathematics. The study of events from a
relativistic point of view leads to different invariants which in turn result in
the study of different notions of distance, called Lorentzian metrics. The
geometric phenomena to be studied are related to singularities in relativistic
space time. Galloway will try to obtain further results building on his recent
progress on the splitting theorem. The physical motivation for this work is the
study of rigidity phenomena in the arena of singularity theory of general
relativity. He will also study problems related to the existence of closed
geodesics in pseudo- Riemannian manifolds. These are known to exist in compact
Riemannian manifolds. Galloway will try to use a dynamic approach to the case
where the metric is indefinite.
