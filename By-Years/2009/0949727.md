This EAGER proposal funded by the Science, Technology and Society Program
supports a workshop on science policy for younger scholars. The workshop
reflects an awareness that complex problems of science, technology, and society
are conspicuously, perhaps uniquely, apparent in national politics today. Yet
there is an absence of a community of science policy scholars who can span the
terrains of intellectual inquiry and real-world practice to contribute to public
deliberation and democratic decision making on these problems. A national
competition is conducted to identify members of the next generation of leaders
of science and technology policy. Successful applicants are brought together for
a workshop, hosted by Arizona State University?s Consortium for Science, Policy,
and Outcomes, aimed at helping them advance their careers, promote their ideas,
develop new ideas and collaborations, develop their capabilities as public
intellectuals, and catalyze their participation in an emergent network of
potential science and technology policy leaders.
