This is the initial conference in VLSI research, and continues a series
partially funded by NSF since 1979 and meeting at major VLSI research centers.
The conference brings together researchers and students in all aspects of VLSI
design and systems research to discuss the latest advances in VLSI. Participants
are from both universities and industries. The conference emphasizes the
interaction of a wide range of VLSI topics and their integration into systems.
