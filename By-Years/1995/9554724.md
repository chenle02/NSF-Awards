"Teaching Teachers to Teach Engineering" is a one-week workshop offered during
the summer at the United States Military Academy. The workshop is offered to
faculty of all engineering disciplines who want to be good Teachers. The
workshop strives to address the needs of faculty from two-year and four-year
institutions, teaching and research institutions, who are seeking high teaching
standards, and efficiencies in preparation. The workshop addresses topics in
preparation, presentation, self-critique, learning models, goals and objectives,
advanced technology, student-teacher relations, testing/grading, advising, legal
aspects of teaching, research, scholarship, and time management. Participants
are expected to prepare and present classes, critique others, apply workshop
material in mini-class environments, and prepare an action plan for their next
term. Workshop participants will work in various size teams to develop
confidence and poise in the classroom. Participants will leave the workshop with
the tools necessary to present logical and thought provoking presentations to
their student. They are expected to interact with faculty at their home
institution to improve the teaching of others through seminars and
presentations. This workshop will guide faculty toward an efficient way to be
both a good teacher and a successful researcher.
