This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of computing equipment for
the C.F. Richter Seismological Laboratory at the University of California, Santa
Cruz. The University is committed to providing matching funds. The equipment
will be installed in the Applied Science Building and will complement and
upgrade the existing computing facilities of the Institute of Tectonics and the
Earth Science Board at UC-Santa Cruz. The equipment will be used in research
aimed at improved imaging of internal structure of the Earth by seismic wave
analysis and the study of the physics of earthquake faulting.
