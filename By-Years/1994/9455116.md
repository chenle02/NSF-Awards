This is a two-week workshop for undergraduate faculty with limited access to
parallel computers. Participants learn to integrate parallel processing into
their courses. Tools include transputers, simulators, a network connection to a
major research center, and software to manage a network to workstations as a
parallel computing environment. Topics include parallel algorithms, design of
parallel programs, parallel architectures, integration of parallel processing
into the undergraduate computer science curriculum, and methods of teaching
parallel processing to undergraduates. The workshop includes lectures and
laboratory sessions focusing on writing parallel programs and developing
curriculum materials. The participants are expected to develop an instructional
unit on parallel processing that they will teach during the 1995-96 academic
year.
