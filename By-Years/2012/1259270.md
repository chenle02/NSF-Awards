This project is providing scholarships and support to 40 students over five
years in order to (1) increase annual full-time enrollment in targeted
engineering technology and applied technology fields, (2) increase retention of
participating STEM majors from the first to second year, (3) increase the number
of participating students who complete their degree within two years, and (4)
increase the number of graduating Bridgemont STEM Scholars who become employed
in their field or continue their education in their field. The project is
investigating the combination of proven retention models and industry
interactive activities on student performance, particularly those who are the
first in their family to attend college. Students are learning sought-after
workplace skills including interpersonal relations, project management, and
workplace ethics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project promotes higher STEM
education in rural West Virginia through an outreach campaign that is informing
a broad audience about high-demand positions available for engineering and
applied technology graduates, which is particularly important given the high
number of first generation college students in the region. These activities are
helping to create a more educated workforce in West Virginia. The program model
strengthens the partnerships between community colleges and industry to improve
student preparation for STEM careers.
