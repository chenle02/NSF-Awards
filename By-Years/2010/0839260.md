This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
further develop its one-step fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-DNA
aptamer technology for the rapid (assay results within minutes of sampling),
sensitive, on-site detection of fecal bacteria in treated water supplies.
Operational Technologies Corporation (OpTech) previously demonstrated successful
development of FRET-aptamers that bind common core antigens of surface molecules
from various strains of E. coli and used the preliminary family of FRET-aptamers
to detect as few as 10 bacteria per milliliter in water samples with a
commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)handheld and battery-operated fluorescence
sensor. The technology was in development to satisfy stringent requirements of
the federal Beaches Act, but is now proposed as a broader solution for safety
verification of treated wastewater. In order to meet this new requirement,
OpTech will add a fluorescence viability test for the handheld reader and
compare to standard Colilert fluorescence test results. In Phase II, OpTech will
expand its repertoire of tests to include other enteric bacteria, viruses, and
parasites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are: 1)
enhanced drinking water safety for the public 2)better on-site decision making
ability for wastewater treatment facilities to decide if treated effluents are
suitable for drinking, irrigation, or release back into the environment, 3)
faster decision making ability at recreational waters (oceans, lakes, even
swimming pools) with regard to potential closings to prevent human exposure to
fecal contamination. FRET-aptamer technology also has applications in rapid and
portable food safety testing, homeland security, and clinical point-of-care
diagnostics.
