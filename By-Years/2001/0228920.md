ABSTRACT 0228920 Stanley Steinberg U of New Mexico

We propose to organize a workshop: Mimetic Methods for Discretizing Continuum
Problems. There are several di.erent research groups and individual researchers
that have rather recently realized that they working on discretization methods
that have many common features that we refer here to as mimetic. This workshop
will be the .rst organized to bring this group of people together for the first
time. There are many powerful methods for discretizing problem in continuum
mechanics: finite element, di.erence and volume methods;sp ectral methods;along
with various generalizations and combinations of these. Typically, these methods
start with a continuummechanics problem described in terms of partial-
differential, ordinary-differential, integral, and algebraic equation and then
discretize this description of the problem. Some methods may instead start with
an integral description in terms of conservation laws or start with the problem
described in terms of differential forms.
