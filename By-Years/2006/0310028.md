This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "The phylogeny and global
diversification of tortoises determined with complete mitochondrial genomes."
Over the past 60 million years, terrestrial tortoises (Testudinidae) have
marched or floated to most continents. Despite a good fossil record, patterns of
tortoise diversification are still poorly understood. This research uses
complete genomes of mitochrondrial DNA of tortoises to reconstruct their
evolutionary history.
