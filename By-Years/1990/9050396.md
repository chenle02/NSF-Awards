This project will support establishment of a computer laboratory in which
students use powerful software for interactive computational investigations and
numerical experiments. It is being funded under the Instrumentation and
Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of supporting projects
to develop new or improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory courses in
science, mathematics, or engineering. The Instrumentation and Laboratory
Improvement Program provides matching support for the instrumentation necessary
to implement undergraduate instructional improvements at U.S. colleges and
universities. In particular, the main objective of this project is to bridge the
gap between where the students currently are and where the faculty are in their
own professional use of computer hardware and software. This will be done by
restructuring the applied mathematics and numerical analysis sequences so as to
include a computer laboratory that is based on student projects using MATLAB for
interactive numerical investigations.
