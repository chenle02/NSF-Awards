Smart Manufacturing and Resources for Transforming the Future (SMART Future) is
promoting STEM exploration and education while strengthening the economies of
rural areas through training in new manufacturing technologies. By preparing
rural high school students for careers in high-growth fields like manufacturing
and information technology, SMART Future is advancing new and innovative methods
for producing goods, meeting the nation's changing employment needs, and
improving educational and earning opportunities for teachers and youth in rural
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through its use of a Mobile Simulation Laboratory,
SMART Future is preparing technicians for industrial automation and technology
careers and increasing the capacity of rural secondary teachers to provide
education in the context of the emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
and Industry 4.0. The project goals are to expand STEM opportunities and prepare
technicians for manufacturing and engineering careers through applied education
of IIoT and Industry 4.0 concepts; and increase the capacity of rural secondary
teachers to provide instruction in industrial automation. Drawing on industry
expertise, SMART Future is providing dual credit for learning STEM principles in
industrial automation, including programmable logic controllers (PLCs),
microcontrollers, robotics, automated processes, machine-to-machine learning,
computer networking and programming, applied mathematics, engineering design,
precision measurement, physics, and mathematical logic.
