This study aims at the development of an optical technique by which the
individual components of polydisperse polymeric liquids can be studied during a
flow process. The design of the experiment takes advantage of an optical
arrangement which has recently been developed for the study of composite
materials. By extending that instrument so that wavelengths in the infrared
spectral regime can be used, the infra-red dichroism produced by polymer chains
deformed during flow can be measured. Such a capability allows chains which are
tagged with deuterium to be distinguished from untagged polymer chains. By
studying bimodal mixtures of polymer chains in which one molecular weight
fraction consists of tagged chains, the dynamics of both long and short chains
can be determined independently. The results of these experiments are compared
with recent molecular theories developed for such bimodal mixtures.
