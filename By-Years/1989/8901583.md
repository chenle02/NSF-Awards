The main purpose of this research project is to study symmetries of manifolds,
with particular attention paid to symmetries of 4-dimensional manifolds. The
problems to be studied vary from general questions concerning the geometric
structure of exotic space forms and 4-dimensional manifolds to many specific
problems connected with the existence of symmetric and asymmetric manifolds. The
broad spectrum of methods which will be employed in this research include the
techniques of surgery and homotopy theory, transformation groups, differential
geometry and gauge theory. Since manifolds are very natural geometric objects,
including spheres and tori, for example, and since symmetry is a very natural
geometric property, techniques for treating symmetry of manifolds are important
to cultivate.
