This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to Dr. Jeanne E.
Pemberton of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona. Pemberton
will establish a new research area using unenhanced Raman scattering to
characterize thin surface films of self-assembled molecular structures. The goal
of the project is to construct bilayers which mimic biological membranes in
order to investigate their permeability to ions, water, and various organic
molecules. %%% The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality of
the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as potential for
continued significant contributions to scientific research, the academic
profession, and the education of future scientists. Particularly noteworthy
achievements are Pemberton's encouragement of undergraduate research and
research in the area of spectroscopic surface analysis.
