The Principal Investigator (PI) and her team will study the causes and
consequences of flare-associated magnetic changes (FAMCs) on the Sun by using a
combination of modeling and data analysis. The team will analyze the output of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) to
investigate how magnetic restructuring in the modeled solar corona affects the
magnetic field at the base of the simulation domain.

In order to better understand the heliospheric consequences of FAMCs, the PI and
her team will investigate correlations of observed FAMCs with the speeds,
masses, and momenta of observed CMEs, as well as any correlations of the
properties of FAMCs and CMEs in their simulations. To investigate how
effectively FAMCs can drive "sunquakes," the team will use different
parameterizations derived from satellite observations and their simulations, in
order to initialize MHD models of the convecting solar interior and to
characterize the Sun's acoustic response to realistic sunquake impulses.

The PI expects that this study of solar magnetic eruptions will help develop the
necessary understanding and tools to improve our prediction capability for the
strong space weather events that can adversely affect our technology-based
society. She will deliver her team's new data sets to the research community,
including her observational analysis and MHD simulation data, through her
institute's web site. The PI notes that community accessibility to this
project's data and modeling results will provide scientists and students
additional tools to perform space weather research. Meanwhile, the PI's team
will promote teaching, training, and learning while advancing discovery and
scientific understanding by serving students at the University of California at
Berkeley. The PI's team has experience supervising student researchers, and they
plan to attract and recruit highly qualified undergraduate and graduate students
from the Physics, Astronomy, and Planetary Science Departments at Berkeley,
while enhancing infrastructure for research and education.
