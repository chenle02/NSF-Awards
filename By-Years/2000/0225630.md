A Center for Computational Biological Physics is established at the University
of California, San Diego as part of the Information Technology Research
Initiative (ITR). This ITR Center, located in La Jolla, CA and operating as a
partnership between UC San Diego, the San Diego Supercomputer Center, the
Scripps Research Institute and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, will
pioneer new computational paradigms in support of this overall goal. This is
critical as biology evolves into a data-rich predictive science and increasingly
turns to complex systems physics for help in in developing the necessary
conceptual underpinnings and the concomitant calculational
strategies.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the Center will focus on two
major projects, one each at the supra-molecular and sub-cellular scales. The
first involves combining molecular dynamics with powerful electrostatic solvers
so as to enable the study of large-scale biological machines. The system to be
used as a testbed is the ribosome, where the recently determined structure
allows for the application of these ideas. The second involves extending the
MCell concept, originally developed for synapse simulations, into a broadly
useful tool for studying sub-cellular-cellular scale signal transduction
processes. Here the target applications concern calcium dynamics in cardiac
cells and its control by hormonal action. In addition to these research goals,
the Center will be actively involved in training a new class of computational
scientist, one who can directly communicate with experimentalists and focus the
computation so as to answer meaningful questions for these systems. Finally, the
ITR Center is directly coupled to a complementary effort, the Physics Frontiers
Center for Theoretical Biological Physics, which is focused on the conceptual
advances that will eventually serve as a source of new demand for novel
computational strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ITR award is jointly funded
by the Physics, Materials Research and Chemistry Divisions of the NSF.
