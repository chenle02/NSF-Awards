This research grant provides funding for the development of new mathematical
decision models to enable complex multistage production and distribution systems
to more effectively and efficiently respond to diverse individual customer
needs. These decision models will address the optimal coordination of operations
planning between distinct stages in production and distribution systems. The
modeling and solution methods will stress the value and importance of various
critical dimensions of individual customer demand attributes and of material
supply flexibility. Optimization-based solution methods will be developed for
solving these large-scale decision problems, which account for the economic
costs and system constraints of multiple inter-related stages that work together
to efficiently deliver consumer goods and services. The models and solution
methods will be tested and validated with an emphasis on empirically
demonstrating their value to organizations that operate and participate in
large-scale production and distribution systems.

The results of this research will provide organizations with new approaches to
operations planning and management that more effectively and efficiently match
their operations capabilities to a broad and diverse set of customer demands.
The resulting models will demonstrate ways in which firms can achieve economic
material supply flexibility in order to provide individually customized output
while serving mass markets. The solution methods that will be developed for
these models will help to overcome significant operations planning complexities
faced by many firms, thus providing the potential to create substantial economic
value for a broad range of organizations. The associated modeling, analysis, and
algorithmic development will also contribute to advances in applied optimization
theory and large-scale problem solving.
