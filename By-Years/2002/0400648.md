Rorrer &lt;br/&gt;0400648&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Semiconductor nanocomposite
materials possess novel optical and electronic properties that can be tuned by
manipulating the dimensions of the composite nanophases. This research will
explore a new biological route to nanostructured semiconductor materials that
possess microscale features. In Nature, many marine and aquatic organisms
assimilate inorganic materials from water to make ornate shell casings that
possess defined nano- and microstructure. For example, diatoms, a class of
single-celled algae, possess the ability to make silica nanospheres and assemble
them into intricate microstructures. The overall goal of this research and
education program is to harness the nanobiochemical machinery of diatom cell
cultures to fabricate nanostructured metal oxide semiconductor materials based
on silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), and titanium (Ti). The Research Plan has three
objectives: 1) Develop perfusion-based bioreactor processing strategies for the
biosynthesis of nanostructured metal oxide materials in diatom cell culture; 2)
Characterize the nanostructure and chemical structure of the composite metal
oxide materials fabricated within the diatom cell; 3) Characterize the
optoelectronic properties of the nanostructured metal oxide materials, after the
appropriate post-processing of the biogenic inorganic material. Ultimately,
bioprocessing strategies will be correlated to biogenic nanostructures. In turn,
biogenic nanostructure and post processing will be correlated to optoelectronic
properties. The challenge and excitement of using a living cell to fabricate a
semiconductor combines engineering, biology, and physics in a way that will
capture the imagination of students at all levels. Graduate students will be
uniquely cross-trained in cell biotechnology, nano-imaging, and semiconductor
materials characterization. &lt;br/&gt;
