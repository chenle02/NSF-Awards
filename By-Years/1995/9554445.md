Ethics and Biotechnology: A Blueprint for the Future Catherine Propst
DUE-9554445 Northwestern University $69,980 Center for Biotechnology Special
Project 2153 Sheridan Road Evanston, IL 60208 This is a proposal to conduct a
workshop on Ethics and Biotechnology: A Blueprint for the future. The directors
of the Biotechnology Center at Northwestern University will collaborate with the
Executive Officer at Palomar College, a two year college in San Marcos,
California and with Providence St. Mel, an inner city high school in Chicago.
The workshop, will be held July 6-7, 1995, at Northwestern University's Evanston
Campus, is designed to provide a blueprint for the incorporation of ethics in
the teaching, practice and management of biotechnology. The information will be
used to add to the biotechnology curricula for technician education and to
encourage joint efforts by secondary schools, two-year colleges, four-year
colleges and universities, and industry. In addition, it will provide a
mechanism to develop creative ways for this information to be taught, practiced,
and managed in their respective institutions.
