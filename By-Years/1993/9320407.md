9320407 Shapiro University of Idaho Dr. Pamela Shapiro, Chemistry Department,
University of Idaho, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry Program for an investigation of cyclopentadienyl-
aluminum and boron compounds as ligands for transition metals. Early transition
metal bent-metallocenes in which a group 13 moiety is a substituent on or a
bridging group between cyclopentadienyl rings will be prepared. These Lewis acid
sites are expected to enhance the reactivity of the transition metal complex
toward polar substrates and increase the ability of the complexes to serve as
olefin polymerization catalysts. Consequently, their reactivity with a variety
of small molecules will be investigated. A number of important industrial
chemical processes which are catalyzed by transition metal compounds also employ
a main-group, often aluminum, compound as a co-catalyst. In this project
compounds which contain both the transition- and main-group metal portions will
be prepared. They will then be investigated to determine their ability to
mediate the reactions of small molecules and to serve as polymerization
catalysts.
