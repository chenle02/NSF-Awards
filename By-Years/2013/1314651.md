The Embryology Course at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) has played a
pivotal role in the training of American developmental biologists for 120 years.
This premier course trains pre-and post-doctoral students for research careers
in developmental biology in a unique physical and intellectual environment, not
duplicated anywhere else in the world. The course is a hybrid between a
conference and an immersive training course in the science and practice of
developmental biology delivered over a six-week period in the summer. It
consists of a series of invited talks by internationally acclaimed scientists
and associated discussions with the students spending most of each day in the
lab discovering how the science can be done. Course students, who are committed
to teaching and research careers in the field of developmental biology, are
chosen from a consistently talented pool of national applicants. Traditionally,
a number of students from each year's class move into positions of leadership in
the developmental biology community. The course faculty are renowned scientists
in the field. Some of the faculty serve as laboratory instructors in the course,
and others give lectures and lead discussions of individual topics. The course
introduces students to the embryos of a large number of terrestrial and aquatic
species including current primary and diverse animal models. Techniques include
molecular, cellular, genetic, and developmental biological methods with
extensive use of cutting-edge microscopy. Students are challenged to formulate
and test hypotheses in a well-equipped research environment under the guidance
of experienced research faculty. The MBL provides a unique learning environment,
laboratory and support facilities, an animal collection facility, and one of the
nation's finest research libraries. Because of its unique nature, the Embryology
Course has and continues to achieve long-term and broad impact in the biological
sciences.
