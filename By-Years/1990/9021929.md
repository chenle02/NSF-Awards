Dr. Herzfeld's research interests concern fundamental physical relationships and
transformations in biological systems. These will be pursued specifically in
regard to energy transduction by membrane proteins and long-range order in self-
assembling systems. This proposal fulfills the FAW objectives which are 1) to
recognize outstanding and promising women scientists and engineers in academic
careers of research and teaching and 2) to facilitate the further development of
their careers.
