The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the enhanced ability to monitor Nitrogen
Oxides (NOx) optically using a novel approach that is fundamentally different
from zirconia-based voltage biased diffusion technology commercially deployed
today. NOx are a major pollutant and precursor to acid rain, surface ozone and
smog formation. Worldwide regulatory bodies are driving NOx regulations to
increasingly lower levels, presenting even greater challenges for real-world
emissions. Addressing these regulations, industry will be increasing deployment
of after-treatment technologies including selective catalyst reduction systems
and lean NOx traps. Both of these technologies will benefit from a less
expensive, more robust, and faster responding NOx sensor. If successful, the new
NOx sensor has the potential to significantly reduce emissions levels through a
more accurate and much faster detection mechanism than current NOx detection
techniques.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will characterize
and prototype an optical based Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) sensor technology that is
not based on conventional techniques such as oxygen sensor derivatives. This
effort will optimize the design and materials needed for a novel thermo-
catalytic NOx sensing mechanism through experimentation and testing, including
validation of earlier prototypes where near instantaneous NOx detection was
observed. Increasing the number and type of catalytic sensing elements and
integrating them into existing NOx sensor OEM packaging will accomplish this.
Sensor calibration equations and response lookup-tables will help validate our
new method for NOx detection with successful results serving as a model for a
new category of sensors based on this architecture. Current
commercially available NOx sensors do not meet response time, accuracy and price
requirements as used in the automotive industry where such parameters are
critical. In this program, the optical NOx sensing mechanism will be optimized,
and planned designs of experiment will help refine this technology into a more
optimized and robust device. Additionally, the detection mechanism
simultaneously measures carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons as part of the
measurement process, thus providing additional utility for any combustion
application.
