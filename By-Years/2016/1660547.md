The Noyce Austin College STEM Education Leadership Scholars (ACSELS) Program is
a Track 1 (Scholarships &amp; Stipends) project that will recruit, prepare, and
support a minimum of 11 undergraduate majors in the disciplines of biology,
biochemistry, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics to become
well-prepared secondary school science and mathematics teachers. The ACSELS
Program will provide scholarships, internships, and stipends to STEM majors
studying to become teachers. Students will receive explicit training in
leadership competencies that prepare them for working in high-need school
settings as effective STEM teachers, teacher leaders, change agents, and role
models for students. Noyce Scholars will complete a five-year program earning a
bachelor's degree in a STEM field (biology, biochemistry, chemistry, computer
science, mathematics, or physics), a minor in education, and a master's degree
in education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACSELS Project activities will impact Noyce
Scholars at multiple points of their academic and professional careers. These
activities include early experiences in the secondary school classroom;
leadership behavior development training; mentoring from STEM faculty, education
faculty, and in-service teacher mentors; and continued professional development
after graduation. Scholars also will be eligible to complete a summer teaching
internship in informal STEM education. Leadership behavior development training
will be conducted through the STEM Teaching and Research (STAR) Leadership
Program and the Leadership Education through Application and Pedagogy (LEAP)
Program. The impact of formal leadership behavior development training on
preparing STEM majors for teaching careers in high-needs local school districts
will be investigated and contribute to knowledge generation.
