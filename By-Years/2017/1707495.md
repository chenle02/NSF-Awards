Newer faculty often find the process of writing their first grant proposals to
be quite challenging. Professors Katherine Plass of Franklin and Marshall
College and Thomas Miller of the California Institute of Technology are
organizing a workshop that seeks to provide new faculty with insight about
proposal writing and reviewing processes, and position newer faculty to write
more competitive proposals to federal funding agencies. Participants have the
opportunity to network with successful grant recipients and program officers.
They engage in mock panels, speed coaching sessions, and other activities
designed to provide them with a better understanding of how to put together a
research plan that is ambitious yet realistic. Broader impacts are also
discussed in terms are educational activities, outreach and applications to
societal problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop, supported by the Division
of Chemistry, is entitled, "Chemistry Early Career Investigator Workshop," will
be held on March 20-21, 2017 in Arlington, Virginia. This workshop brings
together 100 junior faculty from a broad range of institutions and demographics
to discuss steps in strategically crafting research ideas, planning educational
and outreach activities, and assessing and evaluating project aims. Potential
