Cellular Mechanisms of Encoding Space-Time in the Monkey
Brain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Perceptions and memories are organized in brain in
such a way that the spatial and temporal patterns of the original sensory
stimuli are faithfully represented. This ability to encode space and time,
intertwined as space-time in the physical world, is a fundamental feature of the
nervous system. The cellular mechanisms of this encoding process in the primate
brain are unclear. The present project employs a novel method to reveal how the
neurons of the monkey hippocampus contribute to the encoding of space.
Specifically, the firing of single hippocampal neurons are recorded for as long
as 24 hours in squirrel monkeys moving freely on the walls and floor of a test
chamber. During this period, the animals are performing a spatial memory task
and allowed to eat, drink, rest and sleep. The hypothesis is tested that in
these conditions most hippocampal neurons express a complex firing pattern tuned
to process information on large sectors in space. Importantly, the experiments
set the stage for examining the involvement of these cells in encoding time, as
well. Thus, in the long run, this project will significantly contribute to the
development of a unified concept on encoding space and time in the monkey brain.
Such a concept should have a broad impact on cognitive neuroscience and should
help to understand the uniquely sophisticated operation of the primate brain.
