This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Southeastern Analysis Meeting 2017" that will be held March 17-19, 2017, on the
campus of the University of Tennessee.

This event is the latest installment in a thirty-two-year-long series of
conferences covering a wide spectrum of subareas of analysis. In particular, the
Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM) has become the leading conference venue in
the U.S. for function-theoretic operator theory. SEAM 2017 will again span a
broad swath of analysis, featuring five plenary speakers who will address topics
in operator theory (Alexandru Aleman, Ken Davidson, Alexei Poltoratski, Karl-
Mikael Perfekt); harmonic analysis (Betsy Stovall); and frame theory, sampling
theory, and interpolation theory (Shahaf Nitzan). The conference program
provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young
scientists to present their work.
