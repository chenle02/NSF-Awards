Replication is a key ingredient in achieving scalability and high availability
of computer systems. This is evident for globally distributed databases, but it
is also increasingly true for individual computers, smartphones and even
watches, with multiple layers of cache coordinating communication between
multiple processor cores. Where there is replication, consistency is necessarily
at conflict with performance and availability. Strong notions of consistency
allow simpler application development and debugging, at the cost of performance.
This project explores weaker notions of consistency, investigating the extent to
which performance gains can be achieved while maintaining a relatively simple
programming model.

This project investigates abstraction, and under what circumstances can a client
programmer safely reason about a data structure using its sequential
specification. The project develops a common foundational framework that unites
the areas of distributed data structures, relaxed memory models and concurrent
data structures. The project explores foundations for languages and tools for
shared-memory multi-core programming. By improving the programming model, the
project encourages better use of the resources available in current and future
hardware.
