9413012 Bosart Using data from previously completed field projects, this
research will focus on diagnostic studies of the structure and life cycle of
mesoscale weather systems and their interactions with the larger scale flow over
North America and adjacent oceanic regions. Emphasis will be placed on
understanding how topographic barriers and baroclinic zones (e.g. coastal zones
in winter) act to trigger organized mesoscale disturbances and fronts and/or
modify existing transient disturbances. The research methodology will involve
conventional synoptic and mesoscale case studies using the special data sets. An
important component of the research will involve the continuation of an ongoing
cooperative study with a NOAA scientist that involves use of an advanced
mesoscale numerical model. Results of this research will improve understanding
of wintertime weather systems and assist in improving local forecasts of extreme
events. ***
