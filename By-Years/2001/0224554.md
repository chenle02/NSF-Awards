The Wisconsin Vertebrate Fossil Project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wisconsin
Vertebrate Fossil Project (WVFP) is a two-year pilot to be operated by the
University of Wisconsin Geology Museum. WVFP will engage Wisconsin high school
teachers and students in the discovery and study of vertebrate fossils,
primarily from Wisconsin caves. WVFP totally integrates field experiences and
inquiry-based classroom activities with original and important scientific
research. The educational and scientific aspects of this project are united by a
common goal: the production of high-quality scientific data by high school
students. These data will be of far-reaching and contemporary scientific
importance. As production of these data can be accomplished only by students
with the knowledge and enthusiasm required to complete scientific research
projects, the scientific success of the project hinges on its success in
educating students. WVFP begins with a one-week summer workshop in which
participants will conduct field work in Wyalusing State Park, located in the
southwestern quarter of Wisconsin. Student and teacher participants will
discover, collect, and learn to identify fossils of small vertebrates such as
amphibians and reptiles. Following the workshop, participants return to their
schools. Under the supervision of project staff during frequent follow-up
visits, they will process and identify raw fossil samples loaned to them by the
Geology Museum. Processed fossils, along with student identifications, will be
returned to the Geology Museum.&lt;br/&gt;
