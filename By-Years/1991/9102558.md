This proposal requests funds from the NSF/CEDAR program to initiate an
engineering feasibility study for some elements of the Polar Cap Observatory
(PCO). This design study will strongly benefit the CEDAR community in promoting
the concept of a Class I facility, and will begin the "Next Step-An Upper
Atmospheric Initiative for the 1990's." Completion of the design study in 1991
will better define the cost of realizing the PCO, and will permit the issuance
of an annoucement of opportunity for instrument and observatory construction in
1992. With such a schedule, PCO operations could begin as early as 1995, thereby
supporting and complementing the major activities of the NASA ISTP program and
broader "Global Change" initiatives.***//
