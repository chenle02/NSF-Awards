This project proposes an environment to provide up-to-the-minute briefings on
topics of interest, linking the user into an integrated collection of related
multimedia documents. On the basis of a user profile or query, the proposed
system filters multimedia information to match the user interests and
automatically generates a summary of the set of matching documents to provide
the user with an overview of the relevant information. The system also provides
a representative set of images or video that match user interests as well as
hypertext links into the documents themselves. The user can follow up with
multimedia queries to refine the search for related images, video, or additional
articles. The research has three main components: summarization, multimedia
search and manipulation, and event tracking. Results will provide advances in
summarization using language generation over information extracted from multiple
live sources of news, in multimedia search and classification over compressed
images using visual features, and in tracking of events by detecting surface
differences between documents. Research will also result in technologies to aid
a user in tracking multimedia information in specific news domains, reducing the
number of documents end users such as journalists must access.
