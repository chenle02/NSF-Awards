9601080 Downs Despite the prominent role that they play in the evolution of many
multilaterals and their obviously strategic character, membership decisions have
received little theoretical attention from political scientists. Individual
political scientists often have informed opinions about the historical
consequences of a multilateral's decision to incorporate or exclude a particular
state or the relative merits of a specific expansion decision that a
multilateral now faces, but only recently have members of the discipline
attempted to generalize about the factors that determine the outcome of these
decisions or how they are likely to affect the multilateral's future evolution.
As a result, international relations theory has not played a prominent role in
the current and extremely salient debates about the likelihood and consequences
of expanding membership; in NATO and the EU to include different Eastern Europe
states or expanding the membership of NAFTA to include various Latin American
states. In this project the investigators continue recent efforts to formulate a
formal theory of multilateralism that is capable of addressing such membership
issues. To accomplish this, they develop a set of models that endogenize three
interrelated decisions that cannot be understood in isolation. These involve 1)
membership, 2) voting rules, and 3) depth of cooperation. The researchers
explore how these decisions are affected by variations in three factors that are
often salient in descriptions of multilateral development: 1) the nature of the
good that the multilateral regulates, 2) the preferences of states both within
and outside the multilateral and uncertainty about those preferences, and 3)
uncertainty about the capacity of candidate states. Conclusions are evaluated in
the context of case studies that examine the evolution of five multilateral
agreements: the European Union, the Andean Common Market, Montreal Protocol,
GATT/WTO, the Med Plan, and the International Whaling Commission. ***
