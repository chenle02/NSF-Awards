The University of Connecticut continues operating a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site is affiliated with the Polymers Program
in the Institute of Materials Science; its theme is polymeric materials for
sensing and actuating. Ten undergraduates are recruited every year for a ten-
week summer research experience, with a recruitment focus on students from
predominantly undergraduate institutions in the region. The core of the program
is an independent research project in an interdisciplinary environment. In
addition, a series of seminars introduce students to safety practices, effective
communication, and careers in the polymers area. At the conclusion of the summer
students participate in a research symposium where they present the results of
their research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
