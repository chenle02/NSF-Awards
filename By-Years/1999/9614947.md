This project, directed by Assistant Professor Luis A. Colon at SUNY-Buffalo, is
supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of
Chemistry. The work will use sol-gel technology to synthesize chemically bonded
stationary phases for use with chromatographic methods, particularly high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrochromatography in open and
packed columns. The incorporation of the desired functional groups into the sol-
gel reagents during the fabrication of the silica will create Si-C bonds that do
not undergo hydrolysis and provide a material that is multilayered. These
characteristics are especially promising for solving the existing problem of
suitable packing and surfaces for separations at high pH. Studies will be done
of the variables affecting the chemical reactions involved in the glass
formation process. A number of techniques (ESCA, SIMS, FTIR and others) will be
used to examine the physicochemical properties of the glasses, followed by
examination of the chromatographic performance. The overall objective is to
correlate the processing parameters, the material characteristics and the
separation performance. Liquid chromatographic methods are powerful techniques
to separate complex mixtures of compounds into their individual constituents.
The purpose of this work is to provide an entirely new way to synthesize the
materials upon which the separation takes place. Applications of such
separations are wide-spread in areas such as environmental analysis,
pharmaceutical analysis, and many others. The focus of the project is to make
materials with properties superior to those now available.
