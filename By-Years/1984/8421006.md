To provide focus to fundamental research priorities in the total buildings
control area, a two-day workshop will be held by Drexel University in the fall
of 1985 on "Fundamental Research Needs in Building Control Systems."
Approximately 24 university researchers as well as industrial representatives
will participate; they will be selected so that all workshop participants will
have knowledge and experience covering the totality of the buildings and control
area. Three panels will be organized based upon specific topic areas and
research issues submitted in advance by each invited participant. A final report
of the workshop, including specific recommendations, will be prepared.
