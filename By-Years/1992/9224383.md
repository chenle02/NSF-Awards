This award supports a continuing program of permafrost monitoring in Alaska that
began in 1977. Temperature measurements of the air, the active layer, and the
permafrost will be recorded at several sites by automated data logging systems.
The physical state of permafrost is a very sensitive indicator of long term
changes in surface temperature and also is an important parameter for climate
models. Permafrost monitoring is crucial to understanding the processes of
interaction between soil, groundwater, and the atmosphere.
