The workshop will focus on teaching design skills. It will bring together a
small group of experienced design teachers, practitioners, and researchers to
examine design teaching in a range of disciplines, such as engineering,
architecture, and computer science. The goals are to clarify how specific
aspects of design teaching are cross-disciplinary or domain-specific and to
gather techniques, tools, and materials that can be used in a multidisciplinary
undergraduate course in design skills.
