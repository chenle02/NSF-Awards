This project involves the study of both on-line and dynamic algorithms---types
of algorithms with the unifying theme of uncertainty about future requests to
the algorithm. New methods of average-case analysis are introduce to the study
of on-line algorithms, drawing from experience in information theory and data
compression (and, in particular, from stochastic complexity). In addition, the
computational complexity of making optimal on-line decisions when the input
requests are drawn from a known distribution, is investigated. In the area of
dynamic algorithms and data structures, techniques are developed for designing
dynamic algorithms by examining the structure of existing (or perhaps new)
parallel algorithms. Initial results show how to use easily computable
properties of algebraic circuits in order to design dynamic algorithms, and
these results are extended in this project to a wider class of problems
involving more complex incremental operations on the inputs. In addition,
dynamic algorithms for parallel machines are developed, which are important for
applications which require very fast response to dynamically changing data.
