The nonlinear dynamics of equatorially trapped waves and their interactions with
complicated topography and basin boundaries will be studied in the laboratory.
The new experimental technique utilizes the magnetic body force of ferrofluids
to achieve the full spherical geometry of geophysical flows. A complementary
finite-difference numerical model of shallow water waves on a sphere will be
used to aid in interpreting the laboratory results.
