This award supports the mathematical research of Professor Glenn Stevens of
Boston University. Dr. Stevens's project is concerned with special values of
L-functions. These functions are number-theoretic constructs that are studied by
methods from complex analysis. Dr. Stevens plans to embed the theory of Shintani
decompositions for totally real number fields of degree n into the geometry of
the Borel-Serre completion of the symmetric space of GL(n), and to use the extra
structure afforded by this geometry and the action of GL(n,Q) on it, to study
the arithmetic properties of special values of partial zeta functions. Non-
Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a mathematical
curiosity, but by the end of that century, mathematicians had realized that many
objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. The
detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given rise to several
branches of modern mathematics, of which the study of Modular and Automorphic
Forms is one of the most active. This field is principally concerned with
questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of Geometry and Analysis, it
retains connection to its historical roots.
