This U.S.-Venezuela award will support Professors Christopher Lobb of the
University of Maryland and Richard Newrock of the University of Cincinnati in a
research collaboration with Professor Miguel Octavio of the Instituto Venezolano
de Investigaciones Cientificas (IVIC). The purpose of the research is to study
various theoretical and experimental aspects of arrays of Josephson junctions.
The investigators plan to perform computer simulations of two-dimensional arrays
of Josephson junctions in order to understand the state and dynamic properties
of such systems, as well as to explore the parameters that may affect their
performance in potential applications. Junction arrays have interesting dynamic
properties and have potential applicability to infrared wave detectors, mixers
and parametric amplifiers, and as emitters of coherent radiation. Measurements
and simulations will be emphasized in Maryland and Cincinnati, while the work in
Venezuela will emphasize theory and simulations. *** //
