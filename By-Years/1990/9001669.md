This award supports the research in algebraic geometry and number theory of
Professor David Harbater of the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Harbater has
proposed to continue his study of Galois covers of arithmetic varieties and of
arithmetic intersection theory. He will work to construct Galois covers over the
rational line having special type of Galois group and ramification, and in his
intersection-theoretic work, he plans to use a horizontal pairing that he has
recently defined in order to study arithmetic surfaces and to enlarge the
Arakelov divisor group and study the fine structure at infinity. This is
research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject that combines
the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original
formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number theory started with
the whole numbers and such questions as divisibility of one whole number by
another. These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced
each other from the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual
influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now
uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding
influence beyond its own borders.
