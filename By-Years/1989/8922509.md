Despite the importance of public sector financial / accounting decisions, there
has been little analytical work on the topic. Although political scientists have
looked at the underlying political processes in public organizations, very few
studies have tried to explore the antecedents and consequences of the specific
accounting practices used. This proposal outlines a research program to explore
decisions made by state / local government about financial reporting and
auditing. By combining the study of accounting practices with analyses of
organizational structure and processes, the proposed research takes an
innovative approach. The project promises to contribute (1) to fundamental
research on organizational theory in the public sector and (2) to improvements
in public sector decision making by management. These contributions are made
more likely by the application of a research approach which recognizes the
unique functions and powers of public sector organizations. The principal
investigator has both the background and the insights needed to make the project
successful. In summary, the proposed research will lead to valuable new insights
and applications in public decision making.
