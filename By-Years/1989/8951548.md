This award provides funds to the Department of Microbiology at The University of
Massachusetts, Amherst to purchase equipment which will help introduce modern
analytical techniques into the teaching of microbial physiology in two
undergraduate laboratory courses. Gas chromatographic techniques will be used to
measure the products of microbial metabolism. The new approach provides for the
development of laboratory exercises in fermentation, growth and nitrogen
fixation. The products of microbial metabolism to be analyzed include short-
chain fatty acids and alcohols, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. In addition, the
developments will include the capacity to measure ethylene produced as a result
of the activity of nitrogenase. The use of a table top fermentor also allows for
investigations into the rates of metabolic processes and an examination of those
variables (e.g. pH and temperature) that control metabolic processes. The
improvement will overcome many of the limitations currently experienced in
undergraduate microbiology courses. The grantee is matching this award with non-
Federal sources.
