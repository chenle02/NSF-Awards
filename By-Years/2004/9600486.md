9600486 Hession This is a project requesting funding for a planning visit to
Mongolia by Dr. William Hession, the Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia. The purpose of this planning visit is to evaluate whether he can
include integrated spatial analyses and GIS activities in the study of Lake
Hovsgol. The use of GIS in the analysis of environmental changes is important
for understanding the relationships between biodiversity, landscape features,
and human and natural stressors. This information can allow an integrated
analysis of natural resources and research planning in the Hovsgol Nuur
watershed.
