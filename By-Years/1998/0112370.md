This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support investigation examines how the
federal structure of American political institutions affects the way in which
individuals translate policy opinions into voting behavior. A theoretical
framework pays particular attention to citizens' ability to make different
attributions of responsibility for policymaking and policy performance across
different levels of government in a federal system. Specific hypotheses focus on
the affect such responsibility attributions have on the linkage between policy
opinions and federal voting behavior. The hypothesized relationships will be
analyzed by collecting original survey data on citizen attitudes about various
policy areas and the level of governments they deem responsible for those
policies.

This dissertation has implications for understanding empirical patterns of
American federal voting that heretofore have been understudied. The model
produces specific predictions regarding those who would be more likely to vote
for different parties at different levels of government and for those who
turnout for lower offices, but not higher ones.
