Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, the Indian River Community College and
the St. Lucie County School District have formed a partnership to provide
"transition point" young women (Those moving from middle school to high school,
high school to college, reentry women to professional course work) with
experiences and materials geared to support them in the pursuit of science
oriented career pathways. At the secondary and community college levels, a new
program, Exploring Science &amp; Technology - Based Careers for Women is
planned. At the middle school level, the expansion of a summer Just We Girls
program is planned. Scientists will serve as mentors for the college student
participants, who in turn will serve as mentors for the younger women and girls.
A dynamic, interactive regional network of scientists, science teachers and
young women potential scientists is planned.
