This project continues research on iterative substructuring methods and other
domain decomposition algorithms for partial differential equations. These
algorithms are iterative methods for the parallel solution of very large systems
of algebraic equations that arise in finite element/difference modeling of
petroleum reservoirs, computational fluid dynamics, elasticity, etc. In each
iteration, the restriction of the given problem to each of many subregions is
solved approximately and data is exchanged between neighboring subdomains. A
global problem, with few degrees of freedom per subdomain, is also required to
obtain fast convergence when many subdomains are used. The research will focus
on analyzing, improving and implementing several classes of domain decomposition
algorithms, in particular, those which are suitable for emerging massively
parallel systems. The ultimate goal is to solve very large, ill-conditioned
problems of continuum mechanics for which traditional iterative methods are
unsatisfactory and for which direct methods are too slow and require too much
memory. The underlying theory, which has proven central in the recent
development of these fast algorithms, will be further developed and the ideas
tested in systematic numerical experiments.
