This is a continuation of research previously supported by NSF grant EAR
85-19237, involving the experimental determination of mineral solubilities at
elevated temperatures and pressures. It is generally accepted that aqueous
fluids play a critical role in many geological processes in the Earth's
lithosphere; however, fundamental data on mineral solubilities and fluid-rock
equilibria at elevated temperatures and pressures are extremely sparse. This
project will determine equilibrium solubilities of geologically important
hydroxide, carbonate, and silicate minerals in H2O-CO2 fluids at temperatures to
750oC and pressures to 3 kbar. The results of these experiments will provide
better understanding of important metamorphic processes involving fluid-rock
interactions.
