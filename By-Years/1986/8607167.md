This award supports a conference which discusses and synthesizes major issues in
mechanical engineering education and the mechanical engineering practice for the
next decade. Mechanical engineering and mechanical engineering technology needs
are identified; the educational framework to meet these needs is defined; and
plans for implementing, assessing, and updating these needs are set forth.
Industrial leaders and leading engineering educators will interact to implement
the goals of the conference.
