The University of Iowa is being supported to establish a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under supervision of experienced research chemists. The
program will support 9 students for the summer of 1987, of which almost half
will come from other institutions. The Research activities will include: o
Synthesis and Reactivity of Organodimetallics o Automated Analysis of Data from
Passive Infrared Sensors o Synthesis and Spectroscopy Novel Metal-porphyrin o
Novel Biologically Active Heterocyclic Systems
