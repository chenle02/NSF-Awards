The objective of this CAREER project is to establish a significant advancement
in biomolecular nanoelectronics by theoretical modeling and interfacing liquid-
state biopolymers to solid-state nanoelectronic devices. The scientific
component of this project aimed on the theoretical modeling of dielectric
behavior of biopolymers and elucidating experimentally interactions of DNA-
counterion, RNA-DNA, protein-protein, and actin filament-counterion in the
cavity between two nanogap electrodes. The technological components of this
project focus on the precise control of sub10 nm nanogap electrode for
biosensors, development of sensitive label free bioassays, and a robust batch
fabrication method of integrated nanogap electrode arrays with nanofluidic
networks. The educational goal of this project is to effectively integrate
research into educational activities and the training of both undergraduate and
graduate students in interdisciplinary studies: Special educational outreach
program will be accomplished through summer research training camp to educate
women and under-represented students in junior and senior high school. Overall
educational goal is to train students how to carry out their research with sound
theory and hand on laboratory skill for their advanced careers in quantitative
biological sciences or biophysical engineering.
