California, San Diego; Sheldon Brown&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this
proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Hybrid Multicore Productivity Research
(CHMPR)" with a focus on hybrid multicore computing and research on parallel
processing algorithms as well as technology-driven research questions. The lead
of the proposed Center is UMBC with site locations at Georgia Tech (GT) and the
University of California, San Diego (UCSD). &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed
Center plans to develop, test, and optimize prototypes of computationally
intensive applications. A key contribution of the Center will be the
implementation of prototype applications on new architectures and comparative
performance analysis. This Center is needed to advance knowledge both in high-
performance computing as well as computer architecture communities. The PIs are
well qualified and the access to resources is excellent. The combined computing
facilities at UMBC and GT, respectively, are the largest most advanced Cell
Broadband Engine based multicore university systems available today.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will address the future needs of the
computer industry as this new hybrid multicore processor technology evolves. The
proposed Center will provide faculty and students the unique opportunity to gain
hands-on expertise to address a wide variety of practical, hybrid multicore
applications in areas of climate prediction, defense, biomedical informatics,
3-D graphic environments, finance and social computing. The Center has described
efforts to increase participation of underrepresented groups, and there are
plans to publish the results of research and education projects within an online
Hybrid Multicore Knowledge Repository. &lt;br/&gt;
