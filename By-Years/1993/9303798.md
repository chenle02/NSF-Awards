Objectives are to understand the allosteric control of gluconeogenesis by the
enzyme, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, in molecular detail. Specific aims include:
(1) development of a system for the expression of recombinant pig kidney
fructose-1,6- bisphosphatase at high levels without contamination from the
fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase of the host system, (2) cloning and overexpression
of the E. coli fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase for comparison studies with the pig
kidney enzyme, (3) use of the crystal structures of pig kidney
fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase in the T and R states, and functional studies
employing single site mutants of the E. coli and pig kidney enzymes to begin to
determine the molecular basis of the switch between the allosteric states, and
(4) determination of how the regulatory effector AMP alters the activity of the
enzyme. %%% The degradation and biosynthesis of glucose are perhaps the most
important of all metabolic pathways because glucose is the primary energy source
for the brain. Given that the body does not store more than a one day supply of
glucose, survival depends upon the ability to synthesize glucose via
gluconeogenesis, after the stored supply of glucose is depleted. These studies
will be aimed at understanding the function of the enzyme fructose-1,6-
bisphosphatase, an enzyme that exerts metabolic control over gluconeogenesis.
The enzyme's structure will be selectively modified via site directed
mutagenesis and biophysical techniques will be utilized to characterize the
resulting changes in structure. These structure changes will then be correlated
with alterations in biological function. In this way specific aspects of the
structure of the enzyme will be correlated with particular functions.
