This is an award to provide support for research to determine the feasibility of
an innovative concept using microbes to biologically degrade volatile
halogenated aliphatic organic contaminants of soil. Volatile halogenated
aliphatic compounds are predominant contaminants at hazardous waste sites.
Trichloroethylene is the most commonly occurring compound in this class. These
compounds are persistent and therefore require some form of remediation or
removal. Present technology utilizes carbon adsorption, which means transferring
the hazardous compounds to another medium which must be decontaminated by
combustion. The efficiency of the microbial process that is the subject of this
research will be compared with that achieved by use of carbon adsorption and by
use of alternative strains of microorganisms that have exhibited this ability to
degrade soil contaminants. The proposal leading to this Phase I award was
submitted in response to NSF 88-8, Small Business Innovation Research. Results
may provide an alternative and more efficient procedure to decontaminate soil at
sites where the target compounds have been placed or to which they have moved.
