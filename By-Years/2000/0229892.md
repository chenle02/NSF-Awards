The Space Science Institute will refurbish its 5,000 square foot traveling
exhibition, "MarsQuest: Exploring the Red Planet" (ESI-9705377), enhancing the
exhibition with new components that incorporate recent data from ongoing Mars
missions, and extending its national tour for an additional three years.
Enhancements include exhibits on Mars' weather, exobiology and the addition of a
photo-realistic rotating Mars globe. Additional improvements include models of
the NASA Mars exploration rover and an online kiosk to make additional
information available to visitors after they leave the exhibition. MarsQuest is
fully booked and there is a waiting list for a second three-year tour. The
proposed refurbishment and enhancements will occur at the end of the current
tour in 2003, with the new tour beginning early 2004.
