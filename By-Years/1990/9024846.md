Osteryoung is a leading electroanalytical chemist. Her work under this grant
from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division will
study quantitative analysis of benzodiazepines (tranquilizers), sequestration
into microspheres of species liberated by electrolysis, interactions of ions
with cyclodextrins (size and shape selective reagents), and formation of thin
films by electrolysis. Fields benefiting from this work will include
pharmacoanalysis, enzyme modeling, high-temperature superconductivity, and
fundamental electrochemistry. %%% Specific experiments include observation of
complexation of ferrocenecarboxylic acid by cyclodextrins, complexation of heme
groups by cyclodextrins, development of methods for benzodiazepines in non-
aqueous solvents (which, if used in conjunction with extractions should reduce
interferences compared to current methods), use of mono-disperse spheres
toprovide constant diffusion coefficients for a variety of species so that their
rate of evolution in the electrode double layer can be definitively measured,
and electrocrystallization of high temperature Ba-Cu-O superconductors.
