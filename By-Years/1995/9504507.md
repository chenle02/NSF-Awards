Proposal: DMS 9504507 PI: Dorota Dabrowska Institution: UCLA Title: Topics in
multivariate survival analysis and counting processes Abstract: The objective of
this research is to extend applications of multiparameter product integrals and
smoothing techniques in survival analysis. Asymptotic properties of density and
nonparametric regression based on smoothed product integrals will be developed
for the following: data adaptive construction of rank tests for independence
from censored data; nonparametric estimation of multivariate survival functions
from truncated data; goodness-of-fit in frailty models; and quantile derivative
regression in linear transformation models. The results will be applied to the
analysis of data from AIDS and twin studies. Multivariate survival analysis is a
rapidly growing area with a wide range of applications in genetic epidemiology,
astronomy, econometrics and other fields. The aim of this research is to develop
statistical methods for analysis of data arising in such studies.
