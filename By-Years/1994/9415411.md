The aim of this research is to analyze the role of temperature, light, and
nutrient availability in regulating primary production of arctic tundra
ecosytems at several levels of ecological organization and at different time
scales. The research is organized around three general hypotheses about the
mechanisms reeulating adjustments of primary production in response to short-
and long-term variation in climate. The basic idea is that different mechanisms
control the responses to climate at different levels of ecological organization
and at different time scales. In order to obtain useful predictions of the
effects of climate change on primary production, a better understanding of
relationships between these interacting mechanisms of adjustment to climate
change is needed. To test the three general hypotheses, this five-year program
of research will focus on an integrated series of field experiments in moist
tussock tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska. The mechanisms to be studied include
those operating at the physiological level (e.g., photosynthesis), the whole-
plant level (storage and recycling, changes in allocation and biomass turnover),
the species and ecotype levels (constraints on nutrient use eficiency and growth
rates), and the whole-ecosystem level (climate controls on soil nutrient
supply). This project is part of International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). It is
funded within the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program. Collaboration with
other ecologist working at Toolik Lake and at other arctic sites as part of the
Long-Term Ecological research (LTER) and Global Change in Terrestrial Ecosystems
(GCTE) programs will increase the application and impact of this research.
