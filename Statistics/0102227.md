The PI, collaborators and students develop statistical models and methods for
problems involving latent structure in large and complex data sets. Specific
research topics include: new models for regression and prediction with latent
variables; a range of developments involving latent structure in Bayesian
regression models and associated algorithmic implementation using simulation
methods; statistical aspects of machine learning algorithms for regression and
classification; generalized linear and multivariate latent factor models; models
with errors in predictor variables; empirical factor models. Research in these
areas is partly motivated by applications in bioinformatics in the area of gene
expression profiling, and related research and applications in time series in
finance and communications signals processing.

This research is concerned with creating and implementing improved methods for
the statistical analysis of large and complex data sets arising in fields such
as functional genomics, finance and communications engineering. The research
goals include creating new mathematical models that can adequately represent the
complex structure of increasingly large data sets, together with appropriate
computational tools and algorithms for the analysis of such data using these
models. The need for substantial advances in this area of statistical research
are highlighted by the analysis challenges posed by the increasingly large and
complex gene expression data sets that are becoming standard in biomedical
research due to rapid advances in genome technology, and major aspects of this
research involve applications in functional genomics. Additional applications of
models arising from this research lie in analysis of time series data arising in
areas including finance and communications.
