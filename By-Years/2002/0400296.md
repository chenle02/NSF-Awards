The objective of this research project is the advancement of fundamental
knowledge for the processing and manufacturing of sustainable renewable
resource-based "green" biocomposites from engineered natural/bio-fiber and
bioplastics. The approach is to utilize new emerging bioplastics produced by
bacteria and bioplastics derived from corn oil with plant biofibers as
reinforcements to produce structural biocomposites via extrusion-injection
molding and a new hydro-thermoforming process. An integrated research program
will be conducted encompassing education, economics, environment and energy
aspects to strengthen the connection between "Design" and "Manufacturing" in
order to achieve 'sustainability'. A strong collaborative partnership with
representative industrial participants from across the technology will add
additional strength to insure relevancy and industrial implementation in the
future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will result in a framework that will
serve as the foundation for transitioning away from petroleum based resources to
biobased, sustainable resources in structural materials while maintaining a
viable cost-performance structure. Advancement in the demand for and utilization
of these new alternative 'sustainable" materials will create new sources of
revenue for farmers, increase the use of biobased products and reduce the
nation's dependence on petroleum resources. The project will also produce new
educational modules that can serve to integrate the full range of important
environmental considerations into traditional engineering education. &lt;br/&gt;
