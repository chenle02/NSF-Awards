This research project focuses on experimental and theoretical research on
continuous observation and feedback control of single-atom dynamics in cavity
QED. The focus will be on a newly discovered class of supercritical Hopf
bifurcations that are predicted both by semi-classical and quantum models for
the atom-cavity dynamics. The plan is to investigate quantum-classical
correspondence between these models via experiments with real-time filtering and
feedback, and to use single-atom bifurcations as a setting to study the
interaction of quantum fluctuations with semi-classical dynamical instabilities.
An experimental apparatus to perform cavity QED with a Fabry-Perot optical
resonator and atoms guided by a magnetic micro-structure will be constructed.
The broader impact involves education of graduate students as well as efforts in
diversity and outreach.
