This award will provide support for the "Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology
Including Fundamental InteraCtions (PACIFIC) Symposium." It will be held
February 13-19, 2018 in Akaigawa, Hokkaido, Japan.

It has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students, as
it will provide participant travel support for them to be able to participate in
the symposium. This interdisciplinary conference will have an impact on the
broader field including particle physics, astronomy, and mathematical physics.

This symposium will focus on the latest developments at the interface of
particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology and on their ramifications for
understanding fundamental interactions. There will be sessions devoted to
Astroparticle experiment/observations, Particle Theory, High-energy Astrophysics
(theory and observations) and Cosmology.
