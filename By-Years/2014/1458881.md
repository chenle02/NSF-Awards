Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) has received an NSF Scholarships for Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) award for their project
entitled the SLCC (pronounced Slick)-STEM Scholars Program that will provide
scholarships to academically talented, economically disadvantaged students that
often experience low retention and graduation rates. The program has a special
focus on women and minorities since these groups are at higher risk for not
completing STEM degrees. In this way the project will ensure a robust, diverse
workforce. Over the course of 4 years, SLCC-STEM will provide approximately 48
incoming students with a $10,000 scholarship for full time study over 2 years
leading to a STEM degree. In addition, the project will provide scholarships for
approximately 32 "near completers" to finish STEM degrees. "Near completers" are
students who are within 30 credit hours of completion of a degree, but have been
absent from college for at least 2 semesters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SLCC will
draw on its extensive network of relationships with area high schools and
community partners to recruit students into STEM programs. In addition to
financial support, SLCC-STEM will provide other support mechanisms including
faculty mentoring, focused advising, opportunities for undergraduate
scholarship, transfer assistance to baccalaureate programs, and a supportive
social network. SLCC-STEM will work very closely with existing science research
programs and the TRiO/Student Support Services Program to provide these
services. Project evaluation will be both formative and summative assessment
with qualitative and quantitative data collected from multiple sources to assess
recruitment, retention, and graduation rates, as well as the effectiveness of
the SLCC-STEM student support systems. The data generated will provide
information on the most effective means to support underrepresented STEM
students and to re-engage students who have nearly completed their degrees but
have left school for a variety of family or financial reasons.
