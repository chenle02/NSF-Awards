This SGER grants will assist Iowa State University in the acquisition of a
scanning tunneling/atomic force microscope. The microscope will be utilized to
examine the structure of chromosomes. Particular emphasis will be focused on the
structure of DNA in the telomeric region of the chromosome where DNA pairing
differs from normal Watson-Crick base pairing.
