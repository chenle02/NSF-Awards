This CAREER program has a scientific focus on the study of the control of atom-
radiation interactions via coherence and interference. Specific physical
phenomena such as cancellation of spontaneous emission, dressed-state
manipulation of two-photon excitation, and active control of optical bistability
and refractive index will be explored in the experiments. The educational
component of the program is centered on an outreach program to high school
students from underrepresented minority groups in the Miami area.
