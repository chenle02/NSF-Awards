This research will analyze broad frequency/wavelength seismic array data to
investigate the nature of the scattered wavefield and coda produced by sources
at local, regional, and teleseismic distances. Analysis of apparent velocity,
direction, and polarization will allow estimation of scattering sources and
mechanisms producing coda for sources at various distances. P, S and surface
wave coda will be searched to see how scattered energy differs for sources at
different distances, at different times for a given source, and with scattering
type. Three-dimensional numerical modeling will be used to produce scattered
wavefields with characteristics observed in the array data. Results should show
how production of seismic coda, a proposed earthquake prediction parameter, is
related to earth structure and how these structures affect wave propagation over
a very broad frequency/wavelength range.
