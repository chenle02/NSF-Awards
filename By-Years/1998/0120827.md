Project Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research examines distributed sensing
and control as an integral component of self-healing structures. This research
integrates structural health monitoring methods with smart materials,
statistical pattern recognition, and control to produce a class of structures
having the ability to detect damage and to perform active control to compensate
for the damage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the proposed research
consist of:&lt;br/&gt;1) Integrating pattern recognition and data compression
into the impedance-based health monitoring technique;&lt;br/&gt;2) Integrating
elements of health monitoring and control to create self-repairing structures
and machines;&lt;br/&gt;3) Investigating temperature and pressure effects on
simultaneous health monitoring and control;&lt;br/&gt;4) Experimentally
verifying our results and using the results of our experiments to modify and
improve our theories;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The engineering results of this
research are systems that detect a problem, warn of the existence of the
detected damage and then make a temporary repair, all while remaining in
service. This scenario would allow systems to remain in service after a problem
develops and to continue in operation until a convenient time for a more
permanent repair is possible. By making the structures substantially easier to
inspect and resistant to failure, costly periodic "down-time" of equipment will
be significantly reduced. Industrial structures such as airframes, automobiles
and machines can benefit from the application of the technology developed in
this proposal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
