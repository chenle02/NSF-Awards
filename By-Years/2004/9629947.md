ABSTRACT OPP-9629947 Stoltman/Partlow This dissertation grant proposal focuses
on subsistence specialization during the last 1000 years in the Kodiak
Archipelago in Alaska. The role of marine resource specialization has been
debated in the North Pacific region. This archaeological study will involve
systematic collection and analysis of faunal remains from two prehistoric sites.
Multiple faunal seasonality indicators will be used to test the hypothesis that
salmon specialization was a major factor in changing village organization. The
research will be part of, and will benefit from, a larger-scale project on
Alutiiq history by the Afognak Native Corporation.
