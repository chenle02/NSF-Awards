Geochemical studies of long-lived Th isotopes by mass spectrometry will be
continued on previously collected water column and pore water samples. The
effects of bacteria and colloids on chemical scavenging will be explored to
increase our understanding of the aqueous geochemistry of Th. This should lead
to more effective usages of Th isotopes as tracers and chronometers of chemical
scavenging, sedimentation, and paleoceanographic processes. Sensitivity of the
mass spectrometric method for the determination of Th in seawater has been
improved substantially. With this tool, some important marine geochemical issues
which have up until now been impossible or otherwise too difficult to do will be
undertaken. The technical advancement has also prompted modification of the
analytical scheme to include the analysis of Pa-231 by mass spectrometry. The
new technique will open up avenues for important marine geochemical and
geochronological studies in the years to come.
