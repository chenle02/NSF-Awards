The objective of this research is to develop low cost/low complexity integrated
phased arrays to meet the demand of the emerging applications in civilian
communications and sensors. The approach is to investigate new phased array
design methodologies based on employing only a single phase
shifter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research involves
investigation of fundamentally different circuit topologies for the design of
integrated phased arrays. These phased array systems will employ a single true-
time-delay phase shift element and will be integrated on silicon. Integrated
phased arrays to be developed under this project are expected to be broadband,
consume low power, and occupy a small die area. The research has the potential
to significantly facilitate commercialization of phased array antennas by making
them amenable to integrated circuit design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: Low cost integrated phased arrays can impact various areas of
electronic communications including smart antennas, multi-input multi-output
(MIMO) systems, imaging radars and mobile multimedia services. Spatial
selectivity of phased array beams can significantly increase the channel
capacity of gigabit wireless personal communication systems. This project will
serve to educate graduate students through direct participation in the research.
The research is of particular value for students to become experts in high
frequency integrated circuit design, antennas, electromagnetic simulation,
circuit and system design and measurement. This project will involve
undergraduate students through the University Research Opportunity Program
(UROP) and the Marian Sara Parker Scholars (MPS) Program at the University of
Michigan.
