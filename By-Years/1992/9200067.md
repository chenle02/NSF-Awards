This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the area
of chemistry. For three summers beginning April 1992, twelve undergraduate
students will spend ten weeks engaged in research in the chemical sciences. The
focus of some of the research projects are programs at the academic/ industrial
interface. Some students will be guided in their work by mentors permanently
employed in industry. Others will be given the opportunity to meet industrial
scientists in their research setting, to discuss careers in chemistry with them,
and to learn about the role chemical research plays in industrial development.
