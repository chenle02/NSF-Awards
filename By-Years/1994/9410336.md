9410336 Hay The study of plant-herbivore interactions in freshwater communities
has lagged far behind similar investigations in terrestrial and marine systems.
Yet research in the latter two habitats has revolutionized our understanding of
plant-animal interactions, ecosystem function, and coevolution. This project
extends methods and approaches developed for marine herbivore systems to little-
studied freshwater herbivore systems. The investigators are documenting: what
plant traits deter herbivore consumption, the selectivity of freshwater
herbivores, and the impact of generalist vs. specialist herbivores. This
research will allow the testing of important theories of plant defenses and
herbivory developed in terrestrial and marine systems, and provide a unique
opportunity for valuable comparisons between the three systems. This research
will improve our understanding of the ecology of plant-herbivore interactions
and the role of macrophyte feeders in the function of aquatic ecosystems. The
results have application in the management of aquatic ecosystems.
