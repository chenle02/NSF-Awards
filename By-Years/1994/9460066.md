Zirconia has been found to produce one of the lowest rates of polyethylene wear
debris when used with ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene for the
articulating surface of a prosthesis. A zirconia coating can combine these
useful surface properties with the well known bulk properties of common medical
alloys. Due to the lack of chemical cohesion of zirconia with the elements of
cobalt chromium alloy, even deposition techniques which blend the interface
between coating and substrate (functionally gradient interface) are not
producing sufficient adhesion. Implant Sciences Corporation proposes to
demonstrate that a combination of a chemical bonding layer with fully blended
interfaces is a solution to the adhesion problem when the layers are formed
using energetic metal ions of the appropriate species. The proposed coating
process is omni-directional, has a very high rate of throughput, and is proven
for large batch commercial production. Orthopedic manufacturers are greatly
interested in extending the working lifetimes of their total joint replacement
components. The proposed coating method combines the wear rates of ceramic
surfaces with the established manufacturing capability of traditional alloy
prostheses. The combination results in maximum gain in performance for minimum
cost impact. Several hundred thousand total joint replacement operations are
performed each year.
