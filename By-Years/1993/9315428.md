9315428 Cooper This project will apply to large medical databases a variety of
state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques that have proven useful in other
domains. These learning techniques will generate computer models that can be
used to accomplish the following tasks: (1) suggesting general clinical policies
that seem cost-effective and underutilized, (2) providing individual physicians
with patient-specific suggestions about diagnostic and therapeutic actions that
appear to be equally efficacious clinically but cost less than the planned
action, (3) suggesting more effective actions than may be planned, and (4)
detection of clinical situations that are unusual and potentially costly. The
database to be used in the investigation contains information about patients
with community-acquired pneumonia. ***
