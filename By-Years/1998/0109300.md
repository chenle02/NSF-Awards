This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will identify
commercially-important genes in Pinctada margaritifera as targets for future
manipulation in order to improve the efficiency and profitability of black pearl
farming. This work will also attempt to produce transgenic pearl oysters that
carry the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) transgene under a constitutive
eukaryotic promoter. Transgenic animals expressing the reporter gene will be
followed to monitor expression patterns of the transgene in a controlled
quarantine nursery system. Concurrent experiments will isolate genes involved in
growth regulation and nacre formation in this species. Candidate growth hormone
and nacre protein genes will be sequenced, compared to known genes of similar
function in other molluscs and verified as homologous

The commercial application of this project will be at the high end of the black
pearl market that is estimated to be of the order of $ 150 million in the
Pacific alone. This project is expected to result in the production of faster
growing oysters that yield bigger and higher quality pearls than those currently
available.
