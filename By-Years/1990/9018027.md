The goal of this research is to study the mechanism of peptide transport in
human small intestine using brush border membrane vesicles. Presently, there is
no information on the specificity and multiplicity of the peptide transport
systems located on human small intestine. The specific aims are: 1. To determine
total uptake of the peptide substrate. 2. To investigate the kinetics of peptide
transport. 3. To classify the structural characteristics of the peptide
transporter. The investigator proposes to conduct a series of experiments
starting with the isolation of the human intestinal brush border membrane
vesicles obtained from organ donations. Uptake of labeled substrates will be
determined by the rapid filtration method and hydrolysis of the peptides will be
monitored using high performance liquid chromatography. The simple diffusion
component of the peptides will be determined by treating each peptide as a
competitive inhibitor of its own mediated transport. Experiments will be
conducted to determine the kinetic characteristics of peptide uptake. Various
dipeptides and tripeptides will be used as inhibitors in order to determine the
specificity of transport.
