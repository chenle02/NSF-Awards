This one-year project is aimed at comparing longitudinal differences that exist
in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere. Through use of the large MU (Middle and
Upper atmosphere) radar in Japan, the PIs will make comparisons on both an
individual- experiment and climatological-average basis against the measurements
from the Jicamarca, Arecibo, Millstone Hill, and Sondrestrom radars. In
addition, the MU radar will extend the ionospheric-tilt studies to the American
sector to determine their longitudinal consistency and to confirm hypotheses
concerning their relation with global-scale dynamics. Finally, this research
involves the development of a similar data base for MU radar data at Kyoto
University.
