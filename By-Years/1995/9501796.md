9501796 Feng The project will involve the application of new technologies to the
construction and retrofit of civil infrastructure systems, specifically, high-
rise buildings and bridges. These new technologies will be applied to reduce the
hazards posed by wind and earthquakes on these structures with the ultimate
objective of improving public safety and reducing both functional and financial
losses. Two projects entitled "Innovative Vibration Control Systems for
Buildings" and "Seismic Protective Systems for Bridges" were chosen for study
during the award period. Both will present significant technical and theoretical
challenges common to interdisciplinary civil infrastructure research, and both
will involve collaborative efforts with industry, government and allied
disciplines. The result of these studies should yield significant contributions
to the field of civil engineering as well as lasting societal benefit. The
educational portion of this project will address the need to develop innovative
and interdisciplinary civil engineering curricula. The main features of the plan
are to develop new curricula and upgrade the traditional curricula to reflect
the latest scientific and technological advances, design new educational modules
which effectively integrate classroom instruction with research experience,
introduce both undergraduate and graduate students to interdisciplinary research
and encourage field and experimental study. The success of these efforts will
enrich the educational experience of students at all levels, attract promising
candidates to the field of civil engineering and produce capable and innovative
engineers. ***
