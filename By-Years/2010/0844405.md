In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Thomas D. Varberg of Macalester College and his
undergraduate research students will record and analyze the electronic spectra
of transition metal-containing diatomic molecules such as AuF, TaH, TaF, and
TaO. By fitting parameterized molecular Hamiltonians to the measured
transitions, the investigators will determine accurate values for the important
molecular constants and the bond lengths. The nuclear hyperfine structure of the
molecules will be studied at higher resolution by intermodulated fluorescence
spectroscopy. The analysis of the hyperfine structure will illuminate details of
the bonding in these metal free radicals. Understanding such molecules is
important to fields as diverse as astronomy, catalysis, metallurgy and
organometallic chemistry. Diatomic molecules containing a transition metal
display the simplest form of metal bonding and are therefore relevant as initial
models for more complex systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the potential
broader scientific impact of the proposed research, Prof. Varberg will continue
to provide his undergraduate collaborators with valuable research experience,
which will help them to pursue careers in science and
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
