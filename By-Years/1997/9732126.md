Abstract OPP-9732126, 9732461 CHAPIN, LYNCH UNIV. ALASKA, UNIV. COLORADO This
project is designed to test the primary hypothesis that the surface energy and
moisture exchange between atmosphere, ecosystem, snow, permafrost, and soil is
the principal mechanism for coupling the land surface to the climate on seasonal
to decadal timescales. Understanding the characteristics, mechanisms and
feedback processes of this exchange is necessary to incorporate their effects
into predictive tools for pan-Arctic climate change. This proposal will take a
comprehensive view of the study of the land surface energy and moisture budgets,
involving collection of field data, detailed data analysis, model development,
and spatial and temporal extrapolation. The PIs plan to integrate the field work
closely with the simulation work, and investigations of ecosystems and physical
climate systems are undertaken together.
