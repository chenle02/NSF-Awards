This project meets the needs of community college faculty and their students by
providing knowledge and skills in teaching and learning to community college
STEM faculty for on-line, distance delivery of instruction. A prototype program
for professional development of the STEM teaching faculty is developed and
extends the initial success of previously developed certificate programs and
adapts them for instructional improvement. The project combines the resources of
adult and community college education and technology education to provide a
unique learning experience for community college STEM faculty. The combined
expertise of the principal investigators' enables effective delivery of these
on-line certificate programs and will result in STEM instructors gaining
knowledge and skills in online course delivery for their own adult and
traditional students. Diverse cohorts of community college instructors
participate and broaden the partnerships initially established to assess the
needs for curriculum development. These partnerships are also key to the
dissemination of both the materials and the research to wider audiences
including adult and community college educators. These materials may provide an
exemplary model for reaching diverse adult learners with STEM content.
