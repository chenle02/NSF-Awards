This research program is for an experimental and theoretical study of a new type
of continuously tunable solid state laser source for the millimeter-
submillimeter, infrared IR region of the spectrum. This laser would generate
radiation by means of optical transitions between light and heavy hole valence
bands of p-type semiconductors. This new type of solid state laser has the
capability of continuously tuning over a 3-1 frequency range in the IR-
submillimeter region with pulsed power levels of greater than 10 watts. If
developed, this new low-cost source could contribute significantly to
submillimeter scientific and commercial activity. Also, the new laser inversion
idea of shifting distribution functions in a quantum system having a pair of
variable spaced energy levels shows promise of opening new research avenues in
the laser area.
