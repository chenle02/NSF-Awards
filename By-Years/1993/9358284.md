9358284 Sanders Future advances in the power electronics field are likely to
come from two directions: theoretical understanding and technological
application. This research combines these disciplines, research on analysis,
modeling, control, and simulation of power electronic systems is proposed.
Increasingly complex power electronic systems are being designed, and simulation
is emerging as an essential design step for these systems. To address these
simulation challenges, novel techniques including parallel computation, multi-
parameter homotopy, and others are to be explored. Novel approaches for building
the next generations of power supplies are also proposed. The proposed power
supply technologies offer very high power density, high efficiency, and
simplified manufacturing processes. With the current trends of miniaturization
and portability of electronic equipment, the need for integrated power supply
systems is critical. To this date, there has been no successful design of an
integrated power supply that handles a significant power level. One of the
reasons for this is the difficulty in building integrated magnetic components.
New approaches for fabrication of integrated magnetic devices are to be pursued.
