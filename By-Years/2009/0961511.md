Alkyl nitrates from the oceans significantly affect tropospheric ozone
concentration. However, not all sources of oceanic alkyl nitrates have been
identified. A few studies have demonstrated a photochemical source of oceanic
alkyl nitrates but to date, limited, if any other sources have been identified.
For this reason, a scientist from Loyola College proposes to investigate the
biological source of alkyl nitrates from marine diatoms. Specifically, the
research goals of the project would be the following: (1) determine if cultures
of phytoplankton produce alkyl nitrates under 'normal' growth conditions and the
rates of production of alkyl nitrates in the cultures; (2) determine if there
are specific factors such as light, nutrients, and temperature that influence
alkyl nitrate formation; and (3) determine if adding triggers or inhibitors of
nitric oxide production in phytoplankton cause changes in alkyl nitrate
production. The proposed work will improve our overall understanding of the
potential sources of oceanic alkyl nitrates and the factors that may control
these sources, as well as lead to new considerations in biogeochemistry as to
what role phytoplankton may play in the nitrogen cycle specifically with regard
to reactive nitrogen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As regards broader impacts, it is
anticipated that results from the research will be incorporated into
Biochemistry and Instrumental Analysis classes taught by the researcher. Two
undergraduate students will be supported and trained as part of this project.
These students will learn about culturing techniques and how to operate a gas
chromatograph-mass spectrometer.
