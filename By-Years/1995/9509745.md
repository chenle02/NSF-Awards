With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Grubbs of Caltech
will develop the methodology for preparing polymeric materials using metal
catalysts. These investigations will include several metals (Ru, Mn, W, Ir and
Os), a myriad of cyclic olefins with and without functional substituents and an
aqueous suspension for the reaction medium. Success will benefit the polymer
industry significantly. This project will develop new methodology for preparing
polymers which will be beneficial to industry and the materials field. Such
procedures will save valuable natural resources and will be more environmentally
friendly than existing processing.
