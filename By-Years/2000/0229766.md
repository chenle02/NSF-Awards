The proposed research will assess the response of soil thermal, freeze-thaw and
permafrost dynamics to climate change, and will evaluate the impacts of these
processes on the hydrologic cycle of the Russian arctic drainage basin over the
past half century. Research methods will include analysis and synthesis of data
acquired (in many cases, rescued) from 400 locations distributed throughout the
former Soviet Union. A key question being addressed focusses on explaining the
large observed geographical irregularity in long-term surface temperature
change. The research is structured to investigate a key hypothesis that relates
climate warming, higher permafrost temperature, a deeper active layer, and a
longer thaw season. One result will be the impact of climate warming, through
the soil and permafrost interactions, on the seasonal cycles of riverine fresh
water input to the Arctic Ocean. The project will also yield a series of data
products relevant to soil temperature and freeze-thaw cycles.
