This grant will continue to support three professors, four graduate students
and a junior postdoctoral fellow in studies of particle anti particle collisions
in two experiments. In the first, proton and anti proton collisions are produced
at the Fermilab collider and, in the second, electron anti electron collisions
at the LEP accelerator at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. In both cases, the
collisions are at the highest energies available anywhere in the World, and make
possible the deepest penetrations of the particles within one another. This
allows the minutest details of particle interiors to be studied. These may
either conform to the expectations of the "standard model," which accounts for
most hitherto observed data, or may reveal further, unexpected phenomena beyond
the scope of this model.
