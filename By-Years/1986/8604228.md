The field of non-destructive evaluation is of considerable technical, economic
and social importance. The proposers have demonstrated the feasibility of using
magneto-optic materials to produce direct visual images of flaws near the
surface of non-ferrous electrical conductors. The goal of phase II of their
research is the demonstration of a prototype flaw visualization system.
