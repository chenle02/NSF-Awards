The Real-time and Embedded Technology and Application Symposium (RTAS) is an
annual symposium partially sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society. The symposium
traditionally brings together researchers in the broad field of embedded and
real-time computing, control, and communication. The symposium takes place in
Toronto, Canada, May 25th-28th, 2004, and in 2004 includes a separate track on
Real-Time Control (including hybrid systems) and another separate track on
Embedded Applications. To ensure a broader impact in disseminating the results
of this symposium, and to interest young researchers in the field of embedded
and hybrid systems, this award is for travel grants enabling student travel to
attend RTAS 2004 and a pre-conference workshop on current challenges in embedded
computing. The purpose is to encourage the attendance of students who otherwise
would not have the opportunity to participate in such a conference.
