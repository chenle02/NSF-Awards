This main thrust of this research is the performance modeling of routing
algorithms. Almost all prior research work on oblivious and adaptive routing
using virtual channel flow control relies on simulation for performance
prediction. Although simulation can mimic a physical system quite accurately, it
is very expensive in terms of computation time. The analytical models being
developed will be quite effective in evaluating various routing algorithms and
architectural features, and are much more efficient than simulation. The project
is also investigating the fault-tolerant properties of adaptive routing
algorithms.
