teachers' learning opportunities for instructional improvement, 2) examine how
work contexts influence the quality of teacher learning opportunities, 3)
examine the impact of teacher learning opportunities on changes in student
mathematics achievement over four years, and 4) work with district and school
administrators to promote instructional improvement and student achievement by
effectively providing learning opportunities to mathematics teachers. The PI
