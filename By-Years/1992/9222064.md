The general objective of the research is to develop new floor system designs for
steel framed buildings that are more efficient than those currently used. This
efficiency will be achieved through a combination of increased composite slab
spans and framing weight and development of integrated designs that incorporate
structural, electrical, mechanical and communication systems in a partially pre-
assembled configuration. The objectives of the research will be achieved by
using an integrated approach of design, analysis and experimentation. Potential
long-span composite slab systems will be evaluated using partial-composite
theory, which incorporates elemental tests and a non-linear finite element
program. Basic slab properties related to the interfacial bond and end-anchorage
strengths will be evaluated with the elemental tests. Semi-rigid composite beam-
to-girder connections will be developed to reduce serviceability problems
associated with the use of high strength steels.
