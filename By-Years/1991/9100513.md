Current sheets provide an important physical mechanism for heating of the solar
corona as well as more violent phenomena such as flares. Earlier work has
demonstrated that the presence of a small but finite resistivity has an
important influence on the formation of current sheets. This research is to be
continued through in depth studies of the following topics: (i) Current sheet
formation by "free" and "force" reconnection, (ii) role of helicity
conservation, (iii) effect of current sheets on coronal heating by Alfven waves
and (iv) effect of resistivity on complex topologies. These topics will be
studies through both analytical and numerical means.
