As understanding of the biology of these important organisms and their complex
metabolism increases rapidly from year to year, the need for international
gatherings such as those in Geneva and Chicago grows also. A decision was
therefore made that a third symposium would be held in Trieste, Italy, under the
auspices of the University of Milan in 1991. The science of Pseudomonas has
reached a maturity that speaks for itself through the papers presented in the
previous meetings. The field continues to expand. Molecular biology is having an
impact on understanding of metabolic biotransformations in Pseudomonas, its
mechanisms of pathogenicity (in both humans and plants), and its use in the
exciting world of biotechnology. As research blossoms into new discoveries, we
will continue to enjoy this education and human development to further the cause
of science and technology worldwide as well as in the United States.
