Li 0211614 The goal of this project is to develop mathematical theory regarding
biodiversity in the context of resource competition. Recent numerical work
suggests that competition for multiple resources can generate periodic
oscillations or even chaotic oscillations, and a large number of species can
coexist on very few limiting resources. However, both mathematicians and
ecologists still lack analytic understanding of mechanisms that generate
diversity in ecological communities. The investigator studies several resource
competition models, including standard competition models with multiple
resources and competition models within food webs; he gives rigorous analysis
for the models and provides insight into diversity of competing species. Theory
of differential equations and theory of dynamical systems are used to determine
the long-term behavior of solutions of the models in the form of attracting
steady states, limiting cycles or strange attractors. Important issues are what
causes competing species to coexist, and locating parameter ranges in which
coexistence occurs. The question of the maintenance of species diversity in
natural systems has intrigued mathematicians and ecologists for a very long
time. This work provides a general understanding of factors affecting abundance
and biodiversity. The results have important implications for determining the
patterns of species composition in aquatic and terrestrial systems, and for
managing natural resources such as forests and lakes.
