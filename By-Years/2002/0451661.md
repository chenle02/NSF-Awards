Professor Paul Bohn of the University of Illinois is supported by the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry program to investigate potential gradients in nanometer-
scale polymer films containing metallic nanoparticles. The PI is building in-
plane potential gradients in acrylate-based polymers (hydrogels) to control the
chemical and physical properties of the gel. Interactions with analytes (such as
ligand binding)in a fluid medium are being studied. The proposal includes
surface plasmon resonance biosensing, electrochemistry, organic thin films,
interfacial polymerization, and versatile methods to alter and interrogate
surface properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Controlled analytical surfaces such as
these proposed could benefit areas such as chemical imaging, sensors and
separations, and lab-on-a-chip applications. There would also be applications in
biology, namely, the study of cellular adhesion and migration. High school
students involved in a summer program at Clark Atlanta University participate in
the research.
