This research addresses the integration of CAD and CAM through the automatic
generation of a manufacturing process plan from a 3-D CAD part description. The
objectives of this project are four-fold. First, a method will be developed to
define form-features important to manufacturing (such as holes, threads, etc.)
that enables automatic recognition of features from a CAD database. Second,
researchers will implement previously developed algorithms to separate joined
form-features in a part cavity and store their descriptions in a data structure
called a feature node. Third, the detailed structure of a feature node will be
defined according to the necessary information required to manufacture each
feature. These feature nodes will be linked into a larger global structure
called a feature graph. The links represent relationships among the features in
the part. Fourth, and most important, a method will be developed to
automatically generate a generative process plan for the part by traversing the
feature graph. This final step will involve interfacing an expert system for
process planning with a solid modeler to calculate optimal machining parameters
and machine tool sequencing. Evaluation of the software will be through
extensive testing with industry supplied part descriptions and comments from
industrial users.
