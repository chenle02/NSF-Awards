9318160 Gross The vast majority of ecological models applied to problems in
ecosystem analysis and management have relied on aggregative properties of
populations and communities. This award will take advantage of high performance
computing systems to analyze new models based upon interactions between many
individual organisms which comprise these populations and communities. These
individual-based models may be used to predict the dynamics of populations and
communities explicitly on a landscape, and thus provide a method to analyze the
effect of alternative spatially explicit management schemes on ecosystems.
Massively parallel machines offer the potential to deal with these analysis and
management problems, as well as taking account of the vast array of information
about individual organism difference that is ignored in more aggregated modeling
approaches. This award involved the development and comparison of alternative
methods to implement individual-based modes on several high performance
computing systems and the application of results obtained to several specific
problems of ecosystem analysis and management, in particular community-level
interactions between several species and explicit models of populations and
communities. This award is being jointly supported by programs in Ecology,
Ecosystems, Applied Mathematics, Computational Mathematics and Computational
Biology. ***
