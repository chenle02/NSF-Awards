This work in theoretical physics will address foundational problems in the
theory of relativistic strings. It will study space-time supersymmetric
nonlinear sigma models, a superspace formulation of space-time supersymmetry and
the possibility of new types of superspace structures related to integrable
self-dual Yangs-Mills theories.
