The PI will investigate several problems regarding the analysis and
classification of orthogonal polynomials to spectral-type differential
equations. The most general of these problems is the so-called BKS(N,M) problem
which seeks a classification of all ordinary differential equations of integer
order N, up to a real linear change of variable, that has a sequence of
polynomial eigenfunctions which are orthogonal with respect to a Sobolev
bilinear form involving the M-th derivative of functions. When M=0, this problem
is classical with key results due to Bochner and H. L. Krall. Recent progress by
Littlejohn, K. H. Kwon and D. W. Lee has been made on second-order equations in
the cases M=1 and M=2.

These problems in the theory of orthogonal polynomials and differential
equations are classical and have been an outstanding challenge to mathematical
analysis since 1929. Applications of these problems abound in many areas of
mathematics, applied mathematics, physics, and engineering. Indeed, the
classical second-order equations having orthogonal polynomial solutions are
important in many areas of applied mathematics and physics, including quantum
mechanics. Moreover, a complete solution to the BKS(N,M) problem will require an
indepth knowledge of distributions, difference equations, moment theory, Lie
algebras, complex analysis, and operator theory. The applications of the higher-
order examples look very promising. Indeed, each of the examples that we find
will have an impact on applied sampling and interpolation theory with
applications to engineering (theory of communication and signal processing).
Recent improvements in both theory and techniques, by mathematical colleagues
throughout the world, lend hope that these difficult problems will soon yield
global solutions.
