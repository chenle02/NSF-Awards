Representation theory is a branch of algebra studying symmetries, especially
symmetries of linear mathematical structures, using groups of invertible
matrices. On the other hand, algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract
algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, for solving geometric
problems about the sets of zeros of multivariable polynomials. The research
supported by this NSF award is at the crossroads of representation theory and
algebraic geometry, to use representation theory to solve geometric problems and
to use geometric methods to understand representation theory.

The research projects center on two main themes. In the first, the PI will
develop a theory of conformal blocks for general parahoric group schemes over
curves. The research will focus on Pappas-Rapoport conjecture, vanishing
conjecture and Verlinde formula for twisted conformal blocks. This will lead to
applications in orbifold conformal field theory and geometric Langlands program
for parahoric group schemes. For the second theme, the PI will develop
connections between the geometry of twisted affine Grassmannian and
representation theory. The geometry of affine Grassmannians can be related to
Kac-Moody theory, representation theory of reductive groups and their bases via
geometric Satake correspondence, and it also plays crucial role in symplectic
duality. The research along this direction will advance the role of twisted
affine Grassmannians in Kac-Moody theory, ramified geometric Satake, symplectic
duality, and a connection with Springer theory for symmetric spaces.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
