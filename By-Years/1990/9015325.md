Technical Narrative This U.S.-Nigerian collaborative research project involving
the University of Maryland and the University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria is in
the general area of climatology of atmospheric conditions. Project funding will
enable the co-investigator from the University of Ilorin to work for three
months time in the laboratory of Dr. Rachel Pinker at the University of
Maryland. The collaborative research will analyze data used to derive
information on the seasonal variation of sub-Saharan aerosol optical depths.
Additionally, the co-investigator will visit the NOAA Environmental Research
Laboratories in Boulder, Colorado in order to become acquainted with the World
Climate Research Program plans to establish global baseline radiation networks
for monitoring global climate change, and for validating satellite retrieval
methods. This project in aerosol climatology fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
and Nigeria to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
