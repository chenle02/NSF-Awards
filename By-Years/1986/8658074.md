The focus of this research project is object based systems, especially with
respect to support of design activities involving more than one person. Design
involves the manipulation and reliable storage of large amounts of data. Hence,
design systems require database support. However, compared with traditional
(i.e., business oriented) databases, design data is considerably more structured
and varied. More complex constraints of many kinds are imposed (physical laws,
legal requirements, organizational goals, consistency etc.). Such databases have
been called object oriented databases (emphasis on the variety of structure) and
knowledge databases (emphasis on constraints and reasoning). The approach taken
to supplying such databases is to merge object oriented programming language
concepts with database functionality to produce a smoothly integrated
language/database system. There are two main categories of problems: providing
functionality, and achieving sufficient performance. Past work on nested
transactions has been influential. Further understanding of object based systems
can have considerable impact.
