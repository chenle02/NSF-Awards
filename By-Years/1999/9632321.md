The Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) will develop a comprehensive after-school
program that be an extension of its "RiverGirls" four- week ecology-based summer
camp. The ASSETS Project will enable 24 to 48 of the girls who participated in
the RiverGirls Camp to engage in two, twelve-week after school program sequences
that will provide them with in-depth science contact, multiple experiences with
technology and tools, and opportunities to develop more positive relationships
with peers and role models who reflect their own cultural identities. A special
focus of the project includes incorporating participants' parents in an active
and fundamental way in their daughters; educational experience at the museum.
This involvement is designed to help parents provide increased support to their
daughters' in science and math education. The girls who complete the ASSETS
Project will be recruited into other science and math enrichment programs for
youth at the museum. Overall project and program design will be based on recent
resiliency research that has shown youth from any background who grow up with a
key combination of assets, including personal qualities, a supportive
environment, and acquired skills, will have a better chance to make the
transition to successful and productive adulthood.
