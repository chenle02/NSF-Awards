This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is designed to
develop a nonintrusive diode laser sensor for detecting oxygen in the headspace
of pharmaceutical vials. Many drugs are oxygen sensitive and must be bottled in
an oxygen free environment. There are no nonintrusive&lt;br/&gt;methods
available to measure residual oxygen levels in sealed product vials. A
nonintrusive sensor would generate large cost savings for pharmaceutical
manufacturers. During the Phase II project, a prototype off-line instrument will
be constructed. This instrument will be tested at pharmaceutical manufacturing
facilities. In addition if time permits, on-line experimental measurements will
be performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to being useful for the
pharmaceutical industry, this technology will be extendable to a variety of
packaged products in other industries. These industries include the food,
alcoholic beverage, and medical instrument markets. This technology can also be
used to detect&lt;br/&gt;other species in packaged products such as water vapor
or carbon dioxide.&lt;br/&gt;
