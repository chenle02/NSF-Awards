9507441 Heath White whales endure oxygen deficits, extreme cold and pressure,
and rapid changes in pressure when they perform repeated prolonged breathhold
dives to greater than 1800 feet. This study will examine how these factors
affect important body functions such heart beat, circulation and oxygen delivery
to tissues. Of particular interest are specific adaptations that allow the
whales to perform such dives repeatedly without incurring any harmful
physiological side-effects. ***
