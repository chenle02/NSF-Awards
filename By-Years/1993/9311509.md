9311509 Stephanopoulos This project is on research for modification of the
metabolic pathway in Corynebacterium glutamicum for the production of amino
acids of the aspartic acid family (lysine and threonine). Specifically, the
fluxes at the phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP), pyruvate (PYR), and aspartyl-
semialdehyde (ASA) junctions are to be redistributed to improve product yields,
the most critical component in the cost structure of amino acid manufacturing.
This will be accomplished by a program that will attempt enzyme deregulation,
amplification and synchronization at the PEP, PYR and ASA junctions, in addition
to fermentation studies that will exploit the improved cellular properties in
the design of an optimal bioreactor system. ***
