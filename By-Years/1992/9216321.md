This award is for the acquisition of a network testbed for the experimental
networking and distributed database research at the University of Southern
California. The primary research activities are concentrated in two main areas:
Network Control Protocols and Distributed Databases. The main feature that these
two diverse research areas share is a need to (1) solve problems involving
multiple nodes, (2) complement existing modeling, simulation, emulation, and
small scale implementations with multi-node prototypes, (3) isolate the
resulting network from the campus production network, and (4) employ a support
staff to maintain and operate the network. The study of distributed networks is
important because of the wide availability of inexpensive workstations that can
be easily linked together. Not so easy is how to utilize these networks
effectively. The study of network protocols is critical to this task as is the
study of distributed databases. This award supports both areas.
