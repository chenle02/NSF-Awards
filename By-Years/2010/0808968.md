The principal investigator will explore problems in the modular representation
theory and cohomology of the symmetric group and related objects, including
algebraic groups, Frobenius kernels, Schur algebras and superalgebras, and
Iwahori-Hecke algebras. The project includes using connections between the
representation theories of these different objects to obtain new results. The
ordinary representation theory of the symmetric group is closely related to that
of the general linear group through classical work of Schur and others. Recently
this relationship has been extended to the modular representation theory, and
even more recently to the corresponding cohomology. Although this interplay can
lead to new results in either direction, it is especially useful in studying the
symmetric group, where many of the basic problems remain completely open. The
investigator will continue to refine and improve techniques to exploit this
important relationship in order to obtain results in both areas. Recently
Parshall and Scott proved that the celebrated Lusztig conjecture, in the case of
the general linear group, is equivalent to a problem entirely in the realm of
symmetric group representation theory. Meanwhile breakthroughs by Brundan and
Kleshchev, Ariki, Grojnowski and others have led to a ``Lie-theoretic" approach
to the symmetric group theory which is very different from the original approach
of Gordon James and others. Together these developments suggest the next few
years will be very exciting indeed in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is in an area of mathematics known as representation theory, in
particular the representation theory of finite groups. Problems involving groups
and their representations arises naturally in many diverse fields, including
mathematical physics, chemistry, error correcting codes, cryptography and
others. In particular, ideas used by mathematical physicists have played an
important role in recent progress made in many of the areas described above.
