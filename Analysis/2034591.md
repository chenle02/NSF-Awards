This award will provide funds to organize the Prairie Analysis Seminar and
support its participants at the 2020 and 2021 editions of this annual meeting.
The Fall 2020 event will be held on November 13-14, 2020, at the Kansas State
University campus in Manhattan, Kansas; the Fall 2021 event will be hosted at
the University of Kansas campus in Lawrence, Kansas, on a date to be determined.
The Prairie Analysis Seminar is an ongoing joint project by the Mathematics
Departments at Kansas State University and The University of Kansas that has
been successful and nationally recognized since its inception in 2001. The
conference showcases a diverse group of outstanding mathematicians known for
their state-of-the-art research in analysis and partial differential equations;
it provides participants in early stages of their careers with the opportunity
to present their work through contributed talks, get advice from experts, expand
their professional networks and increase their chances of success in the job
market; it promotes the participation from historically underrepresented and
underserved groups in mathematics.

The Prairie Analysis Seminar features as invited speakers leading scholars well
known for their contributions to active areas of research in analysis and
partial differential equations and for their mastery to communicate with a broad
mathematical audience. As in previous meetings, an invited principal speaker
will give two one-hour lectures and will be accompanied by two invited speakers
who will each give a one-hour lecture. A main component of the seminar is the
time reserved for short talks by participants in early stages of their careers,
in particular, advanced Ph.D. students and postdocs. The conference will include
a session to discuss open problems suggested by the conference participants and
their connections to other areas of related work. The seminar can result in
cross-disciplinary activities and establish new directions in this regard since
analysis and partial differential equations have a long tradition of
applications in other academic fields and industry. The meeting will run for one
and a half days from Friday noon to Saturday afternoon. For more information
