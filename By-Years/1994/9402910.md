9402910 STRICKLER This research project will focus on the interaction between
small- scale turbulence and the spatial distribution of phytoplanktonic
particles. Preliminary results from Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of
incompressible, isotropic turbulence have shown that particles of a density
similar to that of algae develop non-random spatial distributions including
aggregates at peak number densities of 40 times the global mean value when
suspended in a simulated flow field. Laboratory tests to determine whether
actual algal particles in real turbulent flow form patches and whether they
behave as predicted from numerical simulations will be undertaken. A special
apparatus which creates reproducible grid-generated turbulent flow and which
allows for direct observation of suspended algal particles will be constructed
and calibrated. The effect of particle size, shape, buoyant density, and
inherent motility ("swimming" capacity) on particle spatial distributions will
be evaluated. Empirical data will be compared to DNS predictions derived from a
refined model. Results will provide pioneering insight into the role of small-
scale fluid dynamics in influencing phytoplankton spatial distributions: such
insight is essential for understanding the dynamics of resource acquisition by
algae and herbivore-algal interactions in oceans and the Great Lakes. ***
