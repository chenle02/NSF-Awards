The University of Utah is offering a two-year program which creates a
partnership with Washington Elementary School and the university's Institute for
the Theory and Application of Geometry to establish Washington Elementary as a
model for teacher-driven reform in elementary mathematics education. The project
includes an outreach component to satellite schools. The program includes two
four-week summer workshops on mathematics content, exemplary materials and
teaching methodologies, followed by implementation programs during the school
year. The university and the school district will provide a cost share of 22% of
the grant.
