This research continues and completes a three-dimensional numerical analysis for
ductile rupture and plasticity induced during crack growth. Finite element
calculations with very fine meshes will be made for cracks growing under large-
scale yielding. The results will be compared with near crack stress fields
generated during small-scale yielding. Specific cases of ductile fracture near
blunting crack tips and the growth of a plane strain crack in large-scale
yielding will be considered. The three-dimensional numerial analysis results
will provide significant new input to understand the mechanics of ductile crack
growth and will help to develop computer algorithms in metal forming such as for
drawing, rolling, and extrusion.
