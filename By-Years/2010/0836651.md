This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled NUE: Teaching Undergraduates Nanomanufacturing Engineering (TUNE), at
Louisiana Tech University under the direction of Dr. James Palmer, will produce
nanosystems engineering graduates with the critical thinking and mnaufacturing
skills necessary to meet the nation's workforce needs in nanotechnology. This
project will create a new junior level nanomanufacturing laboratory course that
focuses beyond fundamental nanofabrication techniques to consider the production
engineering aspects of nanomanufacturing through effective characterization of
the manufacturing process; integrate a focus on nanomanufacturing into capstone
senior projects; connect industry to Louisiana Tech's Nanosystems Engineering
degree program; and recruit future nanosystems engineering from underrepresented
groups in STEM.
