This proposal provides a research experience for ten undergraduates for an
eight week program during the summer. The subject matter for this program is
applied statistics. The students will participate directly in various projects
in the community. They will participate in gathering, entering, preparing and
analyzing the data. There will be extensive use of the computer. In other words
the student will get the full benefit of being in the role of a practicing
consulting field statistician. There also will be a background set of lectures
presented to the students. The following is a list of the projects the students
may be participating in: Parasite counts in grazing animals. Inventory sampling
procedure. Pheromone study in shuckworms. Physical fitness study. Single cell
protein additives. The student should benefit greatly from this "hands on"
experience. This proposal is being funded througn the Research Experiences for
Undergraduate program (REU) and represents a good example of the goals of the
program.
