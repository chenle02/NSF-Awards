9403365 Cruickshank The conference will investigate the use of ion beams in the
study of basic condensed matter physics phenomena (such as particle scattering)
and the potential for analytical applications (such as Rutherford backscattering
and proton induced x-ray emission). In addition, the conference will feature the
use of ion beams as tools for the modification of materials (such as sputtering
and implantation). The potential use of ion beams for tumor surgery and for
inducing other modifications in biological materials will also be examined. % %
