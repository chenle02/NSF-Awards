The principle investigator will continue his research on problems involving the
interaction between combinatorics and algebra. He will focus on two problems.
The first concerns new conjectures arising from the principle investigator's
application of Kazhdan-Lusztig theory to a problem on combinatorial immanants
which assert that certain Hecke algebra virtual characters are polynomials with
with non-negative, even unimodal, integer coefficients. A combinatorial approach
to these conjectures will be sought, along with combinatorial interpretations of
known non-negativity results in Kazhdan-Lusztig theory which now rest on
difficult geometric machinery. The second problem concerns the conjecture that
the Shur function expansion of Macdonald's symmetric functions are polynomials
with non-negative integer coefficients. This project is on the interface between
combinatorics and Lie algebra. The principle investigator is concerned with
certain polynomials which are combinatorially defined and have deep connections
with structures in geometry and representation theory. This work is important
both in mathematics and physics.
