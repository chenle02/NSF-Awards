This research will investigate the brain mechanisms that underlie reinforcement
and the amelioration of stress. These processes may depend upon the endogenous
opiate systems in specific brain regions. The successful completion of these
studies would provide fundamental knowledge on many aspects of human behavior,
including the ability to deal with stress, the behavior of neonatal humans
towards their mother, and the specific brain mechanisms that may underlie the
response to opiates.
