A prominent feature of nervous systems is their ability to change in response
to signals from the environment. This feature is even true within the brain,
where the local cellular environment can determine the development and
organization of several areas. It has been known for some years that activity in
the visual pathways during development of many animals can affect the
organization and response properties of cells in the visual system in the adult.
Little is known about the mechanisms through which visual activity might
modulate the properties of individual nerve cells, or neurons, in central areas.
This project uses the simple model system of the optic tectum, a part of the
midbrain in frogs, to see how interruption of activity in the visual pathway
affects the presence and action in the tectum of two neurotransmitter chemical
compounds. Electrophysiological, immunohistochemical and microscopic imaging
techniques are used to assay the physiological response and neurotransmitter
expression in the optic tectum, and to see whether changes are mediated by
specific components of the activity of the cells that form the optic nerve from
the eye to the brain. Results from this work will enhance our understanding of
how environmental input shapes the properties of brain areas that receive this
information. It will have an impact beyond visual neuroscience to developmental
neuroscience, developmental biology, and research in fields that deal with
information encoding and storage, and learning and memory.
