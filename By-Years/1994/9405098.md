9405098 Colvard Charge division detectors form am important class of detectors
for quantitative imaging of low-intensity electron, ion, or photon beams. A
common example is the resistive anode encoder (RAE), commonly used to create
composition images in secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). A significant
drawback of present RAD-type detectors is their limited maximun counting rate.
This research project proposes to significantly increase the speed of these
detectors by using a new electronic pulse processing approach and a novel
interconnection scheme to reduce their pulse-counting dead time by a factor of
ten. A Phase I study showed that it is possible to integrate the pulses and
perform the necessary processing on pulses separated by as little as 30 ns. this
Phase II research will study the incorporation of the fast pulse processing
design into a functioning RAE detector, including the analysis of pulse
propagation and ringing across voltage isolating connections. By pulling
everything together, the product of this research will be a functioning
prototype ultrafast position sensitive detector that can then be refined and
commercialized in Phase III. ***
