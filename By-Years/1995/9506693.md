9506693 Tucker This grant provides $120,000 for three years of partial
technician support for the University's Geochronology lab in the Department of
Earth & Planetary Sciences. The university has provided one year (Jan 94 - Jan
95) of support for a Ph.D.-level technical scientist (Dr. Yuri Amelin) and will
provide ca. 40% of the next three years of salary support. The technician will
have responsibility for quality control, maintenance procedures, supervision of
graduate students and visiting scientists and improving procedures at this lab
which was established with the acquisition of a state-of-the-art VG sector 54
Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer purchased in January, 1994 (EAR-9219862).
Although, the instrument has only recently attained its manufacturer's
specifications in terms of precision due to the need for replacement of the
original photomultiplier tube, the PI has carefully documented a large number of
analyses of standards, blanks and initial samples of accessory minerals for U-Pb
isotope series dating. The high-sensitivity, high-transmission instrument has
afforded this lab the ability to make ultra-high precision measurements of Pb
isotope ratios which, coupled with their class-100 clean room and careful
chemical preparation of samples has resulted in very low, total-procedure,
common-Pb blanks that ultimately translates into precise ( 3 Ma) dating
capabilities for small (as little as 2 g) samples of accessory phase minerals.
