The proposal explores how software designers and developers with can obtain
information about the power behavior of the software they are developing and
guide them toward designing and developing more energy efficient solutions. Very
little is understood today about what factors in software design/development
influence power consumption, and therefore this exploratory project will do
empirical studies to measure the power consumption of executing software and map
the power profiles to implementation and design properties of the software
applications. The research will measure power consumption of executing software
and map it to code sequences, then identify a set of program properties that are
correlated to specific power consumption behavior. While research on energy
sustainability has so far focused on the role of hardware design, compilation
techniques aimed at optimizing with respect to power consumption, and operating
systems, this exploratory project is aimed at understanding how the programming
the source code can be correlated to low-power implementations.
