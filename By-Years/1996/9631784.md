ABSTRACT This award supports the dissertation research of the co-principal
investigator. The research project will assess the influence of federal
institutions on congressional politics in Brazil where subnational politics play
an important role in national politics. This award will be used to construct a
database of electoral statistics at the national, state, and local levels in
Brazil. The study's central hypothesis is that, contrary to common expectation,
electoral multipartism is not a function of district magnitude and timing of
presidential elections but rather the concurrence between national and state
electoral cycles and the electoral formula for gubernatorial elections. By
establishing a theoretical comparison between these two models of party
competition that will be tested with empirical data, the research promises to
make a valuable contribution not just for area specialists but for the
comparative study of electoral systems. The research will promote an
understanding of federalism, the dynamics of executive-legislative relations in
presidential systems, and the influence of subnational actors on national
politics.
