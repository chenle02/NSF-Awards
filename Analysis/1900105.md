This award provides funding for participation in the conference "The Northeast
Analysis Network" that will be held at University of Connecticut in Fall 2019,
University of Rochester in Fall 2020, Syracuse University in Fall 2021, SUNY-
Albany in Fall 2022. The conferences focus on recent developments in Analysis,
in a broad spectrum of fields including harmonic analysis, dynamical systems,
geometric function theory, nonlinear partial differential equations, and
operator algebras. At each conference, there will be two magnet lectures by a
leader researcher, and many short talks by junior conference participants. The
organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to
target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be
