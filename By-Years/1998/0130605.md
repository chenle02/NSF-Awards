The American Evaluation Association (AEA) is the only National professional
association for evaluators in the U.S. and, as such, should speak for the
profession on National policy issues. However, AEA has never before provided
guidance to the broader community on public policy issues and therefore lacks
the procedures to do so. Having such a voice is particularly critical now with
the current debate of the Bush Administration's proposal to test all 4th and 8th
grade public school students in mathematics and reading. Because the testing
proposal deals specifically with actions that to be taken with regard to public
schools based on the outcomes of the tests, this is primarily an evaluation
issue and would benefit from an analysis by evaluators.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;AEA will create a process for developing a policy statement on the
Bush Administration testing issue and on three other issues to be selected later
that also address concerns of the mathematics and science community. The aim is
to establish an ongoing capability within the AEA organization to mobilize the
organization's resources to deal with policy questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
