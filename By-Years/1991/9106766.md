Communication and Control Systems have a common theoretical core which permeates
many applications. The Conference is devoted to this common theory, the
development of related methodologies and their multidisciplinary applications.
Applications will include aerospace systems, biomedicine and forestry, large-
scale electric-power networks. Special consideration of several of these topics
will be given to energy and environmental issues. Nonlinear control and related
communication aspects of adaptive electric power transmission with the western
grid (extending from British Columbia to Southern California) as a prime example
will be emphasized in several sessions. Here, the interaction of state tracking,
fault detection, rapid communication of information and adaptive control are
crucial to efficient, and safe transmission of energy over thousands of miles.
Nonlinear phenomena, nonstationary and/or non- Gaussian processes are common
complexities in the above applications. Hence, promising new methods of analysis
will be emphasized in both sessions on theory and methodology. Problems of
System Identification/Adaptive Control generally, which are essentially non-
linear will be considered.
