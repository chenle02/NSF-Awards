P.I.: CONOVER, DAVID Proposal #: 95- 30209 PROPOSAL ABSTRACT Genetic variation
and local adaptation may be responsible for many of the differences in somatic
growth noted among fishes and other organisms. Using a marine fish (the Atlantic
silverside Menidia menidia) as a model system, this project proposes to test
selective factors that affect the evolution of growth rate. Specifically,
experiments using laboratory stocks of silversides will compare: 1) the size-
dependency of reproductive output, growth, and survival at different
temperatures, 2) swimming performance and vulnerability to predation before and
immediately after consuming maximum rations; and 3) the variance in maximal and
compensatory growth. Additionally, bioenergetic models will be used to simulate
the effect on body size of transplanting genotypes across environments
