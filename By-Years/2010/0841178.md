PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0841178&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Syracuse
University&lt;br/&gt;NSF PROGRAM: PHY ? ELEMENTARY PARTICLE ACCEL
USER&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Stone,
Sheldon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Flavor Physics and CP Violation
2009&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flavor Physics and CP Violation (FPCP) conference
series has emerged as one of the leading meetings in the field. The first
meeting was in 2002 at the University of Pennsylvania and the conference has
been held annually since then. The venue is rotated every three years between
Asia, The Americas and Europe. The next meeting will be held May 27 - June 1 at
Lake Placid, NY and will be hosted by the Experimental Elementary Particles
group at Syracuse University. Funds are requested to help support the travel and
participation of about 4 young scientists, mainly graduate students, who would
participate in the meeting either by giving a talk or presenting a poster.
Additional funds are requested to aid in publishing the proceedings on-line for
free public access.&lt;br/&gt;
