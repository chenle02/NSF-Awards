This research will examine classified satellite images of Arctic sea-ice in
order to evaluate the temporal and spatial change in melt ponds in the sea-ice.
Sea-ice impacts the heat budget of polar areas by reflecting a large majority of
incoming solar radiation, hence reducing the effect of solar heating. As the
summer season progresses, melt ponds develop, absorb significantly more
sunlight, and increase the ice melt rate. Details of the development of melt
ponds can be obtained by direct examination of high-resolution visible satellite
images. The proposed research will utilize images from 4 areas of the Arctic and
3 summer seasons (1999-2001) and will evaluate the change in extent of melt
ponds and open water as the summer season progresses. The results will be
declassified and open to the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
