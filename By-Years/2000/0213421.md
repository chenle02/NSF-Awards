This study will use a combination of numerical and laboratory (analog) models to
investigate the dispersal and interaction between plume heads and the overlying
lithospheric plates upon which they impinge. Models will include the effects of
melting, on and off-axis cases, and the influence of ridge segmentation and
plate rheology on along-axis flow. Models include both 2D and 3D numerical
models and 3D scaled analog ones. The modeling will include both plume heads
(LIPs), and their more steady-state tails. In general, the experiments will
explore the thermal, compositional, and dynamic evolution of plume heads for a
range of conditions. More specific models will examine the case of the Ontong-
Java plateau system- the earth's largest known plume head. The modeling efforts
are part of a cycle of observations, theory, predictions, more observation which
is expected to lead to specific ODP drilling proposals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
