The investigator is working on the following two problems: (A) He is attempting
to describe integral models for Shimura varieties at primes of non-smooth
reduction. In particular, he studies ``local models"for PEL Shimura varieties
and tries to formulate exact predictions about the non-smooth reduction of a
general Shimura variety. The motivation is to obtain information that can be
used in the calculation of the Hasse-Weil zeta function of these varieties and
in other arithmetic applications. (B) He is studying the representations that
appear in the cohomology of arithmetic varieties with a group action. He will
continue his work on describing relations between invariants describing such
representations and L-functions and develop a theory of ``non-abelian" cubic
structures for the determinant of cohomology of general bundles over
curves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is research in the field of arithmetic
algebraic geometry, a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: the geometry of figures that can be defined by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials, and the study of numbers. This combination has
proved&lt;br/&gt;extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that
withstood generations (such as ``Fermat's last theorem"). The investigator's
work mainly concentrates on the study of specific polynomial equations that have
many symmetries. The general field has connections with physics, the
construction of error correcting codes and cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;
