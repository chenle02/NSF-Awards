Throughout the life cycle of a civil structure, its serviceability must be
assessed in a timely manner. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) strategies
measure structural response and aim to detect, locate, and assess damage
produced by severe loading events and environmental deterioration. At the
University of Houston, prototype piezoceramics-based smart aggregates (SA) have
been designed for concrete structures. Inherited from the property of a PZT, the
SA has the unique feature that it can function both as a sensor and an actuator.
As an actuator, an SA excites elastic stress waves to propagate through the
concrete structure, which can be detected by sensors. Distributed active sensing
exhibit different sensing and energy characteristics compared to passive sensing
and stand-alone active sensing systems. The goal of this project is the
development of a scalable framework and efficient algorithms for cooperative
active sensing in wireless SHM systems. The specific objectives are to i)
investigate coverage models for active sensing under realistic domain-specific
constraints; ii) develop a holistic energy-efficient solution to cooperative
active sensing and processing iii) develop, implement and evaluate distributed
active sensing solutions for SHMs using PZTs and off-the-shelf wireless
components. This work will generate broader impact by closing up the gap between
the practices of civil engineering and embedded sensor network community by
joining expertise of researchers in both areas to enhance the safety of civil
infrastructures of national interest. The interdisciplinary nature of this
research lends naturally to a combined engineering and science curriculum
development at both undergrad and graduate levels.
