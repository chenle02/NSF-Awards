This vertically integrated research project refocuses on Herlihy and Moss's
original proposal of HTM, but adopting the point of view that transactions,
rather than occurring infrequently in code, should be the rule, not the
exception. That is, user code should almost always be executing within some
transaction. The researchers contend that the transactions-everywhere approach
can simplify parallel programming dramatically and that hardware support can
make overheads negligible. To test their hypothesis, they plan to develop an
FPGA prototype processor and memory system for HTM, a linguistic framework for
C-like languages, compiler support for transactions everywhere, debuggers and
other software-engineering tools, theoretical foundations for semantics and
performance, and ultithreaded applications that demonstrate the advantages of a
transactions-everywhere environment. The proposed research will leverage
existing infrastructure already developed within the MIT Laboratory for Computer
Science. The FPGA prototype will contribute to a fast hardware-prototyping
facility being developed by several research groups within LCS. The linguistic
and compiler research will exploit the software technologies already developed
for Cilk, a multithreaded C language with a provably good runtime system.
Transactions everywhere potentially represents a big step towards making
parallel computing practical and ubiquitous. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
