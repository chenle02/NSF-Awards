With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at New York University will acquire a 400 MHz nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer and upgrade the console of an existing 500
MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out
studies on a) metal/ligand conformational dynamics and the mechanism of
inversion of an element of helical chirality upon oxidation/reduction in a
coordination complex; b) the preparation of libraries of vitamin B12
derivatives; c) the characterization of biologically active and theoretically
interesting fullerene adducts; and d) the impact of stereochemistry and DNA base
sequence on the conformational mobility of chemical adducts derived from the
binding of stereoisomeric benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxides to N2-guanine.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry
and medicinal chemistry, among others.
