Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) holds an international symposium on
"Clusters and Nanoassemblies: Physical and Biological Systems" in Richmond, VA,
on November 10-13, 2003. The symposium focuses on the unique properties of nano-
scale biological systems such as proteins, enzyme reactions, RNA, and DNA and
how their understanding can assist on the design of materials based on inorganic
nanoscale systems. The symposium also addresses the utilization of techniques
developed in the physical sciences to develop a fundamental understanding of
biological systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the fifth of a series of
international symposia around the general theme of clusters and atomically-
designed materials organized by VCU. The symposia have evolved to address
current topics each time. The general topic of this symposium, the exploration
of the interface between the physical and biological world at the nanoscale, is
very timely and it is anticipated to generate interest from a wide spectrum of
researchers in the physical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
