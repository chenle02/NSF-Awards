For studies of the solar atmosphere, microwave observations possess a unique
sensitivity to magnetic fields which frequently dominate the energetics of the
active solar corona. For studies of the flaring atmosphere, the shape and
parameterization of the spatially resolved microwave spectrum provide a powerful
diagnostic both of the ambient magnetic fields as well as of the electron
temperature, density and spectrum. This program of solar microwave spectroscopy
is funded in order to exploit this sensitivity for the study of solar flares and
the magnetic structure of active regions during the peak of activity in the
current solar cycle. The work will be based primarily on observations from the
frequency-agile interferometer at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, which
provides high spatial resolution observations at up to 86 frequencies from 1 to
18 GHz. This unique instrument is currently being upgraded so that its
combination of imaging and spectroscopy to more complex sources. The studies
conducted under this grant will benefit from and contribute to other facets of
the MAX'91 program which include soft and hard x-ray and gamma ray imaging as
well as other ground-based and balloon observations.//
