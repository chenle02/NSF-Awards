Many large experimental and observational facilities are deployed in diverse
research fields from physics and materials science, to the biological sciences
and geosciences, to astronomical science, ocean science, and engineering
research. Large facilities engage in the collection, management and public
distribution of massive scientific datasets that are expected remain be useful
even beyond the lifetimes of the facilities themselves; and provide shared
computational and analytic tools, as well as education and training related to
these activities. Facility users also want to compare the large scale data to
state-of-the-art simulations, which in turn can guide which future experiments
to perform. To support these scientific missions and users, large facilities
increasingly rely on national-scale cyberinfrastructure (CI), including high
performance computing, advanced data platforms and analysis and visualization
software infrastructure, and high-speed networking resources. There is
increasing need for synergy between facilities and advanced CI resources, as
emerging new technologies reshape the computational and data analysis
environment and change the way scientific discovery is conducted.

This project will support a two-day community workshop on Cyberinfrastructure
for Large Facilities. The purpose of the workshop is to bring the members of
both the facility and CI communities together, to consider the CI needs of
facilities, explore how large facilities can collaborate better with developers
of cyberinfrastructure to achieve their science missions and serve their users,
exchange best practices and novel CI solutions, and start a planning process can
lead to a sustainable resource and data ecosystem for large scale science that
can respond to new emerging scientific needs and CI technologies. Desired
outcomes also include inspiring new CI research and development activities that
accelerate discovery across large scale science, and improving the connectedness
of the national ecosystem of facilities and cyberinfrastructure in support of
scientific discovery. This project was co-funded by several NSF directorates.
