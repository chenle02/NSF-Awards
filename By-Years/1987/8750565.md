Under this project, four Lab-Volt Model 8085 Digital Communications Training
System will be used to upgrade the communication systems laboratory. Using this
equipment, the students will be able to perform experiments in the areas of
sampling, analog to digital conversion, spectral analysis of digital modulation
schemes, signal to noise ratio, and bit error analysis of digital transmission
systems and error correction code implementation. These experiments will enhance
the learning of students in the digital communications area.
