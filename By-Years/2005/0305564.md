This study provides new constraints on mantle flow and dynamics within the Izu-
Bonin subduction system through a combination of seismic observations and
numerical modeling experiments. Results of this work are providing key
information regarding mantle processes in convergent margins, including the
means of mantle magma transport and the geometry of strain partitioning between
tectonic plates and the sublithospheric mantle.&lt;br/&gt;In this coupled
approach, the following issues are being addressed specifically: 1) the 3-D
distribution of upper mantle anisotropy and its implications for strain
partitioning and mantle flow in the Izu-Bonin subduction zone; and 2) the
interpretation of seismic anisotropy results, particularly their relationship to
both mantle transport processes and the degree of coupling between tectonic
plates and sublithospheric mantle.&lt;br/&gt;The seismic component of the
project involves shear wave splitting analysis for a unique set of shear phases,
including local S, teleseismic SKS, and sS-S differential splitting. The Izu-
Bonin region is particularly well-suited for the proposed seismic studies, as
earthquakes generated in Izu-Bonin provide an excellent dataset of seismic
phases that sample a broad portion of the study area. The availability of
broadband waveforms of Izu-Bonin earthquakes have been recorded by many high-
resolution seismographs and allows constraint of both lateral variations and the
depth distribution of anisotropy for the Izu-Bonin system. &lt;br/&gt;The
numerical modeling component of the project involves calculation of 3-D models
of mantle flow for a range of physical model parameters. To determine the
relationship of mantle flow to the seismic anisotropy observations, flow models
are being used to calculate predicted anisotropy using appropriate elastic
parameter values from a range of deformation studies, and comparing the modeling
results with the seismic anisotropy results.
