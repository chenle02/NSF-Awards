Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0205336&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research pursues
the development of a network of robots with cameras and&lt;br/&gt;their optimal,
dynamic positioning for monitoring a cluttered scene, under different conditions
of visibility. The robots must discover their neighbors, localize
&lt;br/&gt;themselves with respect to their neighbors and integrate information
with that&lt;br/&gt;available from the other members of the team on the fly.
Further this information &lt;br/&gt;must allow a remotely located human operator
to immerse herself in the&lt;br/&gt;environment. The project addresses the
development of enabling algorithms and&lt;br/&gt;technology tailored to such
applications as fire-fighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
