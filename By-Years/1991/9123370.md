Divergent views of the probabilities of the same events are studied in this
grant. Concentrating on two historians of the Sacco- Vanzetti case with
different views, we study how each of them structures the evidence in the case.
We obtain from each of them their probabilities of each of the events of
interest. Using these results, their views can be compared quantitatively to
answer such questions as whether the divergence in opinions is due to differing
opinions about the importance of certain key evidence, whether certain evidence
is viewed identically by both, and whether other evidence, although viewed
differently, is considered irrelevant by both. The goal of the project is
explore how to compare divergent views of the same events, and to see how
successfully probabilities can be used to convey opinions about historical
events.
