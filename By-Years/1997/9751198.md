This project strengthens the curricular content of computer networking and
communications courses through the introduction of hands-on ATM and wireless
network programming to students. The Department of Mathematical Sciences and
School of Technology of two institutions are establishing two laboratories to
teach advanced computer networking. Traditional computer networking courses are
able to provide students with hands-on software development and network
performance experience with TCP/IP networks. This project furthers the expertise
of students by introducing next-generation networks. In particular, projects and
experiments based on gigabit ATM networks and wireless networks are being
introduced. This step enables the students to be well prepared for the upcoming
network technologies. These technologies are becoming more prevalent in the
industry. In addition, there are a number of interesting research issues that
still need to be addressed in these networks. The objective is to prepare the
students for both industry and advanced graduate research. Two different
approaches are being used to teach practical advanced networking concepts. At
one of the institutions, a project-based approach is being used. The students
focus on writing software applications using the ATM and wireless API. The other
is following an experiment-based approach in which each course typically
involves 2 hours of theory and 2 hours of laboratory work. The collaborative
venture benefits the students, who are exposed to both of these techniques. Two
different ATM switches are also being used to help students better understand
switch implementations.
