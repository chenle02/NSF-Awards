The objective of this work is to advance the capability of measurement
techniques towards the ultimate objective which is to: Measure the temperature
dependence of the elastic constants (and velocities) of high pressure phases of
mantle minerals in the temperature range of the lower mantle. The objectives of
this work are to 1) advance the temperature capability of elastic constant
measurements from 1800 K to 2000 K, 2) to decrease the size of the sample
measured to sub-millimeter size, 3) to measure iron-bearing minerals at these
high temperatures, and 4) to measure the thermal expansivity between 1500 K and
2000 K on a variety of mantle minerals. The methods employed will be to 1) use
old and new techniques of resonance ultrasound on small single crystals of
various shapes, and 2) to construct a laser interferometer capable of high
temperature dilametric measurement. The significance of this work, is that it
will allow a higher certainty of isolating the mineralogy of the earth's lower
mantle, and that it will greatly augment the thermodynamic database which will
be useful for geochemistry and mineralogy.
