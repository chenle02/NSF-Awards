A REU that would focus on the preparation and properties of electronic materials
is established. Students would be involved each year in both academic year and
summer research projects in the areas of semiconductor materials, optical
materials, and electronic ceramics. The common focus of all the projects will be
the development and understanding of materials with electrical or optical
properties that are important for applications. Specific research projects
include: (1) crystallization of amorphous ceramics, (2) infrared transmitting
glass fibers, (3) mapping of epitaxial semiconductor materials, (4) synthesis
and optical properties of doped sol-gel materials, (5) crystal growth of high
conductivity oxides, optically active dyes-in-ceramic composites, and
characterization of conducting polymers. Students for the academic year part of
the program will be selected from a variety of undergraduate programs, including
materials science, electrical engineering and chemistry. These students will
receive academic year support for research activities and then be encouraged to
continue as participants in on-going projects during the summer. Students for
the summer part of the program will be recruited from a variety of high quality
undergraduate institutions, such as Harvey Mudd and the Pomona Colleges, which
are not able to provide a graduate-level research environment. A summer seminar
series will be conducted in which students can present their work and interact
professionally with graduate students and faculty in a research environment.
Several of the students will be selected each year to present their work at
national meetings.
