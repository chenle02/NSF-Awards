9402462 Gorringe Fundamental properties of the electro-weak interaction will be
measured via the muon-nucleon capture reaction. Specifically, coupling constants
for the various components of the interaction in nuclear systems are not known
well enough to constrain theory. In addition, medium effects may alter the
strong interaction correction to the elemental interaction via meson exchange
currents, isobar excitations, and nucleon structure. Correspondingly, muon
capture measurements will be carried out in hydrogen and in complex nuclei, as
well as needed ancillary experiments. This work will be done at the TRIUMF lab
in Canada. ***
