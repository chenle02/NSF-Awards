This is a project supported by an award from the Chemistry Office of Special
Projects under the aegis of the Chemistry of Life Processes Initiative. The
fundamental goal is to understand the bioinorganic mechanisms for electron
transport in heme proteins and their role in the metabolism of trace metals by
cells. Several heme proteins including hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochrome c and
b5 are effective reductants for complexes of Fe(III) and Cu(II). Electrons can
be transferred from the heme Fe(II) to the metal complex over distances as great
as 20 A by an outer sphere electron transfer mechanism. The questions addressed
in this research are: 1) What kinetic parameters regulate and control the
electron transfer? 2) What mechanisms are operating in the non-specific outer
sphere electron transport at the heme edge and in site-specific binding of the
metal complex prior to electron transfer? 3) What are the physical-chemical
characteristics of low molecular weight complexes of Fe(III) and Cu(II) that may
be of biochemical significance?
