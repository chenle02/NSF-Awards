Volvox carteri is a potentially powerful model for analyzing the genetic control
of cellular differentiation and morphogenesis. Each individual contains two
entirely different cell types that exhibit a complete division of labor between
vegetative and reproductive functions, and that are arranged in a highly regular
pattern within a simple spheroid. Because the organism is haploid and reproduces
rapidly in the asexual cycle, individuals possessing mutations affecting key
developmental processes are readily isolated, and grown into large, genetically
homogeneous populations. But because the organism can be switched from asexual
to sexual reproduction at will, formal genetic analysis is also possible. Our
objective is to make the genetic linkage map of Volvox more useful for future
developmental- and molecular-genetic studies, by extending it to include
additional drug-resistance markers, restriction fragment length polymorphisms
and rearrangement breakpoints. And, as a major step toward elucidating the
genetic programs that regulate differentiation of reproductive cells, we will
attempt to identify and map all of the loci at which mutations either result in
a breakdown of the division of labor between somatic and reproductive cells, or
result in constitutive sexual reproduction. Volvox bridges the gap between
single-celled chlamydomonas, and multicellular higher plants. Therefore, basic
studies of Volvox are important in evolutionary and developmental studies.***//
