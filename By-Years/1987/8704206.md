Molecular Biology of Thylakoid Proteins of Photosynthesis: In this research Dr.
Pakrasi will use a cyanobacterium as a model prokaryotic organism to carry out a
molecular genetic approach to the elucidation of the function of cytochrome
b-559 in photosynthesis. This organism has a very efficient DNA-mediated
transformation system as well as thylakoid membranes similar to those of higher
green plants. Understanding the function of cytochrome b-559 will give insights
into the change transfer and electron transport properties of photosystem II.
This membrane protein complex is directly involved in the evolution of oxygen by
higher plants and is the herbicides. The results of this research may lead to
agronomic benefits in cost effective and environmentally acceptable herbicide
development.
