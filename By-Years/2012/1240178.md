Igbo is a language spoken by twenty million people, mostly in southern Nigeria.
This EAGER project makes use of a corpus of spoken Igbo, which will cover all of
the dialects of the language. The corpus is to be used for explorations in which
statistical machine learning (ML) programs are created to learn an "inter-Igbo''
consisting cognate sets (Igbo words pronounced differently in different
locations but having the same meaning) that enable the corpus to be treated as
if it were spoken as a single language, even though the dialects are, at extreme
ends of the Igbo homeland, mutually unintelligible. Another aspect of our work
is the extension of the existing corpus to fill in gaps in dialect coverage
where there currently are recordings from locations that have no near
geographical neighbors. The need for this stems from the fact that the closer a
dialect's neighbors the more similar they are, and the easier for programs to
locate words which differ systematically.

Achieving goals of this exploratory project is of considerable interest for
computational linguistics. As opposed to language change over time, there is
little computational work on language change over geography, and finding the
appropriate ML models for the latter aspect of language variation is a
considerable challenge.
