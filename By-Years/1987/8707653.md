Flow visualization, hot-wire anemometry and laser-doppler velocimetry (LDV) are
used in a low-turbulence wind tunnel to study experimentally the flow downstream
of a two-dimensional "momentumless" body. This flow is characteristic of the
wakes of self-propelled bodies (such as aircraft or torpedoes) moving at
constant velocity. The unique property of this flow field which distinguishes it
from jets, wakes, and mixing layers is the very rapid decay of turbulent
structures due to lack of production of turbulent energy downstream of the body.
Smoke-wire flow visualization techniques will be employed to qualitatively
identify the geometry and scale of turbulent structures produced at the body. In
addition, the streamwise decay of these structures will be studied by moving the
smoke-wire assembly downstream. Three-dimensional aspects of the flow will be
studied as well. Hot-wire and LDV measurements will be used to obtain
quantitative descriptions of the flow field, such as Reynold's stresses,
velocity fluctuation frequencies, and energy spectra.
