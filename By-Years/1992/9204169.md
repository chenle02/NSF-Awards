A research program to obtain a more detailed understanding of charge-density-
wave (CDW) phenomena and to exploit the long- recognized potential of CDW
systems as models for nonlinear many degrees-of-freedom dynamics is proposed.
The projects to be investigated include: CDW phase slip at electrical contacts,
including the effects of strains required for phase slip; the effects of
impurities on vortex nucleation and growth; the dynamics of CDW shear; the
exploration of the analogies with other stick- slip processes; the thermal CDW
depinning and analogies with thermally-assisted flux flow; the direct imaging of
CDW structure and motion by transmission electron microscopy (TEM); and the
finite-size effects in CDW dynamics.
