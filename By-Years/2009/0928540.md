The goal of this research is to understand and control the mechanical properties
of the cytoskeletal filament called microtubules. Microtubules are nano-scale
filaments, and the mechanical properties have ramifications for the shape of
cells, cell division, and cell motility. Understanding how the mechanics of
single microtubules is controlled is essential for creating an accurate
quantitative and predictive model to relate the strength of single microtubules
to the strength of the entire cytoskeletal network. This work will
systematically measure and model how lattice defects, associated proteins, and
post-translational modifications can affect microtubule rigidity. This work
represents the first systematic study of how the microtubule lattice can
directly affect the mechanics of single microtubules.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
approach will reveal new information about how the structure of microtubules can
affect its mechanics. The results will have an impact on basic cell biology,
since microtubules are essential for many cellular processes. Moreover,
microtubules are an entropically-driven, self-assembled system made from
identical protein subunits. Elucidating how mechanical properties of this system
can be altered by lattice defects, external binding partners, and modifications
to the subunits will have ramifications for other self-assembled condensed
matter systems made of colloids, polymers, and proteins. Microtubules and their
related proteins can be harnessed as a biological-scaffold for nano-scale
assemblies. This work will enable bio-engineering of novel bio-memetic materials
from the microtubule-cytoskeletal system. Determining the mechanical properties
of the individual microtubule structure is essential for future engineering
processes that may involve them. The research proposed here is truly
interdisiciplinary, combining the fields of condensed matter physics, bio-
engineering, materials science, and cell biology.&lt;br/&gt;
