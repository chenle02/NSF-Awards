This award supports the development of a computerized database and network of
the microbial germplasm collections, "the Microbial Germplasm Database", that
are utilized in research related to plant biology. The Microbial Germplasm
Database will contain information concerning living culture collections of plant
associated microbes and viruses, that are located all over the world. These
collections are valuable resources for the research community, however, are not
efficiently utilized because they are not catalogued or quantified for easy
access. The Microbial Germplasm Database will provide the research community
with a centralized information center where all plant-associated microbes
collections will be described with an easy on-line access. This database will be
linked to other databases of similar nature, such as the World Data Center at
Riken, Japan.
