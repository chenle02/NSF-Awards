It is becoming widespread practice for software applications to be shipped in
the form of a virtual instruction set (i.e,. as "virtual code") and translated
to the instruction set of a physical computer ("machine code") after shipping,
e.g., when downloading an app to an iPhone or just before execution for code
embedded in many Web pages. Increasingly the LLVM virtual instruction set
(developed by the principal investigator under prior NSF funding) is being used
by various industries. A serious problem with this model is that application
developers are unable to test the final computer code that is generated for
their applications: they are only able to test the virtual
code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing new techniques that allow
application developers to have much higher confidence in the final code for
applications that ship as virtual code. The basic approach, called "translation
validation," allows the translation process from virtual to machine code to also
generate a formal proof that the machine code preserves all the correct
behaviors of the virtual code, and does not introduce any unexpected incorrect
behaviors. Unlike existing work on translation validation, this work can
generate proofs for translation between two very different languages, as well as
formal guarantees in the presence of possible incorrect behaviors in the virtual
code. Besides these reliability benefits, the strategy also improves the
security of software because virtual code is widely used today as a means to
enforce security requirements of important systems, e.g., Web browsers,
operating systems, and database systems. Such systems rely on correct
translations of virtual code to machine code to enforce security, and formally
verified translations will prevent security vulnerabilities that might otherwise
be introduced by bugs in complex (and so, inherently bug-prone) translators.
