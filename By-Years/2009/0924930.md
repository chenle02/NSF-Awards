This project funded by the Science, Technology &amp; Society Program explores
how foresters and botanists in British colonies around the Indian Ocean rim
attempted to coordinate scientific forestry policies, introduce and grow similar
trees, and, ultimately, create a new ecosystem spanning the entire Ocean rim.
During this period, foresters and botanists planted millions of teak, rubber,
pine, eucalyptus, palm, sisal, cinchona, and gutta percha trees in cities,
plantations, and the countryside of colonies along the Indian Ocean rim. This
period corresponds to the creation and then fragmentation of an Indian Ocean
network of foresters, beginning with the founding of the Indian Forest Service
in 1864 and ending with the decolonization of British East Africa in the early
1960s. Using state forestry records, private papers, environmental science, and
maps in the United Kingdom and Australia, this dissertation critiques the
assumptions of Alfred Crosby and Jared Diamond that the success of Old World
plants in Australasia was ecologically predetermined. This dissertation attempts
to find how scientists throughout the Indian Ocean socially constructed much of
the landscape that we consider today as "natural."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
comparative historical assessment of long-term tree flows and forestry policies
helps academics, environmental policy makers, and scientists to more
comprehensively think about the existing forests -- especially those in the
Indian Ocean -- in terms of being a constantly changing and constructed
ecosystem. It also offers possibilities for constructing models of the changing
ecosystems in the Indian Ocean, leading to more effective protection and
conservation schemes.
