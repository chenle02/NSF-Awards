The investigators propose a magnetotelluric (MT) experiment in the back arc
Andean region where the subducted Nazca plate flattens out before it descends
steeply under Argentina. The experiment is designed to distinguish whether a low
electrical resistivity zone reflects either partially melted asthenosphere or a
global increase in solid state conductivity through the transition zone. The
study will also test whether a basaltic volcanic province with geochemistry
similar to Ocean Island Basalts (OIB) found just south of the Nazca flat slab
are a surface manifestation of the process generating melting associated with
the plate subduction. Broader impacts include international collaboration and
education with Argentine colleagues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
