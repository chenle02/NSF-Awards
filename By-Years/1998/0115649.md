&lt;br/&gt;The researchers propose to scale up a study they previously conducted
in which they examined the backgrounds of college science students taking
introductory science courses for predictors of performance, while controlling
for demographic differences. They looked at 1,933 students at 19 colleges and
universities in physics using epidemiological research methods. They plan to
expand the study to 24,000 college students to examine the connection between
the instructional decisions made by their high school physics, chemistry, and
biology teachers and success in college science classes.&lt;br/&gt;
