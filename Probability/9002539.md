The principal investigator will conduct research in two areas of probability
theory: coupling and gradient estimates, conditional Brownian motion. One goal
of the first area is to give a new probabilistic approach to partial
differential theory. The principal investigator will use coupling arguments to
compare two or more stochastic averages for processes with differing initial
distributions. He will use tools from differential geometry. The second area
involves answering question in potential theory using probabilistic arguments.
