This RUI grant is to Professor John Filaseta, Northern Kentucky University. It
supports research on hadronic and photonic production of heavy quark states.
Filaseta will work on Fermilab experiments E400 (data analysis) and E687 (data
taking and analysis). He will provide opportunities for undergraduates to
participate, both in data analysis and in data-taking at Fermilab. The
experiments continue the study of the various possible production mechanisms of
heavy quark states, within the framework of QCD. These kinds of experiments
examine the way specific types of particles are produced. The information
obtained will increase our knowledge of the way several constituents of matter,
quarks and gluons, interact to form elementary particles and atomic nuclei.
