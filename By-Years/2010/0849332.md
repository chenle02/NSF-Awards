Game theory uses the tools of formal logic and mathematics to understand
strategic situations, analyze decision options, and predict outcomes. Game
theory is widely used in economics and related disciplines, because many
economic decisions involve strategic reasoning. This award funds the continued
efforts of the Center for Game Theory in Economics to bring together U.S.
students and researchers with the best scholars from around the world to
stimulate and disseminate new research. The Center sponsors a series of summer
workshops with topics from evolutionary biology to bounded rationality to
adaptive learning. The workshops and the annual research conference bring
together game theorists, economists, biologists, computer scientists, and
applied mathematicians. Over half of the attendees are young scholars.
