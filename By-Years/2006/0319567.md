This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to design,
fabricate and test a novel Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCOS) color display system
that includes improved integrated pixel driver backplane integrated into a low
cost, projection TV light engine. This LCOS display system will have excellent
picture quality, high manufacturing yield potential and exceed all quality
benchmarks of business projection displays from size, weight, manufacturing cost
and brightness and will reduce the need for high speed CMOS technology thus
reducing IC manufacturing costs. The LCOS development includes design of a full
custom, mixed signal integrated circuit (IC), LED sourced light engine and
mechanical sub-assembly. The IC will contain novel pixel circuits that remove
charge sharing noise and expand charge storage memory increasing display
brightness and contrast ratio. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Phase I objective is
to prototype and demonstrate LCOS display technology positioning STI to
penetrate 10% of current $5.2B business display market with an OEM display parts
kit during the Phase II grant period. This display market includes business
multimedia projectors and HDTV project displays, which is expected to grow to
$20 billion by 2007. &lt;br/&gt;
