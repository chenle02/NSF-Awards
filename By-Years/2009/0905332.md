Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
OISE-0905332&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Ravi
Sankar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of South
Florida&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: US-Korea Planning Visits: Cross-layer
wireless sensor network technologies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed planning visit will support the PI and two graduate students from the
University of South Florida (USF) to travel to Kunsan National University in
South Korea, for the purposes of establishing a strong, long standing research
collaboration that will result in joint projects and proposals to the Korean
Research Foundation and the US NSF for global research initiatives. NSF funds
will support two visits by the USF research team. KRF will fund the Korean team.
The goals are to explore 1) the potential for hosting an international workshop
on global sensor networks and 2) the possibility of establishing an
international REU site in conjunction with the current REU program at USF.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits &lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on
developing a universal cross-layer wireless sensor network technology, a
research area with expansive potential impact in applications. The potential of
this activity has been recognized by the Korea Research Foundation which has
provided significant research support as well as travel funding to the Korean
partners. The collaboration will be strengthened with the availability of
experimental test bed on sensor networks from Korean
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The project will
broaden the education and research training of underrepresented students who are
currently participants in the Florida Georgia Lous Stokes Alliance for Minority
Participation program, within the USF College of Engineering REU.
