9504513 Ioffe Abstract The research is devoted to a study of various limit
phenomena which arise in a statistical mechanical context or are closely related
to it. More specifically, the investigator works - partly in a collaboration
with other researchers - on questions concerning the structure of limit theorems
in the phase transition regime as well as on applications of ideas reminiscent
of the concept of complete analyticity to a general probabilistic setting such
as, for example, to the theory of Markov chains or to the theory of random
fields. Principal mathematical issues addressed in this research include further
investigation of the two dimensional Ising model in the whole of the phase
transition region, analysis of Ornstein-Zernike behavior of two-and-higher
dimensional correlations and related shape and fluctuation theorems, analysis of
limit phenomena for almost Markovian random fields and justification of the
Wulff construction in various two and three dimensional models (e.g. SOS, Ising
and continuous spin Ising, percolation etc.), based on sharp subvolume order
large deviation results. Long term objectives of this research are twofold. On
the one hand, powerful ideas and methods developed over the past decade in
mathematical statistical mechanics--such as, for example, the method of polymer
expansions, the concept of complete analyticity and the method of induction in
volume--may provide both useful insights and approaches to various limit
problems in probability and stochastic processes. On the other hand, most of the
problems addressed in this research emerge from physical and material science
theories of a rigorous reconstruction of thermodynamical and kinetic properties
of matter directly from microscopic considerations. Thus, a successful
investigation is ultimately aimed at a better understanding of such issues as,
for example, equilibrium structure and stability of crystals and dynamics of
surface growth.
