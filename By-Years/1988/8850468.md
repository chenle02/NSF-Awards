Reaching for Excellence in the Elementary Science Program will initiate Summer
Institutes which will provide intensive study of science for teams of 40
teachers and 20 principals from 14 school systems in Upper East Tennessee. The
six-week institutes in this thirty month program will be conducted by visiting
scientists and science educators as well as faculty from East Tennessee State
University. After a renewal of teacher's expertise in elementary school science
content and methodology teachers will be expected to acquire the ability to
organize and conduct workshops across the region and workshop across the region
and work with peer teachers in their home schools. An amount equivalent to 29
percent of the NSF award is being contributed as cost-sharing.
