Engineering - Materials Science and Engineering (57)&lt;br/&gt;The majority of
students who are learning about materials in undergraduate courses do so without
the benefit of a hands-on laboratory. Through this project, a computer game is
being developed to integrate an open-ended approach to a laboratory experience
where students can apply their lecture-based knowledge. The Gaming for Applied
Materials Engineering (GAME) software includes reporting, interaction, and
simulated hands-on experience. GAME incorporates experimental roadblocks into
the software that are similar to those that would normally be encountered during
a real lab experience. Group interactions are also being promoted through the
generation of student group posters that are uploaded into a special gallery
within the game. The students are assisted and queried through the game by the
"Super-Tech" lab technician. Safety and lab protocols are an integral part of
the game system. Student learning and motivation are being rigorously assessed
throughout the project.
