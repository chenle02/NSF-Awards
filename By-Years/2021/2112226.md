The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the uptime of automated guided
vehicles (AGVs) and similar robotic systems to nearly one hundred percent at
factories and fulfillment centers to further improve productivity and reduce
overhead costs. These systems currently experience downtime when they need to be
recharged off the assembly, production, or delivery route. The proposed
technology develops a distributed wireless charging network that can charge AGVs
and similar robotic systems dynamically or while they are in
use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will further the development of switching amplifiers to operate over
wide reflected impedance ranges with high intrinsic quality antennas, and the
developmet of receiver systems that handle dynamic power ranges. The project
will also establish the first distributed network of wireless charging
transmitters and nodes programmed and monitored collectively as a single
functional unit to maintain the battery capacity of an AGV. The anticipated
technical results of this Phase I project are to develop a distributed wireless
charging network with multiple transmitters and nodes for AGVs along a test
track such that it starts and ends with the same battery capacity after every
full lap around the track, verifying the technical viability of the system in
the marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
