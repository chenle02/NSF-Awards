This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
the work of Dr. Clifford Kubiak of the Chemistry Department, Purdue University,
on reduction of carbon dioxide. Organometallic cluster compounds containing
three nickel atoms and bridging bis(diphenylphosphino)methane bridging groups
have been found to act as photocatalysts for the addition of carbon dioxide to
alkenes, and as electrocatalysts for the reduction of carbon dioxide to oxalate.
These, as well as newly synthesized, photocatalytic and electrocatalytic systems
will be investigated using low temperature photochemistry in matrices, kinetics
by laser transient absorption methods, infrared spectroelectrochemistry, and
rapid scan voltammetry. Another goal of the project is to elucidate the role of
electronic coupling between interconnected metal clusters, and new cluster
assemblies in which ligand bond length and electronic properties are
systematically varied will be prepared. This research is focused on reactions of
carbon dioxide with transition metal complexes. Chemical, photochemical, and
electrochemical means will be employed to promote the reduction of carbon
dioxide, including reactions in which carbon from this source is bonded to other
carbon atoms to form longer carbon chains. These studies are relevant to the
problem of finding good uses for carbon dioxide that might be obtained from an
atmospheric oversupply.
