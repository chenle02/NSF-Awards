Stevens 9623451 The Summer Grants Program of the Council on Undergraduate
Research offers fellowships to student/faculty teams to conduct 10-week research
projects at their home institutions. This program helps to remedy a problem
faced by students and faculty in which the institution cannot sustain an REU-
Site and the student cannot reasonably travel to an REU-Site to participate in a
research program. Increases in resources available to CUR have slowed, creating
particularly acute funding limitations in the Geosciences. Among proposals in
1995, only 20% were funded, while at least three others would have been had the
resources been available. This award will provide base funding for CUR-GEO,
including sufficient funds to support three fellowships each year for three
years. In addition, NSF will match non-federal dollars raised by CUR up to the
cost of three additional fellowships. The matching funds are intended to
encourage additional contributions to CUR-GEO. The fellowship recipients will be
selected by CUR through its established mechanisms. Results will be presented in
CUR-sponsored poster sessions at regional meetings of the Geological Society of
America.
