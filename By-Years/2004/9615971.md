Environmentally Conscious Design and Manufacturing (ECDM'96) to be held in
Cleveland, Ohio from July 23 through July 26, 1996. This conference is organized
to have national and international representatives from academia, industry,
government, and trade associations to discuss key issues in environmentally
conscious design and manufacturing. Two important issues will be addressed: (1.)
progress of science and engineering in environmentally conscious design and
manufacturing, and (2.) integration of research and education in environmentally
conscious design and manufacturing. The main purpose of the conference is to
disseminate fundamental research information on environmentally conscious design
and manufacturing to the manufacturing industries and academe. The PI and his
colleagues have organized the ECMD in the past three years, and the feedback
from participants was well received. The PI has a well-organized plan and
meeting agenda for the conference. The invited speakers and attendees are wee-
respected leaders from industry and academic institutions. A proceeding will be
