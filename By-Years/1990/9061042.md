Energy density in proton-exchange-membrane unltracapacitors can be improved by
increasing the dispersion of electrocatalytic particulates in the electrodes.
Electrochemical ultracapacitors store energy by utilizing double-layer and
surface redox processes. The key objectives of this project is the preparation
of highly dispersed ruthenium oxide on carbon. This material will then be
characterized and incorporated into a prototype ultracapacitor using a
commercial ionomer membrane. Possible applications of high-energy-density
electrochemical ultracapacitors include electric vehicles, pulse-power space
applications, power conditioning, and computer memory backups.
