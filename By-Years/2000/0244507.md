The proposed research covers the fields of Cosmic Ray Physics, Black Hole
Physics and Cosmology. The arrival and detection at Earth of cosmic rays with
energies above 1018 eV will afford researchers an outstanding opportunity to
study high energy physics in a new regime. New detectors such as HiRes and Auger
and OWL will allow one to study physics at ultra- high energy. The PI proposes
to use cosmic ray data that will soon be available to see if TeV scale gravity
is a viable theory. These extra dimensional theories lead to enhanced rates for
quasi horizontal showers as well as predictions for black hole production at the
LHC. If such effects are seen, the PI intends to extract information about the
extra dimensions, as well as the Hawking temperature from the data. The degree
of correlation of the cosmic ray directions with candidate sources will reveal
information about the intergalactic magnetic field and thus constrain the
physics of the early universe. The PI also intends to study whether recent
observations of line shifts in the quasar absorption spectra are due to possible
time variation of the fine structure constant a.
