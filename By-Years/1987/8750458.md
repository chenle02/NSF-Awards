Three high performance liquid chromatographs (HPLCs), a Biological Oxygen
Monitor (BOM), and a DNA filter elution system (spectrofluorometers and
peristaltic pumps), recently acquired by the Chemistry Department at Eastern
Michigan University, provide undergraduate students with opportunities to
utilize cellular and biochemical technology to study the interactions between
chemicals and living systems. HPLC is being used to study the formation of
metabolites and identify molecular adducts resulting from exposure to toxic
chemicals. The DNA filter elution system allows students to examine changes in
DNA integrity introduced by exposure to chemical carcinogens and mutagens. The
BOM is being used in the study of sub-cellular reactions to toxic chemicals. In
particular, activities are directed toward the developing field of toxicology,
with a focus on understanding basic biochemical and cellular phenomena as well
as determining the hazards associated with exposure to toxic levels of
chemicals.
