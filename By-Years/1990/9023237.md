With a Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers from the National
Science Foundation, Dr. Gail Mandel will continue to investigate the basis of
regulated expression of sodium channel genes in the nervous system. Presently,
Dr. Mandel is focusing on the molecular events leading to the first appearance
of sodium channels in the developing embryonic nervous system. This examination
will determine whether cell-cell interactions are critical for the initial
activation of sodium channel gene expression and, if so, how signals are
transmitted to the nucleus. The importance of molecular studies on channel genes
may extend to other genes involved in commitment to the neuronal pathway, having
a major impact on the field of molecular neurobiology in general and the
understanding of ion channel regulation in particular.
