This planning grant to the University of New Haven seeks to restructure the
undergraduate engineering education program. The goal of the School of
Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) at the University of New Haven (UNH) is
to transform its engineering programs to educate students who will better meet
the needs of industry and society. The focus of the curriculum reform efforts is
to foster interdepartmental cooperation and introduce innovative approaches to
our faculty and students, while keeping up with industry demands. The challenge
for the faculty is to develop the desirable new attributes while preserving the
essential content and best features of the traditional programs. This can be
done by coordinating the development of essential skills early in the programs
in parallel with a spiral approach for building fundamental engineering
concepts. By using active and cooperative learning methods and continuous
assessment of new pedagogical techniques, the proposed spiral approach will
allow for a more efficient process of developing conceptual understanding.
Constant feedback on teaching will lead to continual improvement.
