The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that this
technology will strongly impact the commercial production, distribution and
retailing of a number of food products which have frequently been impacted due
to contamination by food-borne pathogens, causing various diseases and
illnesses. In recent years, consumer foods in high demand such as eggs, oyster,
avocado, tomatoes, melons, and berries have been subject to expensive and
wasteful recall. This technology will bring about a significant reduction in the
numbers of recalls for various foods and also help in ensuring food safety and
security of various food products and produces.

This I-Corps project will further develop a microwave assisted pasteurization
process that advances the use of microwaves to solve food safety problems. Due
to their rich nutritive value and high-water activity, shell eggs, oysters and
fresh produce are potential hosts and carriers of pathogenic microorganisms like
Salmonella species. Heat pasteurization is the best solution for controlling
these pathogens but affects the vital functional properties due to biochemical
changes. Therefore, microwave heating was considered for pasteurization.
Products like shell eggs are ideal candidates for this volumetric heating
technology as the pasteurization process requires a higher temperature in the
yolk and a lower temperature in the white. This microwave pasteurization process
renders pathogens undetectable without affecting raw food characteristics
significantly. Based on the optimal parameters obtained by simulations, non-
linear slotted waveguide applicators for heating food products were designed and
a prototype was built. The applicator consisted of a standard waveguide with an
array of non-linear slots. The process parameters for different food products
were optimized and found suitable for industrial application.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
