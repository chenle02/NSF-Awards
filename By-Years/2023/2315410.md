This project requests support for doctoral students to attend the IEEE
International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI2023) in Houston, TX,
USA. ICHI2023 provides a supportive scientific forum for students focusing on
computing, health- and bioinformatics. It provides a forum for expert and peer
critique of students' research with the goal of improving their science. Student
participants will also have the opportunity to receive networking support and
career advice from internationally recognized experts. This proposal supports
doctoral students by providing a Student Doctoral Consortium focused on
encouraging students to learn from peers and experts from multiple perspectives
to understand how innovative computing and informatics combine to make the most
impact in the area of health. In addition, student participation in rapid talks
and roundtable sessions at the conference enables students to explore their
science and see different career paths for researchers in this area. The
ICHI2013 conference exposes participants to different scientific disciplinary
approaches, supports networking with conference attendees, and is designed to
support the development of the next generation of scholars in health- and
bioinformatics. Overall, the travel support brings together students with
experts who might not otherwise engage with one another and engage in
multidisciplinary science in the area of health. This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impact review criteria.
