Abstract for proposal EAR0106701 (PH #18x)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: High-
Resolution Studies of Complex Faulting: Chi-Chi, Taiwan Earthquake
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI's: Donald V. Helmberger,
CalTech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, geologists and geophysicists have
witnessed a revolution in the development and implementation of an array of new
tools for measuring motions of the earth's crust, including global positioning
satellites, interferometric synthetic aperture radar, and broadband digital
seismic systems, allowing tremendous advances in motion detection accuracy.
Japan and Taiwan took the lead in the installation of these instruments, and the
recent Chi-Chi, Taiwan earthquake (1999) sequence has produced a remarkable set
of data. Over 300 strong-motion acceleration records at distances less than 50
km are now available for the main event, Mw = 7.7. Eleven aftershocks with local
magnitudes greater than 6 occurred in the first week, several as large as
Northridge. About 10,000 digital 3-component waveforms can now be studied to
answer questions about variation in rupture velocity, rise-time, nonlinear
behavior, basin amplification, etc. We plan to apply an assortment of newly
developed analytical tools involving wavelet transforms, modified annealing, and
Pseudo-Green's Functions to explore these new data. In particular, we plan to
fix the slip-histories or various sub faults using the static data and using
calibrated seismic paths to constrain the rise-time and rupture velocity
