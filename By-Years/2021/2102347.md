The mobile ecosystem has become an attractive target for various types of
abuses. For instance, many mobile applications leak sensitive user information,
such as email addresses and location, which is a privacy issue. Second,
attackers routinely disguise malware in seemingly legitimate mobile apps to
launch attacks, which poses security threats. Third, many mobile apps and sites
push intrusive und undesirable ads, such as auto-play and pop-ups, which harm
usability. The objective of this project is to defend against these abuses in
the mobile ecosystem through real-time on-device filtering of network traffic on
a mobile device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project performs multi-layer network
traffic analysis with help of machine learning. It extracts features and train
learning models to produce filtering rules, which can be applied on the device.
Filtering on the mobile device is particularly challenging due to limited
resources, lack of visibility into packet payload, and potential collateral
damage on the affected apps. The filtering approach used is envisioned as
universal (i.e., applicable across all apps), automated (compared to the current
practice of manually maintained privacy related data), adaptive (to the ever-
changing threats), and user-centric (i.e., customized per user) while leveraging
collaboration among users. The general framework will be validate in three case
studies against the following abuse scenarios in the mobile ecosystem: (i)
intrusive ads (ii) privacy leaks (iii) malvertising. This project is excepted to
enhance the usability, privacy, and security of the mobile ecosystem and will
inform policies and practices on mobile data
transparency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
