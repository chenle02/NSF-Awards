9309135 Shvaytser This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. This
research will investigate what information can be extracted from sequences of
several frames taken from a scene with temporal variations. Most computer vision
techniques use still images, or pairs of still images, to analyze a scene. Yet,
video cameras capable of providing dense video motion sequences are just as
affordable as still image cameras. New Algorithms will be developed for
computing optical flow and dense displacement fields, 3D structure and motion,
and for object recognition. The emphasis will be on developing algorithms that
can take advantage of more than one or two image frames. The approach to flow
computation involves investigating alternatives to the classical view that image
flow can be computed as a minimization problem, defined in terms of multiple
constraints. While 3D structure and motion can be computed from accurate flow,
robustness requires rigidity assumptions and segmentation. Alternative
approaches will be investigated, based on avoiding flow computation, and
instead, fitting simple models to the structure and motion in small patches. The
approach to object recognition will be to investigate shape invariants that can
be automatically extracted from the scene by learning techniques. ***
