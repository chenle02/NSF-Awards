A new course, Environmental Studies (ENS) 110, Methods in Environmental Science,
is being offered to freshmen and sophomores of all majors at Alfred University.
The primary emphasis of the course is on introducing students to how science is
performed by supervising their research as class projects in ozone monitoring,
geotechnical evaluation , and evaluation of discharge and pollution of surface
and ground waters. Upper level students in Environmental Studies are used as
mentors in the class to encourage and prepare them for future teaching careers.
A graduate student in education also assists and receives instruction while
practicing teaching in science. The course is specifically designed to overcome
many contemporary criticisms of science education by assuring that students are
introduced to science as a process. Students are required to design, conduct,
analyze, and present results of their own experiments and field work. They learn
cooperatively by working in groups. Emphasis is also placed on quantitative
skills by integrating the use of mathematics and computers into science.
