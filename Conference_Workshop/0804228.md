Abstract

In 1854, B. Riemann introduced the notion of curvature for spaces with a family
of inner products (Riemannian metrics). In 1918, P. Finsler studied the
variation problem for spaces with a family of norms (Finsler metrics). Recently
significant progress in Riemann-Finsler geometry has been made by mathematicians
around the world. In particular. many non-trivial examples of Finsler metrics of
scalar (or constant) flag curvature have been constructed and several local
classification theorems have been obtained. Riemann-Finsler geometry also has
applications in other areas such as mathematical psychology, general relativity,
PDE, navigation problems, imaging process, and module spaces, etc.

This conference will provide a platform for mathematicians to communicate with
each other and discuss the research projects for the future. Meanwhile, this
conference will provide a great opportunity for mathematicians in USA to
understand Riemann-Finsler geometry and find motivation to work in this area.
