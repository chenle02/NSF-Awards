Three year scholarships of $25,000 annually will be awarded to three successive
cohorts of eight juniors majoring in mathematics or one of the natural sciences
to earn secondary certification in the existing fifth-year teacher credentialing
program. The new teachers will teach in one of two neighboring high-need school
districts, East Side Union High School District (ESUHSD) and San Jose Unified
School District (SJUSD). The scholarships will permit the approximate doubling
of the number of STEM teachers produced annually at the university.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To aid the Noyce Teacher Scholars in becoming successful
teachers, they experience an integrated support program that offers continuous
access to mentorship opportunities from STEM faculty, education faculty, and
high school master teachers. A key aspect of this integrated support program
involves the tailoring of the current Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment
(BTSA) induction programs that support new teachers during their first two years
to specifically meet the needs of new science and mathematics teachers via
summer workshops. &lt;br/&gt;
