Bermuda Biological Station will operate the R/V WEATHERBIRD II during 1990 as a
general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects. The R/V
WEATHERBIRD II is a 115' general research vessel that was originally converted
in 1989 and is owned by the Bermuda Biological Station. Additional conversion
work on the vessel will be conducted in phases during 1990 and 1991. The ship
operates primarily in the vicinity of Bermuda. This vessel is part of a fleet
used by the National Science Foundation to support oceanographic research
projects. Most oceanographic research projects require highly specialized
equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number
of research projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a
ship and for which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also
requires highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These
vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels,
and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically
dedicated to oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities
and research institutions around the country.
