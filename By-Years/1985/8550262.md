The Association of Science-Technology Centers, representing some 170 science
museums, receives regular requests for information on the status of science
museums, their education programs, exhibits and other activities. To respond to
this need, the organization will collect and analyze data on the status and
activities of both member and non-member science museums. The material will be
published as three reports and made available on computer disks for further
study. The information is particularly useful to communities considering new
museums, and to trustees and contributors to current museums and others who have
an interest in the priorities and policies of education and exhibits programs.
The project will be assisted by an advisory committee and Dr. Sue Smock,
Director of the Center for Urban Studies, Wayne State University.
