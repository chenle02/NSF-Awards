The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is addressing
the increasing demand for sustainable water purification and cost-effective
phase separation with an energy-efficient, economical, portable and scalable
solution. More than a billion people around the world lack access to clean
drinking water. Most of the existing technologies for water purification and
phase separation mainly use energy from conventional fuels increasing their
operating cost and limiting their application. The proposed technology of
Nanophotonics-enabled Solar Membrane Distillation (NESMD) uses solar energy to
vaporize water and potentially other liquids of interest. NESMD system is
energy-efficient, portable and can be scaled in size making it suitable for
household, commercial and industrial water purification. Cost-effective phase
separation with NESMD can be attractive for petroleum and related industries as
well.

This I-Corps project focuses on electricity-free water purification and phase
separation. Nanophotonics-enabled Solar Membrane Distillation (NESMD) system
consists of a polymer membrane coated with light-absorbing carbon-based
nanomaterials which efficiently absorb incident sunlight. The capability of
converting light into heat within a thin layer on top of a semipermeable
membrane allows an efficient local conversion of liquid to its vapor phase. This
membrane can be used in contact with saline/polluted water or a mixture of
organic solvents allowing the heat from the absorbed sunlight to induce
vaporization through the membrane separating the liquid of interest from non-
volatile components such as salts, heavy metals, bacteria or other liquids.
Proof-of-concept lab-scale studies of the NESMD system show efficient water
purification with more than 99.5% salt rejection. Through this I-Corps project
the team wants to further assess and investigate the value of this technology
for water purification and phase separation market.
