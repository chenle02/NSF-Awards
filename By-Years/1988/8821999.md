This proposal focuses on the development of methods to compare alternative types
of material handling systems used by industry. The goal of the project is to
assist users in selecting well-designed, integrated material handling systems
that will meet their needs at minimum cost. The approach will seek general
solutions to material handling problems but it also will look in detail at
several specific companies and the material handling systems that they employ.
This mix of general theory and empirical validation through examination of the
performance of existing systems is very appropriate to the goals of the DRMS
program. The researchers combine strong backgrounds in quantitative analysis
with experience in industrial applications of material handling systems. Initial
results, obtained by the researcher based on a subset of the proposed studies,
are very promising. Both the importance (and expense) of material handling
decisions suggest that the results of the proposed study should be of interest
to suppliers and users in a large number of different research and industrial
settings.
