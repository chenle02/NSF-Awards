Observations of ionospheric convection from SuperDARN and DMSP along with ACE
solar wind observations will be used to develop a new high-latitude convection
model. The approach will be to use Data Interpolating Orthogonal Functions
(DINEOFs). DINEOFs are a data-based technique that determines a limited set of
basis functions and their evolution that best describes a data set. The basis
functions will be used to study the interaction between polar cap convection and
the solar wind. The technique allows the two ionospheric data sets to be
combined and will fill gaps in the data record without using bin-averaging as is
presently done. The approach is rigorous and provides error estimates. The
resulting model will provide spatial and temporal characteristics of the
convection for both hemispheres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This model will be
valuable to other magnetospheric and ionospheric researchers. It is from a young
researcher just starting his career and will support a post-doctoral researcher
at the University of Texas at Dallas. A graduate student will be supported at
Virginia Tech.
