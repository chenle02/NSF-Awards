9354017 Clark This two-year program is designed to serve as a model for the
utilization of cooperative relationships between university professors and
outstanding two-year college physics faculty members working together to provide
professional in-service enrichment training for two-year college physics faculty
in the Southwestern United States. The program focuses on recent developments in
physics research, innovative physics teaching methods, and successful techniques
for recruiting local minority students into two-year college science and
engineering programs. The program includes an annual May Institute at Texas
A&amp;M University, academic year follow-up workshops, local projects by
participants, and staff visits to participant's campuses. ***
