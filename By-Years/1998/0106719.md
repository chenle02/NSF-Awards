Rudnick&lt;br/&gt;0106719&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pilot project will
characterize the Li isotopic composition of the Earth's mantle. This project
will concentrate on both solution and laser introduction of Li to our Nu plasma
multicollector ICP-MS. We will begin by analysing international rock standards
in solution, then will proceed with mineral separates from peridotites (olivine,
orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene). Our ultimate goal is to determine the range of
Li isotope values in the Earth's mantle, as sampled by a variety of peridotitic
xenoliths derived from lithosphere of variable ages and tectonic settings that
have experienced a variety of metasomatic overprinting processes. In addition,
we hope to establish the degree of isotopic heterogeneity between coexisting
phases. &lt;br/&gt;
