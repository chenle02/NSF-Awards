This award provides partial support for renovation of the seawater system at the
University of Texas - Pan American Coastal Studies Laboratory (CSL) on South
Padre Island, Texas. The CSL supports research and educational activities of the
University, and provides a variety of public education activities focused on
marine life and related topics. The CSL is currently hampered in fulfilling this
mission by the limited capabilities of its seawater system. These limits are
imposed by the original design of the system, deterioration of the intake and
discharge lines, and the aging of other equipment. The renovated system will
have dual intake lines and pumps, sand-filtration, new plumbing for filtered
water, and twin discharge lines. The system will support research on marine
algae, seagrasses, and small marine animals. In addition to research, the
seawater system will support general lab use, university and public outreach
courses, and an aquarium intended for public displays.
