The award from the Chemistry Division supports an Undergraduate Research Centers
(URC) planning grant. The PI is Donald R. Bobbitt. The planning will focus on
establishment of an interdisciplinary Undergraduate Research Center employing a
"studio focus" and built around the concept of "Uncovering the Rules of Nature
at the Small Scale". The planning phase of the project will involve a broad
community, including University of Arkansas faculty from several colleges,
representatives of the Arkansas High School and Community College Systems and
members from industries and small businesses with interests in nanoscience and
technology. During the planning phase, a programmatic vision and operational
framework for the studio concept of learning will be developed to engage more
students and a more diverse base in undergraduate research, together and early,
in their freshman and sophomore years. Teams of faculty, students and staff will
be assembled. New courses, an example curriculum and detailed cross-disciplinary
experiments will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;
