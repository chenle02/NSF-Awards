Low-dimensional topology is undergoing a revolution thanks to an infusion of new
techniques from other areas, including mathematical physics, representation
theory, holomorphic curve theory, analysis, and algebraic geometry. This fusion
of techniques has led to an explosion of results and also new avenues of
research. Examples of this include Perelman's recent proof of the Poincare
conjecture using methods from geometric analysis; Donaldson's gauge theory
approach to construct invariants for smooth four-manifolds, and the subsequent
discovery of the Seiberg-Witten equations; invariants of three and four-
manifolds defined via holomorphic curves; the quantum polynomial invariants for
knots and, more recently, their categorifications. This project aims to train
the next generation of researchers in these exciting and vibrant subjects,
including graduate students and postdocs; and also to widely disseminate the
latest discoveries in these fields.

The aim of this proposal is to stimulate the research training environment at
Columbia University in the new developments in low-dimensional topology and
geometry. Many of these developments have been pioneered by faculty at Columbia.
The objectives of this program are: (i) to increase the number of undergraduates
who will pursue graduate studies in this exciting and active area of
mathematics, and to ensure that their training equips them well for graduate
studies; (ii) to broaden and strengthen the research background of the graduate
students at Columbia, so that they are better equipped to fulfill their research
potential, and contribute meaningfully to this rapidly-changing subject; (iii)
to prepare the postdoctoral associates for more independent research in this
area; (iv) to foster communication among all strata in the research group at
Columbia, and in fact to train the associated students and postdocs in
expository skills, teaching, and research; and (v) to foster the dissemination
of knowledge in this field from Columbia University to the wider mathematical
community.
