This is a multi-institutional proposal from Rice University and Duke
University. The PIs propose a field/laboratory program to collect/study
carbonate sediments from the Nicaraguan Rise. The field program consists of a
seismic survey and core sampling. The laboratory program includes interpreting
seismic profiles, determining sediment types, and establishing the ages of
fluctuations in sediment type. These fluctuations will reveal the climatic
controlling factors on carbonate sedimentation in an area never studied before.
