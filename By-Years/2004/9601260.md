Selection of food often involves mechanosensory information about texture along
with chemosensory information about flavor. Aquatic crustaceans such as crayfish
and lobster have antennae, antennules and mouthparts with many sensory hairlike
structures called sensilla, which often are receptors for chemosensory as well
as mechanical stimuli. These animals provide an excellent model system for study
because the few nerve cells in each sensilla are very easily accessible for
recording nerve activity, to determine how they respond to different stimuli.
This project uses anatomical and electrophysiological techniques to explore how
these sensory structures are innervated and to help understand how responses to
mechanical hydrodynamic flow around the receptors interact with responses to
chemosensory stimuli. Results will clarify how multi-modal signals about the
environment are normally integrated by the nervous system to produce appropriate
behavior. This work will have an impact not only on chemosensory and
mechanosensory science, but on understanding information coding in general in
the nervous system with potential relevance to robotic sensors, on understanding
sensory evolution and how organisms adapt to their environment, and may lead to
applied advances in animal stock management in the fisheries industry.
