Abstract ATM-9702607 Jenkins, Gregory Pennsylvania State University Title:
Investigating Climate Variability and Climate Change in West Africa Using
Coupled Global Regional Climate Models The scientific goals of this proposal are
1) to investigate the links between the large scale atmospheric circulation, the
easterly waves and the climate variability over west Africa using the past
fifteen years of observations and modeling, 2) to test the model simulation
sensitivity for convective parameterization, and 3) to try to simulate regional
climate under doubled CO2 scenario. The educational goals are 1) to provide
outreach to K-12 students 2) to develop demonstrations and presentation with the
help of under graduate students for presentation to high school and college
students, and 3) to encourage under represented groups to consider careers in
Atmospheric Science. This work will enhance our knowledge of West African
climate variability and will develop technical expertise especially in under
represented groups.
