ABSTRACT

Gruev, Victor 1603933

Currently, cancer surgeons use their naked eye and palpitation because other
imaging technologies are not conducive to the operating room. This proposal
deals with the design of an image-guided surgical platform where surgeons would
wear goggles and a specialized imaging device to obtain an enhanced view of the
boundaries of a tumor site

While many imaging technologies exist, none are conducive to the operating room
either due to size or incompatibility with surgical tools. To address current
limitations the PIs propose a biologically inspired solution that mimics the
compound eye of the mantis shrimp. They will employ pixelated filters with a
transmission ratio of 90% and the pixel pitch will match that of a CMOS
photodiode array
