The project strives to minimize the gap between measurements and models that
characterize the formation rates, concentrations, and spatial distributions of
small organic particles in the atmosphere. Laboratory studies will be conducted
in the UNC Environmental Chamber Facility to measure key physicochemical
properties of aerosol and gas phase products. The results will be applied to
improve models of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation to better inform
policy decisions about air quality, human health, and
climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will test the hypothesis that higher
viscosity and phase-separation will suppress the reactive uptake of isoprene
epoxydiols (IEPOX). The four objectives of the experimental plan to test this
hypothesis include the (1) determination of the reactive uptake of IEPOX as a
function of particle viscosity; (2) determination of the reactive uptake of
IEPOX on particles with complex morphologies; (3) identification of the
molecular composition and physicochemical properties of the IEPOX-derived SOA
constituents for different viscosities and morphologies; and (4)
characterization of volatile products resulting from reactive uptake chemistry
of IEPOX.
