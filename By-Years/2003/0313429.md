0313429&lt;br/&gt;Levey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Chile award
will support Dr. Douglas J. Levey, Mr. Alex E. Jahan, and Dr. Kimberly G. Smith,
University of Florida, in convening the first symposium on austral bird
migration with Drs. Rodrigo Vasquez and Pablo Sabat of Universidad de Chile, to
be held in Puerto Varas, Chile in October, 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal
of this symposium is to catalyze international collaboration on austral
migration of birds. The meeting will take place immediately before and during
the Neotropical Ornithological Congress (NOC) in Chile. Leading researchers from
academic institutions and representatives of both federal and non-governmental
conservation-oriented organizations in North America will be brought together
with their South American counterparts. This will provide important exchanges of
technology developed in North America to study migration that can be easily
adopted by South American researchers. In addition, the independent evolution of
migration in South America can be used to provide rigorous tests of migration
theories developed in North America, thus providing mutual benefit.&lt;br/&gt;
