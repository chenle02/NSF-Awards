This project concerns authentication, audit trails, and privacy in secure
electronic transactions, with the intended scope encompassing a wide array of
daily activities such as banking, on-line shopping, elections, and surveys. Some
of these activities are already be based in part on electronic transactions
today, but would benefit from better mechanisms for security. Other activities
have the potential to be performed electronically given greater confidence in
the security infrastructure surrounding electronic
transactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops the design of a
concurrent domain-specific language for distributed electronic transactions that
will provide more security guarantees and automation of checks than has been
previously done in such languages. It proposes an alternative to security based
on software packages with dynamic checks, by a type-theory based approach where
security guarantees are verified automatically and statically via typechecking,
factoring out checks that other approaches perform dynamically for every
execution, and performing them only once at compile
time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efforts in these directions are potentially rich in
social and economic benefits. Research on secure electronic transactions will
directly reduce the incidence of electronic fraud, theft, and forgery, improving
the quality and extending the scope of the software available to the general
public.&lt;br/&gt;
