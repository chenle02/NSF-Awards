This award is to organize a workshop entitled: "New Paradigms for Developing
Peta-scalable Codes" to be held at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center on May
3-4, 2003. The two-day workshop will focus on languages and frameworks to
facilitate the development of computer programs that will efficiently utilize
many thousands of processors. The organizers have identified a number of
outstanding speakers who will provide training on modern parallel programming
languages, and specialized libraries that are useful in developing scaleable
computer codes for massively parallel architectures.
