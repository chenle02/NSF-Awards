The objective of this collaborative proposal is to perform an integrated
experimental and multi-scale modeling project to optimize the operation of a
continuous bench-scale dendrimer enhanced ultrafiltration (DEUF) system for
recovering metal ions from aqueous solutions. The focus will be on commercially
available ethylene diamine (EDA) core, poly(amidoamine) PAMAM dendrimers as
functional materials for DEUF-based processes for recovering metal ions from
industrial wastewater streams. Research activities will involve (i) measurements
and molecular dynamics simulations of proton and metal ion binding to dendrimers
in aqueous solutions, (ii) experimental characterization and mesoscale
simulations of dendrimer sorption to polymeric ultrafiltration membranes, and
(iii) evaluation and optimization of a bench-scale DEUF system. The fundamental
mechanisms of proton and metal ion binding in aqueous solutions of dendrimers
will be probed through a combination of experimental measurements and molecular
dynamics simulations. In terms of the broader impacts, the project will provide
educational opportunities at an HBCU. DEUF has the potential to recover toxic
metal ions from contaminated public water supplies.
