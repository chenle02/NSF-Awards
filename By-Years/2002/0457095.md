This grant provides funding for creating and analyzing probability models of
contact centers. A contact center is a collection of resources providing an
interface between a service provider and its customers. The classical contact
center is a call center, containing service representatives (agents) who talk to
customers over the telephone. In modern call centers, agents are supported by
elaborate information-and communication-technology equipment, such as an
interactive voice response unit, an automatic call distributor (ACD), a personal
computer and assorted databases. With the rapid growth of e-commerce, contact is
often made via e-mail or the Internet instead of by telephone. There often are
many types of service requests, requiring different service skills, such as
knowledge of different languages or technical information, and the agents differ
in their ability to respond to these requests. The ACD is able to route calls to
different agents through skill-based routing, but there remains an opportunity
to do better routing and staffing. Multimedia present opportunities for improved
efficiency if some of the work can be postponed. Multimedia also lead to more
complicated contact experiences. Customers may alternate between periods of
interaction with agents and periods of browsing on the Internet. Thus, the full
contact experience may take place over several disjoint subintervals of time.

If successful, the results of this research will lead to fundamental principles,
effective control algorithms and software that will make it possible to better
design and manage contact centers. Work will be done to better understand
customer abandonment and retrials, to establish stochastic-process limits that
expose the impact of non-exponential service-time and time-to-abandon
distributions, and to find conditions for resource pooling in contact centers,
where the efficiency of a large single-skill center is achieved in a multi-
skilled center with minimal flexibility.
