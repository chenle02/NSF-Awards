Many stream channels have been modified significantly in the last century.
Dams, levees, revetments, meander cut-offs, and reservoirs have been constructed
to control floods and to improve navigation. These modifications have severely
altered the morphology of the channels and have changed the patterns of erosion
and sedimentation. The exact character of these changes is not well documented,
however. Among the most drastically modified streams is the lower Mississippi
River. This project will use historic hydrographic survey maps to measure
changes in channel morphology and sediment regimes on the lower Mississippi over
the last century. The data gathered in this project will also be used to analyze
the degree to which human versus natural forces have altered flows and
depositional patterns, and they will provide a basis for more detailed
examination of the processes of meandering in large streams. This project will
yield useful results at a number of levels. It will provide a data set specific
to the lower Mississippi River. These data will be valuable aids to scholars
studying this stream and to practitioners who must deal directly with flood
control and navigation systems. The conclusions drawn in this project will also
have broader significance, offering new insights into the processes by which
stream flow and sediment transport respond to modification by humans and to
changes in natural conditions.
