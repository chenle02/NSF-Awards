This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, explores the detailed kinetics of hydrocarbon species on well
characterized transition metal surfaces. The work focusses on the development of
methods for preparing hydrocarbon intermediates cleanly on the surface using a
low energy ion source, on improving the sensitivity for monitoring surface
kinetics in these systems, and on carrying out careful isothermal kinetic
measurements of the reactions of these adsorbed intermediates. The chemistry to
be explored includes the isolation and reaction of intermediates such as
alklyidene, vinyl, and allyl on platinum, copper and nickel surfaces. %%% The
understanding of the detailed chemistry of the intermediates produced when
hydrocarbon molecules interact with transition metal surfaces is important for
understanding heterogeneous catalysis. This research project develops methods
and approaches for identifying and detailing the kinetics of adsorbed
hydrocarbon intermediates on such catalytically important metals as platinum,
nickel and copper. The kinetic information obtained from these studies will be
useful for our developing understanding of the reactivity and selectivity of
transition metal catalysts.
