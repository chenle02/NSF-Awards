9303047 Chan This award provides 56% of the funds required for the Principal
Investigator to purchase equipment that will be installed in a paleomagnetics
laboratory in the Geology Department at the University of Wisconsin at Eau-
Claire. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary.
The paleomagnetic equipment is to be used in measuring the direction of
magnetization of igneous rocks both in formal course work and in research
projects involving undergraduate students. Such measurements are necessary to
obtain an understanding of the behavior of the Earth's magnetic field in the
past and are also needed to interpret the past deformation of the magnetized
rocks during tectonic events. ***
