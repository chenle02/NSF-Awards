A fundamental challenge in psychology and cognitive neuroscience is to
understand the brain mechanisms that underlie the ability to learn and remember
new information. A brain structure called the hippocampus has been at the
forefront of research into this question for many years. People with damage to
the hippocampus lose the ability to form lasting memories about the events they
experience in everyday life (this type of memory is called "episodic memory").
Such memories require a mechanism that can rapidly link together the sequence of
events that occurs in an episode and store this sequence in memory. This project
will investigate this mechanism by recording the electrical activity of large
populations of brain cells (neurons) in the hippocampus of the rat. Hippocampal
neurons are selectively active when the rat occupies restricted locations in the
environment. The activity of these "place cells" is thought to represent the
rat's mental map of its environment (similar properties have been found in the
hippocampus of humans). As the rat moves through the environment, its memory of
the routes it has taken is encoded in the connections between the place cells
that are activated in sequence along the route. It is hypothesized that the
place cells of the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus will rapidly acquire this
sequence information in a new environment, in order to rapidly create new
memories of its movements in the environment. As the rat explores the
environment and learns the location of food sources, it is hypothesized that
these memories will create a navigational map that allows the rat to move
directly to the hidden food source from any arbitrary location. These
experiments will illuminate some of the basic mechanisms by which the brain
stores the sequences of spatiotemporal events that underlie our memories of past
events. This project will offer training opportunities for post-doctoral
fellows, and the Dr. Knierim intends to keep reporting his findings to the
public during interviews on public radio. &lt;br/&gt;
