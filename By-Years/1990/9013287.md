This project will underwrite the construction of a research laboratory on the
Nelson Environmental Study Area. The facility will contain standard wet
laboratories; animal behavior room with an adjoining observation booth; two
general purpose laboratory rooms for activities not requiring wet laboratory
facilities; a room for storage of field equipment; a computer/meteorology room;
office and conference room. The facility will support experimental ecology in
five major areas: small mammal population biology, plant population biology and
physiological ecology, mechanisms of secondary succession, air-ecosystem
interactions, and dynamics of aquatic ecosystems. The building will enhance
current research programs, increase the efficiency of field/laboratory
interactive measurements, make possible the development of now lines of research
now foreclosed because of the lack of a research laboratory, and make the KER
more accessible to the national scientific community.
