&lt;br/&gt;This workshop (February 7-9, 2003) focuses on an area of increasing
interest to scholars in economics and decision science - the attempt to connect
research on cognitive neuroscience with research on decision making. This area,
which has been called "neuro-economics" is very much in its infancy. The
catalyst for the huge amount of interest in the area in the last few years was
the publication of "Descartes' Error," a book by neuroscientist Antonio Damasio
demonstrating that damage to parts of the brain involved in processing emotional
information can impair decision making. This finding has been of interest to
researchers for two main reasons - first, it suggests that the widespread belief
that emotion interferes with effective decision making is wrong. Second, it
suggests that insights into decision making and economic behavior can be
obtained by relating such behavior to neurological
phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop is the third in a series
at the University of Arizona that bring together scholars working on topics in
decision science, emotion and neuroscience. The particants include 3 of the 12
researchers who participated in the "Behavioral Economics" symposium at the
Nobel award ceremony this year (Kahneman, Slovic, Smith).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
