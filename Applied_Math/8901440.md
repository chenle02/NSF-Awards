8901440 Wu This research program is devoted to the following subjects: (1).
Bifurcation mechanism of forced emision of solitary waves - to determine by
analytical and computational efforts, the basic mechanism underlying the new
phenomena of periodic emision of solitons by critical excitations steadily
applied to a nonlinear dispersive system at resonance. (2). The KdV (Korteweg-de
Vries) model with boundary forcing - to develop, by computer-aided
investigations, the theory of initial-boundary-value problems of the KdV
equation, a new challenging field which is nearly all open. This study will
explore various inverse transform methods and asymptotic approximation
techniques. (3). Forced three-dimensional nonlinear wave theory - to develop
efficient numerical methods for evaluating the generation, scattering and
diffraction of three-dimensional nonlinear waves with external forcing at
resonance and to analyze the criteria of periodic bifurcation of solutions in
various cases. New research results can be applied to all soliton-bearing
systems, including fluid dynamics, ocean engineering, meterology, oceanography,
plasma physics, optics, several areas of physics and quantum biophysics.
