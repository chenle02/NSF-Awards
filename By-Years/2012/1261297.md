The two day Workshop: "Developing Physical Theories on the Emergence of Drug and
Immune Resistance in Cancer" will be a two-day highly-focused meeting bringing
together oncologists and physicists with interests in both the theory of
resistance and in novel measurement technology that would be used to guide any
proposed conceptual framework. The goal of the meeting would be to define the
scope of the problem, to present to the physicists the data that is available in
the oncology community and to formulate an approach to move forward. The panel
of physical scientists and oncological clinicians will develop a road map for
probing new avenues towards the exploration of cancer etiology, especially drug-
resistant cancers. At the very least, this meeting will serve to catalyze
discussions between research scientists who traditionally very seldom
communicate, and much less with the same language and/or temporal/spatial scale.
The intention is that the meeting will result in; a) new research partnerships
between theorists and medical experimentalists, and/or a general consensus that
drives more basic oncological research with embedded theoretical modeling and
simulation. The later will hasten a more detailed understanding of cancer
etiology and perhaps treatment regimes.
