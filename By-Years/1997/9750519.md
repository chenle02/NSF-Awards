As a result of rapid developments in the spectroscopic analytical and chemical
separations fields, the focus of this department has been directed to
instrumental techniques in the physical, biological, and analytical chemistry
curricula. The project involves the addition of modern instrumentation in gas
chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography (analytical and prep-
scale), mass spectrometry, ultraviolet/visible, fluorescence, Fourier-transform
infrared, and Fourier-transform nuclear-magnetic resonance spectroscopies to the
curriculum. The department is now seeking to address the need for instruction in
electrochemical methods to combat a lack of student understanding of basic ideas
in solution chemistry and interfacial measurements. This project is implementing
a systematic program of electrochemical education that provides for (1) hands-on
student exposure to modern electrochemical methods and equipment; (2)
demonstration of the competitiveness of electrochemical methods with other
techniques; (3) the development of new undergraduate laboratory exercises; and
(4) the exposure of the modern methods and equipment to increased numbers of
students in the areas of analytical, inorganic, physical, polymer, and
biochemistry. These experiments illustrate important chemical concepts and serve
to demonstrate the use of electrochemistry in analysis.
