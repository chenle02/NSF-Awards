Ziegler-Natta catalysts are used widely as industrial catalysts for the
synthesis of polymers. The zirconium and titanium compounds which will be
studied in this project are related to soluble Ziegler-Natta catalysts. This
project is expected to provide a better understanding of how these catalysts
function and to provide information needed to design more specific and more
efficient catalysts for polymer synthesis. General methods for the synthesis and
isolation of cationic organozirconium complexes of the type bis-Cp-Zr(R)(L)
where L is a labile ligand have been discovered. The organozirconium complexes
are highly reactive. Their Zr-R bonds undergo rapid insertion of ketones,
nitriles and other polar unsaturated substrates, and the THF complexes
polymerize ethylene in the absence of an Al cocatalyst. These observations
support recent proposals that cationic Ti and Zr complexes are active species in
soluble Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems. The cationic organozirconium complexes
are also easily hydrogenated to synthetically useful cationic hydrides. The
research plan is to synthesize an extensive series of Cp2M(R)(L) complexes (M =
Ti, Zr) and to study the scope and mechanisms of their reactions with olefins
and other unsaturated substrates, and with hydrogen. These novel compounds
provide an opportunity to study the fundamental features of insertion reactions
of M-R bonds (M = Ti, Zr) in the absence of the many complications caused by Al
cocatalysts. Also included in this project is research to develop asymmetric
organic syntheses based on chiral cationic Cp2M(R)(L) complexes.
