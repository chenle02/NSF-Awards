9224190 Onstott This project will use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data
obtained from the European Space Agency Earth Resources Satellite (ERS-1) to
investigate the distribution of sea ice characteristics and thickness in the
Chukchi Sea region north of Bering Strait. Satellite observation will be
compared to in situ measurements and SAR signatures obtained from an instrument
on board the USCGC Polar Star, and extended to observations made farther east in
the Beaufort Sea during the LEADEX experiment of 1992. The distribution of sea
ice characteristics and thickness is believed to be a significant indicator of
climate change in polar regions. At this time our understanding of the processes
that determine these factors, and our capability of determining the variability
of sea ice on even the regional scale is inadequate. Consequently the proper
interpretation of satellite microwave images appears to be potentially the most
productive way to address questions of global change in polar regions. Since
ERS-1 is the first of several satellites to carry an active microwave radar,
research in this area is particularly timely. ***
