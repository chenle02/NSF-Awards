This proposal is to operate two ground-based imagers at South Pole station and
combine their observations with simultaneous global auroral observations by the
IMAGE spacecraft investigating temporal and spatial effects in the ionosphere
from the reconnection processes at the magnetopause. The location of South Pole
has advantages for auroral imaging because the continuous darkness over the
winter months allows 24 hours optical observations and the ideal magnetic
latitude permits observation of the dayside aurora. The reconnection (merging)
region of the magnetosphere provides the most significant entry point for solar
wind plasma. It is now widely accepted that the dayside region contains the
footprint of field lines that participate in reconnection processes with the
interplanetary field. Although there is quite a body of literature about the
auroral footprints of the dayside reconnection region from ground based
observations, it has not been possible to relate those results to simultaneous
global auroral images. Global observations of proton auroras from the IMAGE
spacecraft provided direct images of the footprint of the reconnection region
showing that reconnection occurs continuously and that the spatial distribution
of the precipitation follows the theoretically predicted behavior as a function
of the interplanetary field. The apogee of the IMAGE spacecraft orbit is slowly
drifting south and in the time frame of this project (austral winter of 2004),
IMAGE apogee will be over the Southern hemisphere. Thus, it will be possible to
obtain simultaneous global images of the aurora by IMAGE and of the high
latitude dayside region by two ground-based imagers (electron and protons
auroras) at South Pole Station. The main project goal is to capitalize on this
unique opportunity and use the IMAGE satellite as the "telescope" and the
ground-based imagers as the "microscope" for these observations. In summary, the
proposed project will use new opportunities provided by IMAGE and the South Pole
proton-electron data answering several key questions for better understanding of
substorms and related phenomena. Understanding the Earth's electromagnetic
environment is one of the key requirements to predict space weather and to
understand how geoactive magnetic storms are. The project will continue the
involvement of students in every phase of the program, which appears to be a
good encouragement for some to start a career in upper atmospheric research.
