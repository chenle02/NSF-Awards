This research program is concerned with the development of both theoretical and
computational tools for the analysis of stochastic discrete-event dynamic
systems (DEDS). Such systems arise naturally in the analysis of modern
manufacturing facilities, telecommunications networks, and computing/database
machines. It is intended to establish basic algorithms (primarily simulation-
oriented) for the efficient numerical computation of performance measures
associated with such systems. Although the primary goal is to develop
theoretical and algorithmic tools, it is expected that the research program will
develop theory and methodology that will positively contribute to applied
probability, queueing theory, and discrete-event simulation.
