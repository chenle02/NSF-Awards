9526623 Sverjensky This project is to develop a new multi-site model for the
adsorption of protons and cations onto oxide and silicate surfaces that does not
depend on empirical prediction of surface equilibrium constants from aqueous
complexation constants. After the new multi-site model has been calibrated,
surface equilibrium constants should be predictable from the properties of the
underlying crystal structure. The model will be calibrated using published
experimental data for surface titration, adsorption from solution, and surface
spectroscopy. The model will enable the prediction of adsorption behavior for
many different mineral and solution compositions, which should facilitate the
application of the model to both oxides and silicates in nature.
