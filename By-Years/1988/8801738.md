The purpose of this research will be to analyze models of the time evolution of
collisionless plasmas moving under the influence of their self-induced
electromagnetic fields. These models take the form of systems of partial
differential equations, the Poisson- Vlasov system and the Maxwell-Vlasov
system. The unknown in each model is the density of the plasma, and the Maxwell-
Vlasov system is somewhat more complete of the two systems, exhibiting
electrical and magnetic effects as well as relativistic. Globally symmetric
solutions were first established in 1952, and numerous extensions followed.
However, the problem of global existence of classical solutions for general data
is still open for either system. Recent results establish the breakdown of
certain solutions in finite time. One goal of this work will be to show that
when the initial data is nearly spherically symmetric, global existence of
solutions is guaranteed. A second line of investigation proposes to model the
interaction between the solar wind and the earth's magnetic field. By this one
understands the neutral stream of charged particles moving rapidly away from the
sun. It consists mainly of protons and electrons which, when they encounter the
earth's magnetic field, induce currents adding to the total magnetic field. The
resulting interaction is believed to account for the aurora borealis and
geomagnetic storms. Another feature of this interaction is a bow shock wave
across which the behavior of the plasma changes abruptly. The precise nature of
shock waves in collisionless plasmas is still unclear. A mixed initial value-
boundary value problem is proposed to model the above interaction. Initial work
to be done will be in establishing global existence results for solutions and to
determine conditions under which solutions tend to a steady state as time
increases. Applications to the physical sciences are clear.
