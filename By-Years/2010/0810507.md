This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project seeks to
develop technology to help teachers and schools evaluate speech fluency in young
children and to provide an innovative and unique method of intervention when
speech problems are discovered. An initial goal of this research project is to
develop automatic speech recognition software that is designed to identify
specific aspects of speech that are related to early childhood education, such
as rhyming, blending, vowel sounds. Current technologies specifically designed
for adult speech recognition will be customized to identify aspects of a child's
speech related to phonemic awareness. The second major goal of the research is
to develop an novel procedure for the instruction and intervention of children
with speech fluency difficulties, specifically, to 'mirror' the child's voice
back to the child with the hope that the child will be able to self-correct the
speech impediment.

A child's speech is foundational to his or her literacy development and
assessing speech fluency for the purpose of individualizing curriculum is a
vital role of early childhood education. As schools nationwide are confronted
with increased accountability due to 'No Child Left Behind' and 'Reading First'
legislation, the technology proposed by this research plan could become an
indispensable tool for use elementary schools. Currently, such speech fluency
evaluations are typically delivered individually by teachers and consume a great
deal of time and money. The proposed research will offer teachers an
independently administered assessment and instructional technology that would be
easy to use and provide immediately available and actionable information for
schools.
