HRD 95-55812 Girves The CIC WISE Initiative proposes a comprehensive set of
collaborative activities to help achieve gender equity on the 15 campuses of the
Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC), targeting upper division
undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty women in science, engineering,
and mathematics (SEM). The objectives are to enlarge the pool of undergraduate
women pursuing SEM graduate study; to increase the number of female graduate
students who pursue faculty careers; to increase the numbers of women who
advance through the faculty ranks; and to improve the educational and
professional climate for all SEM women. New activities include providing student
leadership development workshops, professional development and socialization
experiences (e.g., attending professional conferences), adapting and
institutionalizing practices to enhance the campus climate for women (e.g.,
gender-equitable teaching workshops), facilitating electronic communication
through creating a WISE web with resource materials, databanks, etc., and
establishing an implemented electronic inter-institutional mentoring model. The
goals are to be achieved by integrating a set of new activities with a series of
existing, yet autonomous, CIC and institutional programs and plans. The project
will expand opportunities for women students and faculty, focus attention on
women in science issues, and add coherence and continuity to existing
activities.
