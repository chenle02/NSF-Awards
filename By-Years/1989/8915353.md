An important goal of the U. S. Global Change Program is to quantify the natural
rate and range of variability i the climate system. One of the principal sources
of paleoclimatic data with annual resolution comes from the analysis of tree
ring thickness. From these data it is possible to reconstruct records of past
temperature and precipitation for at least the last few centuries, and perhaps
up for the last millennium. This renewal proposal, by an established tree-ring
laboratory, requests support to continue the production and analysis of
paleoclimatic data derived from tree rings. The goal of the project is to
quantify the thickness variations in tree rings; relate the variations in
thickness to ecological and climatological parameters; develop long-term records
of annual variation in climate; and attempt to isolate anthropogenic effects
from natural variations in climate. This research is important because it well
help to isolate natural variability in the climate system from the effects of
fossil fuel burning by man.
