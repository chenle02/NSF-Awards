We propose to model the temporal evolution of the large-scale density
structures of the plasmasphere as they are created and controlled by the
dynamics of refilling and convection. These structures are a prominent features
appearing in measurements of the plasmasphere and will be theoretically examined
with a two- dimensional plasmaspheric model 覺Rasmussen et al., 1990! patterned
after Chen and Wolf 覺1972!. Our approach will be to parametrically study
plasmaspheric features created by a variety of temporally- and spatially-varying
electric fields and to compare these features with recent measurements of the
plasmasphere. Areas of specific interest are the two-dimensional structure of
regions of relatively dense plasma, which appear to be detached from the main
body of the plasmasphere when seen from the perspective of an orbiting
satellite, as well as the creation of various characteristic plasmaspheric
density profiles 覺see Horwitz et al., 1990!. This modeling study is, in part,
motivated by new observations of structures in the plasmasphere 覺e.g., Carpenter
et al., 1990; Horwitz et al., 1990; Anderson et al., 1990!.
