In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program
of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Michael C. Heaven of Emory University and his
research group investigate the unusual bonding mechanisms of beryllium. This
element and its compounds exhibit unique properties. For example, beryllium
alloys are used as lightweight structural materials due to their exceptional
strength to weight ratios. The remarkable durability of the metal is reflected
by the fact that it is used as a plasma facing material in fusion reactors. The
chemistry of beryllium is underexplored due to its toxicity. To circumvent this
problem, there have been many theoretical studies of beryllium and its
compounds. However, beryllium poses a severe challenge for many computational
techniques. The difficulties encountered are directly related to the unusual
bonding characteristics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At present, the experimental data
needed to evaluate quantum chemical models for beryllium are lacking. This
validation is needed to establish confidence in the computational methods used
to identify compounds with valuable physical and chemical properties.
Experimental studies of prototypical beryllium compounds are the primary
objectives of this program. Spectroscopic techniques, applied to gas phase
molecules and ions, are used to obtain structural and thermodynamic properties.
The species examined, oxides, hydroxides and carbides, are chosen because they
have been the subjects of high-level theoretical investigations. The research
provides the graduate and undergraduate students, and post-doctoral associates
involved with a rich experience in advanced experimental and theoretical
methods. A successful collaboration with Spelman College, that provides research
opportunities to students from a historically Black women's college, continues.
