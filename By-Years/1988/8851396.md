James Madison University will purchase two micro-computer based control and data
acquisition systems, a digital picoammeter, two autoranging digital multimeters,
and a bipolar power supply/amplifier. This equipment will be used to improve
instruction in upper division physics laboratory courses, and by advanced
undergraduates in independent research projects. Students will use these
instruments to control and analyze data from selected modern physics experiments
and in some newly developed plasma physics experiments. James Madison University
will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
