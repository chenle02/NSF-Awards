This award supports the research of Professor Wiles to work in number theory.
The aim of this project is to try to prove that certain families of elliptic
curves over the field of rationals is modular, the famous conjecture of Shimura-
Taniyama-Weil. The approach will be to prove in general that suitable Galois
representations with values in the two by two matrices , with entries in the
field with three elements, always arise from modular forms. This is research in
the field of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and
questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among
the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely
aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an
essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error
correcting codes for electronics.
