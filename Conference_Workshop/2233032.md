This National Science Foundation award enables the Society for Industrial and
Applied Mathematics (SIAM) to administer a travel grant program for
approximately one hundred U.S. based mathematical and computational scientists,
early career faculty, and graduate students to attend the International Congress
on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 2023), to be held August 20 - 25,
2023 in Tokyo, Japan. The ICIAM is the premier international conference for
applied mathematics, with approximately 500-750 U.S. participants anticipated.
Travel grants to applicants will be awarded on a competitive basis. Applications
will be evaluated by a panel of professional mathematical and computational
scientists to select a diverse group of well-qualified researchers.

Applied and computational mathematics are global enterprises with significant
impact on technology and economic development. ICIAM is an effective way to
foster the interaction of U.S. mathematical and computational scientists with
the international community of researchers and practitioners from academia,
government and industry. The program for ICIAM 2019 will be distinguished by its
focus and its outstanding speakers selected by the scientific program committee.
Focus areas in applied, industrial and computational mathematics will be chosen
based on their current and future importance. More information about the
conference is available at http://iciam2023.org/

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
