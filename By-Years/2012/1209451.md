This award will support a study the origins of compact binary stars in
cataclysmic variable systems that may be the progenitors of some types of
supernovae. Spectroscopy will be used to provide accurate masses and
temperatures of the components of several binaries, and will be used to
constrain the interior structure of the binary members. The main goals of this
work will be to constrain the current evolutionary state of the secondary stars
in these systems, to identify the properties of the progenitors, and to provide
additional constraints on the processes associated with the evolution of
interacting binaries, including constraints on the important, but poorly
understood, common envelope phase.

The origins of supernovae are still under considerable debate, and astronomers
are attempting to understand which types of stars eventually end their lives
explosively. Many details, particularly of the evolution of progenitor stars,
remain poorly understood.
