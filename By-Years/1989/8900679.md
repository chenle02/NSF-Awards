This award provides funds for a 10 week summer research experience for nine
undergraduates from Carleton College and other regional colleges and
universities. Pre-participation reading requirements will provide students with
an adequate foundation for meaningful scientific investigation. During the
summer, students will work in a one-to-one relationship with a research
supervisor in the laboratory. Weekly seminars will provide students with the
opportunity to discuss research plans and results as well as to delve into
primary scientific articles. To further focus and unify the student
participants, a theme of developmental regulation has been selected. Six of the
nine projects relate directly to this theme and mid-summer seminars will be used
to discuss current literature in this area. Projects will include investigations
of: the mechanisms of action and the chemical characteristics of a possibly-
steroid pheromone produced by Oedogonium, functional structure of Hensen's node
in the chick embryo, regulation of floral development in tobacco, effect of B
chromosome in maize on developmental processes, structure and function of the
glucocorticoid receptor in rat liver, development of synaptic connections in
Xenopus, variation of sex expression in composites, evolution and mechanisms of
animal behavior, and effect of gregarine parasites on population biology of
capitellid polychaetes. Opportunities to complete research and writing during
winter break will be available.
