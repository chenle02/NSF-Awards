This proposal is for the support of graduate students involved in a project
under the direction of Professors Lasiecka, Triggiani and Lagnese. The
particular project is related to the boundary control of systems described by
wave-type partial differential equations defined as a bounded domain in many
dimension space. Problems to be investigated include those of exact
controllability, uniform stabilization, and robustness of asymptotic stability
properties under structural perturbations. Applications of the theoretical
developments mentioned above are widespread in mechanical and electrical
systems. One example might be the reduction in oscillations in large space
structures. Another might be related to the control of robot arms. This activity
will contribute to the training of scientists who can address some of the
challenges facing modern engineers.
