Study of recently-erupted lavas from Kiluea volcano in Hawaii have shown that
for individual samples, paleo magnetic directions may deviate from the
orientation of the actual magnetic field by as much as several degrees. This
project will study this discrepancy by: 1) Monitoring the local geomagnetic
field while samples cool through the Curie temperature; 2) Laboratory work on
stressed and unstressed cooled samples that have been collected specifically for
this purpose; 3) Melting and cooling lava under controlled laboratory conditions
and measuring the magnetic field. The results should benefit a wide spectrum of
earth scientists including volcanologists, paleo magneticists, age daters, etc.
