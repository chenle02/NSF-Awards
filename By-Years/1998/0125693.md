The Lunar and Planetary Institute will expand a successful pilot program in
which libraries in Texas and Louisiana are used as community learning centers.
The program is two-fold and includes both "Explore!" resource materials and "Fun
with Science" modules. "Explore!" materials are a collection of space science
posters, brochures, fact sheets, videotapes and references. These resources are
disseminated to librarians for use as part of their collections and to support
the "Fun with Science" modules. "Fun with Science" consists of eight space
science modules that librarians are trained to use in after-school and summer
youth programs. Module topics include rocketry, comets, impact cratering, remote
sensing and space capsule design. Each year, 3-4 new modules will be produced.
Librarians receive training on content, activities and NASA resources in 2-3 day
sessions. The dissemination plan would enable the program to expand to include
public libraries in Texas, Illinois (Chicago) and South Carolina, as well as
school libraries as a secondary audience. Rural sites will be targeted and
distance learning will be used for training when possible. CD ROMs containing
the modules, training videos and a website will be developed to support this
project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
