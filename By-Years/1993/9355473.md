9355473 Cunniff Prince George's Community College is developing and coordinating
a two-day invitational conference for the principal investigators from the two-
year and four-year coalitions that have been supported under the Undergraduate
Faculty Enhancement (UFE)program. In addition, several principal investigators
who have been supported under Calculus and the Course and Curriculum Development
(CCD) that are coalition type activities and other selected individuals with
expertise in coalition building are also attending. A guidebook for individuals
who are developing, planning, and leading coalitions is being written. The
guidebook contains such information as descriptions of successful coalitions,
barriers to coalition building and models for overcoming these barriers, other
potential coalition models, recruitment strategies, evaluation mechanisms, and
methods for sustaining coalitions. Each coalition represented is also developing
as a result of this conference a manuscript for submission to a newsletter or
professional journal about their coalition activities. ***
