Cartilage is an important component of the vertebrate skeleton, but its
evolutionary origin is poorly understood. Neural crest cells evolved in
vertebrates and are required for the development of numerous vertebrate-specific
characters, including cartilage within the head. The central goal of Dr.
McCauley's research is to determine how the evolution and development of
cartilage in vertebrates is related to the duplication of a single Sox E gene
that is also present in invertebrates. The duplicated SoxE genes, Sox8, Sox9,
and Sox10 play an important role in neural crest specification, but the
importance of this gene duplication to the evolution of facial cartilage is not
known. Dr. McCauley will use a molecular approach to interfere with the function
of individual Sox proteins in a primitive vertebrate, the sea lamprey, to
determine their roles in the development of cartilage from neural crest. The
lamprey was chosen because of its primitive relationship to other vertebrate
species. Results of this research are expected to reveal how lamprey SoxE genes
regulate cartilage development and whether the fundamental developmental
mechanisms of cartilage formation derived from neural crest cells are common to
all vertebrates. This research will have broad impacts for the scientific and
education communities. These studies will integrate research and higher
education and will involve undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds in
original laboratory research, in addition to training graduate students and
post-doctoral investigators. Results will be of interest to a diverse audience
since studies on the "primitive" lamprey are relevant to understanding the
evolution and development of "advanced" model vertebrates. Techniques developed
and used in this research will also be applied to a laboratory course currently
under development by Dr. McCauley. Students in this course will learn how
molecular, developmental, and bioinformatics tools are used to address questions
related to the evolution of novel traits.
