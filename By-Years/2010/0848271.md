The 16th International Congress on Nitrogen Fixation will take place June
14-19th, 2009, in Big Sky, Montana. This meeting attracts over 400 participants
from around the world to share research, establish collaborations and bring
synergy and synthesis to the many interdisciplinary projects on the topic of
nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation remains a very significant topic given the
challenges of world population growth with respect to world agriculture and
human nutrition. While much progress has been made in the field, much is still
to be learned and very difficult work remains. The program includes well known
keynote speakers, plenary sessions as well as more focused concurrent topic
sessions, as well as poster sessions while providing ample time for one on one
interaction. The subject matter of this conference has evolved over the years,
ranging from very basic research to applied biotechnology and includes cutting
edge sections on molecular biology, ecology, and applied production methods.
Funds are requested to partially support attendance of young researchers
(graduate students, postdocs, or junior faculty).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The conference has a
history of being inclusive of young scientists as well as women. The Organizing
Committee is making a special effort to encourage the attendance of colleagues
at institutions that serve significant populations of underrepresented students
to establish contacts with these students. This conference provides an
opportunity for young research scientists to interact with diverse international
scientists is an important component of training the US workforce for a global
research endeavor. This will facilitate networking and establishing
collaborative ties with international groups. Enhancing the use and management
of biologically fixed nitrogen will result in important environmental,
humanitarian, and economic benefits.&lt;br/&gt;
