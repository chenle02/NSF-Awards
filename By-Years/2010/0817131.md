Ongoing activity in the nervous system and how it impacts sensory and other
inputs is the subject of much recent experimental activity. In particular, it is
clear that the intrinsic interactions between neuronal circuits in absence of
inputs can have a strong impact on how the system responds to incoming stimuli
even at the large scale cognitive level. Thus, nonlinear dynamics methods will
be applied to problems in theoretical neuroscience dealing with this question.
Specifically, the research group will study the propagation of spontaneous and
evoked waves in neuronal networks as well as the conditions for synchronization
in these systems. The effects of both pulsatile and frozen noise inputs on
oscillatory networks of neurons will also be studied. A particular question of
interest is how input correlations interact with intrinsic activity to shape the
output correlations. Finally, the group will study how different ionic currents
and modulators shape the ability of neurons to synchronize their behavior and
how they respond to external inputs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How humans perceive
the world is governed both by the sensory inputs with which they are constantly
bombarded and by their previous experience. This experience, as well as the
natural wiring of the nervous system, shapes the spontaneous behavior of our
brains and this spontaneous activity strongly modulates the sensory inputs. In
this project, computational and mathematical models of neurons are used to
understand what kinds of spontaneous behavior are possible, how this depends on
the wiring and how this activity interacts with sensory inputs. For example, if
many neurons fire together synchronously as a consequence of both common inputs
and their intrinsic interactions, this could provide a strong signal for the
importance of the sensory stimulus. These studies can help guide experiments
which together with models and theory lead to a better understanding of normal
brain function.&lt;br/&gt;
