Since about 1985, extremely efficient and nonconservative methods have been
developed for the analysis of robust stability of control systems subject to
parameter variations. However, there are no synthesis procedures available at
all. On the other hand, H-infinity control theory has a well-developed synthesis
procedure. This theory, however, is highly conservative when applied to the
parametric stability problem. In this proposal it is intended to develop
synthesis procedures for control problems containing parameter uncertainty. A
promising opening is given by recent results (obtained by the PI's) proving that
the extremal stability margins (including H-infinity margins) occur on certain
manifolds derived from Kharitonov's theorem. This link suggests that H-infinity
(and other classical synthesis methods) might be intelligently tailored to give
nonconservative synthesis procedures for parameter variation problems. This will
form the main area of our research. It is expected that the results of this
research project to have an impact on the analysis and design of control systems
arising in many applications.
