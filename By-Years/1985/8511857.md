This research project involves the design of an Expert EEG system for the
automatic analysis of abnormal electroencephalograms (EEG) and of sleep EEG. The
computer system will use the knowledge and inference schemes used by human EEG
analyzers and engineers to achieve fast, correct interpretation of several
channels of EEG. The problems to be solved are also applicable to the general
problem of detecting aperiodic signals in a noisy environment. More generally,
this work will contribute to better understanding of the methods of Artificial
Intelligence as applied to bioengineering.
