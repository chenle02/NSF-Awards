This project continues the exploration of organometallic olefin metathesis
reactions, which has grown into one of the key tools of modern synthetic
chemists. Applications include the synthesis of small molecules, such as natural
products, and the production of polymers with well-defined structures and
controlled properties. During the current granting period, emphasis will be
placed on developing a fuller understanding of the fundamental mechanistic
underpinnings of these reactions. Further refinement and development of new
catalyst systems are expected to accrue from such studies, in additional to
their intrinsic scientific value. Applications of a tandem strategy coupling
ring-opening metathesis with atom transfer radical polymerization will be used
to produce a variety of new polymer structures such as comb and hyper-branched
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry and the Solid State Chemistry and
Polymers Program of the Division of Materials Research support the research
activities of Professor Robert H. Grubbs of the California Institute of
Technology. Professor Grubbs has developed very powerful catalysts for the
precise construction of organic molecules including those of interest to the
pharmaceutical and polymer industries. The current period of funding will allow
for the further understanding and refinement of the needed catalyst systems as
well as their applications for the preparation of novel polymeric
substances.&lt;br/&gt;
