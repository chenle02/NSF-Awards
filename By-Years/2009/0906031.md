This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009. The
fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Uncovering the
genetic and molecular mechanistic basis for natural variation in gene expression
in the nematode worm C. elegans" for Daniel Pollard. The host institution for
this research is the New York University, and the sponsoring scientist is
Matthew Rockman.

Morphological, physiological and behavioral differences within and between
species are known to arise from heritable variation in gene expression, yet much
remains unclear regarding the genetic and molecular mechanisms by which
expression variation arises. This research utilizes the genetically well-
characterized nematode worm, C. elegans, to address fundamental questions
regarding observed differences in how genes are expressed. The specific goals of
the research are to 1) measure gene expression in hybrids of wild C. elegans, 2)
use computational tools to build a model of how genes are regulated through a
molecular network in C. elegans, and 3) experimentally characterize examples of
regulatory relationships predicted by the model. The results of this project
offer an unprecedented breadth of understanding of the molecular mechanisms
underlying gene expression variation in an animal model system.

Training goals include statistical genetics and causative network modeling
skills. Data, results and publications are being disseminated through open
access websites and journals. Outreach goals are to participate in national and
international research conferences, offer guest lectures, and oversee the
training of students at the sponsoring institution.
