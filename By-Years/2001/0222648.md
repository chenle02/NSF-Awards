This is a proposal for funding in support of the annual Clemson mini-Conference
on Combinatorial Optimization, now in its 16th consecutive year of existence.
This day-and-a-half long conference is held every year at Clemson University,
Clemson, South Carolina, on a Thursday and Friday, usually sometime during the
first two weeks of October. The mini-Conference invites about 12 speakers to
give 40-minute talks on their current research. Speakers are chosen equally
between the fields of discrete mathematics (including combinatorics, graph
theory, operations research and coding theory), and algorithmic computer science
(including computation theory, computational complexity and the design and
analysis of algorithms).
