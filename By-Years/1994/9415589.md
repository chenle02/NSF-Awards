9415589 Schmitt Full water column turbulence, velocity shear and fine-structure
measurements will be conducted in the deep ocean at two sites in the Brazil
Basin (near the western boundary and in the interior) concurrently with a
purposeful tracer release at 3000 m depth. The diapycnal diffusivity in the deep
Brazil Basin will be estimated from the observation from the dissipation of
kinetic energy and thermal variance, and the nergy levels of internal waves and
the mechanisms supporting that mixing will be documented. The microstructure-
based diffusivity estimates, limited by sampling constaints in space and time
will compared with those obtained by the Ledwell and colleagues (OCE-9515598)
from their tracer dispersion. Additional comparisons will be made with the
basin-averaged mixing rates determined from the large-scale budgets of the WOCE
Deep Basin Experiment.
