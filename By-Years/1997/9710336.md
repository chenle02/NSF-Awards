9710336 Krishnamurti Although there have been significant advances in the
forecasting of hurricane track and intensity, especially in the one-to-two day
range, longer range forecasts are much in need of improvement. The principal
investigator and his colleagues will conduct an investigation into the possible
improvements that might be realized through the use of ensemble forecasting for
predictions up to five days in advance. They will focus on three primary areas
of research: (1) further development and parallelization of a very high
resolution regional model for use in forecasting, (2) testing of a new method to
develop the perturbations used in ensemble forecasting, and (3) evaluation of
the overall forecast skill of the FSU global model which employs a physical
initialization (primarily initializing rain rates) compared with operational
forecast models.
