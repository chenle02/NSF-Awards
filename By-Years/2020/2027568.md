The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring climate risk management tools,
including parametric insurance, to the consumer leisure travel, events, and
outdoor recreation markets. This project quantifies the probability of
contextually relevant weather events and presents these analytics through a
suite of tools to help plan for weather variability. The project will make
previously uninsurable weather and climate risks broadly insurable for the first
time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
I project will develop a high-performance data service and application
programming interface (API) for historical weather and forecast data to power an
advanced machine learning data analytics front-end and an actuarial parametric
weather insurance platform. The data service will access over 40 years of
structured historical weather data recorded at hourly and sub-hourly temporal
resolution and at spatial scales of less than 10 km, globally, in addition to
multiple ensemble-based National Weather Prediction forecasts at similar spatial
resolutions. This data service will power a front end capable of millions of
location-specific queries and analysis requests per day. In order to accomplish
the technical objective of second or sub-second access times, the open-source
and proprietary software will need to be used in conjunction with existing cloud
services provided by the leading cloud providers, principally caching,
streaming, and scaling / load balancing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
