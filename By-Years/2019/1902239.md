The Langlands Program is a mathematical framework that unifies questions in many
different areas of mathematics, especially number theory and linear algebra. The
traditional arithmetic Langlands program has been studied for more than fifty
years, and has found significant applications to solving classical Diophantine
equations, such as the solution of Fermat's last theorem. The geometric
Langlands program, which is relatively new, is under rapid development as it is
also connected with other subjects such as geometry and physics, from where one
can draw intuitions. In this project, the principal investigator will explore
connections between these two different facets of the Langlands philosophy by
applying geometric methods to study arithmetic problems. This award will also
provide support for graduate students studying topics related to this exciting
but demanding area of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the
principal investigator will generalize his previous results on cohomological
correspondences between mod p fibers of Shimura varieties, and apply them to the
study of arithmetic level rising problems and the Beilinson-Bloch-Kato
conjecture. Along the way, he will develop necessary ingredients such as the
tame local geometric Langalands correspondence for p-adic groups. The principal
investigator will also continue his study of p-adic aspects of cohomology theory
with coefficients, and compare and relate them with the complex aspects and
l-adic aspects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
