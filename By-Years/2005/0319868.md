This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop
the detector portion of a novel Digital Magnetic Biosensor ("DIBS"). The primary
goal is to establish the feasibility of detecting and counting individual
protein molecules using magnetic reagents and digital detector technology
adapted from existing magnetic data-storage devices. A prototype microfluidic
device will be built and used to investigate detection limits. Products are
envisioned that use multiple DIBS in a wide range of disposable diagnostic
"cards" that are driven by a hand-held analyzer based on a popular PDA platform.
The device will be capable of single molecule detection/resolution, simultaneous
analysis of multiple analytes in a single pinprick-sized sample, giving results
within minutes. An initial conservative target of 1000 molecules per sample is a
first objective.

The commercial application of this product will primarily be in diagnostic
medicine. Applications in remote environmental testing and homeland defenses
monitoring are also possible. The initial targeted customers for these products
are distributed healthcare providers who wish to provide rapid and cost-
effective quantitative immunoassay-based diagnostic tests on site. These include
primary healthcare physician practices, specialist healthcare centers, and
hospital emergency rooms. A large potential secondary market for home testing is
also anticipated.
