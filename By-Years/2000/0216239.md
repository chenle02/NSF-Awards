With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Prof. R.
Graham Cooks of Purdue University will develop a state-of-the-art Kingdon trap
mass spectrometer for high performance chemical and biochemical analysis. This
instrument represents a fundamentally new approach to high accuracy/precision
mass measurements. In addition, its performance should be equivalent to a
Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) instrument, which is
considerably more expensive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will impact the
education of a number of graduate students and postdoctoral associates at
Purdue, who will work directly to develop the instrument or will be involved in
its testing. A set of short courses in biological instrumentation will also be
offered.
