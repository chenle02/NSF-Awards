This I-Corps project proposes to further develop a technology for traffic signal
management in transportation systems. This technology has been evolving through
various research projects since 2002. The proposed technology provides a
solution to meet demands for efficiency, scalability, security and robustness in
the control and management of large-scale time-sensitive industrial
applications. It has been founded on cooperative distributed control
technologies and is capable of addressing the network-in-the-loop challenges,
such as time delay, packet loss and bandwidth allocation, efficiently. It can
effectively integrate distributed sensors, distributed actuators, distributed
controllers, and communication networks to make intelligent decisions over a
physically and/or virtually connected space. This space can be as small as a
room or a building, or can be as big as a community, or even a city. Compared to
the centralized counterpart, the proposed technology does not rely on a
specialized control center but a group of distributed smart control modules
which make intelligent decisions by exchanging information with local neighbors.
It scales well as the network grows with plug-and-play capabilities, exhibits
resilience to the communication delays and robustness to node and link failures.

This technology is a platform technology that meets the critical needs of many
industrial applications, such as: 1) traffic signal management in intelligent
transportation systems, 2) energy management in building management systems, 3)
electric vehicle charging strategies in a municipal parking deck or a community
environment, 4) mobile devices power management in an aggregate level. Further
development of this technology will impact all of these areas and facilitate the
transition trend from centralized control to distributed control, which may
bring about significant advances in the corresponding hardware and software
development for industrial control systems.
