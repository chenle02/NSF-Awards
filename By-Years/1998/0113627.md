This project produces course modules related to critical aspects of aviation for
internal use and projected for external distribution. Modules are considered to
be a part of a course, developed from both technical and policy perspectives,
integrated with other course materials, involving both labs and lectures, and
presented to bring the topic alive, and leave a lasting impression on the
student's professional attitude. The first step of the project involves both
external survey of the field and identification of potential module partners
(importing and exporting) and internal examination of engineering and policy
curricula for most productive module injection and evaluation. The long-range
objective is meeting the criteria for curriculum and institutional certification
as a center for academic excellence in information assurance education. The
modules have an aviation engineering orientation, thus potential high impact on
the aviation and related industries. The project should have a high impact on
the institution, faculty, and students as well. Results are disseminated as both
publications and packaged courseware with extensive website support
