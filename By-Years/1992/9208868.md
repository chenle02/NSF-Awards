The aim of this workshop is to discuss the geotechnical research needs for the
assessment and mitigation of damage to the infrastructure resulting from strong
ground shaking. Infrastructure refers to transportation systems, waterfront
structures, water retaining structures such as earth dams, underground
structures, and in general, any structure built on or of soils. Losses in the
infrastructure due to earthquake damage has been a significant fraction of the
initial construction costs. Assessment and mitigation of damage to the
infrastructure involves identifying the potential damage to the infrastructure
caused by large earthquakes, as well as the research needed to reduce these
losses through improved design and construction methods. A particular focus is
on verification of these design and construction methods. It is motivated by
questions such as: In the event of a magnitude 8 earthquake occurring, can an
estimate be made of the damage to the infrastructure? Are the current methods of
analysis adequate to evaluate the potential damage due to a large magnitude
earthquake and to provide an economic method for strengthening the
infrastructure? These questions can be answered effectively only if the
procedures used for analysis have been verified. This workshop will build upon,
and bring together, the results from recent workshops which addressed particular
aspects of this broader earthquake hazard mitigation initiative. It will be held
on February 4-5, 1992 at the University of California at Davis.
