The present CAREER award integrates research and educational components focused
on the understanding of nuclear properties and their application to the
interdisciplinary field of nuclear astrophysics. The main focus of the research
is to address the question: How were the heavy elements made? The research
component aims at the study of the decay properties of exotic nuclei utilizing
the technique of Total Absorption Spectroscopy (TAS). Measurements will focus on
nuclei along the rapid-neutron-capture process (or r-process), which is believed
to be responsible for the origin of half of the heavy elements. The measurements
will build on the previous experience of the PI in the development and use of a
Total Absorption Spectrometer and will utilize existing equipment at the
National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory together with the implementation
of new proposed equipment, in this case a tape transport system for the removal
of background activity from the detection area. The technical focus of the
research is through the measurement of beta-decay strength distributions of
nuclei along the astrophysical r-process. The beta-decay strength distribution
is the only reliable parameter for constraining the theoretical models used in
r-process calculations and improving their predictive power.

The PI will also establish a unique, new one-week summer school for rising
juniors in the area of nuclear physics. The school will be available to 12
students each summer and provide hands-on laboratory activities as well as
instruction in nuclear physics. Students from schools that do not offer an
undergraduate course in nuclear physics will benefit from this summer school.
Ultimately it is important to increase the number of graduate students in the
field of low-energy nuclear structure physics, which is important not only for
the basic science addressed, but as a training ground for skilled workers in
critical areas of homeland security.
