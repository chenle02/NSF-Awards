In this project, supported jointly by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program and the Atmospheric Chemistry Program, Professor Roberts will study the
interaction of small molecules with well-characterized ice surfaces. These ice
surfaces will be made by epitaxial growth on platinum single crystal substrates,
and characterized by reflection infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
The sticking probability, adsorbed structure, and surface reactivity of a number
of small molecules relevant to stratospheric ozone chemistry will be examined.
Molecules such as hydrochloric acid, hypochlorous acid, and nitric acid will be
studied, with a view toward understanding the effects of ice structure,
adsorption kinetics, and surface reactions on the production of species
important in stratospheric ozone depletion. %%% Reactions occurring on
stratospheric ice particles are thought to dominate the chemistry which results
in the destruction of ozone in the upper atmosphere. Very little is known about
the basic chemistry of the ice surface, and the reactions of relevant small
molecules on this surface. This research project will address questions of
adsorption and reaction of these small molecules, primarily chlorine source
molecules, on well-characterized ice surfaces. Basic information of this type is
essential to a complete understanding and eventual remediation of the depletion
of ozone in the upper atmosphere.
