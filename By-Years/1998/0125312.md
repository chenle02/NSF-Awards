gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large anorthosite bodies associated with high-grade regional
metamorphism and anatectites are nearly restricted to orogens of Precambrian
age. They may indicate different conditions for Precambrian tectonics or
different circumstances of plate interactions, however to test various models
for their formation an accurate temporal framework for the development of
metamorphism, anatexis, melt accumulations and emplacement in orogens is
required. This project will utilize the well studied Adirondack sector of the
Grenville orogeny which contains classic anorthosite plutons to develop a
detailed chronology of events. Results are expected to produce sufficient data
to test models of anorthosite development, which will have applications in other
Precambrian orogenic belts. &lt;br/&gt;
