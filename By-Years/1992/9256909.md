Support of six Traineeships for five years in the area of advanced research
instrumentation will be supported by this action. Cornell has a wide variety of
major facilities with unique equipment for experiments in particle physics and
studies of condensed matter. Trainees under the program would use these
facilities to learn how to devise new methods for measuring quantities of
fundamental physical interest. The technological training would embrace a wide
range of modern and complex specialties ranging from accelerator design and very
low temperature physics to microfabrication and materials characterization.
Major emphasis would be placed upon filling the Traineeships with women and
previously underrepresented minorities. The Cornell Physics Department has
demonstrated its commitment to training women physicists with increasing success
over the past 20 years. The program would permit an enhancement of those
efforts.
