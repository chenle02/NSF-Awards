This project is an airborne field investigation of aerosol hazes in the arctic
troposphere, which will include studies of the emission of dimethylsulfide (DMS)
from the ocean and of the radiative and microphysical properties of stratus
clouds. The project will make use of an instrumented C-131 aircraft owned by the
University of Washington. The arctic summer haze phenomenon is considered to be
important in a variety of arctic atmospheric processes. It affects the radiation
budget directly by modifying the albedo and the thermal infra-red flux at cloud
top levels, and indirectly through the modulating effects on cloud radiative
properties by cloud condensation nuclei (CCN's). In particular, if it can be
shown that DMS emissions control the local CCN concentrations, it may be
possible to identify a biological control of the arctic marine stratus albedo.
The project will make direct measurements of the distribution of arctic haze,
and their chemical, microphysical, and optical properties. The concentration and
fluxes of DMS from the Arctic Ocean will be measured, and their contribution to
the local and global sulfur budgets will be estimated. The observations will
provide data sets that will be used for the validation of satellite-derived
cloud parameters.
