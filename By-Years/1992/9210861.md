Performance of computer vision algorithms is contingent upon the quality of the
input. With uncorrupted data most of the algorithms perform well, however, once
noise is present the results may become unreliable. The noise can appear as
uncertainty about the input and/or incorrect assumptions about the underlying
model structure. A robust computer vision algorithm should tolerate both types
of noise. The methods borrowed from statistics or estimation theory were not
designed for visual data where resistance to data uncertainty and tolerance of
incorrect assumptions are of paramount importance. Good performance for noisy
visual data can only be achieved through robust detection of the consensus among
the outputs of a large number of identical non-robust processes, with a
methodology called the Consensus Paradigm. A similarity exist between the
computational steps of recently proposed 3D object recognition algorithms and
the robust estimation methods. The research will exploit this similarity and
develop object recognition algorithms with improved noise resistance. Results of
the research will contribute to the development of techniques for autonomous
decision making in unfamiliar visual environments.
