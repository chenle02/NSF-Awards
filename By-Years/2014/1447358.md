Cyberphysical systems, systems which combine computing and physical components,
are at the core of our modern infrastructure yet are known to have significant
vulnerabilities to natural and malicious disasters. These vulnerabilities are
not amenable to the simple technological solutions attempted in the past because
they are caused by a very wide range of causes from theoretical to technological
to economic to psychological. We are exploring new and novel approaches to
mitigating these vulnerabilities so that our society and economy can remain
secure and prosperous. We anticipate researchers will proceed to develop
solutions for use across the entire range of our national infrastructure.
