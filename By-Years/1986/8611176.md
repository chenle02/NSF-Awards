This is an application of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to the
study of ethylene epoxidation over silver, an important industrial process. The
main value of this research will probably be to test the ability of SERS to
provide useful information on catalytic processes. Although the technique has
been around for a decade, there remains great skepticism about its utility for
studying catalysis.
