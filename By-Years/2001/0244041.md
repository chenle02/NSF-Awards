Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CHE-0244041 Date:
1-08-2003&lt;br/&gt;PI: Larive Institution: University of
Kansas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemistry Division award supports a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Kansas
for the summers of 2003-2005. Cynthia K. Larive is the program director and
Mikhail Barybin is the co-PI. Twelve students will carry out research with
faculty and research groups in the chemistry department over a ten-week period.
Student recruitment will be principally from Kansas and the 17 states roughly
bounded by the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Students will work on
their choice of more than 28 projects in all areas of chemistry. Many of the
projects are interdisciplinary in nature. Twenty per-cent of the mentors have
appointments in Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry. The students will
participate in weekly meetings and seminars to discuss research methods,
results, and career opportunities. They will prepare a mid-term oral report, a
final written research paper and participate in a poster session during the
final week of the program. &lt;br/&gt;
