This is a joint research and educational program that focuses on an
interdisciplinary study of adaptive behavior in complex systems whole behavior
is determined by the dynamics of interaction that do not lend themselves to
simple models, abstraction, or simulation. The project aims to develop a strong,
coherent program of courses, seminars, laboratories, and research projects
within the Brandeis Center for Complex Systems whose goal is to promote
interaction among faculty from related fields, and to provide undergraduate and
graduate students with opportunities for interdisciplinary research and
training. The project uses imitation as the domain for studying multi-
representional cognitive systems, and applys it to three experimental areas: 1)
dynamics simulation, using a physically realistic human model, 2) robotics,
using a group of up to 24 mobile robots, and 3) software agents, using two
different multi-agent simulations. Imitation involves the interaction of
multiple-representations from perceptual, memory, and action/motor subsystems,
thus bringing up the key integration issue of Artificial Intelligence and
Control. Imitation is a rich domain for scaling up complete, multi-modal
cognitive systems, and insights from this work can be applied to various
applications spanning different branches of AI, including skill learning,
automated assembly planning, cooperative multi-robot systems, and multi-agent
cooperation.
