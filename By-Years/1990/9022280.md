Professor Kingsland is examining the careers of three important but relatively
neglected American botanists of the early twentieth century: Daniel T.
MacDougal, a physiological ecologist; George H. Shull, a geneticist; and Edward
M. East, a geneticist. All three were pioneers in the development of
experimental approaches to evolutionary biology and in the formation of the
disciplines of ecology and genetics. Though located at different institutions,
their research overlapped in several ways. With this grant, Professor Kingsland
is exploring the relationship between "pure" and "applied" science by studying
the economic and institutional context of their work, especially the
applications of their research to environmental management and agriculture. She
is also considering the role of the private patron (the Carnegie Institution) in
influencing the direction of research at the turn of the century. She is using
these case studies to bring into clearer focus the agricultural and
entrepreneurial context of American experimental biology in the early twentieth
century. In so doing, they can also help us to understand the form and character
of modern American science.
