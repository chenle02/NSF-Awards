With support from the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Division of
Chemistry, Professor Miriam Freedman and her graduate and undergraduate students
at Pennsylvania State University will study the freezing behavior of atmospheric
particles, or aerosols. Aerosols catalyze the formation of clouds in the
atmosphere, which can be composed of liquid water, ice, or a mixture of these
phases. Ice particles in clouds can form by the freezing of aqueous droplets
below -38 degrees C, or ice can form on the surface of an ice-nucleating
particle (INP) at warmer temperatures. How particles nucleate ice on a molecular
level is not well understood. To investigate the surface features that promote
the ice nucleation process, the approach used in this project is to work with
materials in which the surface can be infinitely tuned and probed. The goal of
this project is to provide a framework for understanding which surface features
are important for ice nucleation and the relative importance of these different
features. This project is important for atmospheric scientists developing models
of cloud formation. In addition, this project is of interest to the physical
chemistry community because it deals with phase transitions, catalysis, and
surfaces. Ice nucleation experiments are ideal for the inclusion of
undergraduate researchers, often leading to publications with undergraduate
coauthors. Results from these studies will be incorporated into undergraduate
course lectures. Students performing this work will also be engaged in public
outreach to families as well as continuing education for members of the wider
community.

This project characterizes the ice nucleation behavior of inorganic systems as
well as organic and biological systems. Similarities are hypothesized between
mineral, organic, and biological ice nucleating particles (INPs) in terms of how
structure determines the ice nucleation behavior. For inorganic systems, the
role of functional groups and surface composition will be characterized using
functionalized gold nanoparticles, porous metalosilicates, and spinels. In terms
of organic and biological systems, this project aims to characterize the role of
hydrogen bonding on ice nucleation through studies of virgin and aged
microplastics, ice-nucleating bacteria and their isolated proteins, and
poly(vinyl alcohol)/poly(vinyl acetate) with different degrees of hydrolysis.
Experiments will be performed primarily using immersion freezing, which is a
dominant pathway for ice nucleation in the atmosphere.
