Engineering-Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;This project creates inquiry-based laboratory
modules to expose students to nanobiotechnology and increase specific skills in
nanomaterial synthesis and characterization. The specific topic areas of the
modules are 1) nanopatterned antibacterial surfaces, and 2) creation and
characterization of nanostructures for use in bioimplants. The topics areas are
intentionally multidisciplinary to enable students to spend time on one
scientific concept and learn several biology and nanotechnology laboratory
techniques in one unit, and to encourage multidisciplinary team work. The goals
of the modules are to increase skills in nanomaterial synthesis and
characterization, develop experimental skills, augment student interest and
confidence in pursuing the subject matter, and encourage students to pursue
higher level nano-courses as well as research projects. The course is targeted
to sophomores from across engineering and science.
