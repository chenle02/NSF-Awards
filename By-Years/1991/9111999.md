Muscle contraction is driven by conformational changes associated with portions
of myosin molecules when they are attached to actin filaments. This shape change
results in a sliding motion between these two muscle proteins and thus,
shortening of the entire muscle. Attempts to understand the dymamics of this
system have relied on two approaches: (1) experiments that employ rapid
mechanical transients applied to activated muscle and (2) mass action models
that treat these proteins as independent chemical species. Our research re-
examines these two approaches with a combination of theoretical and experimental
approaches. From a theoretical standpoint, we will show that rapid mechanical
perturbations applied to single muscle cell preparations lead to propagating
waves of internal strain and that these waves may account for the behaviors that
have been incorrectly attributed to mysosin kinetics. Using recent experimental
methods that employ high - speed laser diffractometry, we show such waves occur
and we use such data to corroborate our theoretical predictions. We will also
develop a new theoretical approach for modelling thedynamics of interacting
proteins. In this new approach, we relax the assumption that each myosin
molecule acts independently. Instead, we argue that the kinetics of each
molecule can be represented as an oscillator whose behavior depends on the
kinetics of its neighboring myosins. This system of coupled oscillators can
yield kinetics of an ensemble of molecules that is vastly different from the
kinetics of each individual. These two approaches challenge the classic views of
muscle as a system of slow, independent molecules whose kinetics can be
extracted from experiments employing rapid mechanical perturbations.//
