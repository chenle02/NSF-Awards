9409538 Hemker This Research Initiation Proposal is to study the creep behavior
of some of the new high temperature structural materials which are expected to
be used in the aerospace and automotive industries. Monotonic and transient
mechanical creep testing will be combined with quantitative transmission
electron microscopy in order to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms that
control creep in TiA1- base alloys and composites. The ultimate purpose of this
project is to gain insight into the mechanisms that can be used to improve the
creep resistance of these alloys and composites. ***
