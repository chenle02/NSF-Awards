The aim of this project is to put new and cutting-edge computational
applications in the hands of high school students in after-school club settings
in underserved communities. These tools will allow the students to build
tangible and ubiquitous computing applications that will find genuine utility in
the communities that surround the schools. For the first half of the project, we
will be planning with our partner schools and making connections in the adjacent
communities. We will also be crafting the initial technology platforms for the
students. The final phase of the project will entail high school students
working jointly with researchers to build community-centered applications. New
insights will be gained on how to develop toolkits for young designers and, for
the young designers, how to design and evaluate computational applications. This
work will also suggest new ways to engage underserved communities in building
and using the nation's information
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
