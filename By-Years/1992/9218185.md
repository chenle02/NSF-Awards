This grant is in support of the second Topical Meeting on Nonlinear Optics
(Optical Society of America): Materials, Fundamentals and Applications. This
conference will be held August 17-21, 1992, in Maui, Mawaii and will provide a
forum for discussion of optics; including new phenomena, novel devices, and
advanced materials. Topics covered will include: Fundamental Studies; Nonlinear
Optical Materials; Wave mixing and Phase Conjugation; Surface Nonlinear Optics;
Fibers and Waveguides; Nonlinear Cavity Electrodynamics; Ultrafast Nonlinear
Optics/Lasers; and Novel Nonlinear Optical Phenomena and Applications.
