In cooperation with the California Department of Insurance (DOI), data will be
collected on insurance claims for damages and losses sustained in the October 1,
1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake. The DOI has already queried the 650 companies
underwriting in California as to their total losses due to this earthquake. This
study involves a second questionnaire, conducted with the cooperation of DOI,
requesting detailed information on each and every loss claim paid out, by each
company. The results of the study will be detailed information on losses, for
all lines of insurance. Loss information of this nature has not previously been
collected on an industry-wide basis. Availability of this information will
permit more accurate determination of the effects of deductibles, and of the
relation of building shake loss to other losses, such as fire, inland marine,
workers compensation, auto, etc.
