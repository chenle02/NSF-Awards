The Power and Controls Laboratory under development is directly tied to several
lecture courses in the electrical engineering and will be capable of
demonstrating to students a wide range of systems and component oriented
experiments. Experiments are in the areas of solid state machine drives (power
electronics), load-frequency control, and energy management. The major equipment
items used to carry out these experiments are several microcomputers dedicated
to operating a motor- generator and power electronic machine drive combination.
In addition, a master station microcomputer (control center) serves to supervise
system operation once the machines are interconnected. The laboratory facility
thus permits students to study realistic and timely issues. The significance of
this facility is primarily in producing competent engineers to meet the present
and future needs of industry and the nation.
