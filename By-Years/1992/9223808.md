The Bodega Marine Laboratory of U.C.-Davis will undertake an instrumentation
development project to develop a position- determining archival tag for
monitoring the movements of marine vertebrates. This small microprocessor-based
tag will be equipped with sensors that will store (archive) environmental
measurements from which geographical location can be derived. The work involves
the modification of a commercially available tag that is used for terrestrial
applications. Sensors will measure irradiance as a function of time for
determining longitude and total geomagnetic field intensity for determining
latitude. Temperature and pressure will also be measured. Data will be stored in
a file and when the tag is retrieved and the data examined, the movements of the
tag over time can be determined. The archival tag has potential application in
studying the migratory patterns of pelagic fish, such as tuna, and marine
mammals. NOAA/National Marine Fisheries Service is collaborating with this
project.
