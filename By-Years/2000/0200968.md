Anne McCoy of the Ohio State University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to investigate photoinitiated processes in
weakly bound clusters theoretically. The following three categories of processes
will be examined: (1) ultraviolet photodissociation of binary complexes in which
the dissociation induces a bimolecular reaction, (2) reaction dynamics
photoinduced in complexes by vibrationally exciting one of the cluster
molecules, and (3) cluster size effects on transition state dynamics of IHI
clustered with argon atoms and the photodissociation of water clusters with
argon atoms. Studies of photoinitiated processes in clusters pose serious
challenges theoretically and computationally. A significant component of this
research will involve developing approximate approaches that will enable
treatments of at least some of the degrees of freedom classically in the
dynamics studies, as well as investigating hybrid quantum/classical methods for
propagating the dynamics.

Clusters of molecules provide a laboratory through which interactions between
molecules can be examined both experimentally and theoretically. Clusters cannot
be considered simply as the sum of their constituent molecules, as the cluster
environment generally changes chemical reactions of the complexed molecules.
This research will explore theoretically cluster chemical reactions, many of
which can be compared to related experimental results of current interest.
