This project will support the study of effective and robust strategies for the
solution of large linear systems that arise from the discretization of elliptic
boundary value problems. Major emphasis will be on the solution of non-self-
adjoint, indefinite problems, e.g., the exterior Helmholtz problem. Both
preconditioning strategies and computational strategies on parallel machines
will be investigated. In the area of preconditioning strategies, the objective
will be the derivation of estimates of condition numbers as well as the
distribution of eigenvalues and singular values of the preconditioned systems.
The preconditioning of pseudospectral discretizations by finite difference or
finite element discretizations will also be studied. In the area of
computational strategies, the effectiveness and implementation of various
preconditioning strategies on SIMD and MIMD computer systems will be studied. In
solving boundary value problems for elliptic equations numerically, it becomes
necessary to solve the very large systems of linear equations that arise when
the continuous problem is replaced with a discrete problem. The principal
investigator will develop numerical methods that are both efficient and robust
for solving such systems.
