The generative entrenchment of an entity is a measure of how much of the
generated structure or activity of a complex system depends upon the presence or
activity of that entity. It has been demonstrated that entities with higher
degrees of generative entrenchment tend to be more conservative in evolutionary
changes of such systems. Models of complex structures incorporating the effects
of generative entrenchment have demonstrated their relevance in analyzing and
explaining a variety of developmental and evolutionary phenomena. Professor
Wimsatt and his graduate student will extend prior simulations and analyses of a
variety of cases, problems and investigations of a number or results on the
evolution of gene control networks. They will extend the work of Kauffman, of
their own work, and others to investigate the influence of different degrees of
generative entrenchment on the behavior of these networks and their evolution.
Since virtually any system exhibits differential degrees of generative
entrenchment among its parts and activities, these studies and results have in
addition broad potential application for theoretical, simulation, and
experimental analyses in a number of areas. These areas include: developmental
programs and their significance for evolution, macroevolutionary change, the
innate- acquired distinction and investigations using it in linguistics and
cognitive psychology, developmental constraints, constraints on the evolution of
complex adaptations, and even in the analyses of scientific change.
