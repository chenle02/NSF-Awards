TITLE: CAREER: Reliable Peer-to-Peer Data Preservation&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION:
Harvard University&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Roussopoulos,
Mema&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL NUMBER:
CNS-0447075&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT FOR AWARD:&lt;br/&gt;The
amount and variety of content being published online is growing at an
exceptional rate. Online publishing enables content to reach a much larger
audience than paper publishing but offers no guarantee of long-term access to
the content. This work investigates techniques for building a large, reliable
peer-to-peer system for the preservation of online published material. The
system consists of a large number of low-cost, persistent web caches (peers)
that cooperate to detect and repair damage by voting in "opinion polls" on the
content of their cached documents. The peers are autonomous and mutually
suspicious. Project activities include: 1) investigating defenses against
adversaries whose goal is to modify content without detection or to disrupt the
preservation process; 2) performing a foundational study of the interconnections
between identity, trust, and reputation models in peer-to-peer systems; and 3)
developing, analyzing, implementing, and testing new protocols that address the
high frequency of updates of online government documents, the large volumes of
scientific data, and the privacy concerns of sensitive medical data. This work
is being evaluated using a real testbed being deployed at 100 libraries around
the world with the support of publishers representing over 2000 titles. The
broader impact of the work is that all electronic material preserved through the
system including academic journals, government documents, and scientific and
medical data will remain accessible to generations of citizens. An important
component involves the development of new courses that incorporate this research
and the development of the Women in Computer Science Organization at Harvard.
