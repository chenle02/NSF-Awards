With the guidance of faculty adviser Dr. Brent Mishler at Duke University,
graduate student De Luna will complete a taxonomic study of the tropical
American group of mosses of the family Hedwigiaceae. Field collecting in several
South American countries will supplement collections already made by the student
from Mexico and Central America. Laboratory culturing of the mosses will provide
additional critical growth stages. The scientific study of evolutionary
relationships among plant species has benefited from new sources of data and new
methods of analysis. Mosses are particularly suitable for an empirical
evaluation of the use of developmental (growth stage) data in systematics.
Growth experiments under controlled conditions will provide data about the
ontogeny and heritability of features used in moss classification, and allow
evaluation of the variability and reliability of these characters. The research
will result in an improved classification of these tropical mosses, through the
use of quantitative and cladistic analyses of developmental anatomy and
morphology. In turn, questions about their biogeographic relationships with
North American and African forms can be addressed.
