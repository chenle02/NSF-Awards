This award will provide funds for the support of a workshop on Antarctic
regional-scale synoptic meteorological processes and their representation in
numerical forecast models. Its objectives are to assess our current
understanding of physical processes at high southern latitudes and to provide a
means for formulating specific experiments to generate new information so that
necessary parameterizations within numerical models can be tested and improved.
The workshop will be held at the National Center for Atmospheric Research on
February 4-6, 2003.&lt;br/&gt; Nearly every study that addresses issues of
global change identifies the polar regions as among those most sensitive to
climatic shifts. The Antarctic continent is a particular importance in global
change scenarios because of its massive ice sheets and potential impacts on sea
level change. In addition, numerous teleconnections between Antarctica and lower
latitudes over time scales ranging from synoptic periods to those associated
with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and beyond have been documented in
recent years. However a physical understanding of how Antarctic processes are
linked to those over the rest of the globe is still lacking on all time scales.
A prerequisite for investigating and understanding the links between Antarctica
and the rest of the globe is a thorough understanding of regional physical and
synoptic processes and transports to and from the continent. Proper
representation of Antarctic processes is basic to global change studies,
especially since Antarctic transports are strongly tied to local topographic and
mesoscale processes that are currently not resolved within global climate models
(GCMs). These considerations have been brought together in the Ross Island
Meteorological Experiment, a basic and applied research program, designed both
to highlight and remedy current gaps in our knowledge of Antarctic synoptic
processes.&lt;br/&gt;
