As computers become pervasive, an increasing number of information rich
applications are being deployed that create, store and access sensitive and
critical information. An enabling service that can be used to store and access
such information must meet both security and performance requirements even when
some nodes that implement the service are compromised or when some clients
behave maliciously. This research project focuses on a number of novel
techniques for building an agile and secure store that can meet the needs of
future applications. First, a flexible and agile architecture for a distributed
store is investigated to allow applications to dynamically adapt their desired
security and performance levels. Second, the agile nature of the store requires
the detection of potential compromises and malicious activity. New protocols
that adapt to such suspected attacks are explored. Finally, a variety of
ubiquitous applications that need to access sensitive information are
investigated. The characteristics of such applications can help quantify the
overheads that are inherent when the conflicting goals of security and
performance have to be reconciled. &lt;br/&gt;
