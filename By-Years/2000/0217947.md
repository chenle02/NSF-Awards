0217947&lt;br/&gt;Komanduri &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award
supports a US-India collaborative research project in mechanical engineering
entitled Magnetic Field Assisted Finishing Process. The investigators are Ranga
Komanduri of Oklahoma State University (OSU) and Vijay Jain of the Indian
Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK). The primary focus of their research is
the finishing of advanced materials by magnetic field assisted polishing. Their
collaborative work will have a direct impact on ultra-precision machining and
finishing of advanced materials. This is an area of high current interest and
will contribute to fundamental understanding of the ultra-precision machining
process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The US PI is a recognized leader in the
development of magnetic float technology and has established a state-of-the-art
research facility at OSU. They have been one of the most active groups in the
finishing of advanced materials in the U.S. The Indian PI, an expert in magnetic
abrasive finishing processes, is also well recognized for his work in
manufacturing. Their collaboration will advance technologies in each of their
complementary areas and, by taking advantage of their combined knowledge base,
they intend to extend their studies to a new technology, the magnetorheological
abrasive flow finishing of advanced materials. This project will support an
international experience for a US graduate student and result in stronger
cooperation between OSU and the IIT,Kanpur. This project is jointly funded by
the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Design,
Manufacture, &amp; Industrial Innovation. &lt;br/&gt;
