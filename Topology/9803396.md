9803396 Mosher A central theme of geometric group theory is that finitely
generated groups can be studied geometrically by attempting to classify them up
to quasi-isometry. In one part of this project, the investigator, working
jointly with B. Farb of the University of Chicago, will attempt to show that if
G is a finitely generated group that is quasi-isometric to a solvable group,
then G is very closely related to some solvable group by simple algebraic
operations, with special attention to fundamental groups of 3-dimensional solv-
manifolds and other polycyclic groups. In another part, joint with M. Sageev,
the investigator will work on constructing new examples of word hyperbolic
groups that have high codimension but are not closely related to arithmetic
lattices, a problem posed by M. Gromov. Continuing a long-term effort, the
investigator will study the following weak version of W. Thurston's
Hyperbolization Conjecture, namely that if M is a compact 3-manifold, then the
fundamental group of M is either word hyperbolic or else contains a subgroup
isomorphic to a free abelian group of rank 2. This part will make use of tools
developed in previous joint work with U. Oertel as well as new tools of ``coarse
algebraic topology'' developed recently by geometric group theorists. Continuing
another long-term effort, the investigator will work on showing that if M is a
compact hyperbolic 3-manifold, then only finitely many different pseudo-Anosov
flows are needed to compute Thurston's norm on the second homology of M. Groups
are the mathematical abstraction of symmetries of geometric objects. Symmetry
patterns of wallpaper, bathroom tiles, and the tilings on the walls of the
Alhambra in Spain give examples of Euclidean symmetry groups. Many of Escher's
paintings give examples either of Euclidean or of hyperbolic symmetry groups.
This project will cover several topics in geometric group theory, the general
study of geometries and their symmetry groups. By matching the large scale
properties of a geometry with the large scale properties of its symmetry groups,
one can use geometries to study groups and vice versa, a very fruitful pairing
that has led to many recent mathematical advances. The investigator, working
with Benson Farb (U Chicago), will study a special class of groups known as
``solvable groups,'' a generalization of Euclidean symmetry groups. Working with
his colleague Michah Sageev, he will investigate new generalizations of
hyperbolic symmetry groups. He will also continue work on long term efforts to
understand 3-dimensional geometries and their symmetry groups, as well as to
study 3-dimensional dynamical systems. ***
