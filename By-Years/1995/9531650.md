Dr. Quang Shen and other members of the Chemistry Department at Colgate
University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects in the areas of inorganic, organic, physical, and
polymer chemistry, as well as biochemistry. Students work side by side with
their mentors, meet weekly as a group, present final written and oral reports to
the department, and present their work at their home institution and at a
national research conference.
