9503716 McEwen This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Research grant will support the
collaborative research of Dr. Alejandro de Nicola of Argentina (Instituto de
Biologia y Medicina Experimental) and Dr. Bruce McEwen of the U.S. (Rockefeller
University) to investigate the role of Na,K-ATPase in the amygdala in the
control of salt appetite in the rat caused by injections of deoxycorticosterone
(DOC). The effects of the mineralocorticoid agonist, aldosterone, as well as the
glucocorticoid receptor agonist, Ru 28362, on the amygdala and hippocampus will
also be studied. The laboratories of both Drs. de Nicola and McEwen are well
established and recognized for the high quality of research which has come out
of them. The questions proposed generate much interest in the scientific
community; in particular, the neural basis of steroid control of salt appetite
in rats is recognized as an important problem. Both in Argentina and in New
York, young scientists will be given an opportunity, as part of this grant, to
participate in an important area of research in well-equipped laboratories. ***
