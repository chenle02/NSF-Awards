This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a
biologically-inspired image search and recognition technology to provide rapid
object information retrieval from a mobile phone camera. The end result is that
potentially any object in the real world is now "clickable": a picture of an
object provides a hyperlink to the Internet. The proposed system utilizes a new
method for sparse, multi-scale image representation based on the monogenic
signal, a 2D generalization of the analytic signal that is robust to image
transformations.

By 2010, it is estimated that there will be over 1 billion mobile phones with
cameras.The mobile phone is becoming an important connection between people and
the digital world. The applications for mobile search technology are enormous
and include national homeland security, product information retrieval (such as
environmental ratings, pricing, or specifications), vision support for the
blind, accessing object information for the disabled, and general purpose
information retrieval including remote visual data analysis and inspection.
Search technology has brought about many profound societal, educational and
scientific benefits in the past decade. The proposed mobile image search
technology will extend those benefits to a broader base of users and
applications.
