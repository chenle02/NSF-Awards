This award provides support to Dr. Christina Romer under the National Science
Foundation's Faculty Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers Program. The
objectives of this program are to recognize the nation's most outstanding and
promising women scientists and engineers in academic careers in research and
teaching, to retain them in academia, and to facilitate the further development
of their careers. This award will allow the investigator to pursue her research
interests which focuses on the nature and causes of business cycles in the
period before World War II, in the hopes of learning more about how the modern
economy operates and about what can be done to prevent or mitigate business
cycles in the future. Three projects will be undertaken. The first will analyze
the role of macroeconomic policy stabilization of real output during the Great
Depression. The second will involve examining whether monetary and fiscal
policies in the post war era have tended to in general to counteract or
exacerbate movements in real output. The third project will extend the PI's
previous work on historical macroeconomic data. Her previous work has shown that
since the conventional series is seriously flawed, it is important to look for
new and better sources of prewar data.
