This proposal is a collaborative effort of four colleges ( Georgetown
University, Canisius College, University of San Francisco, and Seattle
University) to incorporate biotechnological concepts and laboratory experiments
into high school science curricula, particularly biology and chemistry. The
project is an outgrowth of a successful teacher enhancement project at
Georgetown University under the leadership of Dr. Chirikjian in the area of
biotechnology. Teachers and college scientists at the three other institutions
participated in the 1987 summer program at Georgetown in preparation to serve as
lead teachers and project directors in their areas in this project. During the
Georgetown project, a laboratory kit and reagents were developed to facilitate
conducting the key experiments in high school science classrooms. In addition,
during this project, a set of key technique videotapes will be developed to
assist teachers in implementation efforts. Participating teachers have assisted
in the design refinements of the kits and reagents to assure their most
effective use in high school classrooms. Georgetown University staff will
provide staff and materials support to the satellite colleges in the initial
years of the project. School district and local private sector support will
augment NSF funding in the implementation of the project. The project will be
fully implemented in each of the satellite colleges during the period of this
project and plans will be developed for the continuation of appropriate project
related activities after NSF funding ceases. This project is worthy of funding
because of the importance of incorporating this important area of science into
high school classrooms, the kit and reagents being developed specifically for
the high school audience, the model of dissemination and cooperation among
colleges and universities on a national level and the commitment of the PIs and
teachers to continue the project activities at the conclusion of the project.
