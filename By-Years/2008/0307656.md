The aim of this project is to make engineering education attractive to students
of all backgrounds, races, and gender by including the excitement of open-ended
research, i.e. neither student nor teacher knows the right answer. The project
utilizes the ROBOLAB toolset, developed by the PI over the past 5 years, which
is a combination of LEGO hardware and LabVIEW software and allows students to
predict, investigate, test, and understand math, science, and engineering.
ROBOLAB, designed for students of all ages, provides the tools and gives
students self-confidence to satisfy their curiosity and to understand math and
science. The project combines new directions in both research and education by
integrating the virtual world with the real world of ROBOLAB, and tests new
informal education efforts, that include integrating math, science, and
engineering education with movie cinemas and the Internet.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are to investigate how the
kindergartner and the university students learn engineering, to enhance the
robotics toolset by combining it with the chemical-mechanical planarization
(surface polishing process in semiconductor manufacturing) research, and to
increase the collaboration of all institutions (K-12 and university) dedicated
toward bringing open-ended research problems into the classroom as a teaching
method. The project includes education and engineering graduate student teams, a
faculty team, some in engineering, some in education, and partners with
industry, government institutions, and international science centers, which
provide support and dissemination structures for these efforts. &lt;br/&gt;
