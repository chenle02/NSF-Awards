Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;This project will introduce new technology
into the introductory Principles of Biology laboratory at Columbus State
University. The technology would support and maximize the impact of inquiry-
based activities built around the learning cycle approach to science education.
Specifically, computers and graphing calculators will be interfaced with an
array of probes and sensors to facilitate measurement, quantitative analysis,
and presentation of&lt;br/&gt;data. These skills are now critically lacking in
our students. The use of these instruments will better engage students in
laboratory activities, allow them to experience the use of technology in modern
biology, and enhance their ability to visualize and understand the biological
phenomena they are exploring in the laboratory. Outcomes will be assessed
through comparison of learning and attitudes among students who use the new
technology with students who carry out similar experiments without the
technology. DUE themes addressed by the project include integration of
technology in science education, professional development of science faculty,
preparation of future science educators, and participation in science by women
and underrepresented minorities. Participation of the PIs in appropriate
workshops and specific efforts to share their experiences with colleagues will
ensure professional development. Student demographics at CSU guarantee
significant involvement in the project of women, underrepresented minorities,
and future teachers. Project results will be disseminated through publications
and presentations at regional and national meetings, and products will be
disseminated through publication on a web site devoted to the
project.&lt;br/&gt;
