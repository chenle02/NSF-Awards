The purpose of this fundamental bioengineering research is to produce a model
which will permit the prediction of the adaptation of trabecular bone
architecture to stress. It is possible that this fundamental knowledge could
lead to the accurate prediction of a stable form of bone implant and prothesis
design. The unique feature of the model is that it should permit prediction of
bone remodeling over a period of time.
