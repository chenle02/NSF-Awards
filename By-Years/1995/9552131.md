The computer science department is developing a course laboratory component--
based on a networked computer laboratory-- for its upper-division undergraduate
course on the principles of telecommunication and computer networks. Students in
this course benefit from well-designed programming assignments that illustrate
and reinforce the principles discussed in lecture classes. The laboratory adapts
easily to different network hardware and software configurations, enabling
students to fully explore a wide range of telecommunication issues, from bit-
level signal transmission to Internet exploration. Advanced students from
related departments benefit as well as computer science majors. The computer
laboratory is also used to enhance exploration of traditional, networked, and
distributed operating systems in the computer operating systems course. This
project presents the student with an integrated view of telecommunications and
operating systems. Project development and results will be recorded and
disseminated through workshop participation, conference presentation, and
journal publication.
