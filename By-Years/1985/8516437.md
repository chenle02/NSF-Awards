A two-day tsunami research workshop is conducted to develop a viable research
strategy and plans for future research in tsunami engineering. The research
needs and interests from other federal agencies that are involved in tsunami
research including the Department of Commerce (NOAA), USGS, and the Department
of the Navy are assessed. Tsunamis are a major hazard to lives and property in
the U.S. coastal areas including California, Hawaii, and Alaska. Since 1946,
tsunamis in the U.S. have caused 355 fatalities and an estimated loss of coastal
recources of over 1/2 billion dollars. A need for a tsunami research planning
meeting has been widely felt within the tsunami research community and within
federal agencies that support activities related to tsunamis.
