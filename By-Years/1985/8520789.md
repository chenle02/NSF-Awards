Studies are conducted on the dynamics and relaxation behavior of glassy
polymers. Experimentally, the methods of modern high-resolution NMR of solids
will be used in conjunction with a recently developed dilatometry technique as a
probe of the molecular motions and chain-packing effects in glassy polymers. In
particular, the investigator will perform so-called CPMAS NMR experiments on
polycarbonates under high carbon dioxide pressure to obtain information on the
effects of absorbed gas molecules on the molecular motions and chain packing.
The investigator will also use multiple quantum NMR to obtain new information
about the extent of correlated motion of the polymer in the glass and to
correlate the NMR experiments with macroscopic properties, e.g. dynamic
mechanical loss. Theoretically, the investigator will use a combination of
computer simulations, phenomenological model building, and statistical mechanics
to understand the relaxation processes in glassy polymers.
