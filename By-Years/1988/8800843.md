Norman Johnson will continue his research in finite projective geometry. This
involves the study of abstract planes comprising finitely many points and lines
joining them. The motivation for this research is a desire to build a bridge
between classical projective geometry and synthetic incidence geometry. The
objects of study are sets of parallel classes of lines called nets. Johnson will
study the structure of covered nets. In order to do this these nets will be
characterized as objects in certain projective geometries and these in turn will
be used to determine the structure of the net.
