This proposal requests funds for a Biochemical Resources Facility to be operated
by an interdisciplinary core user group of seven researchers from the
Departments of Chemistry and Biology. The facility will be a comprehensive
protein chemistry laboratory, including instrumentation for peptide
purification, amino acid analysis, peptide sequencing, and peptide synthesis.
The facility will be supervised by a full-time director, and a technician will
be employed. The major research interests of the core users are: enzyme
mechanisms and enzyme mimics, protein structure, receptor recognition, and gene
control. The request is well justified, and funding is recommended.
