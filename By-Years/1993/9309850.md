9309850 Fabes This Americas Program award will support a research
conference/workshop in Harmonic Analysis and Operator Theory to be held in
Caracas, Venezuela from January 4 through January 8, 1994. The meeting, jointly
organized by Prof. Eugene Fabes of the University of Minnesota and Prof.
Wilfredo Urbina of the Universidad Central de Venezuela, will serve to honor
Prof. Mischa Cotlar on his 80th birthday and provide an opportunity for
Venezuelan and other Latin American mathematicians to establish contacts,
exchange ideas, and develop cooperative research activities in the subject area
with leading mathematicians from the U.S., Europe, and other Latin American
countries. Professor Cotlar's career in Latin America has been notable, not only
for his outstanding research but also for his role in educating many of the
leading mathematicians from the region. The conference will serve to give an
overview of the current research areas in which Professor Cotlar is active and
will encourage communication and cooperation between the participants. ***
