This proposal is concerned with questions which arise from the desire to
compute canonical bases for associative algebras. The principal investigator
will develop a theory of Groebner bases founded on a vector space approach. He
will study language- theoretic properties of a straightened basis and will use
word combinatorics to simplify and bound algorithms. Finally, he will connect
these new techniques to an older theory of p-filtrations as well as push an
earlier, successful search for crystal invariants further. Given a finite
dimensional algebra, every element of the algebra can be written as a
combination of a finite set of elements which is called the basis. This basis is
not unique. This project is concerned with finding a basis such that there is an
effective method of determining what elements can be written as a combination of
this basis. This work is an important step towards the use of computers in this
field.
