This EAGER proposal, augmenting basic materials and device research in
integrated polymer/living tissue structures, opens an exciting new area in
engineered materials. Upgrading from the planned inkjet printer to the new
generation of materials plotters in this exploratory project will enable the
rapid integration of organic structural, sensor, actuator and electronic
components into fully functional devices at many scales. The applications for
robotics and cyber-physical systems include 3D polymer MEMs with integrated
organic electronics, neurons and even muscle tissue into polymer mechanical
devices, variable-focus vision systems and new approaches to polymer muscles.

Broader Impacts: This equipment will advance discoveries in multiple materials
and device studies in projects across a number of academic departments. The
research will broaden participation by providing the critical hardware for three
female PhD students in the PI's labs, two of which are funded by NSF GRFs. The
equipment will be made broadly available through a new user-service facility,
enhancing infrastructure in multiple disciplines.
