This project will aim to establish a quantitative framework for integrating
multi-sensory visual data in computer vision. Using the methods of variational
calculus, the information from multiple visual sources will be embedded to
achieve the goal of object surface reconstruction and recognition. In robotic
applications spatial reasoning is important. Spatial reasoning means vision,
task planning, navigation planning for mobile robots, symbolic reasoning and the
integrating of such reasoning with geometric constraints. To the extent spatial
inferences must be made from information gathered from multiple sources the
ideas developed in this project on integrating information sources are an
important adjunct to spatial reasoning. Since the formulation of the problem
favors concurrent computing, both computer vision and spatial reasoning will
benefit from this research.
