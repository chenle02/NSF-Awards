An emerging question in plant biology is whether plants display analogous
elements of mammalian-programmed cell death (apoptosis) during development and
pathogen attack. With respect to plant-pathogen interactions, cell death occurs
in both susceptible disease and resistant host responses. For example, in
resistant reactions, specific recognition responses in plants trigger formation
of the "hypersensitive response" (HR) and activation of host defense mechanisms.
HR triggers a cell death pathway resulting in restriction of pathogen growth and
disease development. Historically HR has been considered a product of necrosis,
but several studies have suggested that cell death during HR involves activation
of a plant-encoded program for cell suicide that may resemble apoptosis.
Susceptible interactions also result in host cell death although it is unclear
to what degree (if any) the host participates in this response. Recent data
obtained in my laboratory strongly suggest that during disease development in
pathogen infected susceptible tobacco plants, apoptosis is occurring. Hallmark
characteristics of apoptosis, including discrete DNA fragmentation (e.g., DNA
ladders) and nuclear condensation have been observed. These apoptotic responses
do not occur in the transgenic, disease resistant tobacco. Based on these data,
as well as reports from other laboratories, it appears that elements of animal
cell suicide are functionally conserved in plants. The central hypothesis of
this research is that plants share certain features of apoptosis with animals.
The goal of this project are: (I) to identify and characterize plant genes which
functionally resemble those found in animal apoptosis pathways and evaluate
these genes in resolution, the cell death process in plants. An understanding of
how plants regulate cellular suicide will provide information regarding plant
response to environmental stress and have the potential to generate effective
disease resistant plants.
