On-line Process Analytical Technology (PAT) is needed in enabling
biopharmaceutical companies to significantly improve drug quality and
productivity. Current in-situ monitoring in production plants and laboratories
is still mainly based on measuring temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, pressure,
airflow, and liquid flow. These parameters do not give information on cell
viability, cycle, size, autophagy and apoptosis that are metrics to indicate
reproducibility of the bioprocess. FDA suggested key PAT technologies such as
near-infrared, mid-infrared, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence and imaging, and
mass spectroscopy, are all under active development, but with limitations of one
kind or another, such as limited sensitivity, difficult to use, and high cost.
Dielectric spectroscopy is also studied as a promising approach, but not yet
appropriate for PAT due to limited sensitivity and information contents.

This project involves a novel radio frequency (RF) interferometer technique for
On-line Process Analytical Technology (PAT) instrument development. The obtained
radio frequency (RF) probes exploit novel interference processes to enhance
sensitivity while applying novel tuning mechanisms to cover broad frequency
ranges and tune sensitivity for robust system operations. The RF probes are
expected to have unprecedented sensitivity and robustness to analyze cell
viability, autophagy, apoptosis, and size in a label-free and non-invasive
manner. Many of these cell properties are not available in other PAT methods.
The electronic approach is expected to enable mass produced low-cost and easy-
to-use PAT instruments.
