The PIs uill define the global-scale ionospheric-thermospheric system with a
focus on diurnal characteristics and seasonal controls under solar maximum
conditions. Using data from SUNDIAL, the PI will provide comprehensive seasonal
coverage of the solar maximum period. Analysis will establish the weather and
climatology of the ionospheric-thermospheric system for spring/fall equinoxes
and summer/winter solstices under solar maximum conditions. Data will also
establish boundary conditions on the NCAR TIE-GCM coordinated modeling efforts,
which should define model inputs on the EUV and x-ray regions of the solar
spectrum, as well as the components of the thermospheric tides, their amplitudes
and their phases. Project results will advance understanding of thermospheric
winds, electric fields, and ionospheric density distributions, and establish and
important baseline for defining weather and climatology of the ionospheric-
thermospheric system for all seasons of the solar cycle.***
