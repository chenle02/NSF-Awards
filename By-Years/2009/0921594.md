This project examines proposals for Islamic law in Western democracies, focusing
on the United Kingdom and Canada and assessing the implications of these
proposals' adoption or rejection. Muslim citizens in several countries have
sought an arena of state-sanctioned Islamic law for use within their own
communities. The response of both lawmakers and the public in these countries
has been generally hostile, on grounds of women's rights and the principle of
democratic secularism. However, it is likely that as Muslim minorities in Europe
and North America become both larger and more politically active, demands for
Islamic law in some form will become more common. This is not a matter of a
"clash" between Islam and democracy, but of a debate over what democracy
requires or allows with regard to religion, law, and rights. Does democratic
pluralism extend to the legal realm, or does this put at risk a consensus of
fundamental values that makes democratic politics possible?

This project investigates three key elements of the issue: (1) current and
recent Islamic law proposals, (2) the variables that affect why, and where, such
proposals are put forward, and (3) the factors affecting the popularity of, or
hostility toward, such proposals in Muslim communities and in the general
population. The project uses a mixed-methods approach combining field research
and secondary-source research. This allows both extensive investigation of the
two primary cases and examination of several additional cases to provide greater
comparative context.

The question of Islamic law in the West is a crucial one that will shape the
character, and possibly the legitimacy, of democracy in states where it has been
longest established and most deeply entrenched. This project addresses an
understudied issue that is becoming increasingly important to scholars in
political science, law, and other fields, as well as to policy makers in several
countries.
