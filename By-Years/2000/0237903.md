Computational comparison of biosequences is fundamental to modern biology. It
is the fastest, most widely used technology to annotate the functional elements
of a newly sequenced genome. Algorithms for comparison must address the rapid
increase in the size of sequence databases and the need for more sensitive tools
of multiple alignments, as well as the need to compare inferred feature models.
Enhancing the pattern-matching algorithms that form the heart of fast comparison
tools is the focus of this research. A research framework for rational pattern
design and a technique for combining pattern matching with substitution score
matrices will be incorporated. Pattern matching generalizes the word-matching
heuristics of alignment algorithms. The choice of pattern can impact the search
speed and sensitivity. The improved search patterns will be specialized to
particular feature types, such as coding sequence, or to groups of organisms.
Collaborations with popular search tool developers are established and will help
integrate the new methods. Research training involves students at many levels
and will also form the basis of cross-disciplinary student exchanges.
