This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research in
support of the 2013 Materials Research Society Spring Meeting titled "Design of
Cell Instructive Materials" is cofunded by the Biomedical Engineering program in
the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems.
This Materials Research Society Symposium will focus on applying basic science
and engineering principles that advances in designing cell instructive materials
with emphasis on materials to study mechanotransduction, the response of cells
to materials, drug and gene delivery, and spatial and temporal regulation of
signals. The planned sessions will provide a cutting-edge scientific program and
discussion forum that focus on specific fundamental and applied science and
engineering challenges that, when overcome, will facilitate the translation of
biomaterials and tissue engineering sciences to biomedical applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program serves to educate biomaterials and tissue
engineering communities in the highly relevant field of developmental biology
and to stimulate discussion in current approaches from materials research,
engineering and biological perspectives. The symposium has not only excellent
geographical diversity, but also includes many women, young investigators, and
industrial researchers among the invited speakers and discussion leaders.
Participants will have the opportunity to interact with leading scientists
throughout the conference, and will be able to present their own work. The
planned poster session by students and junior faculty members is expected to be
effective means to convey scientific information as well as to develop important
synergies and interactions with professional colleagues.
