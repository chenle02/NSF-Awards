A machine's physical memory is a resource for which many subsystems, including
databases, persistent object storage managers, and multimedia file systems, are
potential competitors. As memory size grows, optimizing the diverse uses of
physical memory will require diverse management policies. These policies must,
however, coexist, and the claims on memory for different uses must be balanced.
This research investigates a system architecture for balancing the requirements
of memory competitors, while allowing a greater variety of management policies
to be implemented. The system architecture permits pageout daemons situated
outside the kernel to control pools of physical memory. This allows subsystems
such as databases much greater control over memory management policy. A balance
manager within the kernel controls the size of these pools. A simulator is used
to explore the interactions of management policies, while a prototype system,
supported by an extended version of Mach 3.0, allows the experimental validation
of the simulation results. Successful completion of this project will provide a
framework for managing large physical memories in future machines. Using the
balancing strategies identified in this research, subsystems for memory-
intensive application will be more readily developed and installed on new
machines without ad hoc performance tuning.
