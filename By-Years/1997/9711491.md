ABSTRACT ATM -9711491 Aizen, Vladimir B. University of California, Santa Barbara
TITLE: Simulation of Snow and Glacier Runoff in Central Asia Alpine Watersheds.
The objective of this research is to carry out improvements in physical regional
modeling of snow/glacier melt runoff in the Central Asian river basins of Tien
Shan and to analyze the long term water balance dynamics in this region. This
involves important hydrological data set development over the region to
calibrate and then to validate the model developed. Based on such a model
development long term changes in river runoff over this region will also be
analyzed. Successful completion of this project will help analyze water balance
dynamics over mountainous snow/glacier fed river basins.
