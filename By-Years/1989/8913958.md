This project will contribute to the theory of Markov texture models under
perspective projection. Dr. Cohen is extending his work on Markov-based texture
identification and segmentation to include 3-D perspective distortions, thus
developing theoretical tools for texture analysis and establishing a baseline
technique to which other perspective texture modeling approaches can be
compared. The Markov texture models may be of particular use in machine vision
and in computer graphics.
