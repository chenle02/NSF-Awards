The objective of this project is to study the control of articulated objects
performing complex actions. Motion analysis will be approached from a
computational perspective viewing actions as directed by coordinated processes
that specify torques and forces on objects to accomplish purposive behavior. The
project will study the problems that arise when objects have many degrees of
freedom, when tasks lack precise specification, when unpredictable events and
interactions with other objects are commonplace, and when the consequences of
actions cannot be precisely determined before the action is performed. The
project will emphasize fundamental principles for programming complex physical
object. Methods for representing objects, specifying tasks, and reasoning about
actions will be addressed. Techniques for adaptive, event driven control of
concurrent motor functions will be investigated. Particular emphasis will be
placed on coordination and methods for maintaining stability and balance. The
work will contribute to the ongoing design of a system in which theories of
action and control can be easily posed as computational processes and
empirically tested in simulation. The physical object simulator Newton will be
used to accomplish the work.
