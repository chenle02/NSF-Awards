This industry internship project will be carried out in conjunction with MILCO,
one of the largest textile industries in the country. The main products of MILCO
are TRICO fabric for internal use as well as for sale to other companies, and
ladies' sleep wear for wholesale supply to large stores. Currently, MILCO has
significant problems in maintaining high productivity due to space limitations
and the lack of an efficient computerized production planning and inventory
control system. The objectives of this project are: (1) provide MILCO with
analytical tools to study the various alternatives to solve their plant layout
problem, (2) improving their marking and cutting operations, (3) help them to
develop a long-term strategy for production planning and inventory control and,
finally, (4) establish a future collaboration with MILCO to work with research
problems of their interest. It is also expected that the knowledge gained in
this project will have a significant impact on the Principal Investigator's
long-term development as researchers and teachers.
