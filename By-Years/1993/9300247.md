The Molecular Physics Laboratory (MPL) at SRI International will become a site
for the National Science Foundation's Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) program. The REU program provides talented undergraduates in science,
mathematics, and engineering the opportunity to participate in active research
projects during the summer. The MPL has developed a world-wide reputation for
its fundamental and applied research in collisional and radiative processes
involving ions, atoms, and small molecules. This REU Site Award will permit
significant expansion and unification of SRI's efforts to contribute to the
advancement of undergraduate education in science. SRI is particularly
interested in providing a research experience for women, minorities, and persons
with disabilities and will make strong efforts to recruit members of those
groups.
