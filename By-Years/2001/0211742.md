In higher plants, each pollen grain contains two sperm cells that are delivered
to the embryo sac. One sperm fertilizes the egg and this fusion gives rise to
the embryo that eventually grows into the plant. The other sperm fertilizes
another cell in the embryo sac and this second fusion gives rise to the
endosperm, a nutritive tissue in the seed that is required for the development
of the embryo. Double fertilization is arguably the developmental process of
most economic value in crop plants, because most foods are seeds or arise from
seeds. Double fertilization was discovered over 100 years ago. But because of
the relative inaccessibility of plant gametes, the molecular biology and
mechanistics of this unique feature of the higher plant life cycle are barely
understood. In order to exploit gametes for crop improvement, it is necessary to
know more about them. To facilitate a more global understanding of plant gamete
gene expression, cDNA libraries will be constructed from isolated sperm, eggs,
and embryo sacs of maize. More than 5000 cDNAs from each library will be
sequenced. Expression profiles for about 200 diverse cDNAs from each library
will be determined. Plants with fluorescently-tagged gametes will be constructed
to facilitate analysis of gamete function in gene disruption lines, and to
facilitate imaging of fertilization. Functional analyses will focus on genes
predicted to encode surface-localized proteins that might mediate critical
cellular interactions during double fertilization. All sequences and stocks from
this project will be available to the research community. With this information
about maize gamete gene expression, comparative genomics can be used to identify
and manipulate gamete-expressed genes in diverse plant species.
