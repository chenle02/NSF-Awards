This proposal request will assist in the purchase of surface profile and thin
film thickness measurement equipment which costs $35,135. This equipment will be
used for the accurate measurement of thin deposited films or a thin etched layer
of semiconductor material and assist in the electrical and chemical
characterization of silicon carbide films currently grown on silicon wafers by a
CVD process, but proposed to be grown using rapid thermal annealing techniques
in this laboratory. The equipment will significantly enhance the scope and
quality of research at the Solid State Laboratory of the Department of
Electrical Engineering, the Department of Metallurgy and the College of
Engineering Surface Analysis Laboratory. It will contribute immediately to
research currently being conducted, which is supported by the Semiconductor
Research Corp. and NASA, and will open future new research avenues.
