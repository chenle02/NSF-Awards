The PI requests funding to overfly the Iowa River corridor to capture imagery
of the 2008 Midwestern flood ? a potential 500 year extreme event. The
overflights are scheduled for 19-21 June 2008 and will use airborne laser swath
mapping to carefully analyze flooded areas in Iowa. The objectives are to
interface the lidar-based map products with soil erosion models in order to
determine sediment load provided to the watershed outlet (Gulf of Mexico), to
refine estimates for total nitrogen washout from agricultural lands using both
mapping and in situ measurements, to better understand drainage channel geometry
in the flooded watershed, and to constrain the drainage channel hill slope
morphology in order to refine water residence time modeling. The unique aspect
of the proposed research is the ability to combine large-scale high resolution
mapping technology to understand a rare (perhaps 500 year) flooding event. Using
lidar mapping, the PI may feed geomophological data into large scale two-
dimensional flood wave propagation models within the Iowa River watershed. In
addition, high-resolution bathymetry data will be coupled with high-resolution
free-surface maps in order to follow post-flood changes in the main channel
morphology. Ultimately, the high-resolution mapping products will be
incorporated into predictive models to assist managers at all levels, from civic
planning to emergency response. The magnitude of flooding observed in Iowa
demonstrated the limitations of current FEMA 100-year and 500-year flood maps,
primarily caused by poor accuracy and resolution. High-resolution mapping will
provide managers with the tools needed to model and understand the 2008
Midwestern flood and will provide a basis for better understanding river
morphology. Data will also be useful in estimating nutrient loading to the Gulf
of Mexico which may impact the dynamics of the dead zone. With billions of
dollars lost each year, more accurate flood and geomorphology data are timely
and of broad interest.
