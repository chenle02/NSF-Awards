Middlebury College seeks to modify its experimental SCIENS (Science Core
Instruction and Experience Network System) program. The modified program will
offer twenty-six students a short course in the summer following the sophomore
year of high school and a summer research following the junior year. The course
will include activities in biology, chemistry and biochemistry, physics, geology
and computer sciences. Research opportunities for students will be available in
cell biology, organic and biochemistry, bedrock geology, and laser physics. The
targeted population is minority students with high abilities. They will be
selected nationwide. The population will be evenly divided between males and
females. Twenty students will participate in the SCIENS core course. Six student
will be selected from that group for participation in the research component.
The program supports participation by low-income students by replacing lost
summer income. The project staff are all faculty at Middlebury College. Project
activities occur at Middlebury College, at the High Pond Research Station, and
in the thousands of acres of college and national forest land surrounding the
college.
