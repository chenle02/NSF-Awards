Addressing issues of bounded rationality in economics has long been recognized
as an important yet difficult problem. There has been a tremendous increase in
research on complexity and bounded rationality in game theory due to the
application of the notion of an automaton from computer science to problems in
economics. This project can be divided into three areas: (1) continuing work on
automation complexity but with a major focus on stochastic Bayesian games
(repeated games with incomplete information); (2) applications of complexity
analysis to economics; and (3) investigations of some new methods of bounding
complexity in extensive games. The project will make important methodological
contributions. The work on stochastic Bayesian games is important because it
allows rigorous studies of decision making with differential private
information. The research will contribute to our understanding of important and
as yet unresolved issues such as the scope of equilibria attainable by bounded
players, rule rationality versus full rationality, Bayesian updating by bounded
players, and language and complexity. The project will apply strategic-
complexity analysis to such important economic problems as market segmentation
and the design of coordination of complex organizations using many bounded
players.
