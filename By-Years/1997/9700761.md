Gross 9700761 The principal investigator will continue his study of Calabi-Yau
threefolds, which are complex threefolds with vanishing first Chern class.
Various aspects of their geometry will be addressed. He will continue developing
tools of deformation theory in order to understand how various moduli spaces of
Calabi-Yau threefolds interconnect. These tools will also be applied to study
the deformation theory of rational Gorenstein threefold singularities, which can
give insights into four-dimensional birational geometry. Calabi-Yau threefolds
will also be considered in light of the recently proposed construction of
Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow for mirror symmetry. Among other issues this will
involve studying the nature of special Lagrangian torus fibrations and the role
that special Lagrangian submanifolds play in the geometry of Calabi-Yau
manifolds. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic
geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had
a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated
figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but
from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
