This award supports airfare travel expenses for U.S. participants in the "Fourth
International Conference on Recent Advances in Applied Dynamical Systems," held
at the Zhejiang Normal University in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province, China, on 16-20
June 2010. The conference centers on recent research in applied dynamical
systems and bifurcation theory, with emphasis on complex systems and stochastic
models.

The meeting features invited lectures by leading researchers. Abstracts of the
conference talks, as well as presentation slides, will be posted on the
conference web site. The meeting includes a round table discussion on open
problems and directions for future research, a report from which will be
published in the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Dynamical
Systems Magazine (DSWeb; http://www.dynamicalsystems.org/).

The conference brings together experts and junior researchers in applied and
random dynamical systems and bifurcation theory, and it serves as a venue for
developing communication and establishing collaborative research among research
groups from the U.S., China, Japan, and other countries. Priority for travel
funds is given to graduate students, postdocs, junior mathematicians, women and
minorities, and researchers without other sources of support.
