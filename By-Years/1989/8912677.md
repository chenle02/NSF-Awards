This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Donald Treiman, Department of
Sociology, University of California at Los Angeles, to pursue with Dr. Sylvia
Moeno, Senior Lecturer, Sociology Department, University of South Africa
(UNISA), for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative research. This
research project, part of a larger effort, will add South Africa to the list of
nations embraced by a rich tradition of comparative research in the attainment
of social status. Poised on the threshold of major social change, amidst the
continuing disparity in socioeconomic outcomes among Whites, Asians, Coloureds
and Blacks, this country offers a heretofore neglected, strategic research site
for the study of the effects of race and ethnic group membership, residential
location, the availability and quality of schooling, and explicit patterns of
racial segregation and discrimination on the social and economic outcomes of the
population. The project will ultimately survey approximately 12,000 households
sampled by race and type of residential location so as to be representative of
all major racial groups in the country. An indigenous organization known for the
quality of its work among all racial groups and composed primarily (80 percent)
of black South Africans will collect the survey data under the direction and
with the participation of faculty and graduate students from UCLA. Retrospective
work histories, residential histories, and educational histories will be
solicited and combined with other data to facilitate a subsequent comparative
analysis of the determinants of inter- and intra- generational mobility within
race and ethnic groups. The principal investigator is one of the foremost
American sociologists doing comparative work in this area and has the
credentials and skills to carry out this project in cooperation with black South
African colleagues.
