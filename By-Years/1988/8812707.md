A relatively high degree of self-knowledge is generally assumed when information
about people's values is elicited for public policy purposes. This assumption
may be appropriate when people are familiar with a good and have extensive
experience in valuing it. However, the available empirical evidence suggests
that people may care about such things as maintaining a clean environment,
reducing perceived risks, or protecting their health without really knowing much
about the good in question or their own value for it. In particular, people may
be unable to make even simple trade-offs involving such goods, let alone the
ratio comparisons required by monetary measures of value. This award involves a
three-part sequence of studies that will attempt to develop the key elements of
a general theoretical framework to assess the nature of expressed values and the
compatibility of value structures and value elicitation approaches. The research
examines the way individuals define their values within different response
scales and policy context. It then investigates how learning about the good
itself and about the policy context changes individuals' expressed values. The
research will result in alternative conceptions of the valuation processes that,
by more accurately portraying the source and structure of individual values, is
also able to lead to improved methods for choosing between competing public
policy alternatives.
