ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number 0234689&lt;br/&gt;TITLE Verifying Properties
of Systems Software&lt;br/&gt;PI Alex Aiken&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
focuses on enforcing critical properties in software such as device drivers,
high-performance servers, network protocols, and embedded systems. The plan is
to design, build and experiment with an analysis tool for C and C++ programs
that will achieve two goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) It will check the full
range of critical properties of systems software, from low-level checks, such as
preventing buffer overruns and null pointer dereferences, to high-level,
program-specific&lt;br/&gt;checks, such as verifying the steps of a protocol are
executed in the correct order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) The tool will be used
for investigating the trade-offs between static (at compile-time) and dynamic
(at run-time) enforcement of properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impacts of
this work should include: first, a better understanding of when it is sufficient
to use the weaker but less expensive (in programmer effort) checking at runtime
instead of static checking at compile-time; a coherent model of how to integrate
very low-level and high-level program checking in a single system; and a
prototype tool that others without specialized knowledge of program analysis can
use to improve the quality of complex systems written in C and
C++.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
