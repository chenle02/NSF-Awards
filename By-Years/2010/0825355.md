Earth is in the midst of a global biodiversity crisis. Species are disappearing
at alarming rates. The causes of these extinctions are complex, but emerging
diseases play an important role, particularly for amphibians. Ten years ago a
new disease caused by a deadly fungus was discovered in frogs. This chytrid
fungus has now infected hundreds of species all around the world. Despite
intensive research efforts, little is still known about how chytrid kills frogs.
This project will use new genomic based techniques to study chytrid. Whole
genome sequences (the complete genetic information encoded in chytrid DNA) will
be obtained for chytrid strains from different parts of the world and from
different environmental conditions. This work will help elucidate why certain
strains of chytrid are more deadly than others and will help identify particular
genes that are important for chytrid's ability to attack frogs. This project
takes a cutting-edge approach to an important disease problem and will benefit
conservation efforts in frogs. Results from this research may also provide more
general clues about the genetics of fungal pathogens, such as those affecting
humans. From an educational standpoint the findings from this research can be
used as a teaching tool to show how creative approaches to environmental
problems can have a positive impact on global biodiversity.
