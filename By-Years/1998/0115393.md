This proposal seeks to examine the adaptation of firms in the U.S. machine tool
industry to changes in their environment, to understand the factors affecting
firms' capability to transition to computer-numerically controlled designs and
modular production techniques, as well as more extended relationships with
customers required by this equipment. Many U.S. manufacturers lacked the skills
to respond, and as a result employment in the industry and its importance to the
domestic economy was substantially reduced. Nevertheless, other firms not only
survived but thrived in the changed environment. This study will trace the
responses of U.S. machine tool incumbents to the technological and market
challenges facing the industry between 1975 and 2000 to discern the differences
between failing and surviving firms.&lt;br/&gt;Prior studies have focused on
factors that lead to behavioral inertia, offering little insight for how firms
act when not demonstrating inertia, or how performance is affected by these
behaviors. The researchers suggest that incumbents may exhibit three types of
responses to change: (1) They may continue with their existing strategy; (2)
they may imitate new entrants' products; or (3) they may innovate away from both
their existing products and those offered by rivals. The strategy a firm enacts,
and its effect on the firm's survival and performance is expected to depend upon
the adaptability of the firm's competencies at the time of competitive
challenge. Thus this study goes beyond extant literature by empirically
investigating the proposed tradeoff between survival and performance, by
focusing on survivors of radical technological change, and by exploring the
relative influence of accumulated competencies and firm choice in affecting
these outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;
