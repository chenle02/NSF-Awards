The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) proposes a three-year plan to
improve the teaching of undergraduate microbiology at the nation's two- and
four-year institutions. This proposal will also support new faculty and/or
postdoctoral fellows with a commitment to undergraduate teaching. The proposed
program builds on previous experience of the Society in supporting undergraduate
faculty. The project will: Increase faculty members' understanding of recent
advances in the microbiological sciences and their familiarity with the
Society's core content recommendations for the first course in microbiology;
increase the number of faculty who are able to incorporate active learning into
their classroom and laboratory instruction; improve the career development of
new faculty and postdoctoral fellows who are considering academic careers which
will involve significant teaching of undergraduate students; and facilitate
sharing, disseminating, and evaluating resources available to improve the
teaching of microbiology in the lecture hall and the laboratory. The project
will culminate in a forum (the Undergraduate Microbiology Education Conference)
for the development, dissemination, and assessment of effective learning
strategies for the teaching of the microbiological sciences at the undergraduate
level. Activities prior to the forum will increase access to this forum by
faculty from two-year and/or minority-serving institutions who might not
otherwise be able to participate due to financial, disciplinary, or geographic
barriers.
