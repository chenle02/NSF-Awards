The Eighth Southwestern Developmental Biology Conference will be held April
12-14, 1990 in Denton, Texas. The meeting is sponsored by the Society for
Developmental Biology, which states in its guidelines: "Regional meetings are an
important activity of the Society for Developmental Biology....The function of
the Regional Conference is to provide a more informal opportunity than national
meetings for the exchange of information on development. Participation by
graduate students, postdoctorals and junior faculty is particularly
encouraged...." The meeting will adhere to this goal. This will be achieved by
inviting three prominent speakers to present different aspects of developmental
neurobiology. In addition, developmental biologists from the Southwestern region
will be encouraged to present recent and preliminary findings from their
laboratories. Such an arrangement will give the students in the Southwest an
opportunity to meet investigators from a specialized discipline and reinforce
their knowledge about research projects pursued in their own geographic region.
