The project is studying the feasibility of using high level programming
constructs which directly express the parallelism in an algorithm. Although
parallelizing compilers for sequential programming languages provide good
results for some numerical codes, namely those with regular communication
patterns, such compilers are not effective in extracting parallelism in dynamic
programs. The methodology used in this project is to express a computation as a
collection of encapsulated, asynchronous fine- grained objects, or actors, which
interact by sending each other messages. The project is studying ways of
reducing the costs associated with managing fine-grained objects and messages.
Moreover, because efficient execution on concurrent computer architectures also
requires architecture-specific placement (and migration) strategies, the project
is studying methods to allow code for placement to be independently expressed
and combined with code for the logical operations in an algorithm. The advantage
of such a separation is to allow portability of the algorithmic code across a
wide range of concurrent architectures. ***
