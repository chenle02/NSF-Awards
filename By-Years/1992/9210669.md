The project develops a better understanding of competitive strategies of
multiproduct firms in the specific context of retailers. The research will
involve both theoretical and empirical analysis of competitive strategies. The
theory relies on a game theoretic framework with an important feature often
absent in such cases. Consumer decisions are endogenous to the theoretical
model, and are predicated on information provided by firms. Where information is
lacking, consumers have expectations which are fulfilled in equilibrium, i.e.,
rational expectations. Empirical work spans an examination of supermarket
pricing and advertising strategies over a long time, and a study of consumer
patronage of supermarkets in the same market. Thus, the empirical study follows
the theory which treats both firms' and consumers' decisions as endogenous. The
empirical study provides insights into specific institutional mechanisms.
However, the model is general, thus providing insights into the phenomena of
multiproduct firms and multifaceted competition which are becoming increasingly
important. Finally, the research will move marketing science away from its focus
on a single brand to the case of multiproduct firms with multiple strategic
options.
