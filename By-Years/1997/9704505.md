Karatzas DMS-9704505 We propose to train a Post-Doctoral Research Associate,
for two years, in the various mathematical and computational aspects of modern
Finance, combining the strength of Morgan-Stanley's fixed income research group
with the mathematical ewxpertise of the Columbia University faculty. The Post-
Doctoral Fellow will be able to benefit from the expertise of both groups, and
will act as catalyst for transfer of knowledge between them. The Post-Doctoral
Fellow will be expected to help develop a mathematical framework for the
valuation of American-style derivative securities on interest-sensitive (fixed-
income) instruments, and to develop accurate and fast numerical techniques. The
problem is of considerable practical importance, and requires advanced
mathematical tools, such as stochastic differential equations, martingales and
optimal stopping, partial differential equations and Monte-Carlo simulations.
