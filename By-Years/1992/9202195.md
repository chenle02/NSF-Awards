In November, 1991 Galeras Volcano in Colombia showed numerous signs of impending
eruption, very similar to those of the neighboring volcano Ruiz just before it
erupted a few years ago with a loss of over 20,000 lives. This grant will enable
the PI and his student to go to Colombia before any eruption comes and establish
a small seismic network on the flanks of the volcano. They will then try to
correlate seismic tremors with specific gas emissions as determined by COSPEC.
This information about the relationship between seismicity and gas emission
could be very important in attempts fo predict future eruptions of similar kinds
of volcanoes. If no eruption occurs while the PIs are there, local geologists
will use the equipment to make measurements when and if it does occur.
