This project investigates the possibility that changes in DNA methylation play a
role in the early stages of speciation. In the process of screening amplified
fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) in the copepod Tigriopus californicus,
particular regions of DNA were found to be methylated in one population but not
in another. Further, hybridization between populations appeared to induce
changes in methylation. This SGER seeks to more definitively test for
methylation differences between parentals and hybrids by using methylation-
sensitive AFLP to screen a large number of loci in a much wider cross than was
used in the past. Because the distribution of methylated DNA throughout the
genome is poorly known in invertebrates and wholly unknown in this particular
species, a locus-specific technique will be used to assay methylation at
selected microsatellite, ribosomal DNA and protein-coding loci.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such work has medical implications due to the role of DNA
methylation in processes ranging from transcription regulation to spontaneous
mutation to carcinogenesis. If hybridization-induced changes in methylation are
confirmed, this has considerable implications for conservation and management
practices aimed at promoting intermixing between populations. Both undergraduate
and graduate students will participate in the project and learn a variety of
techniques in molecular and evolutionary genetics.&lt;br/&gt;
