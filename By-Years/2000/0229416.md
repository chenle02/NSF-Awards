This award supports a pilot ice-core drilling and analysis program to test the
feasibility of obtaining well-dated, high-resolution isotope and chemistry
records from East Antarctica. Shallow ice cores will be obtained from two
locations: 1) ~100 from South Pole towards North Victoria Land, as an extension
of the Byrd Station-to-South Pole ITASE traverse [International Trans Antarctic
Scientific Expedition]; 2) at Taylor Dome, near the original deep coring site.
Each of these cores will be sampled at very high resolution (~1/2 cm) and
analyzed for stable isotope (delta D or delta 18-O) at the University of
Washington. The cores will also be analyzed for trace ions at the University of
Maine, under separate funding. The resulting time series, if they can be well
dated as we expect, will be used to calibrate against the instrumental
temperature record, brightness temperature observations from satellites and
operational weather forecast reanalysis data sets. Results from this calibration
work will be used to help plan a program of larger scope, with the objective of
mapping the spatial expression of climate variability in East Antarctica. A
summary document will be produced and made available to the community to help
with planning of related field programs (e.g. deep ice radar, firn radar
profiling, atmospheric chemistry, ice coring, snow surface properties for
satellite observations, ice surface elevation and mass
balance).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
