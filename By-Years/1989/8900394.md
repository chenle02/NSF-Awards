The Research Experience for Undergraduates program was formed by the National
Science Foundation to provide opportunities for undergraduates to perform
research under the guidance of established researchers. It is hoped that they
will find the experience rewarding, and will be attracted to careers in
research. Two types of awards are supported: site grants, and supplements to
existing research awards. This is a site grant, in which Tulane University will
team eight undergraduate students with two faculty members to investigate the
expansion of Petri net modeling capability and its application to computer
networks. Five students will work during the 1989 summer at Tulane, and three
will work at Bell Northern Research. All will work together at Tulane during the
following academic school year.
