Electronic systems based on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) have become
increasingly complex. Evolutionary and revolutionary advances in process
control, CAD layout software, and semiconductor device physics have allowed
circuit designers to place an ever increasing number of devices on a single
chip. In addition, the band width Hx VLSI circuits is increasing as well. All
these advances have led to increasing problems with reliability and testability
of VLSI circuits. The proposal addresses the problems of reliability and
testability of VLSI circuits. The research program will continue ongoing
research in the analysis of electronic performance of VLSI circuits and in the
design and implementation of on-chip test and analysis circuits. In addition,
the proposal addresses the problem of VLSI circuit failure due to ionizing
radiation. The project will support the training of minority graduate students
in this important area over a three year period.
