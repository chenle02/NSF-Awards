This award will provide support to defray expenses of researchers participating
in the Conference on Recent Advances in Harmonic Analysis and Elliptic Partial
Differential Equations that will take place May 8-10, 2009 at the University of
Virginia, Charlottesville, VA. Support will be provided to participants who do
not currently hold NSF awards, with exceptions made for plenary speakers. It is
understood that much of the funding will be directed to graduate students,
postdocs, and junior faculty but that certain senior participants will be funded
as well.

The program of the event will feature about eight plenary speakers, who will
deliver one-hour lectures, and a number of contributed talks. The main aim of
the conference is to give a chance to young analysts to learn about the advances
in the field of Harmonic Analysis and PDE from well established experts in the
field and also to present their research work in front of an expert audience.
Special attention is paid in involving women mathematicians, ranging from
graduate students to senior researchers, in all aspects of the event. Several
graduate students as well as an undergraduate student will participate at the
meeting.
