Theoretical research will be conducted in a number of areas of statistical
physics. The orientational ordering of icosahedral fullerene molecules will be
studied using mean field theory. Intermolecular potentials will be studied which
can explain the orientationally ordered structure and from which a calculation
of the librational excitation spectrum can be undertaken. This will help explain
future inelastic neutron scattering experiments. Research will also be done on
the way quantum fluctuations select a ground state out of a manifold of states
which classically would be degenerate. This work will be based on the use of
degenerate perturbation theory to construct an effective interaction mediated by
quantum fluctuations. Additional research, motivated by the magnetic properties
of the copper oxide materials, will be done on the effects of various types of
localized magnetic defects at low defect densities. Work will also be done on
interpreting the observed properties of antiferromagnets on a kagome lattice by
using high temperature expansions. %%% A variety of projects will be undertaken
in condensed matter physics using statistical mechanics techniques. These
projects have to do with the recently discovered solid carbon-sixty and the
copper oxide high temperature superconductors. These condensed matter systems
pose difficult and intriguing problems which push the limits of conventional
condensed matter theory and, at the same time, hold high potential for real
applications. Successful completion of this work will provide a significant
contribution to this field.
