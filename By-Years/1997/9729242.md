ECS-9729242 Karl Yngvesson Superconducting hot electron mixers for the Thz range
will be explored, promising DSB receiver noise temperatures of 10x hf/k or less.
These receivers will employ : 1. thin film NbN; and 2. new S-Sm-S devices, which
have never been used for this purpose before. The mixers will be integrated with
thin film antennas, and coupled through silicon lenses. The potential for focal
plane arrays of such receivers will be demonstrated.
