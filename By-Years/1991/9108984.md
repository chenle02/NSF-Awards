The goal of this project is to update and rewrite the Transportation Research
Board Special Report 176: Landslides-Analysis and Control, initially published
in 1978. This publication has already achieved an excellent reputation worldwide
as a highway design text, and a repected reference for academics, researchers
and practitioners. The intent of this project is to include in the manuscript
the significant changes and advances that have been made in methods of field
investigation and instrumentation, slope stability analysis, and design and
construction of soil slopes during the past ten years.
