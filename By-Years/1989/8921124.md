The objective of the investigation is to study fundamental aspects of the
initial stages of epitaxial growth in silicide ultra-thin films. Experimental
techniques employed include energy filtered transmission electron diffraction,
quantitative Auger lineshape analysis, and ultra-high vacuum scanning electron
microscopy. The nature of the athermal, initial stage reactions at room
temperature will be explored using amorphized or hydrogen passivated substrates.
Precursor annealing reactions will be studied by measuring thermal activation
energies for competing diffusion and nucleation processes, with emphasis on the
role of epitaxial eonstraints.
