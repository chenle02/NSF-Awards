Information to support decision making can be used substantively to facilitate
the choice process. It can also be used symbolically to justify choices already
made. The majority of prior research has focused on the use of information to
reach a decision and has rarely considered the inherently political nature of
decision-making where managers approach a situation with clear preferences, and
subsequently acquire and use information to support these preferences. This
pilot study will investigate how the symbolic use of information in a large
face- to-face group is related to the decision context through the analysis of
floor statements from the Congressional Record. The research has the potential
to contribute to theory by augmenting existing knowledge of organizational
decision making processes. The pilot study will test and validate the research
design which addresses some of the limitations of prior cross- sectional
research on organizational information processing and which has been criticized
for focusing on individual decision makers in isolation from their environment.
