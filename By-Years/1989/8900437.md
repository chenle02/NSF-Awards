This grant provides for the continuation of the Utah State REU project. The Utah
State REU project has been very successful, taking advantage of Utah State's
large space science program and the university's access to many space science
students. The award provides cash stipends for each of ten students as well as
some travel expenses. The award also supports the PI for 1.5 months to assure
his close interaction with the students of the project.
