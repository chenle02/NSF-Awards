The objective of this proposed research is to develop a mechanical test
technique capable of measuring the mechanical properties (such as yield strength
and fracture toughness) of micron-sized volumes. Research includes development
of the test device as well as development of micro deformation and fracture
mechanism theory related to the application of this test. This analysis
capability should markedly improve our capacity to analyze and fundamentally
understand structure/property relationships for materials in such emerging
technologies as: thin film and surface modified materials; microelectronics;
composite materials; interfaces; and environmental effects, such as hydrogen
embrittlement.
