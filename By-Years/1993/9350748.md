9350748 Jackson The goal of this project is to introduce scientific computation
and simulation techniques into the undergraduate curriculum at Central Michigan
University. To this end, a laboratory-based course is being created as a part of
the Physics curriculum and offered as an elective to students in the other
sciences. The course will be taught as an in-class lab, where the students run
simulation experiments in the class and discuss the results, as well as any
difficulties, with the instructors on the spot. Our team-teaching approach,
pairing a Physicist and a Computer Scientist, stresses sound programming
practices - modular design, proper documentation and program efficiency - as
well as standard numerical and simulation techniques. Computer simulations allow
the students to experiment with realistic systems which cannot be handled by
traditional analytical methods. The course includes a selection of real-world
problems from various scientific disciplines to illustrate and emphasize the
power and broad applicability of the computational techniques. The in-class lab
format and mix of student backgrounds lead to a productive exchange of ideas and
a better awareness of the unity of the underlying science. ***
