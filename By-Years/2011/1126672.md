The primary purpose of the ARIANNA Ultra-High Energy (UHE) Neutrino project is
to observe ~40 cosmogenic neutrinos per year originated by the GZK mechanism
with sufficient precision to determine their energy spectrum and interaction
properties. The energy spectrum of GZK neutrinos provides important insight on
the production mechanism and source distribution of the cosmic rays. In
addition, a statistically significant measurement of the angular distribution of
the diffuse cosmogenic neutrino signal can be used to infer the interaction
cross-section at energies beyond those probed by Large Hadron Collider. While
the physics of the GZK mechanism is straightforward (extragalactic UHE protons
collide with cosmic microwave background photons, producing pions that
eventually decay to neutrinos), answering how the cosmic rays were accelerated
to very high energies is especially difficult because cosmic rays are bent by
magnetic fields in our Galaxy, and their range is limited by the GZK mechanism
to ~100 megaparcecs. There is now a long legacy of successful high-energy
neutrino programs that utilize the abundant and transparent ice of Antarctica.
In particular, ARIANNA relies on the detection of radio pulses generated after
neutrino interactions in dense media by the Askaryan effect, capitalizing on
several remarkable properties of the Ross Ice Shelf near McMurdo Station, the
hub of U.S. Antarctic Program operations: (1) the ice is impressively
transparent to electromagnetic radiation at radio frequencies, (2) the water-ice
boundary below the shelf behaves like a good mirror to reflect radio signals
from neutrinos in any downward direction, and (3) background noise levels were
quite modest in the frequency band of interest. Its close proximity to McMurdo
Station provides a number of suitable options for logistical support, and
ARIANNA's scalable architecture allows it to follow the science. This award
allows the project to develop the data acquisition electronics required by the
ARIANNA autonomous stations. Experience gained in operating the hexagonal array
with precision, low power electronics would frame the performance requirements
needed to expand the array in the future. The project will continue contributing
significantly to the training of next generation of scientists by integrating
graduate and undergraduate education with technology and instrumentation
development, field observations, and scientific analysis.
