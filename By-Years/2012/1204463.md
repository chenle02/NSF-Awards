A team of experienced ATE Principal Investigators (PIs), working in
collaboration with ATE Center and project PIs and the American Association of
Community Colleges, is initiating a regenerative mentoring system for leadership
development and knowledge transfer to broaden the impact of the ATE Program.
Targeted outreach is facilitating participation of technician educators from
underserved groups and from community colleges that have either not been
successful or have never received funding from the NSF. Peer mentoring is
facilitating knowledge transfer and helping prepare the next generation of
community college faculty leaders in advanced technological education fields
critical to economic development and national security. This project builds on
three successful pilot projects that engaged new institutions in the work of the
ATE Program and improved outcomes for ATE projects and ATE Centers. Mentor-
Connect has involved ATE PIs, NSF Program Officers, current grantees, potential
grantees, the National Academy of Engineering, and the IBM Corporation in
project planning. The project is delivering: * A system benchmarked to the IBM
Global Mentoring Program with multiple innovative mentoring strategies and
effective use of technology; * An increase in engagement with and competitive
proposals from colleges and populations underrepresented in the NSF/ATE Program;
* Online referral, resources and support services for use by mentors,
prospective and current PIs, and NSF Program Officers; * A cadre of new, diverse
Principal Investigators with leadership skills; * Broader utilization of
existing ATE resources and; * Engagement of successful ATE PIs as mentors who
give back to the ATE Program.
