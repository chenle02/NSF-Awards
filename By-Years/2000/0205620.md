This project is a multidisciplinary, international collaborative research
project aimed at developing a theoretical understanding of the records generated
by the scientific, government and artistic sections. On this basis, the project
will formulate and test various technology, metadata, and policy models, etc. to
ensure that records created using these systems can be trusted as to content
reliability and accuracy and for subsequent multipurpose use. The project will
address issues related to how information technology is transforming functions
of modern society, particularly in the areas of digital government, e-commerce
and large-scale research efforts.
