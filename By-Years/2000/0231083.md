The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) is beginning a collection of
online interactive resources covering business mathematics, calculus, and
mathematical modeling. These new offerings establish a new component of MathDL,
the Mathematical Sciences Digital Library (www.mathdl.org). Core text-based
materials already exist for each area along with a limited set of animations and
simulations. This project is expanding the interactive elements and developing a
package of fully online resources for each area, taking advantage of the World
Wide Web's hyperlinked medium. This component, MathDL Books Online, licenses
access to the full set of materials for a minimal fee, with revenue supporting
the development and production of additional offerings in the series.
