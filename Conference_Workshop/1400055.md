This award provides support for the Atlanta Lecture Series in Combinatorics and
Graph Theory for the 2014/2015 academic year. This series consists of three
mini-conferences in Atlanta, on the campuses of Emory University, Georgia
Institute of Technology, and Georgia State University. These conferences will be
scheduled in November 2014, February 2015, and April 2015. Each conference will
feature two one-hour lectures by one distinguished researcher, several one-hour
lectures by established researchers mainly from the Southeast, and several
thirty-minute talks by junior researchers and graduate students.

The Atlanta Lecture Series in Combinatorics and Graph Theory, begun in 2010, has
become a major event for the combinatorics community in the Southeast, providing
opportunities to strengthen collaborations among researchers and institutes
within the southeast region of the United States. The featured lectures and
other invited talks cover a variety of topics in graph theory and combinatorics.
These conferences have inspired young researchers and will continue to provide
opportunities for young researchers and graduate students to interact with each
other and with established researchers.
