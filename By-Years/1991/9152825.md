The goal of this project is give freshman biology majors opportunities to apply
analytical methods to data analysis, hypothesis testing, and prediction in a
course emphasizing physiological adaptation. MacIntosh computers, temperature
measuring equipment, analytical balances, and treadmills and wet spirometers
will be used in innovative experiments involving vertebrates and invertebrates
to help students learn to evaluate experimental results, expect the unexpected,
and become active participants in experimental biology at an early stage in
their careers.
