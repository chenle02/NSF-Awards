Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the upgrade of our continuous wave NMR
spectrometer to a multinuclear FT-NMR instrument, we are integrating NMR
spectroscopy throughout our undergraduate curriculum. In the chemistry
department, we are developing an exciting new curriculum which makes use of
major laboratory instrumentation, including FT-NMR, in all of our chemistry
courses. We are adapting and implementing a number of NMR experiments from the
peer-reviewed chemical education literature for this purpose. For example, our
new freshman curriculum include an integrated chemistry and biology course
focusing on the environment. We are adapting a H-NMR study of mono-, di-, and
trihalomethanes to examine the concepts of electronegativity and polarity in
this course. These compounds are familiar to students through the discussion of
trihalomethanes in the module on "Water Purification" which we have adapted from
the NSF-supported ChemConnections initiative. In our Inorganic course, we are
adapting a C-13 NMR experiment on the structure of fullerenes. In our more
advanced courses we emphasize the integration of the various disciplines of
chemistry to prevent our students from seeing each class as a separate
discipline. To show this integration of knowledge we are using FT-NMR
experiments throughout the curriculum in activities highlighting the
relationship between the structure and properties of molecules. We are also
integrating molecular modeling analysis of structure with NMR spectroscopy.
