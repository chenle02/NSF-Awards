In 1987, the Plant Resources Center which contains The University of Texas (TEX)
and Lundell (LL) Herbaria was given 5000 square feet of new, renovated space to
accommodate the growth engendered by the receipt of the remainder of the Lundell
collection (60,000 specimens) and the Moldenke collection (6475 specimens).
However, in addition to these collections, the PRC has grown by about 100,000
specimens over the last five years. The combined influx of the Lundell material
and additional growth has now saturated all of the space provided by the
University. Beginning in 1994, the PRC will receive a large collection of 11,600
specimens from Dr. Paul Fryxell. The Fryxell material which consists primarily
of Malvaceae will Compliment the collections in the PRC because the majority of
the specimens are form Mexico and Latin America. Dr. Fryxell plans to spend most
of the year in Austin where he will continue his research and help curate the
Malvales. In addition, the PRC was given a notable collection of North American
Yucca specimen (155 numbers) that it must sort, label, and mount. This
collection will ultimately be one of the most complete collections of North
American Yucca in the World. The University of Texas has shown its continued
support for the PRC by providing another 3000 square feet of space that it has
agreed to renovate at a cost of $20,000. In addition, beginning in the summer of
1994, the University has agreed to fund the equivalent of an additional full
time position for the PRC. The University cannot, however, provide cases for the
space. Funds will provide herbarium cases for the new floor and for one half-
time graduate student Curatorial Assistant to incorporate the Fryxell
collection, help prepare the Yucca material, assist in shifting the herbarium,
and make necessary additions to the type register.
