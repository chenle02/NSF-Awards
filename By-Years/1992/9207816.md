This project will provide a vacuum induction melting (VIM) system that is
important to ongoing research in the Materials Science and Engineering
Department at UAB. The VIM system will allow the participating Department
faculty to produce liter-sized heats of research alloys. This is particularly
important to projects which require the experimetnal verification of
computational models describing melting, solidification, and microstructural
evolution. The melting system will be used to produce high purity, binary and
ternary alloys for experimentation. Research projects include modelling of
microstructural evolution during rapid thermal processing, fiber-matrix
interface stability in Boride fiber reinforced Titanium-Aluminum intermetallic-
composites, Titanium Aluminide-Silicon Carbide diffusion couples.
