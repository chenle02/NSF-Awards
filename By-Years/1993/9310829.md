This award supports the operation of the PALE Steering Committee for the
Paleoclimate of Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE) initiative as part of Arctic
Systems Science (ARCSS). The Steering Committee will develop science and
management plans for this program and will be active in the implementation of
the research activities. Pale is entering a critical phase of data collection,
synthesis and interpretation. This award will support 1) annual meetings of PALE
researchers for the exchange and synthesis of results, 2) small workshops to
address specific research needs, and 3) Steering Committee efforts to coordinate
projects and maintain communication among PALE researchers.
