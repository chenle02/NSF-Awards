9318054 Ikle The National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine
is a world-class research and clinical care institution specializing in chronic
respiratory allergic, and immunologic diseases. Its physician-scientists depend
on access to current knowledge bases and state-of-the-art telecommunications.
This proposal is to connect the nearly completed internal network at National
Jewish (NJCNET) to the NSFNET through Colorado Supernet using T1 service. The
co-investigators have designed and implemented the NJCNET and have the expertise
needed to support TCP/IP. This connection will greatly benefit the institution
by providing access to BITNET and Internet mail, GENBANK and EMBL data bases,
FTP, supercomputers, image transfers and financial support to maintain this
connection in the future. ***
