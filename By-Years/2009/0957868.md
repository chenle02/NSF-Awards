Professor Tonya L. Kuhl of the University of California-Davis is supported by
the Division of Chemistry to develop advanced analytical techniques, including
high resolution synchrotron x-ray reflectivity (XR), grazing incidence
diffraction (GID), fluorescent microscopy, and surface force microscopy, for the
characterization of the structure of lipid membranes and the quantification of
the interaction forces responsible for lipid self organization and membrane
formation. A systematic approach will be used to determine the effect of lipid
composition, environmental conditions, and the chemistry of the underlying
support on the structure of the membranes. The lipid membrane will be placed on
a pH-responsive polymer cushion to enable the incorporation of proteins without
distorting their structure. Another related thrust is to develop a lipid
membrane platform for 2-D protein crystallization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
overarching aim is to develop robust and easily fabricated biomimetic membrane
platforms for fundamental biophysical studies and for the assembly of
biochemical sensors that mimic the chemical and physical environment of the cell
membranes in a controllable manner. Understanding these model systems opens the
door for the study of biological membranes which play a crucial role in enabling
the proper functions of cells. Students will be trained in the use of advanced
photon sources to conduct multidisciplinary research at the interface between
chemistry, physics and biology.
