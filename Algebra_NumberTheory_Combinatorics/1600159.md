This award provides funding for US participants at the workshop "Algebraic
Cycles and Moduli" to take place June 2-8, 2016, at the Centre de Recherches
Mathematiques, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada. The funding will
support three principal speakers, 4 regular faculty and between 9 to 14 junior
participants. The workshop activities will include three to four talks each day
by leading international experts, interspersed with unscheduled time to allow
for discussion and collaboration. The topic of the conference is at the
forefront of current research in algebraic geometry. It involves a wide range of
complex techniques from geometry, analysis, and topology and has important
applications in physics.

The specific purpose of the workshop is to survey the recent developments in the
field of algebraic cycles and moduli, with a focus on the following topics: (1)
Mumford-Tate groups and domains, (2) Torelli-type theorems and hyperk√§hler
manifolds, (3) Conformal block bundles over moduli spaces of curves, (4) Normal
functions, (5) Applications of the Beilinson regulator to Mahler measure and
Feynman integrals. The workshop will bring together some of the leading experts
in these fields, as well as a number of young researchers, who will further
propel developments in these directions. More details on the conference can be
found at its website: http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2016/Cycles16/index_e.php
