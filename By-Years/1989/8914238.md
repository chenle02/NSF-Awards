The primary objective of the proposed research is to develop a strategy for
applying optimization techniques to the design of reinforced concrete systems.
The proposed strategy consists of decomposing the design into a system level and
a component level. Coupling is preserved between levels. Continuous and discrete
optimization techniques are applied at both levels. Heuristic configuration
search algorithms are used at the component level. Approximations based on
statistical experimental design methods are employed to make the strategy
operable within reasonable time frames on current workstations. Systems may
include components such as slabs, beams, columns, and footings. All ACI 318-83
specifications which apply are included as constraints, and both material and
labor costs are included in the objective.
