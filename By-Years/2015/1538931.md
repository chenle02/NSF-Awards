Irises originated in the Northern Hemisphere and consist of about 260 species
that have colorful multidimensional flowers. This proposal focuses on
understanding the evolution of a large group within Irises, a group that is
morphologically diverse with plants ranging from tall to dwarf species. The
evolution of this group will be studied by sampling the morphological and
biogeographical diversity within the focal group. In addition, relationships
among Iris species will be assessed using genetic data. The evolution of
important vegetative and floral characters will be examined as a result of
clarifying the evolutionary relationships among Iris species. In addition, this
project will conduct developmental studies to decipher the pattern of formation
of the elaborate, tri-dimensional, flowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This group of
plants are of economic importance and are commonly used in public and private
gardens. In many regions of the world Iris species are rare in nature leading
several nations to protect all species. This project will train graduate and
undergraduate students; in addition an international student will be trained in
molecular genetic techniques. Seminars on this research will be given to the
general public and horticultural groups.
