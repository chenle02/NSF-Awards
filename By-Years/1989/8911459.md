The co-principal investigators will conduct a study of the dynamics of
equivalent barotropic and baroclinic vortices, using a numerical method known as
contour dynamics. This method is very attractive for studies of nonlinear
processes, especially in terms of reducing computational requirements, but thus
far has not been widely applied in atmospheric sciences studies. The motivation
for the dynamical investigation is twofold. The practical motivation is the
increased awareness of processes such as "breaking" and "filamentation" in the
context of geophysical vortices, and particularly in the dynamics of the
stratospheric polar vortex. Most of our current rudimentary understanding of
such phenomena derives from barotropic models. The theoretical motivation stems
from recent studies which show that the dynamics of breaking baroclinic or
equivalent barotropic vortices may differ significantly from the barotropic
case. The researchers will investigate the implications of these results in
contour dynamics models of vortices subjected to forced planetary wave
disturbances and thence to assess their significance for our understanding of
stratospheric dynamics.
