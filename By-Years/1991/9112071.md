An integrated thermal analysis system which will be dedicated to support
research in Chemical Engineering will be purchased. The use of an integrated
thermal analysis system will immediately support several research projects,
including: Heat Capacities of Gas Hydrates: (G.D. Holder, PI) Heat capacities of
methane hydrates. Probe Molecule Studies: (D. Blackmond and R. Oukaci, PIs)
Effect of probe molecules on the activation energy of the CO hydrogenation
reaction over various catalysts. Synthesis of Octane Enhancers During Slurry
Phase Fischer- Tropsch: (J. Goodwin, PI) Characterization and screening of
catalysts for the synthesis of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) which is used
as an octane enhancer in fuels. Thermal Analysis of Catalysts: (J. Tierney and
I. Wender, PIs) Determination of thermal stability of sulfated transition metal
oxides used as catalysts for hydrocracking and hydroisomerization of paraffins
and for direct coal liquefaction. Re-Design of Expanded Polystyrene to Improve
Recyclability and Allow Use of CO2 as a Blowing Agent: (E.J. Beckman, PI)
Examination of CO2/amine reactivity, polymerization and characterization of
copolymers, and the physical and thermal properties of the foamable copolymers.
Thermal Analysis of Coal Liquefaction Reactions: (G.D. Holder, PI) Temperature
measurement at which endo/exotherms occur in coal liquefaction reactions under
liquefaction conditions.
