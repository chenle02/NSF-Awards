9412345 Corleto This Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for the
Department of Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, the
Environmental Engineering Program and the Department of Geosciences at Texas
A&amp;M University to purchase a Digital Scan/Imaging System (DSIS) that will be
dedicated to supporting research in engineering and sciences. The equipment will
be used for several research projects, including; studying the micromechanics of
deformation and fracture behavior of rubber- toughened polymers, developing a
micromechanics based displacement and strain measuring technique for submicron
domains, evaluating fracture properties of ductile polymers and analyzing the
influence of fractal geometry theories in particle aggregation mechanisms in
aquatic environments. The acquisition of the DSIS will significantly enhance the
research capabilities at Texas A&amp;M University - Kingsville which is one of
the largest producers of Hispanic graduates in the fields of advanced
engineering, science and mathematics. ***
