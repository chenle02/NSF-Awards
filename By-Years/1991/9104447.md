An investigation of the geomagnetic and tectonic implications of a new
geomagnetic polarity time scale for the late Cretaceous and Cenozoic developed
by the PIs from a global magnetic anomaly data. The objectives of the study are
to further search for small variations in the magnetic signal between anomalies
and to statistically analyze polarity dependent bias.
