This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposesto develop a new
approach to protein x-ray crystallography using convergent beams. This new
technology is based on the development of convergent beam x-ray optics and of
protein diffraction theory with 2-dimensional convergent x-ray beams. Compared
with conventional collimating optics, convergent beam optics can provide x-ray
beams with orders of magnitude higher flux density, which is crucial for
structure measurements with small protein crystals (less than 100 um) using low-
power laboratory-based x-ray sources. In this Phase I project, simulation
diffraction patterns for different protein crystals will be generated by a new
software package CBMPRO to theoretically evaluate the feasibility for
determination of protein crystal quality, unit cell, space group, and structure.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of proteomics.
