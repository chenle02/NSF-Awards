9512561 Enjeti This proposal requests advanced instrumentation, computational
and test equipment to support research, education and training in a new Power
Quality Laboratory under the direction of the PI. This laboratory will be able
to simulate a wide variety of power delivery equipment (i.e. transformers,
motors, capacitor, cables, etc..), distribution fault relays, inverters and
power supplies. In addition, the laboratory will perform research on active
filter technology to cancel generated harmonics, correct for power disturbance
in real time and stimulate the advancement of clean' power converts which do not
generate harmonics and are immune to power disturbances. ***
