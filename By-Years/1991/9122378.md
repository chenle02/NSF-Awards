This award will be used to support the organization of the eleventh Santa Cruz
Summer Workshop in Astronomy and Astrophysics to be held 13-16 July 1992. The
title of the workshop is to be "The Globular Cluster--Galaxy Connection:
Globular Clusters Within the Context of their Parent Galaxies". The theme of the
workshop will be to interpret the properties of globular cluster systems in the
Milky Way and other galaxies within the context of the formation and evolution
processes of both the clusters themselves and their parent galaxies.
