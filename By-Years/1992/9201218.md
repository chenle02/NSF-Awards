This research focuses on the study of Gelfand pairs arising from actions of
compact Lie groups on nilpotent Lie groups. Specific goals include the
classification of such pairs, development of geometric criteria for Gelfand
pairs, and a detailed analysis of the associated spherical functions and
differential operators. The project is in the general area of modern analysis
and concerns classical questions from noncommutative harmonic analysis in a new
setting of Gelfand pairs involving nilpotent groups. The research draws heavily
on the well-known theories of compact and nilpotent Lie groups and provides a
nice contrast to the study of Riemannian symmetric spaces. This research has the
opportunity of deepening our understanding of the solvability of differential
operators and the full relationship between the geometry of the orbits of Lie
groups and representation theory.
