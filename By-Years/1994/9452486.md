9452486 Aktan Non-destructive testing procedures are included in a required
junior level course. The revised course addresses not only the design of
concrete and asphalt mixes and test procedures to determine virgin properties of
these materials, but also non- destructive testing (NDT) procedures for
determining the properties of these materials in service. The NDT procedures
are: measuring the infiltration and rate of infiltration of deicing salts into
concrete, mapping reinforcement topology in concrete, measurements of corrosion
activity in reinforcement, ultrasonic testing for flaw determination, and
acoustic emissions monitoring.
