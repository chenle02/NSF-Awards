9309610 Heal This research will further develop the issue raised in the
investigator's paper "International Negotiations on Emission Control." That
paper studies the incentives that countries have to join and to remain in
international agreements on the abatement of global pollution. It develops the
concept of a critical abatement coalition, one with the property that all
members are net gainers from membership. There will be a smallest critical
coalition because of certain threshold effects. One of the earlier paper's
results is to identify as very important in the stability of coalitions the
extent of cross effects on net benefits between countries that join a coalition.
These will be referred to as "reinforcement mechanisms." In particular, the
stability of agreements is increased by the extent to which abatement by country
i increases the marginal net benefit of country j from abatement by j. This
research will identify and model ways in which the introduction of abatement
policies by one country could reduce the abatement costs of another and provide
reinforcement mechanisms. The research will then take two initial steps towards
empirically implementing the ideas of critical coalitions and reinforcement
mechanisms. One will be a preliminary attempt to identify alternative minimum
critical coalitions for the avoidance of global climate change. The second will
be a preliminary identification of reinforcement mechanisms. ***
