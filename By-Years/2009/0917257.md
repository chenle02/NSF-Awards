The method of Groebner bases has become one of the most important techniques in
providing an exact solution of nonlinear problems in multivariate polynomial
ideal theory, computational algebra and elimination theory, in solving systems
of algebraic equations, and in many other related areas. It is also being
fruitfully used in a variety of seemingly unrelated research areas such as
geometric theorem proving, integer programming, solid modeling, and engineering.

This project will develop the theories and algorithms for an efficient framework
of PSPACE Groebner basis computation in Boolean rings and then apply this
framework to temporal logic reasoning and model checking. The theoretical and
algorithmic results of this research should have a broader impact on symbolic
computation, temporal logic reasoning and related areas such as automated
verification of hardware and software in model checking. Symbolic computation is
an active and rich area with enormous activity and progress in the last twenty
years. A new approach to temporal logic reasoning and model checking making use
of results from symbolic computation seems to have considerable promise, both as
a supplement to existing methods and as a way to bring a large body of powerful
mathematical machinery to bear on the model checking problem.
