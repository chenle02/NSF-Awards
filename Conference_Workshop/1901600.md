This award supports participation in the conference Modern Aspects of Complex
Analysis and Its Applications, held at the University of Washington in Seattle,
Washington, during August 19-23, 2019. The meeting aims to foster interaction
between experts and early-career mathematicians working in the field of complex
analysis. The structure of the conference will comprise a number of workshop-
style talks directed at beginning researchers that are focused on presenting and
discussing fundamental ideas in the field. The organizers are making an effort
to attract younger and minority researchers to participate in the conference.

The field of complex analysis is a classical discipline at the root of much of
modern mathematics. Over the years, its boundaries have been pushed in many
different and often surprising directions: from random geometric objects, to
fractal geometry and dynamics, to discrete networks and data science. The goal
of the conference is to bring together researchers across generational cohorts
in the field of complex analysis with various related areas, including random
conformal maps, dynamical systems, and geometric function theory. Topics
discussed will include harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory,
quasiconformal maps, analysis on metric spaces, and probability. More
information can be found at the meeting web site

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
