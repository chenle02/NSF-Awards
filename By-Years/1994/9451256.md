The Department of Chemistry is committed to introducing modern instrumentation
early and extensively throughout our curriculum, with an emphasis on a hands-on
approach for our undergraduate students. A 200 MHz NMR spectrometer and some
computational software for molecular modeling are being used in complementary
pedagogy, as well as in separate applications. These acquisitions are having a
major impact upon modernization of our microscale organic chemistry laboratory,
as well as many of our undergraduate research projects. We also are introducing
experiments involving NMR into laboratories in physical chemistry, inorganic
chemistry, and biochemistry.
