9452386 Kowles Laboratory capabilities in upper division biology core courses
and the undergraduate student research program have been improved and
diversified by the acquisition of equipment for conducting experiments that
require precisely controlled environments. The added instrumentation includes a
control chamber, floor model incubator shaker, shaker water bath, thermocycler,
DNA sequencing apparatus, and an electroporation system. Laboratory activities
added to the curriculum include: bacteria transformation, plasmid preparation,
DNA sequencing, gene amplification and transient expression, and RNase
protection in molecular biology; studies in protein synthesis, protein
isolation, and cellular metabolism in biochemistry; cellular ATP determination
and the dynamics of cell proliferation in cell biology; and a number of
qualitative and quantitative techniques for undergraduate research projects.
