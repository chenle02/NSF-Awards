9520277 Lee To reduce the damages to reinforced concrete columns and to prevent
their collapse due to strong multidirectional ground motions, the use of
concrete filled tubular (CFT) columns is an attractive option. In 1992, an NSF
Workshop for U.S. Japan Cooperative Research on Composite and Hybrid Structures
recommended that the CFT column system be one of the four research areas to be
emphasized in earthquake engineering research. In recent years a large number of
cyclic loading tests on CFT specimens of the circular type has been conducted.
These tests were primarily subjected to combined compression and torsion.
Results showed that CFT members can deliver high ultimate strength with large
ductility. This project will develop appropriate mathematical models through
both analytical and experimental investigations to quantify the composite
actions of CFT columns under cyclic and earthquake loading considerations. In
the experimental program, the scale or volumetric effects and the loading rate
effects will both be considered, shaking table tests of three-dimensional CFT
columns system will be carried out during the second half of this three-year
study. This is a project supported under the year 1 program of the Civil
Infrastructure Systems (CIS) solicitation, NSF 94-154. ***
