9803344 Mason Large sample problems in probability and statistics concern what
happens to processes or statistics when the sample size increases to infinity.
The investigator plans to work in three areas in which such problems naturally
arise. These are the following: 1. self-normalized sums, 2. generalized
extremes, and 3. weighted approximations. The problems in area 1 originate from
the long standing question concerning the possible asymptotic distributions of
the classical Student's t-statistic. Those in area 2 stem from questions about
the limiting distribution of extreme values, such as annual maximum
temperatures, river heights and largest incomes in a population. He generalizes
the notion of extremes to a multivariate setting and proposes to study its large
sample properties. Finally in area 3, he intends to look into methods of
approximating finite sample processes that arise from testing for dependence in
data by an asymptotic process. This should provide a useful tool to determine
the limiting distribution of many functionals of such finite sample processes.
Solutions to problems in all three areas of research should have numerous
applications in statistical inference and estimation, especially in multivariate
and dependent situations, whenever large samples are available. Eventually, it
is hoped that many of the results will lead to the construction of data analytic
tools which will enter into the everyday practice of statistics. In any case
they should improve our understanding of an interesting range of random
behavior.
