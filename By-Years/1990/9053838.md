The Science Academy of Austin will conduct the project, "Austin Science and
Math Consortium: A Private Sector School Partnership for Tomorrow's World" to
begin restructuring the math and science curricula in grades K-12 and make them
components in a district- wide integrated "thinking curriculum." The project
will address uses of technology in education, environmental issues, and
scientific and mathematical literacy. Sixty teachers will be trained each summer
for four summers in the use of technology. Two summer institutes will be
conducted in the BSCS elementary school curriculum, and teachers will
participate in environmental summer programs. Linkages will be developed among
teachers, students, university faculty, and public and private sector leaders.
An additional 10 to 15 Science Academy students will be provided each year to
conduct classes in elementary schools. Interdisciplinary Science Academy courses
will be developed on Planet Earth an on physics and technology.
