Creating Alternative Learning Strategies for Transfer Engineering Programs
(CALSTEP) is a collaborative project that aims to strengthen community college
engineering programs. The project is developing core engineering laboratory
courses that are delivered either completely online, or with limited face-to-
face interactions. These laboratory courses, together with the online lecture
courses developed through a previously funded NSF project, will enable community
college students from colleges with limited engineering course offerings to
complete the required lower-division engineering courses needed for transfer.
CALSTEP is also developing alternative models of flipped classroom instruction
to improve student success and enhance student access to engineering courses
that otherwise could not be supported in traditional delivery modes due to low
enrollment. The project will also train engineering faculty in effectively using
the curriculum, and facilitate the continued improvement of the curriculum
through a consortium of over twenty community college engineering programs in
California. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in the development of
a comprehensive set of lower-division engineering curriculum materials that are
consistent with system-wide vetted course descriptors, opportunities to further
understand and contribute to the growing body of research on the potential of
technology in improving STEM education, and investigation of alternative models
of instruction. The project will contribute to increasing student access to
engineering education; increasing the number of economically/educationally
disadvantaged students, and students from underrepresented groups who pursue an
engineering career; reducing the time and money that transfer students spend in
four-year institutions to complete their degrees; and increasing the diversity
of the future engineering workforce.
