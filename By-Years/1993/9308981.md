9308981 Saavedra Multithreading, along with software prefetching, lock-up free
caches, and weak consistency models, has been proposed as an effective hardware
mechanism for mitigating the pernicious effects of the large latencies expected
to be present in massive parallel machines. This research focuses in studying
the extent to which virtual multithreading can be used to hide the long delays
incurred by synchronization events. Virtual multithreading gives the illusion
that the processor is executing a large number of threads using only a small
amount of resources. Preliminary results indicate that, with sufficient hardware
support, the combined execution of the virtual threads can be used effectively
to hide extremely large synchronization delays. The goals of this research are:
1) explore new hardware mechanisms for the support of virtual threads and
evaluate their cost-performance tradeoffs; 2) develop analytical formulas to
model the effectiveness of virtual multithreading in terms of the most relevant
machine and program parameters; 3) investigate the dynamic behavior of fine-
grain parallel programs with respect to synchronization and use this information
to construct models of program execution; and 4) develop a detailed simulator of
a virtual multithreaded-based parallel machine and run an extensive set of
experiments in order to validate the analytical models and hardware mechanisms.
