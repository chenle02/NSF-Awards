This U.S.-Hungary research project between Victor Hruby of the University of
Arizona and Katalin Kover of the University of Debrecen features the study of
bioactive peptide function. Specifically, conformations and dynamics of
oligopeptides, peptide mimetics, proteins and peptide protein complexes in both
the solution and gas phases will be examined using multi-dimensional NMR, tandem
mass spectrometry and theoretical methods. The researchers intend to examine the
role of three-dimensional structures and molecular dynamics in the biological
activity of peptides and proteins with the goal of better understanding the
behavior of synthetic oligopeptides, proteins and peptide-protein complexes. If
successful, results may yield new information leading to the definition of
peptidomimetic compounds that are potentially useful as reagents or in drug
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This biophysics research project fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the
United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share
research resources inn areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
