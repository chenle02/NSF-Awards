The purpose of this research is twofold: to investigate the power of counting
solutions to computational problems, and to determine the properties shared by
the typical languages in a complexity class. Counting has been shown to be much
harder than once thought, and deep connections have been drawn between the
algebraic properties of counting classes and their computational difficulty. The
goal is to resolve the structural relationships between counting classes and to
show that, although each solution to a problem is easily verifiable, counting
number of solutions is inherently difficult. Adapting the analytic notions of
measure and category to complexity theory has yielded new techniques to study
the internal structure of a complexity class. Various properties can be
classified as either 'typical' or 'exceptional' for languages in the class,
giving an overall qualitative picture of the class, and providing insight into
the relative difficulties of computational problems. These new techniques, and
their relation to pseudorandom sequences, will be investigated.*** //
