This research project concerns arithmetic combinatorics, an interdisciplinary
field of research with many emerging applications. Progress on questions in
number theory and theoretical computer science requires new insights and
methods; part of the success in this direction over recent years relies on novel
techniques at the interface of algebra and combinatorics. Central to these
developments is the so-called arithmetic combinatorics of finite fields, which
has undergone significant recent advances and opened new challenges. This
research project focuses on several questions motivated by current research in
the area, including study of the orders of points on varieties and counting
solutions to algebraic equations with constraint variables.

Combinatorial problems in finite fields continue to offer many challenges. Of
particular interest in this research project are questions involving orders of
points on varieties over finite fields (e.g. recent developments related to the
Markoff surface). Part of the motivation for the work is to investigate the
problem of strong approximation for Markoff triples and to give estimates on the
number of solutions of equations when the variables are restricted one way or
another, for instance to multiplicative groups. When classical techniques do not
apply, general sum product theory in finite fields and residue rings may be
useful. Sum-product results in various settings are of interest in their own
right as they lead to new results in analytic number theory, in particular,
estimates on Gauss sums and short character sums.
