The ability to control molecular transport through membranes is a crucial aspect
of the operation of biological systems. This research project, supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is designed to develop an
understanding of the molecular level behavior of ultrathin organic membranes
under the influence of electric fields. This understanding is the basis for the
control of molecular transport across these membranes. Professor Paul Bohn and
his students at the University of Illinois will use both optical fluorescence
and standard ac impedance measurements to obtain this understanding. The optical
waveguide methods developed by the Principal Investigator for the study of the
properties of thin organic films will be applied to these measurements. The goal
of the overall research program is to be able to design a molecular gate,
operable by applying an electric signal. Transport across organic membranes is
the basis for various aspects of molecular separation, gene regulation, process
control schemes, and drug delivery in the body. In order to understand this
process on a molecular level, a research project which probes the behavior of
model organic thin films under the influence of an applied electric field is
being pursued. Measurements of the optical properties and the electrochemical
properties of these membranes will be carried out, and the information obtained
used to develop designs for molecular gating devices.
