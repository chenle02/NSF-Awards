9707675 Milgroom The overall goal of this proposal is to examine the mating
system and genetic structure of natural populations of the fungus that causes
chestnut blight, Cryphonectria parasitica. This is the only fungus so far shown
to both self-fertilize and outcross in nature; that is, it has a mixed mating
system. While selfing occurs readily in nature, it is rare in the lab,
suggesting that environment has a role in determining the frequency with which
selfing occurs. The first objective for this proposal, therefore, is to
determine the role played by environment in influencing how often selfing
occurs, and also the extent to which the ability to self-fertilize is
genetically determined. This will be accomplished by testing the potential of
individuals to self and/or outcross in natural populations, under different
environmental conditions, especially with regard to the ecology of chestnut
trees (e.g., tree age, habit, and density, companion species), which are hosts
for this fungal pathogen. The evolution of selfing depends on the intensity of
inbreeding, which is mating among closely related individuals. Therefore, the
second objective is to determine the degree to which natural populations of C.
parasitica are inbred. The effects of selfing and inbreeding on population
structure are determined in part by the potential for inbreeding depression,
which is a reduction in fitness of inbred individuals relative to complete
outbreeding. Therefore, the third objective is to determine the effects of
inbreeding on fitness by studying laboratory crosses between individuals of
varying degrees of relatedness. Mating systems, the means by which organisms
reproduce and pass their genes on to the next generation, have profound effects
on diversity and evolution. The fungal kingdom comprises a richly diverse group
of organisms, representing a broad range of life histories and reproductive
strategies. Yet our knowledge of the natural breeding systems of fungi is
surprisingly sparse and incomplete, considering the rich tradition of research,
dating back to Darwin, on plant breeding systems. Virtually nothing is known
about the temporal or spatial dynamics of fungal mating systems in nature. The
work outlined above will constitute a first step in addressing this disparity,
and in so doing launch a new direction in research on fungi.
