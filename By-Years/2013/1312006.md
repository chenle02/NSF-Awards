This goal of this research program is to study the multifaceted problem of
feedback via detailed simulations designed to model galactic star formation
processes over a wide range of galaxy mass and size scales. The work will
involve a series of high-resolution numerical simulations to investigate the
detailed physics of feedback in disk galaxies by assessing the relative
importance of supernova blasts, HII region expansion, streaming ultraviolet, and
diffuse infrared emmision to driving turbulence in the
ISM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of
undergraduate and graduate students, creation of ?visually rich? web pages,
workshop coordination, and sharing of software with the community.
