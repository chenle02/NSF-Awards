Lempp will pursue research in recursion theory. The main project is to study
the decidability of fragments of the first- order theories of the sets of r.e.
degrees and of Turing degrees where information about the jump operator is
included in the language. Lempp hopes that strategies from the solution to the
deep degree problem (with Slaman) will help with the necessary embeddings of
homomorphisms of partial orders into these sets of degrees. Secondly, Lempp will
investigate the existence of a join operation in the r.e. degrees modulo some
equivalence relation defined by iterated jumps. In a forcing argument, Lempp has
already shown that the join does not necessarily exist in the Turing degrees
modulo this equivalence relation. Furthermore, Lempp plans to conclude work
begun with Cooper and Watson by proving an extension of the nondensity theorem
in the d.r.e. degrees. Finally, Lempp intends to continue his work in index
sets. In his thesis, Lempp has exhibited a large family of such index sets for
r.e. sets the r.e. supersets of which form a Boolean algebra; he now plans to
look at the non-Boolean algebra case and at index sets of r.e. degrees.
Recursion theory being the study of the theoretical limits of computability,
such investigations when completed may well renew contact with their original
inspiration in the world of electronic computers.
