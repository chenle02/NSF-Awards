In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Amanda Haes of the University of Iowa will
exploit the plasmonic properties of gold nanorods encapsulated in
chromatographic-like silica membranes for selective transport and subsequent
surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of small molecules and anti-
cancer drugs without the use of traditional receptor based surface chemistry.
Importantly, the diffusion and transport of the target molecules will be
systematically investigated using principles that typically guide
chromatographic separations. SERS detection will be dictated via molecular
diffusion and transport through the chromatographic-like silica membrane to the
metal core of the solution-phase nanostructures and is expected to be promoted
by the double layer thickness and charge states of the molecules and silica
membranes. Direct molecular detection with (1) identification, (2)
quantification, and (3) signal amplification vs. normal Raman signals are
expected thereby opening up possibilities of trace drug and biomolecule
detection. The broader impacts include mentoring of graduate and undergraduate
students. New hands-on scientific activities for elementary students will be
developed, reinforcing the excitement of chemistry in these young,
impressionable students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work would advance general
nanomaterials surface chemistry design strategies for understanding the
transport and direct small molecule detection in complex sample matrices. The
unique tunability of this surface chemistry modification approach could have
significant impacts on applications of these materials in the fields of
biomedical and environmental sensing as well as forensics.
