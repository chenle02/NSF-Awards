The intent of this proposal is to address critical issues concerning the
commercialization of enzyme electrode technology by carrying out research into
electrodes modified with enzyme/ion exchange polymer films. A basic
understanding of the factors that affect the characteristics of this type of
enzyme electrode is also sought. The proposed research will seek to assess the
relative merits of different types of ion-exchangers for enzyme electrode
design, and will develop new techniques for achieving electrical communication
between immobilized enzymes and electrodes.
