The object of this study is to identify and map the ionospheric signatures of
the dayside magnetospheric cusp and cleft. A six-hour flight at constant noon
magnetic local time by the instrumented airborne Ionospheric Observatory (AIO)
of the Geophysics Laboratory will make synoptic observation in this important
region of the magnetosphere (other ground -based and satellite-based data will
also be available). The focus of the study will be to organize and analyze the
data obtained on the AIO and other available sources and to present the results
at a GEM (Geospace Environment Modelling) Workshop which is scheduled for the
Fall of 1990. ***//
