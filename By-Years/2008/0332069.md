Van Tassel, Paul R&lt;br/&gt;Yale University&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The European
Center for Atomic and Molecular Calculation (CECAM) workshop will be held May
22-24, 2003 at the Ecole Normale Superior in Lyons, France (www.cecam.fr).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the workshop is to bring together
specialists from different fields in which metastability occurs (biology, glass
physics, adsorption phenomena, etc.) in order to clarify difference/similarities
in the observed behavior and ultimately develop/extend numerical methods to
treat metastability. Specifically questions to be answered included the
following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. How does metastability differ (if at all)
when brought about by the thermal quench versus a shift in the energy
landscape?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Can methods developed primarily to treat
systems undergoing a thermal quench be applied to systems undergoing a shift in
energy landscape?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. What common features of metastability
are exhibited by systems as diverse as glasses, biological molecules, and
confined fluids?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proceedings of this workshop will be made
available by the principal investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
