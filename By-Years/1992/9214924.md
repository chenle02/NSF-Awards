This award is for the acquisition of teleconferencing and multimedia
technology, and for curriculum changes to expand a curriculum in
Telecommunications. The University of Pennsylvania will use a new instructional
delivery system, the "video wall", to develop "Telementoring" as a long distance
learning technique. The video wall is already being used in research projects by
members of the AURORA Gigabit Testbed which is being supported by both NSF,
DARPA and a consortium of industrial research partners. Educational materials
developed will be made available to other academic institutions through
Internet, and results of the educational experiments will be disseminated
through publications and presentations at educational and professional meetings.
The University of Pennsylvania plans to use a state of the art instructional
delivery system, the "video wall", to provide multimedia and teleconferencing
support for undergraduate courses in telecommunications. The video wall is an
experimental video conferencing terminal with two large screen projection
televisions mounted side-by-side creating the illusion of one large screen. Two
cameras, co-located with the screens, are arranged to produce a single blended
life- size image which is combined with high-quality directional sound. The
results of the curriculum and materials development will be disseminated through
Internet, and publications and presentations at educational and professional
meetings.//
