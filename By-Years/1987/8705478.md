The Hobcaw Barony, a 17,500-acre site including diverse terrestrial, freshwater
and estuarine habitats, has been set aside in perpetuity for ecological and
experimental research by the Belle W. Baruch Foundation. It has been designated
an Experimental Ecological Reserve and since 1980 has been part of the Long-Term
Ecological Research program. On-site research is focused on landscape ecology
involving the coupling of terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. During
1986 there was a resident staff of 21 persons at the field station. In addition,
approximately 70 faculty members and graduate students from the University of
South Carolina and 21 visiting scientists from other institutions conducted
research using these facilities. Research at the Barony is currently hampered by
inadequacies in the computer system. This project will provide funds to upgrade
the computer and to protect delicate scientific equipment from deviations in the
station's electrical power.
