Bioinformatics
Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
mission of the University of Minnesota Bioinformatics Summer Institute (UMBSI)
is to provide the highest quality undergraduate level education and research
experiences in bioinformatics, equipping the new generation of this burgeoning
professional community with the tools for a successful career in bioinformatics.
Undergraduates will participate in the Institute for ten weeks during the
summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of workshops, seminars and research
projects will result in the participants having (i) an introductory
understanding of contemporary issues in bioinformatics (ii) an ability to
develop and apply information technology solutions to investigate biological
systems (iv) an ability to work in multi-disciplinary teams and a realization of
the importance of doing so in bioinformatics, (v) a beginning understanding of
the impact of bioinformatics solutions on society, including economic, ethical
and environmental impacts, and (vi) a keen interest in pursuing further studies
and a career in bioinformatics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computer infrastructure
at the Digital Technology Center, and a team of eighteen faculty position will
be involved in the the University of Minnesota Bioinformatics Summer Institute
for success. The UMBSI will offer the training and the skills that will spark
the interest to a new generation of scientists to undertake leading careers in
bioinformatics.&lt;br/&gt;
