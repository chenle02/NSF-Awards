9317488 Pelto This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural
anthropologist from the University of Connecticut. The student will study
changing beliefs about reproduction and sexual behavior among young men and
women in Senegal, West Africa. It will examine how changes in wage labor,
migration and education patterns affect reproduction-related strategies. Using
ethnographic research methods of intensive interviews, surveys and focus-group
interviews in Dakar, the capital city, and in a rural village, the student will
try to understand how young people conceptualize their sexual behavior and its
relation to STDs. This research is important because AIDS and other STDs are a
major public health issue all over the world, and particularly in Africa.
Advances in our understanding of how young people think about their sexual
behavior can help public health officials deal with the problem. ***
