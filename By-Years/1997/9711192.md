9711192 May A central component of efforts to address losses posed by
earthquakes is the incorporation of mitigation measures into decisions about
land use, building practices, and risk bearing. Considerable research has been
undertaken about prospective measures and the factors that shape decision making
by the affected groups. But, despite this growing body of research, there is a
rather unsatisfying understanding of the prospects for mitigation. This is an
exploratory, case-study investigation of exemplars of programs that are useful
analogs to earthquake mitigation and have been successful in bringing about
change in risk termite inspection, and radon detection. Interviews will be
conducted with representatives of each of these groups within state (or local)
programs that are identified as part of the research as being exemplars. In
addition, library research and document collection will be undertaken. The
purpose of the study of the exemplars is to draw insights concerning research
about and the institutional design of federal earthquake-hazard mitigation
programs. ***
