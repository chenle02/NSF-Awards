In this project, the investigator will study questions in algebraic geometry
that require the use of algebraic stacks. One aspect of this research will study
how in the context of the study of Gromov-Witten invariants, the somewhat exotic
structure of Deligne-Mumford stack can be related to the more familiar
resolutions of singularities which have long been a staple of algebraic
geometry. A second project will focus on bringing to bear the machinery that has
been developed in the theory of algebraic stacks on the study of Donaldson type
invariants.

Algebraic geometry is among the oldest branches of mathematics and is concerned
with studying the solutions of systems of polynomial equations. Modern
applications of this theory often place a strong emphasis on understanding the
symmetries of such systems. The most powerful framework for understanding
geometry in conjunction with symmetries is the theory of algebraic stacks. This
point of view has acquired extra significance due to a surprising connection to
theoretical physics, where attempts to unify quantum field theory and general
relativity have led to a host of interesting mathematical problems concerning
the symmetries of various geometric structures. This interaction provides a rich
source of problems where the language of stacks, which has a reputation for
being excessively abstract and technical, can be used to study very concrete
questions about simple geometric objects.
