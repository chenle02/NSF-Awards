This research concerns the effects of elevated ambient and substrate
temperatures (25 C to 250 C or higher) on the terminal characteristics of
integrated GaAs MESFETs. The work will focus on the detailed experimental and
analytical modeling of large and small signal parameters of the transistors,
with particular emphasis on temperature-induced shift of threshold voltage as a
result of backgating, and variations of small-signal output conductance
gd=dID/dVgs with temperature and frequency. The most likely beneficiaries of
severe-environment high-speed integrated circuits include the automobile, the
aircraft, the space and geothermal exploration industries, all of whose
projected electronics applications for the 1990's and beyond will exceed the
capabilities of silicon. This work thereby anticipates the forthcoming needs of
a large and important sector of U.S. industry.
