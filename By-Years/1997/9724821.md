9724821 Stahl This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative research
project between Dr. Philip Stahl, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri,
and Dr. Marisa Colombo, Institute for Histology and Embryology (IHEM), Mendoza,
Argentina. They will conduct experiments, using in vitro and in vivo approaches,
to determine the possible involvement of key proteins in controlling
phagocytosis, the process by which cells internalize large particles. These
particles, often including live microorganisms, are sequestered within membrane-
bound compartments called phagosomes. The focus of the proposal is to develop an
understanding of the mechanism of phagosome-endosome fusion and phagosome
maturation.. In vitro reconstitution assays will be used to dissect the
molecular mechanisms that regulate membrane fusion and transport. This
technology, developed in the PI laboratory in Washington University, is being
further developed and refined by the Argentinean collaborator in Mendoza This is
an important area of basic research that could elucidate the fundamental
molecular mechanisms during phagocytosis necessary for the future development of
anti- infective strategies. ***
