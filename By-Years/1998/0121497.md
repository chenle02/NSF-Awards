This ITR research medium research project will put together an interdisciplinary
research group whose aim will be to develop a new modeling and a solution
framework that nontrivially integrates a wide class of solution methods,
including mathematical programming, constraint satisfaction, and a variety of
heuristic algorithms. The objective of this framework is to be able to
effectively tackle challenging engineering optimization problems. The group will
be composed of faculty and students from Computer Science, Operations Research
and Chemical Engineering. The key goal for the group will be to identify
principles according to which algorithms can be integrated. These principles
will then form the basis for a modeling language that guides the integration.
Furthermore, new solution techniques will be developed for hybrid models and for
global optimization of nonconvex discrete/continuous
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two paths of integration will be investigated.
One is to exploit problem structure at the modeling stage by using an idea
developed in constraint logic programming: namely, by writing the problem in the
form of "global" constraints that individually invoke algorithms tailored to the
special structure of each constraint. A second is to make a fundamental
distinction, at both the modeling and solution stage, between two types of
algorithms: checkers and solvers. The research will be applied primarily to the
optimization of process systems, with a focus on synthesis of reactive
distillation systems and the integrated testing of new products and batch
manufacturing. Because these problems have both discrete and continuous aspects,
and the second involves difficult nonlinearities, they provide a natural context
for combining optimization and logic-based methods. However, the research will
develop a general-purpose approach to modeling and solution, rather than one
that is exclusively for process systems applications.&lt;br/&gt;
