Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Chemistry Department at
the Univeristy of Pittsburgh to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. The areas
of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1) Study
of the mechanism of action of vitamin B-12 through synthetic models 2)
Development of new synthetic methods using sulfur reagents 3) The determination
of the stereochemistry of alkylidene-alkyl insertion reactions 4) Natural
product synthesis and the development of new synthetic methods 5) Construction
of complex natural product systems 6) Free radical clocks as probes of enzyme
mechanism 7) Studies in molecular recognition
