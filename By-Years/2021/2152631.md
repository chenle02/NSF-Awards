For languages with a small number of speakers remaining, there is an urgent need
not only to document the linguistic knowledge of these speakers, but also to
make both new and existing linguistic knowledge readily available to the
community, scholars, and the public, while supporting the next generation of
speakers. This project addresses these needs for an endangered Indigenous
language. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, this project contributes to documentation
through linguistic work with living speakers of the language, and through
curating and annotating audio and written historical language materials that
have not been previously accessible to scholars or the public. These materials
will expand a widely-used online dictionary and will be used to create the first
annotated open-access linguistic corpus of the language. Second, the project
will expand and improve existing materials and make them more accessible, while
supplementing with additional audio and written materials from work with fluent
speakers. Finally, the project focuses on mentoring and training Indigenous
language workers by providing linguistic training and research experience for
graduate students and recent undergraduates, developing a workshop for
prospective Indigenous college students, and developing linguistics coursework.
Beyond the creation of accessible language materials and curriculum development,
the project will facilitate the broader scientific contributions of Indigenous
project personnel, giving them an opportunity to explore linguistic topics
related to their own research interests through direct elicitation with speakers
and close study of conversational texts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
