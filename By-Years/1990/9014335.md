The goal of this research program is to provide exact analyses of over-sampled
A/Ds, especially a variety of architectures for implementing a method known as
sigma-delta modulation. Through the use of old and new techniques from nonlinear
and linear systems theory, random processes, and ergodic theory, exact
descriptions of the behavior of quantization noise for single-loop and multi-
stage (cascaded) sigma-delta modulatory architectures for a variety of input
signals (both with and without dithering) have been obtained. The thrust of the
present proposal will be to extend these results to other architectures
including a sigma-delta loop with leaky integrators and non-unity gain, modulo
sigma-delta and parallel sigma-delta modulatory. Also, if time permits, other
related topics will be examined including stability issues in feedback
quantization, and the incorporation of subsequent signal processing (such as
compression and linear filtering) into the A/D converter.
