The team will perform numerous state-of-the-art simulations of galaxy clusters
spanning a large range in&lt;br/&gt;mass. The simulations will incorporate
observationally-constrained&lt;br/&gt;models for feedback from star formation
and supermassive black holes,&lt;br/&gt;along with a novel treatment of chemical
evolution. The&lt;br/&gt;aims are twofold: (1) Establish a unified description
for the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of the galaxies, the supermassive black holes, and
the hot&lt;br/&gt;tenuous gas within the clusters; (2) Determine the key
observable&lt;br/&gt;signatures that constrain the interplay between the
processes of&lt;br/&gt;galaxy feedback and the growth of structure in the
Universe. These&lt;br/&gt;efforts constitute a self-consistent, holistic
approach to feedback that will be able to account for
multifaceted&lt;br/&gt;properties observed across all mass scales. The team will
continue its&lt;br/&gt;involvement in an established, successful STEM program.
The research&lt;br/&gt;will increase the physical realism of the simulations,
increasing the&lt;br/&gt;appeal of the image products released to the public.
