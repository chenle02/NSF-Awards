Abstract for award DMS-0401318 of
Petridis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal
investigator will investigate the distribution of modular &lt;br/&gt;symbols and
period polynomials (Gaussian distribution laws). He will&lt;br/&gt;study
perturbed Eisenstein series in Teichmueller space and
character&lt;br/&gt;varieties in relation to the disappearance of cusp forms
(higher order&lt;br/&gt;Phillips-Sarnak conditions), and apply analytic number
theory techniques &lt;br/&gt;in the spectral theory of Hilbert modular varieties
(subconvex estimates&lt;br/&gt;of the L-series of a Maass cusp form and
equidistribution of Eisenstein&lt;br/&gt;series) and Heisenberg manifolds
(distribution of the error term in Weyl's&lt;br/&gt;law for the eigenvalues of
the Laplace operator).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research falls into the general
mathematical field of Number Theory. &lt;br/&gt;Number theory has its historical
roots in the study of the whole numbers, &lt;br/&gt;addressing such questions as
those dealing with the divisibility of one &lt;br/&gt;whole number by another.
It is among the oldest branches of mathematics &lt;br/&gt;and was pursued for
many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. &lt;br/&gt;However, within the last
half century it has become an indispensable tool in &lt;br/&gt;diverse
applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
&lt;br/&gt;communication systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
