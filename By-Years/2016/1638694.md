The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is a continental research
platform designed to extend our understanding of the biosphere to regional and
continental scales. Through remote sensing, in-situ observation, synthesis, and
modeling, NEON will provide researchers with a unique capability to quantify the
strong and weak forces regulating the biosphere and predict its response to
climate and land-use change. NEON infrastructure will include field deployed
instrumented towers and sensor arrays, remote sensing capabilities, cutting-edge
laboratory instrumentation, natural history archives, and facilities for data
analysis, modeling, visualization, and forecasting, all networked through a
cyberinfrastructure backbone. Infrastructure will be deployed across the
continental US, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico using a statistically determined
design, stratified by climate and land-use. The knowledge base NEON will create,
its real time and continuous integrated data, simulation and observation
capabilities, and its networked communication will be an asset for formal and
informal education and training. A NEON gateway will provide resources to
support informal public education and provide opportunities for citizens to
actively participate in scientific investigations. This award is the
administrative framework for the construction and operations of the National
Ecological Observatory Network.
