This award provides one-half the funds required to upgrade a SUN 3/160
monochrome workstation to a SUN 4/260 color workstation with additional random-
access memory (RAM). The Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University
of Minnesota will provide the remaining funds needed. The upgraded workstation
is necessary to support computationally intensive research in the Department of
Geology and Geophysics on mantle convection, postglacial rebound, magma
dynamics, molecular dynamics and double-diffusive convection. The color
workstation is needed for visualizing time-dependent models of convection in the
mantle, and the added RAM will be used in developing numerical algorithms for
large-scale supercomputer applications and processing data generated from
supercomputer calculations.
