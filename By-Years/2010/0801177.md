The Local Langlands correspondence is a conjectural interaction between two
kinds of symmetry: the structure of complex Lie groups and local Galois
theory.&lt;br/&gt;The work in this proposal will establish new cases of the
explicit local Langlands conjecture, with special emphasis on groups such as E8,
which arise from icosahedral symmetry. &lt;br/&gt;The proposer will build on his
previous work in this direction by first completing an ongoing project aimed at
explicitly verifying the tame Langlands correspondence and second by extending
the scope to verify the wild correspondence in some cases.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symmetry is a fundamental concept in
Mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;Representation Theory is the study of how symmetry
manifests in different ways. This proposal concerns the interactions of two
quite different kinds of symmetry, one of them geometric, as in the icosahedron,
and the other algebraic, arising from the symmetries among roots of polynomials.
&lt;br/&gt;This interaction of symmetries is a branch of mathematical
development whose roots go back to Euclid's Elements. Part of the Broader Impact
of this proposal is to recognize and share this historical component of the
local Langlands correspondence, by using the common language of ancient
mathematics to unify disparate mathematical communities. For example, not
everyone can understand E8, but it has roots in Euclid, which can be, and at one
time was studied by a wide population, for diverse extra-mathematical reasons
that are important for all educated citizens.&lt;br/&gt;
