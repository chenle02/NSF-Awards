Colorado School of Mines TITLE: Planning Grant to Reform the Undergraduate
Engineering Program at the Colorado School of Mines

Abstract

The Engineering Division at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM), plans to reform
the Engineering program at CSM through four strategies:

1)Consolidation of fundamental engineering curriculum through the elimination of
legacy materials.Our approach to curriculum consolidation begins with the
development of three "Fundamental Systems Courses "(FSC)to replace six
traditional courses.The FSC are linked to the traditional course materials
through the similarity of mathematical structures.We will offer two pilot
classes in the new format during the planning grant. 2)Development of "two-plus-
one-credit " courses to replace specific three-credit courses, with the one-
credit modules featuring project-based study of emerging engineering topics
and/or computational methods used by practicing engineers.The one-credit modules
will involve mentoring by industrial colleagues. 3)Further development of new
and existing five-year BS/MS programs at CSM focusing on the changing needs of
US industry for the engineering workforce. 4)Implementing effective teaching
methods,including mentoring,team-based and experience-based learning,computer
simulation,and web-based reinforcement of learning materials.

To assess the effectiveness of these revisions,we will use formative and summati
e instruments, including surveys,data collection,a new outcomes assessment
instrument,and anecdotal information obtained from faculty,students,and our
Corporate Advisory Board.Trained professional evaluators will interview students
participating in the pilot sections via focus group settings.
