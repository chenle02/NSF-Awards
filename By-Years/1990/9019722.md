Nutrient limitation of algal growth provokes changes in the biochemical
composition of the cells. This in turn affects the quality of algae as food for
upper trophic levels. Models of the dynamics of the interaction of herbivores
and their food thus should include such food quality effects. This research will
explore the ways in which algal growth rate changes food quality. Laboratory
demography studies of the freshwater cladoceran, Daphnia pulex, feeding on
variously limited unialgal and multi- algal foods will be undertaken. These
studies will ascertain the relationship between growth rate and quality in
simple systems. In addition, food quality effects in natural populations will be
examined through a set of experiments and measurements including 1. assessment
of nature and degree of nutrient limitation in algal populations, 2. assessment
of degree of food limitation in zooplankton populations, 3. measurement of
assimilation efficiency of N and P in zooplankton. These data will then be used
to explore in theoretical models how the stability and tendency for coexistence
of herbivore and algae is influenced by food quality effects. Results will
contribute to the conceptual basis of limnology and will add to the information
base for managing aquatic resources.
