A significant challenge in evolutionary biology lies in explaining why some
groups are more diverse than others. This research investigates factors that
produce species richness and diversity of forms (and the relationship between
these two factors) within a major group of frogs, the Asian Toadfrogs (family
Megophryidae). This family is exceptionally diverse, both in terms of number of
species and variation in size, shape, and ecology. The investigators will use
DNA sequences and information from fossils to construct an evolutionary tree of
species relationships, which they will then use to test hypotheses about
evolutionary rates of diversification. The addition of geographical distribution
data affords the opportunity to test whether historically important geological
events also affected changes in biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work
will provide key insight into the timing of diversification events and the
mechanisms that led to the species diversity we observe today. It will advance
our knowledge of the role that animal form has with regard to species
diversification and will provide important new insights into adaptive radiation,
a phenomenon of general biological interest. Outreach will include training
students in modern laboratory techniques and convening several public education
programs in rural Washington, including workshops on evolution and museum
displays of frog biodiversity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
