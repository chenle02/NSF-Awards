The proposed research focuses on a better understanding of the complex
processes that takes place in a glow discharge. Primarily this involves studying
the physical characteristics of the discharge. Although experimentally the
processes have been adapted for device manufacturing, the physics and the
chemistry of the processes have been relatively difficult to understand. This
can be attributed to many reasons; Extreme complexities and subtleties in the
processes, the effect of spatial and temporal variations of the electric fields,
lack of fundamental data as to the nature of electron and ion behavior, and so
on. With the advent of large and powerful supercomputers, a more precise
numerical analysis of the complex system of equations governing these processes
has become feasible. The problems to be studied can be viewed as governed by a
three-dimensional, time dependent, system of equations, a formidable problem.
The application of the numerical techniques to this class of problems is
possible, provided a combination of highly advanced numerical schemes can be
achieved. Such a systematic study of the discharges will help in developing more
efficient processes for semiconductor fabrication.
