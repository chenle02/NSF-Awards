The investigator studies the convergence, stability, and superconvergence of
finite volume element type methods, and implements algorithms in software. A
general framework is developed for mixed control volume methods on irregular
grids. Furthermore, nonlinear covolume methods applied to parabolic differential
and integro-differential equations are studied.

Fluid flow problems such as chemical or radioactive contaminant transport in
subsurface reservoir flow, displacement of oil in the oil recovery process, and
bioremediation of aquifers, are complex and difficult to simulate
computationally. Yet they are important for the environment and for managing
energy resources. The investigator develops, analyzes, and implements a class of
computational methods called finite volume element methods that seem to have
some advantages over other methods but that have not been rigorously analyzed
yet. The analysis undertaken in the project should establish a firm theoretical
footing for the methods. This is important for the reliability and validity of
computations performed with the methods.
