This is in support of the US-USSR Binational Symposium on "The Physics of
Optical Phenomena and Their Use as Probes of Matter," which will begin in
Irvine, California, January 22, 1990. Among the subjects to be covered in the
presentations are: (1) Optical Properties of Surfaces, Interfaces and
Composites, (2) Optical Properties of Random Systems, (3) Laser Interactions
with Biological Matter, (4) Nonlinear Optics of Semiconductors, (5) Optical
Nonlinearities in Fibers, (6) Phase Conjugation and Other Coherent Optical
Phenomena, (7) Ultrafast Phenomena, and (8) Advanced Spectroscopic Probes of
Condensed Matter. It is intended that in the presentation the physical origins
of the phenomena discussed be emphasized, not just the phenomena themselves.
