This award supports summer research in field biology by undergraduates at the
Mt. Lake Biological Station of the University of Virginia. During the 10-week
program, students pursue a research problem with the guidance of a faculty
mentor; mentors are chosen from among researchers who come to the station for
summer field work. Many of the mentors come from institutions other than the
University of Virginia. Besides their research projects, students participate in
several informal and formal seminars each week.
