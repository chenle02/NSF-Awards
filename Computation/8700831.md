This project will study infinite particle systems. These systems are used as
models in many diverse fields such as statistical physics, chemistry, computer
science and population genetics. The model offers many challenging problems to a
mathematician. The research proposes a simple but rich model exhibiting many new
interesting properties. A specific such models runs in to a paradox due to
metastability. A physical system is metastable if it settles down to an apparent
equilibrium, stays there for a very long time, and then eventually makes a
sudden transition to its true invariant state. Extensive computer graphics work
will be done to study these complex systems. Coputer graphics will also be used
to explain the work to wider audiences.
