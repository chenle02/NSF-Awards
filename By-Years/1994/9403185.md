9403185 Moodie This research is concerned with facilitating research
collaboration between American and European investigators involved with funded
investigations of manufacturing systems. Prior attempts at collaboration have
had marginal success. Within the program researched here, a small group of
currently funded researchers from the United States and E.C., with narrowly
defined, on going research programs, will participate in two focused workshops:
one in Europe, the other in United States. Immediate sharing of usable research
results is anticipated and future, joint research projects can be established.
This program will provide a format for stimulating research collaboration in
other areas of manufacturing research.
