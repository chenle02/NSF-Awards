Reductive groups often arise as groups of symmetries of arithmetic and geometric
structures. This connection makes their study very interesting and it is also a
major source of important questions. For example, for the celebrated Langlands
Program (in Number Theory), a complete classification of unitary representations
of reductive groups over local fields is needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I propose
to investigate arithmetic, group theoretic and geometric properties of reductive
groups using various tools. Among the powerful tools I have used in the past is
the geometry of a nice space known as the "building" of the group provided by
the Bruhat-Tits theory. This theory, together with a detailed understanding of
the structure of reductive groups, and their cohomology (these are certain
subtle geometric invariants of the groups), has helped to settle many important
questions about these groups. In my own work on rigidity of certain "large"
subgroups known as "lattices", and also in my study of arithmetic questions
about these groups, including the congruence subgroup problem, these techniques
played crucial role. In my joint work with Allen Moy, the Bruhat-Tits theory of
reductive groups over local fields was used to settle some questions about their
representations and also to classify admissible representations of depth zero.
Subsequently, several other mathematicians used our frame-work and techniques to
find solutions of many interesting problems in the representation theory and
harmonic analysis. I will use some of the geometric techniques mentioned above
to find a classification of irreducible admissible representations of reductive
groups over local fields. I will also investigate the congruence subgroup
problem which remains unresolved for certain (anisotropic) groups. The latter
would require understanding their normal subgroups first. I am working on this
question with Andrei Rapinchuk and Yoav Segev. I also plan to write a book on
the congruence subgroup problem in collaboration with Andrei
Rapinchuk.&lt;br/&gt;
