0110107&lt;br/&gt;Mohler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the research
proposed in this project is to elucidate mechanisms by which the head of the
Drosophila larva is patterned during early embryogenesis. The mechanisms by
which the segments of the head are specified are not well understood, but are
clearly distinct from the mechanisms used to specify the segments of the trunk.
The head segments are laid down considerably later than the trunk segments in a
process independent of the pair-rule genes that combinatorially specify the
trunk segmentation plan. Furthermore, unlike the trunk segments, segment
identity of many of the head segments is conferred by non-homeobox containing
transcription factors whose genes are not members of the HOX
complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will specifically examine how the
three cephalic segments (intercalary, antennal and ocular) are initially
established, by examining the controls regulating the spatial expression of
three segment polarity genes (wg, hh and en) that are essential for establishing
segmentation in the Drosophila embryo. In addition, this research project will
examine the molecular mechanisms by which the CNC/Maf-S bZIP transcription
factor regulates segment identity in the labral and mandibular segments of the
head. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the genes that are involved in segmentation
of the Drosophila embryo, including those active in head segmentation, have
homologs in most animal species. Analysis of the developmental roles of these
genes in Drosophila head patterning and their interrelationships is likely to
provide important developmental principles involved generally in animal
embryology&lt;br/&gt;
