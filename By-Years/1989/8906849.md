This project provides resources to procure equipment which, together with
existing equipment at Pennsylvania State University, will establish an active
vibration control laboratory. Furthermore, it will support four currently active
research projects. Due to weight reductions associated with new materials and
design techniques, the need to control vibrations of flexible mechanical systems
has increased dramatically. These structures exhibit dynamic characteristics
which make them difficult to control. These characteristics include complicated
vibration patterns due to a large number of modes, low inherent damping, and
closely spaced natural frequencies. The complexity and time variability of these
dynamic characteristics require adaptive on line systems which can assist in
identifying modal order, mode shapes, frequencies, and damping and which can be
used in the design of automatic controllers which can guarantee stability and
performance requirements. The four research activities which will be enhanced by
this equipment include (1) active control of flexible structures, (2) active
control of suspension systems, (3) active control of shock mounts, and (4) laser
scanning of structural surface vibration for active vibration control.
