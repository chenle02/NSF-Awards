This grant provides funding for the study of basic research issues related to
engineering incentives in health care systems, such as design of appropriate
incentives, estimation of system-wide performance for a set of incentives and
predicting participant response to given incentives. We specifically focus on
how incentives can be used to reduce costs by aligning objective functions of
non-cooperative decision makers. New methods will be developed in order to
compute equilibria in large distributed systems. This project will develop novel
distributed, iterative methods that will allow us to efficiently decompose the
overall problem into a series of sequential bilateral equilibria for each pair
of connected players and then iteratively refine the local equilibria until a
fixed point for the entire network is attained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, the results of this research will enhance the understanding of types
of incentives, how to model distributed systems with incentives, and how
incentives should be used for large systems of strategic decision makers. This
work will lay the foundation for a formal approach to engineering incentives in
complex, distributed systems, and define a research agenda to study incentives
and policy implications in health care systems from a design and engineering
perspective. New methods developed in this project will further understanding of
iterative algorithms used to compute equilibria in complex networks of decision
makers. The primary societal impacts of this research will be to allow health
care policy makers to estimate overall costs and impacts of incentives in health
care systems, and eventually, be able to devise intervention strategies that
will lead to desired provisioning of health care. The proposed work will also
contribute multidisciplinary education, and promote the ability to combine
knowledge in technically diverse fields (distributed systems, economics,
optimization, health policy) and apply this knowledge in the context of
understanding and managing health care systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
