The project aims to establish new results in different topics of stochastic
analysis. First a new approach for proving the smoothness of the density for
solutions to stochastic partial differential equations will be introduced. This
method is based on a stochastic version of Feynman-Kac's formula for the
Malliavin derivative of the solution. Moreover, the techniques of Malliavin
calculus will be applied to derive upper and lower Gaussian estimates for the
density of the solution. A second objective of the project is to obtain results
on the rate of convergence of Euler-type numerical approximation schemes for
stochastic differential equations driven by a fractional Brownian motion. The
application of the techniques of Malliavin calculus to analyze numerical
approximation schemes for backward stochastic differential equation is also one
of the topics of the project. Another research direction deals with the proof of
central and noncentral limit theorems for a large variety of functionals of a
Gaussian process, including multiple stochastic integrals, and weighted power
variations. The project also aims to establish Feynman-Kac's formulas for the
one-dimensional stochastic heat equation driven by a fractional multiplicative
Gaussian noise.

Stochastic analysis is an active area in mathematics which is motivated by the
study of ordinary and partial differential equations perturbed by a random
noise. These equations play a central role as models in many areas of physics
and economics. The application of these equations in concrete problems requires
suitable numerical approximation schemes, and convenient estimates for the
probability distribution of the solution. This project aims to make new relevant
contributions to these problems, by developing and applying powerful
mathematical techniques such as the Malliavin calculus. On the other hand,
motivated by some applications in hydrology, telecommunications and mathematical
finance, there has been a recent interest in input noises possessing a long
memory property such as the fractional Brownian motion. The development of a
stochastic calculus with respect to these long memory processes is also one of
the aims of this project.
