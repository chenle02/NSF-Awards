9610536 Cuitino Semiconductor devises, such as static and dynamic random access
memory, use thin metal interconnect lines. Future devices are anticipated to use
even thinner interconnects. The effect of microstructural features, such as
grain misorientation, grain size distribution, grain morphology, size and
morphology of microdefects, as well as of other factors including, deposition
temperature, usage temperature, electric current density, on nucleation and
growth of voids in narrow interconnects is studies. crystal creep theory based
on dislocation mechanics is employed as the central tool for this investigation.
The study will also be applicable in other areas such as the design and
fabrication of single crystal propellers, turbine blades, etc. ***
