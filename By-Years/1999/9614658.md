9614658 Braile This research involves the study of the time-to-failure method of
earthquake prediction whereby precursory earthquakes define an accelerated
energy release curve associated with a main shock earthquake. This precursory
sequence is modeled and a predicted magnitude and time-of-failure is calculated
by solving an equation containing three unknown parameters and a relationship
determined in earlier work on the New Madrid Seismic Zone. The study will extend
the application of this method to southern California. The primary goal of this
research is to improve and further evaluate the method and its uncertainties
with the ultimate goal of implementation of practical intermediate-term
earthquake prediction. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program. ***
