The anthropologically rich Afar region of East Africa has been a prolific area
of research for human origins. The northernmost reaches of the Afar in the newly
founded State of Eritrea have been untapped to this point. This award is to
undertake fieldwork in the northern Afar. It is important for, 1) understanding
the earliest history of humankind in Africa 2) understanding the northernmost
range of early human ancestors on the African continent, 3) understanding when
and where our species, Homo sapiens left Africa, and 4) understanding the
biogeography of humans and our ancestors in one of the worlds most geologically
active areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will survey, map and surface
collect sites in the northern Afar (Danakil depression) four to five weeks. All
specimens will be catalogued and deposited in the National Museum of Eritrea.
Description and analysis of fossils and artifacts will take place in Asmara.
Rock samples for petrographic and isotope analysis will be transported to the
United States and South Africa for analysis. The research team will consist of
scientists from the United States, Eritrea and South Africa. &lt;br/&gt;
