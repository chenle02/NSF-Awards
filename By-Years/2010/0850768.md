Researchers at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook will
replace outdated alpha spectrometry systems. Since the 1980's, their laboratory
used four Quad Alpha systems, and these systems have worked well for many years.
However these systems are interfaced with now-obsolete analyzers that have
failed and are not repairable. In addition, most of the Quad Alpha units
themselves have failed and currently only four out of 16 detectors are
operating. Even though alpha spectrometry has been supplanted by other
analytical approaches for many alpha-emitting radionuclides, measurement of
certain short-lived alpha emitters is optimally accomplished via this method. A
new, upgraded alpha spectrometry system will provide the necessary capability to
continue the laboratory's high quality alpha spectrometric measurements. The
equipment will be used in several NSF-supported projects related to carbon cycle
research. These studies will be important to our understanding of the ocean's
"biological pump", which influences the transport of organic carbon to the deep
ocean and is coupled with the ocean's ability to take up and cycle carbon
dioxide derived from human activities. In terms of broader impacts, the
equipment will enhance the research infrastructure at SUNY Stony Brook, and will
aid in supporting research activities for the foreseeable future. Researchers at
SUNY Stony Brook will use the systems as part of their education and training
activities.
