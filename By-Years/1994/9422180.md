9422180 Winter The proposed research has the objectives of (1) organizing
macromolecules into highly ordered structures and (2) studying the effects of
flow and phase transitions on this order. For that purpose, we chose liquid
crystalline polymers because of their extended chain conformation and their
crystal like optical properties which allow direct observation of the phenomena.
The experimental methods will mostly be rheometry and polarizing microscopy
(conoscopy). %%% The lack of understanding of the behavior during processing has
prevented the widespread use of engineering plastics which have been synthesized
in abundance in recent years. Emphasis is on morphology development by physical
processes rather than chemical processes since the end-use properties are as
much determined by processing (which needs to be advanced) as by the chemistry
of the polymers. The proposed research will help to find processing strategies
which utilize phase transitions to organize polymers into novel morphologies
with superior properties. ***
