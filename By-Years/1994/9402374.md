Keigwin The PI will conduct paleontological and isotopic studies of changing
hydrographic and climatic conditions since the last glacial maximum (LGM) in the
Okhotsk Sea and will attempt to link these results to earlier reconstructions
from the open Pacific. Testing the hypothesis that nutrient-depleted watermass
existed during LGM in NW Pacific at &lt;2300 m depths is also an objective.
Cores collected from the Okhotsk Sea in 1993 will be used for the study.
Collaboration with a Russian scientist from the Pacific Oceanological
Institution at Vladivostok is planned.
