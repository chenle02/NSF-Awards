Professor Anne Kelley of Kansas State University is supported by the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to perform advanced spectroscopic
studies of molecules with potential for good nonlinear optical responses. By
quantitatively simulating the absolute resonance Raman intensities and optical
spectra of these species in solution, the PI will experimentally determine the
effect of solvent environment on the structures of both the ground and lowest
excited electronic states of the molecules. Neural networks will be tried for
fitting experimental data to models. The molecules will also be studied embedded
in polymer matrices at 5K using single molecule emission spectroscopy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is important to be able to quantify the relation of
optical and nonlinear optical responses to solvent effects, if these molecular
structures are to be incorporated into polymer matrices to fabricate devices.
This work will improve our ability to convert sophisticated spectral data into
predictive models for new optical materials. Optical materials are needed for
advances in optical computing and communications.&lt;br/&gt;
