In the preface to his classic text, "Principles of Biochemistry," Albert
Lehninger stated "Biochemistry should be taught much earlier, since it has
become the lingua franca of the life sciences and greatly illuminates subsequent
study in any area of biology. And not only biology: An early course in
biochemistry for students of chemistry or physics provides challenging glimpses
of how living organisms solve some of the most fundamental chemical and physical
problems." This project will develop, test and incorporate into introductory
biology and chemistry courses a series of modules based on eight important
scientific themes: molecular structure and bonding, intermolecular forces,
biomacromolecules, enzymes and catalysis, acids and bases, organic chemistry,
energy and thermodynamics and bioethics. The modules will utilize interactive
computer visualization and molecular modelling techniques, will emphasize
discovery and active learning and will be adaptable for both beginning and
advanced students. The goal of the project is to facilitate learning and
stimulate student interest in and enthusiasm for science.
