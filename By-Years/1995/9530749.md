95-30749 Fomenkova Dr. Fomenkova and her Co-Principal Investigator, Dr. Barbara
Jones, will carry out a three-year project of infrared (IR) imaging and
spectroscopic observations of comets during perihelion passage. The objective is
to determine (1) the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei -- size,
rotation, surface properties, composition, and mechanisms of coma formation, (2)
physical and chemical alterations of dust grains in the inner coma, and (3) the
extent of heterogeneity of individual comet nuclei and from one comet nucleus to
another. One comet the investigators intend to study in detail is comet O1 Hale-
Bopp, which is currently approaching the inner solar system and will reach
perihelion in April 1997. The observations will be carried out with the
investigators' imaging camera mounted on the 1.5 meter telescope at the Mt.
Lemmon Observatory and the new Long Wavelength Spectrometer of the Keck
telescope. The Mt. Lemmon Observatory is jointly operated by the investigators'
home institution (the University of California in San Diego) and the University
of Minnesota. ***
