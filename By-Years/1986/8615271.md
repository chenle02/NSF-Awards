The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center at the University of
Massachusetts, Amherst is now a self-sufficient research group addressing basic
polymer science. This project is a collaborative study between the Center for
University of Massachusetts - Industry Research on Polymers and Mount Holyoke
College. The project is studying the development and examination of synthetic
vesicle systems which "sense" their environment via conformational changes of
membranes-bound synthetic polymers.
