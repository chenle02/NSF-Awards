Cloud computing, which allows a customer to rent virtual servers from cloud
providers, is the infrastructure that powers a wide variety of Internet
applications used by consumers, businesses, and the government. Unfortunately,
traditional cloud computing requires significant system-management expertise to
ensure that applications are reliable, secure, and cost-effective. In contrast,
"serverless computing" is a new approach to cloud computing that automates a
significant portion of system management, and has seen explosive growth over the
last few years. Despite being a promising advance, serverless computing
introduces new problems, and is more limited in scope than traditional cloud
computing. This research project develops tools and techniques to make
serverless computing more cost-effective, more reliable, and more broadly
applicable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the project are the
development of (1) the mathematical foundations of serverless computing, (2)
analysis tools to help programmers find and eliminate software bugs in
serverless software, (3) new abstractions that enable a broader class of
software to use serverless computing, and (4) new runtime systems that make
serverless computing faster and cheaper. The project's broader significance and
importance are that (1) it helps programmers make their serverless applications
more reliable and secure, (2) it benefits cloud-computing providers by making
serverless computing cheaper and faster, and (3) it encourages further research
in this new area by enabling the publishing of research results and the release
of open-source software. The project also involves high-school outreach
workshops to broaden participation in computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
