A remarkable aspect of algebraic number theory lies in its revealing of
connections between objects that appear to be of entirely different natures. The
overarching principle of the research of the PI is that certain algebraic
problems can be reinterpreted directly as geometric problems in higher
dimension, providing intriguing connections between objects from different parts
of mathematics. A great wealth of such connections have been found indirectly
through intermediate objects of an analytic nature. The research of the PI aims
to provide a window through which well-known conjectures and statements of
arithmetic may be seen in a new and more direct light.

The PI has conjectured an intricate but explicit relationship between modular
symbols and cup products of cyclotomic units. This and its proposed extensions
say roughly that class groups of cyclotomic fields are explicitly determined by
and determine homology groups of modular curves reduced modulo Eisenstein
ideals. The project aims to strengthen his conjecture and extend it and known
results to higher-dimensional algebraic groups and other global fields. This
involves substantial foundational work to develop the necessary framework for
the desired formulations that are the primary focus of the project. The
expectation is that the geometry of locally symmetric spaces should explicitly
determine the arithmetic of lattices in Galois representations, which is to say
the structure of Selmer groups.
