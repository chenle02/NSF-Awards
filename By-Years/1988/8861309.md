Numerous anchorage-dependent cells show improved attachment, improved growth
and reduced serum requirements when cultured on surfaces coated with
extracellular matrix components (ECM). The major proteins of ECM are
fibronectin, laminin and type IV collagen, and most of the cell adhesion
activities of these proteins reside in two peptide segments, RCG and YIGSR.
Since these peptides are active when immobilized onto surfaces, the research
proposed here will covalently immobilize these peptides onto polystyrene, and
then cell types will be assayed for attachment and cell growth. This technology
should provide inexpensive culture products and improve the efficiency of
culturing many types of anchorage-dependent animal cells.
