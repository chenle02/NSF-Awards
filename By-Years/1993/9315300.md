9315300 Janes Although some stars in our galaxy may have formed soon after the
origin of the universe, the galaxy itself probably coalesced only gradually with
the galactic disk forming several billion years later. Old open star clusters
which formed early in the history of the disk will be studied. An improved
understanding of the relation between the ages, compositions and velocities of
these objects will be sought. This information is essential to constructing a
comprehensive model for the formation and evolution of the galactic disk. ***
