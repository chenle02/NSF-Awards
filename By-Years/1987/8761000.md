The objective of this SBIR Phase I proposal is to study the feasibility of
automatically scheduling multi-machine complexes on a real-time basis and
implementing a unified computer system to provide new scheduling tools in
automated systems. Real-time scheduling by separating schedule generation and
regeneration tasks from schedule adaptation/recovery tasks will be investigated.
The effectiveness of heuristics to automatically determine variable rescheduling
periods, schedule adaptation/recovery procedures, and schedule regeneration
procedures will be explored. This research should lead to a new software product
and is motivated by user requirements derived from applications of a current
software product, FACTOR, which provides shop floor scheduling tools. FACTOR was
developed under a prior SBIR grant. If this Phase I research is successful, a
Phase II proposal will be submitted.
