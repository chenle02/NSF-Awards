It has been known for quite some time that metaphors and analogies can
redescribe an object, thereby creating new perspectives on it. However, this
phenomenon has not yet been properly addressed in cognitive science and AI
research. Previous work has identified and characterized this process of
redescription that underlies creative instances of metaphor and analogy. This
work will implement a computational model of resdescription in the proportional
analogy domain. In this framework, an object is seen as an element of a finitely
generated algebra, and a "description of the object is defined to be any
possible way in which that object can be generated from other objects by
applying appropriate operators. Typically, an object can be generated in many
ways and, consequently, has many descriptions. In designing the model, the
problem then, is to find efficient algorithms and heuristics which select
appropriate descriptions of the objects so that the analogy relation is
comprehensible.
