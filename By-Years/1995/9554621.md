The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) is holding a series of regional
workshops for mathematicians who teach statistics but have little formal
training in the subject. These workshops provide participants first-hand
experiences of active learning strategies by which undergraduates can
investigate elements of statistical thinking. Follow-up activities will support
the workshop participants as they form a community, linked by electronic mail,
in which they share ideas about teaching statistics. These workshops will
introduce participants to: 1) the nature of statistical thinking, particularly
concentrating on how statistical concepts and methods differ from mathematical
ones; 2) hands-on activities through which students can participate actively in
their discovery and understanding of statistical concepts and properties; 3)
assessment practices which go beyond testing and grading to establish a dialogue
between students and instructor that leads to both improved teaching and a more
authentic assessment of students' understanding of statistics and data analysis;
4) technology not simply as a tool for analyzing data but also as a vehicle for
active learning and as a resource for acquiring teaching materials.
