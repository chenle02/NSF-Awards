This award provides renewed support of the National Drosophila Species Resource
Center (NDSRC), a collection of 250 species of the fruit fly Drosophila. The
collection, which began operation at the University of Texas (Austin) over 50
years ago, includes over 1405 living strains that are used for basic studies in
genetics, developmental and population biology, ecology and evolution. The
number of species in the collection has increased by about 10% since 1990. Each
year, the NDSRC provides approximately 1000 samples of its collection to
scientists throughout the world at modest charge. Operation of the collection is
guided by the principal investigator, Dr. Jong S. Yoon, and an extemal advisory
committee first established by the American Society of Naturalists in 1975.\par
