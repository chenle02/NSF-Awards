This project continues research into data structures which allow fast
searching. A major area of interest involves data structures for rapidly
scanning set of elements to find the subset that lies in a particular geometric
region, and to thereby develop a better understanding of "range query" costs
(from the vantage points of current software needs, potential geometric query
objects, a dynamic setting, a static setting, tradeoffs between retrieval time
and memory space.) A second goal is to continue research into how to efficiency
implement a non-procedu- ral set-theoretic database query language, similar to
the rela- tional calculus or SETL, in a main memory database. Other areas of
study will include possible examinations of dynamimc perfect hashing, compact
representations of sorted lists and communication delays inherent in parallel
processing. The importance of this research is that geometric region searching
has applications into a wide range of area where the data can be though of as
mapped out in space - VLSI circuit design, graphic-design interfaces, and census
or statistical database applications based on geographical regions. Efficient
retrieval, using advanced technology such as very large main memories for
computer, is critical to developing these applications.
