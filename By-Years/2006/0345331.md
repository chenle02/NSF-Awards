ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broad-scale disturbances such as fire, drought
and biological invasions can have major ecological consequences. However, it is
difficult to study their effects when they are unpredictable in space and time.
This research will determine the effect of periodical cicadas on the dynamics of
forest systems. Periodical cicadas emerge every 17 or 13 years, depending upon
species, after extended below-ground feeding on tree roots. The 2004 emergence
is likely to be one of the largest insect outbreaks on Earth, providing the rare
opportunity to critically examine the impact of a major biological disturbance.
Preliminary work suggests that cicadas have strong preferences among tree
species, favor young successional forest sites, and have chronic effects on tree
growth. We will contrast forest composition in high density vs. cicada-free
sites, and will manipulate cicada colonization by netting blocks of early
successional forest. Long-term effects of cicadas on different host species will
be examined through the analysis of tree rings. This research will improve our
understanding of disturbance events and forest dynamics, and may serve as a
useful model for other, less predicable biotic disturbances. Further, this
research provides a unique opportunity to educate the local community about
forest systems, and to actively involve students in an exciting event that
incorporates "science as process" learning activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
