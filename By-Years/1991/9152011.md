This project is improving both quantitatively and qualitatively the nuclear
physics laboratory and to a lesser extent, the nonlinear and optics experiments,
at California State Polytechnic University-Pomona. The quantitative aspect of
the improvement is needed due to the increase in the number of physics majors at
the University. The qualitative aspect involves using computers to interface
with equipment, which will allow faculty to add novel experiments to the
existing program. Computers also are being used by students for numerical
simulations of nonlinear phenomena.NSF funds are being matched with funds from
non-federal sources.
