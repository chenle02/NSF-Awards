Abstract

Proposal Title: CAREER: Nanofluidic Molecular Filters Proposal Number:
CTS-0347348 Principal Investigator: Jongyoon Han Institution: Massachusetts
Institute of Technology



The aim of the proposed research is to develop new micromachined nanofluidic
filters for biomolecules. Specific goals include fabrication and
characterization of nanofluidic filters, demonstration of molecular-size sieving
mechanism, and a study of the molecular charge sieving. Understanding of
biomolecule interactions with nanopores is essential for optimization and
improvement of molecular separation and filtering. The proposed work will
address this important issue by studying biomolecular separations in nanofluidic
channels with well-defined size and shape as well as surface charge. The details
of the program are well thought out. The fabrication of the nanofluidic channels
with varying depths will be achieved by patterning and etching silicon wafers.
The channels will be characterized by studying the dynamics of various DNA
molecules and comparing the results with previous studies. The PI outlines
potential collaborative opportunities with other research groups at MIT, namely
those that have expertise in areas such as confocal/two-photon microscopy and
fluorescence correlation microscopy. Nanofluidic filters represent a novel
approach for biomolecular separations. In addition to potential practical
applications, this technology will impact our understanding of molecular
interaction and dynamics within nanostructures. The educational aspects of this
program include the incorporation of biological engineering research problems in
existing MIT courses, development of a Molecular Movies website covering
molecular transport and diffusion, and the development of a new lab module that
covers biomolecule transport mechanisms. The educational program will propel
both undergraduate and graduate education to new frontiers in biological
engineering.
