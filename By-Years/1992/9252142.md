Several new biochemistry/molecular biology modules are being developed utilizing
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and associated sophisticated
software to add quantification and open-ended investigative design to the
present curriculum. New experiments or extensions of present experiments,
transferring current research of faculty into the laboratory, will include
determination of the carbohydrate moiety of glycoproteins, fatty acid
composition of membrane lipids, and sequencing of peptides. In addition,
undergraduate independent study projects will now involve more current
technology. The audience includes students in biochemistry, biophysics,
genetics, and zoology, primarily in formal lab courses and independent research,
non-majors in other life sciences departments, and secondary school teachers and
students in special outreach programs of the Department of Biochemistry and
Biophysics, such as NSF-Young Scholars and NIH minority research apprentice
programs.
