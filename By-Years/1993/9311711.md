LEVIN 9311711 This project is aimed at defining the transport and decomposition
of newly deposited algal carbon in the seabed. A multi-tracer mixture
(13C-Algae, clay, glass beads) will be spread on the seafloor at two North
Carolina continental slope sites that are characterized by different infaunal
densities to determine the impact of animal populations on particle mixing and
organic carbon turnover. The 13C will be followed through various reservoirs
(e.g., solid phase organic and inorganic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon,
animal tissues) on time scales ranging from days to one year. Apparent rate
constants for the degradation of specific algal biochemicals will be determined.
Identification of diagenetic products resulting from the turnover of the algal
carbon by the benthic ecosystem will be investigated and related to the
naturally occurring profiles of 234Th and 210Pb. Potential selectivity by
deposit feeders for organic content, particle size and quality of material
ingested will be evaluated. Uptake of 13C- algal material by infauna will be
studied to determine the relative importance of different feeding modes,
distributions within the sediment column and body sizes.
