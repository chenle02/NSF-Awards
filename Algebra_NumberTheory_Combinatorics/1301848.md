The investigator proposes to continue his project on several topics in number
theory, automorphic forms and arithmetic geometry. With various collaborators,
the PI will investigate the Gan-Gross-Prasad periods, the generalized
Waldspurger formula for unitary groups conjectured by Ichino--Ikeda and N.
Harris, as well as the representation theoretical formulation of Gross--Zagier
formula to higher dimensional Shimura varieties by S. Zhang. The PI will also
pursue the arithmetic fundamental lemma, a relevant conjectural identity between
a certain orbital integral and a certain intersection number on Rapoport--Zink
space. This research concerns a special type of mathematical object defined by
algebraic equations, known as algebraic cycles, which contain important
information about geometry and arithmetic. They have applications to the
arithmetic of elliptic curves, particularly the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer
conjecture, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems of the Clay Mathematics
Institute. The study of elliptic curve is crucial in many areas such as
cryptography and information security.
