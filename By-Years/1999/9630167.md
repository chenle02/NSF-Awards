9630167 Odom The major strategies to yield permanent improvements in the quality
of science and technology research that will increase the competitiveness of the
State's major research universities for federal and private sector R&D funds
are: 1) the addition of new tenure track faculty in targeted research areas, 2)
graduate student support, and 3) programs to increase linkages between academic
researchers and their industrial colleagues. Three multi- disciplinary research
areas have been selected for enhancement based on their scientific merit and
potential for high payoff and success. They are: Mechanics and Materials
Research to Evaluate and Improve the Strength of Structural Joints in
Transportation Systems; Fundamental Studies at Polymer/Material Interfaces: A
Junior Faculty Development Proposal in Optical Sensing; and An Interdisciplinary
Program in Signal Transduction. Partnerships with two other NSF-funded
initiatives in South Carolina-the Statewide Systemic Initiative (SSI) and
Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) programs will also be established to
increase the number of minority students being encouraged to pursue careers in
science, engineering and mathematics fields.
