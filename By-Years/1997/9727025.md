9727025 Olmstead Dr. Olmstead's research will address a problem that has
confounded botanists for several hundred years: the pattern of early
diversification of flowering plants (angiosperms). This research project should
help us to understand what these plants may have looked like and what course of
evolution in floral and vegetative features may have taken. In many respects
this is the greatest question in flowering plant systematics. Three prior DNA-
based studies examining individual genes have yielded conflicting results or
have been unable to resolve relationships among the extant representatives of
lineages that were diverged approximately 100 million years ago. The
experimental approach will be to determine DNA sequences for 17 chloroplast
genes totaling approximately 13,000 nucleotides for each of approximately fifty
plant species chosen to represent previously identified critical lineages of the
basal angiosperms. This approach will provide a three-fold increase in the data
currently available to help solve the problem and should be sufficient to
produce resolution. Much of the required material for the research has already
been gathered, and additional sampling will be achieved by cooperation with
other researchers and curators at botanical gardens.
