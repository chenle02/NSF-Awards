9419505 Jaecks Three projects are supported. The first involves the transfer of
excitation form He+ to AR+. The second is the study of the photoionization of
Ar+ using synchrotron radiation with emphasis on the correlations of the product
ion with the outgoing electron. The third experiment is a continuation of prior
research involving the breakup of H3+ into three coulomb interacting fragments.
All of the projects are designed to probe the correlations involving particles
of negative and positive charge in collision environments. ***
