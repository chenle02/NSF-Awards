Professor P. Saab will continue to work on problems concerning stability
properties for spaces of vector-valued functions, namely the Pelczynski property
(V) and the Dieudonne property for spaces of Bochner integrable functions, and
on problems connected with those Banach spaces that are M-ideals in their
biduals as well as on problems arising from studying operators on spaces of
continuous vector-valued functions.
