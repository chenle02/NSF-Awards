Dr. Sutton at the University of California, Berkeley, has constructed a receiver
which can be used for astronomical observations at submillimeter wavelengths.
This project consists primarily of enhancing the scientific capabilities of an
otherwise working instrument. By installing the receiver on a telescope and
obtaining spectroscopic data on molecular lines at a frequency of 345 GHz, Dr.
Sutton will prove the performance of his instrumentation for astronomical
research in a newly opened window of the electromagnetic spectrum. The
submillimeter wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum has been largely
inaccessible for astronomical observations due to the limitations of the Earth's
atmosphere as well as technical difficulties with constructing receivers and
telescopes for use at such short wavelengths. That situation is rapidly
changing. Currently a number of large, high surface accuracy telescopes are
becoming available, and the scientific productivity is limited primarily by the
quality of the receivers. Several groups are constructing receivers for these
telescopes. Dr. Sutton is at the forefront of this receiver development effort.
