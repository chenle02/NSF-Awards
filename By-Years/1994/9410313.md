9410313 Chong This proposal deals with issues in parametric and nonparametric
decision and control problems for Discrete Event Systems (DESs). DESs are
dynamical systems that are driven by the occurrence of physical events, and
arise in virtually all man-made systems, including manufacturing systems,
communication networks, distributed computer systems, logistic systems, and
vehicular traffic. The proposal considers performance oriented DES models, and
focuses on the problem of performance optimization. Methods for optimizing DESs
have received significant interest in recent years, and show tremendous promise
for the development of efficient ways to optimize large-scale complex man-made
systems. An objective of the study is to couple perturbation analysis methods
with optimization algorithms (both parametric and nonparametric), with the aim
of gaining further rigorous understanding into when and why they work, and
developing algorithms and tools that will be useful in DES decision and control
problems. This work emphasizes applications in manufacturing systems,
communication networks, and real-time computer systems. ***
