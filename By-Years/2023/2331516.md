This project seeks to identify ways to restructure the research enterprise to
more routinely create rigorous, relevant knowledge that contributes to impactful
and equitable societal outcomes. These ways include growing demand for engaged
research: processes by which policymakers, researchers, community leaders, and
others work together to identify evidence needs, bring together different kinds
of knowledge and expertise, and use evidence to accomplish shared goals. To
support this work, universities and the other institutions that are central to
the research ecosystem must develop their capacity to support engaged research
and other forms of policy- or societally-relevant scholarship. Momentum on these
issues comes from all sectors of society. The federal government has prioritized
open and impactful research through the Year of Evidence for Action and the Year
of Open Science and related directives. Funders have recently launched or scaled
up initiatives for supporting engaged research and mobilizing universities
toward institutional change.

In order to explore how institutions can advance engaged research and to provide
a context for leaders of related initiatives to connect and better align their
efforts, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine will
convene a 1 1/2 day public workshop on building institutional capacity for
engaged research and other forms of policy- or societally-impactful scholarship.
Following the event, the National Academies will publish a report that
summarizes discussions at the meeting. The workshop and report will anchor a
follow-on set of activities to enact ideas that emerge during discussion.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
