Einstein both proposed and retracted an addition of a cosmological constant
Lambda term to his equations describing gravity as curvature of space and time.
Recent observations indicate the presence of a small, positive Lambda. As shown
by the PI and collaborators, the notions of spin and mass are mathematically
richer if this the case. The project will in part be devoted to a study of these
new phenomena. In addition, the theoretical understanding of what a quantum
theory of gravitation might look like, has significantly advanced in a large
part through studies of string theories which replace particle excitations with
those of fundamental strings. Strikingly, many new results in mathematics have
arisen from these considerations. The PI will investigate various aspects of
this math/physics interplay, including a generalization of strings to membranes,
random matrices and supersymmetry.
