Proposal Title: NIRT: Fabrication of Hollow-fiber Polymer/Porous-layer
Nanocomposite Membranes for Gas Separations&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
CTS-0403574&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Michael
Tsapatsis&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Minnesota - Twin
Cities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in
response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 03-043, category
NIRT. The objective of this project is to study the synthesis and properties of
nanostructured inorganic/polymer composites for application in gas separation
technology. Flakes of clay will be incorporated into polymers and fabricated
into tubes used in gas separation experiments. The blend of experiment and
modeling will provide an underlying basis for understanding the compatibility of
the polymeric and inorganic constituents. The effect of structural properties on
permeability at different length scales will be probed. By spanning several
length scales, including the nanoscale, the team will contribute to fundamental
knowledge regarding the behavior of nanoscale materials. The team plans to
extend their work to developing new approaches to making layered composites. In
terms of the broader impacts, education and outreach activities center on
undergraduate research and research experiences for K-12 teachers. A
collaborative effort with a Czech group will focus on the development of
charged, polyelectrolytes, which could be used in the fabrication of porous
layer nanocomposite membranes. There are strong ties to industrial partners that
can help transfer technology in the fabrication of improved
membranes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
