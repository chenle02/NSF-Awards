The aim of this research is to investigate strengthening mechanisms in deposited
epitaxial single-crystal nitride/metal superlattices where the layers have
different slip systems. Materials systems are NbN/Mo, NbN/W, VN/Cr, AlN/Mo, and
AlN/W, providing both cubic-B1/cubic-BCC and hexagonal-wurtzite/cubic-BCC
combinations. Both (001) and (111) oriented MgO and W substrates are used. It
will be determined if AlN can be grown in a cubic structure when surrounded with
cubic (001) layers. These materials should exhibit large strength and hardness
enhancements due to the superlattice structure. Correlations between layer
characteristics, strength, and hardness will provide new information on
strengthening mechanisms. Changes in the layer lattice mismatch (in
superlattices containing alloy VN-NbN or Cr-Mo layers) are used to produce
superlattices with both coherent and incoherent interfaces. Unlike previously-
studied nitride/nitride superlattices, these layers are immiscible such that the
structures are stable and retain their desirable characteristics at high
temperatures. Structure a nd property studies versus annealing time and
temperature are carried out, and the results compared with results from
nitride/nitride superlattices. %%% There is technological interest in
nitride/nitride superlattices where early results show dramatic improvements
over conventional nitride coatings in cutting tools.
