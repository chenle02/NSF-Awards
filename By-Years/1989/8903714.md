The Gordon Summer Research Conferences are held every summer on a number of
scientific topics. These meetings are well recognized for the presentation of
new data (sometimes preliminary or controversial), free flowing discussion and
interchange between scientists at all levels. Although the speakers include the
leaders of the field, presentations of new interesting data by young
investigators are included, and places at all meetings are reserved for young
scientists (postdocs and graduate students). These meetings are regarded as
among the best of the scientific meetings.
