9704780 Collins This project aims to improve understanding of polycrystalline
materials, specifically GaAs and CdTe for this study, through microscopic
investigations of individual grains, grain boundaries, and interfaces, and the
effects of surface passivation treatments on these features. The key component
of the approach involves the use of near field scanning optical microscopy(NSOM)
transmission, along with photocurrent, photoluminescence and minority carrier
lifetime measurements. %%% The project addresses basic research issues in a
topical area of materials science having technological relevance to electronics
and photonics. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at
a fundamental level to polycrystalline materials. Additionally, the fundamental
knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute
to improving the performance of these materials in a variety of applications by
providing a better understanding and a basis for producing improved materials,
and materials combinations. An important feature of the program is the
integration of research and education through the training of students in a
research area with strong technological relevance. ***
