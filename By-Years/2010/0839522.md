This Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) Phase I project will
develop and demonstrate a low cost, multi-disciplinary Engineering Principles
Demonstrator based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) on-chip
experiments. The Demonstrator is designed to address a critical need in
engineering education of more directly integrating experiments into engineering
classrooms and curricula. MEMS technology can be effectively used to demonstrate
most of the physical phenomena that engineering students must understand and
become proficient at applying in their professions. Unlike conventional
technology, which requires separate, cumbersome and often marginalized
laboratory courses, MEMS experiments can be performed on a time scale consistent
with direct integration into lectures, they are intrinsically safe, as well as
environmentally efficient. The Demonstrator software can be used to integrate
explanation of relevant principles as well as to provide designed experiments
and analysis assistance within the product.

The primary innovation in this proposal revolves around the use of MEMS
technology to teach engineering fundamentals to undergraduate engineering
students. The proposed demonstrator is broadly applicable across a variety of
engineering curricula. The potential advantages to society with a technology-
and knowledge-based economy follw from the quality of engineering students
graduating with skills and knowledge to solve national challenges. With the
economy of the United States and its standard of living predicated on high
technology innovation, the benefits to the US economy would be expected to be
significantly higher relative to other, less technologically oriented economies.
The outcomes of this project is expected to impact a large number of students
who graduate from US engineering schools without the fundamental grasp of
physical phenomena which is critical for innovating new solutions and products.
