This RTG proposal is focused on training in low-dimensional topology and its
applications. The study of low-dimensional manifolds has become one of the
central areas of research activity in mathematics. The PI's have an established
track-record of research accomplishments in several different areas of low-
dimensional topology; for example knot theory, 3 and 4-manifold topology,
hyperbolic manifolds and symplectic topology. The project will also allow the
PI's to continue their training of postdocs and students. The subject of this
RTG Proposal interacts with several other branches of mathematics as well as the
applied sciences. It therefore provides fertile ground for research, education
and training experiences at all levels.

One of the main features of the proposal is to build, and elevate, the
successful structure for training and education currently in place in the
Department of Mathematics. However, an important new component of our proposal
is training for interdisciplinary research. This will afford postdocs, graduate
and undergraduate students educational and training experiences different from
the traditional ones available at present. We therefore aim to provide a
framework that supports education and training by instruction in the traditional
sense, and also provide opportunity for training experiences in applications of
topology in the physical and biological sciences. As part of this latter effort
the project will promote interactions with scientists studying knotting
phenomena in DNA and biomedical mathematics. As part of our outreach efforts, we
will instigate a public lecture series that will raise the profile and level of
awareness of the role of topology in other sciences in the University and local
community.
