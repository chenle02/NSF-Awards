This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research project involving the University of
Michigan and Bilkent University is in the general area of systems and control
theory. Project funding will allow the team from Bilkent University to work for
various periods of time in the laboratory of Dr. Pramod Khargoneker at the
University of Michigan and also allow Dr. Khargonekar a research visit to
Bilkent University. The collaborative research will focus on the problem of
robust stabilization for a variety of possible modeling uncertainties. The
expected theoretical results will yield sufficient conditions for the
solvability of robust stabilization problems and constructive algorithms for
solving these problems. This project in engineering systems fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Turkey to combine complementary talents and pool research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
