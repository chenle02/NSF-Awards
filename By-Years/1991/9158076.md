The PI's work will be divided into two parts, identifying new "gravitational
lens" systems at extragalactic distances and observations of cool stars with
coronae. The PI will be conducting observations of gravitational lens candidates
first identified in the MIT-Green Bank radio survey. In collaboration with J.
Lehar, D. Roberts, and B. Burke, she has just completed monitoring the
gravitational lens 0957+561. These measurements have resulted in a lens time
delay, which can be used to put limits on the cosmological Hubble's constant.
Observations are commencing on the Einstein ring system MG1131+0456, aimed at
characterizing its radio light curve in order to determine whether time delay
measurements can be made with this object as well. The PI will also conduct
observations on active cool main sequence ("dMe") stars to determine whether
they have low-mass companions. These observations will be made with a variety of
collaborators in the U.S. and France. Trial observations to date have succeeded
in detecting the presence of "coronae" around such active stars as YZ CMi, EV
Lac, and AD Leo. Further observations of these stars will be made to determine
the extents of these coronae around the stars exciting them.
