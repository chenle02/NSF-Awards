This grant will run a Recruitment and Mentoring in Mathematics Program (RAMMP)
program, with the purpose of increasing the number of students from
underrepresented groups entering doctoral programs in mathematical sciences. For
three years, ten advanced undergraduate students will divide into teams and
engage in mentored summer research projects in mathematics. The students will
develop their interests in mathematics in an active, supportive community of
peers. The program will be run at the City University of New York, an
institution known for its student diversity, and will expose talented students
to mathematical research and related activities, which form the daily work of a
doctoral student but which many undergraduates never experience. This experience
together with mentorship and community building activities continuing throughout
the year will encourage the student participants to pursue higher degrees and
careers in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research problems
will be selected from the fields of faculty members participating in the program
including Number Theory, Combinatorics, Algebra, Dynamical Systems, and
Geometry. The problems will have a significant computational component and will
be chosen so that even partial student progress will advance the long-term
research agendas of their faculty mentors. Mentors will choose accessible, open
questions whose resolution would lead to the discovery of new phenomena or new
proof techniques with broad applicability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
