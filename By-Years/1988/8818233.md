The behavior of glassy polymers during large-scale deformation will be studied
experimentally and analytically. The goal is to develop constitutive equations
that can be useful for processing of these materials, especially for predicting
force requirements and material behavior, such as non-homogenous deformation
(crazing and shear bands) and spring back. The model will be tested and
validated with numerical simulation of the cold drawing process. The results
will improve the understanding of the phenomenology and the prediction of the
response of these "engineered" polymers to thermomechanical stimuli and should
impact the technologically important area of cold forming of these materials.
