A computer-based gas chromatograph with a mass selector detector (GC/MS) is
being used by the Chemistry Department at Evergreen State College for
undergraduate instruction in organic chemistry, physical chemistry,
environmental chemistry and faculty/student research. By coupling this
instrumental unit with an existing laboratory computer network system, the
advantages of computer interfaced analytical instrumentation in the sciences are
also being demonstrated.
