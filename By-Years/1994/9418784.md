9418784 Wernicke This is a project involving the installation and monitoring of
a continuous GPS network across the Basin and Range. The scientific goal is to
determine whether the geodetically determined strain is concentrated within
bands of historically high seismic moment release, consistent with the elastic
rebound theory, or is spread out in a more diffuse manner. Until now, both land-
and space- based geodetic techniques have had limited success in resolving
heterogeneity in intraplate strain accumulation, because the slip rates along
intraplate fault zones are usually at or below the level of resolution for
conventional GPS or land-based surveys, or about 1mm/yr. However, with the
technique of continuous GPS monitoring, rates of 1mm/yr are resolvable in less
than five years. With appropriate network design, a high-resolution kinematic
image of an entire diffuse orogen is now within reach. ***
