9353399 Clark This is a three year collaboration between Brown University's
Institute for Secondary Education, the Roger Williams Park Zoo, and the middle
schools in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts. The emphasis of the
project is to have science teachers doing hands-on investigative laboratory work
with university scientists at the Zoo. Thirty teachers each year will learn
research techniques as they work at the zoo, exploring themes such as Diversity
and Anthropology, Reproduction and Conservation and Behavior-Morphology and
Environmental Conditions. Workshops will include sessions on teaching for
collaborative learning, using essential questions to frame a curriculum,
stressing inquiry-based learning and using technology. The project staff will
observe and provide support during the academic year. The project is designed to
provide an opportunity for science middle school teachers to experience the Zoo
as a living laboratory and to encourage teachers to use innovative methods which
will enhance science education in the classroom. This proposal is appropriate
for teacher enhancement because it is a leadership project designed to prepare
middle school science teachers to collaborate with a local zoo in developing an
innovative and research-based science program for students. It will also further
the goals of Rhode Island's SSI project. The cost-sharing amount is 41% of the
amount requested from NSF. ***
