The proposed research targets improving the computing environment for important
scientific problems without requiring large expensive systems. The objective of
this new fundamental research is to perform science domain exploration to
broaden the applicability of scalable RC systems and GPUs across other domains
and industry sectors that have great computational&lt;br/&gt;needs; and research
methods and develop an infrastructure to enable domain computational scientists
(not expert users of accelerators) to use accelerator technologies (based on
FPGAs and GPUs) in a productive manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the
proposed work have the potential to greatly expand the use of reconfigurable
computing for solution of critical [problems in science and engineering. The
work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry
members of the center and has the potential to extend the centers portfolio
through collaboration of two of its sites as well as extend the scope and
horizon of the CHREC center research projects and direction, benefiting current
industry members while attracting potential new ones. The PIs research will
likely impact diverse undergraduate and graduate students at each institution.
