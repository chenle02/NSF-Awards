Decision Field Theory for Decision Trees Dynamic programming is the prescribed
method for planning multiple-stage decisions. This prescriptive theory is based
on two fundamental principles: Dynamic consistency and consequentialism.
However, the empirical validity of these two principles has not been tested. The
purpose of this research is to conduct three sets of experiments, where each set
is designed to empirically test the dynamic programming principles of dynamic
consistency and consequentialism.
