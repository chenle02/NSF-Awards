This grant will provide Washington MESA teachers with a forum through which
they can acquire new information on factors that impact math and science
learning as well as time to work with colleagues on strategies to incorporate
the new material into their classroom. Fifty-five Washington MESA teachers will
be able to attend a series of six one-day seminars. Of these two will be
statewide seminars back-to-back with national or state conferences and will be
focused on math and science education or on multicultural issues that impact
learning. The other four seminars will be local, focused on curriculum
development, instructional practices, and career explorations. The areas of
focus for the seminar series will include the incorporation of "hands-on"
activities; problems set in a real-world context; and strengthening the
perceptions that underrepresented minority students warrant high expectations;
and sharing of materials, activities, and projects that work well at various
levels. Seminar participants will come from 8 districts which serve 71% of the
under-represented minority students across Washington state. An amount
equivalent to 115.8% of the NSF award is being contributed as cost-sharing.
