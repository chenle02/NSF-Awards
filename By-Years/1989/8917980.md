Professor P.B.Armentrout is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program. He is studying a number of molecular systems used in the production of
catalytic materials and very short lived chemical species known as reaction
intermediates. This research is done by a technique called flowing afterglow
mass spectroscopy. In this work,the flowing afterglow source is designed to
provide ionized species which are thermalized and hence have well characterized
internal energies. The samples used in this work are coordinatively unsaturated
transition metal centers and are extremely short lived; as a result, they are
detected by a guided ion beam mass spectrometer. These transient species are
important reaction intermediates in many commercial catalytic processes.
