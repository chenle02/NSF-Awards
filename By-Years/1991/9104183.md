This project is concerned with two related problems in the representation
theory of p-adic groups. One is concerned with finding invariants of certain
compact open subgroups in admissible representations of reductive groups over
local fields. The other is concerned with the relationship between the Steinberg
module of an algebraic Q-group, and the cohomology of its arithmetic subgroups.
This research is in the area of representation theory of p-adic groups. The
principal investigator will try to find invariants which measure certain
properties of these groups. This work would have important implications for the
theory of automorphic forms. It will be of interest to algebraists and number
theorists alike.
