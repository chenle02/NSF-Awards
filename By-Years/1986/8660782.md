The aim of this research is to develop methodologies and algorithms to address
problems of cyclic routing. That is, for routing problems where customers must
be visited at regular intervals called cycles. Research to date related to
vehicle routing has assumed that the customer will only be visited once in the
time period under consideration; using this assumption the problems are to
assign each customer to a route, sequence the route, and schedule the visit to
each customer consistent with the route. For a large class of practical vehicle
routing problems, however the one time period assumption is not adequate because
customers must be visited cyclically.
