The thematic programme on Random Geometry will be hosted at Cambridge
University, United Kingdom, from January 12 to July 3, 2015. The purpose of the
programme is to bring together leading researchers from around the world to
explore and develop the burgeoning field of Random Geometry, a new discipline of
mathematics that lies at the intersection of probability, geometry, and
analysis. Random Geometry uses tools from these fields to quantifiably study the
rich geometrical structure of random metric spaces and the random processes that
live within them. Random Geometry is interdisciplinary in nature, and the
intellectual merit of the programme lies in its potential to establish a cross-
fertilization of ideas within different areas of mathematics and connect these
ideas with theoretical physics and other fields of science. Broader impact will
be realized via this exchange of ideas across disciplines and through the
training of a new generation of students to carry on the work in this important
field.

In addition to enabling long-term collaborations between leading researchers,
the programme will allow for the dissemination of new results with conferences
on Conformally Invariant Scaling Limits (Jan 26-30, 2015), Random Graphs and
Trees and their Applications (Mar 16-20, 2015), Random Planar Structures (April
20-24, 2015), and the Geometry of Random Walks and SLE (June 15-19, 2015). The
programme will begin with an Instructional Workshop for Younger Researchers (Jan
12-23, 2015). Funds from this proposal will enable the participation of United
States based students and junior researchers in these programs.
