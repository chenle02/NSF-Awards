9408495 Taylor The Solid State Science Committee (SSSC) proposes to continue its
effort to monitor the health of the field of materials science in the United
States. The committee will prepare a forum on processing and manufacturing of
advanced materials. It will assess the progress that might be achieved with the
new generation of free electron lasers jointly with the Board on Chemical
Sciences and Technology. The SSSC will monitor and provide assistance on
photonics and optical materials to the Board on Physics and Astronomy and the
National Materials Advisory Board on a study on optical sciences and
engineering. %%% The Solid State Science Committee (SSSC) proposes to continue
