&lt;br/&gt;This project brings 100 high school science and math teachers to the
Materials Research Society (MRS) 2004 Fall Meeting, held in Boston on November
29 - December 3, 2004. At the same time, the Strange Matter exhibit developed by
the MRS is on display at the Boston Museum of Science (MOS). An MRS-MOS
partnership that utilizes the infrastructure offered by the MRS Fall Meeting and
the science outreach expertise available at MOS implements activities designed
to communicate materials sciences to the teachers and to the public, and to
highlight needs, opportunities and methods of outreach to researchers attending
the meeting. Teachers are paired with researchers, and together they participate
in activities that include a symposium at the MRS meeting on materials science
in secondary education and on linking educators and researchers, workshops for
teachers at the MOS in association with the Strange Matter project, workshops
for researchers on effective outreach strategies, and talks for the general
public on materials sciences to be held at MOS. The project is expected to have
both short-term impact via knowledge transfer and long-term impact via formation
of long-term relationships between educators and researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
