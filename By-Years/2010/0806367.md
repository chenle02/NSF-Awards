This award will support a study of the effects of baryonic matter on
cosmological constraints on dark energy as derived from future weak lensing
surveys. Large-scale numerical simulations of cosmological structure formation
will be performed that treat the physics of baryons in detail. The information
garnered from the simulation programs will be used to develop the techniques
that will be needed to make optimal use of future photometric surveys to
constrain the properties of dark energy and the process of galaxy
formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work include research
training for a graduate student. All simulation data, processed data products,
analysis tools and software developed as part of this project will be made
available freely to the scientific community. Simulation visualizations and
results will be discussed as part of regular public lecture series at the
Allegheny Observatory and will be incorporated into the Carnegie Science Center
Girls Science &amp; Math Project to build interest in astrophysical sciences.
