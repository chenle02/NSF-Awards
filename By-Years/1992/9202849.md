Many real replacement problems (e.g. vehicle fleets, manufacturing machines,
pavement segments) face budgets on capital expenditure. Only a certain level of
funding is available for maintenance and replacement. Despite the richness of
the replacement literature, there exist few studies which address the effect of
capital rationing on replacement decisions. When budgets are ignored and each
asset analyzed separately, capital expenditures, in aggregate, can fluctuate
wildly and substantially exceed yearly budgets constraints. This research
studies two environments, with replacement of parallel assets under capital
rationing constraints will be investigated: (1) with future technological
changes, and (2) with Markovian deterioration. For the latter, both
deterministic and stochastic deterioration assumptions will be addressed. The
approach is to use integer programming for deterministic problems and a
combination of integer programming and Markov decision processes for stochastic
problems.
