This accomplished based renewal proposal requests funds for two years to
continue research related to magnetic reconnection in solar flares. The
previously developed computer code will now be employed to study two-ribbon
flares, prominence disruptions, and coronal mass ejections. The model shows
promise for investigating all of these phenomena and arriving at specific
results concerning their origin and characteristics. A strong effort will be
made to consider problems which relate to existing observational data. ***
