Flow and transport in porous media arise from a wide variety of real world
problems such as oil recovery, groundwater contaminant remediation, CO2
sequestration, wildfire, magma transport through the Earth crust, and viral
protein trafficking inside host cells. All these problems have tremendous
economic, environmental, medical, and social significance. Mathematical modeling
and computer simulations will provide efficient and inexpensive tools to enhance
our abilities in understanding, predicting, and controlling the aforementioned
problems. Scientific challenges abound in the modeling and simulations of flow
and transport, due to the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the media, multiple
spatial and temporal scales, and uncertainty in these processes. This research
project aims at developing a new class of efficient and robust numerical methods
for coupled flow and transport problems. These methods will be implemented as
computer software modules that can be used for a broad range of scientific
computing tasks. This project will also provide hands-on training opportunities
for graduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups.

Specifically, this project focuses on development of novel finite element
methods for solving coupled flow and transport problems in porous media. This
will be accomplished by combining the weak Galerkin (WG) and Eulerian-Lagrangian
approaches. The WG approach establishes a new type of approximations of
differential operators by using degrees of freedom in element interiors as well
as those on mesh skeleton. WG finite element schemes could offer preferred
features such as local conservation and symmetric positive-definite discrete
linear systems. The Eulerian-Lagrangian approach efficiently utilizes the flow
information and produces small temporal truncation errors. This enables robust
long-time simulations of transport problems. By incorporating these two
approaches, the PI and collaborators will design, analyze, and implement a
family of new finite element methods for solving the Darcy equation, convection-
dominated transport equations, the miscible displacement problem, and two-phase
flow problems. These new methods overcome disadvantages of existing methods but
maintain those well-received advantages, for example, local conservation.
Software modules (a Matlab toolbox and C++ libraries based on PETSc) will be
developed to put these new methods into practical uses. PhD students will be
trained through this project to gain integrated capabilities of mathematical
modeling and algorithm development for challenging real world problems.
