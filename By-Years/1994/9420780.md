Abstract CTS-9420780 J. L. Anderson, Carnegie-Melon University An investigation
of the electrophoretic motion of nonspherical colloidal particles is proposed.
The existence of a critical current needed to align slender particles at small
pore apertures will be experimentally determined. A hydrodynamic model,
including the rotation and translation of spheroids and spherical doublets in
nonhomogeneous electric fields will be develop. The theory will be extended to
motion of particles induced by a gradient of the particles concentration near a
surface-active surface (diffusiophoresis of colloids. The research has relevance
to electrofiltration, and provides fundamental understanding for other potential
applications where electrophoretic alignment is important.
