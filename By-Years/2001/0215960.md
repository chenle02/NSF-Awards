This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will produce an
emission-free control valve to address an industry need for environmentally safe
valves. The axially rotated Venturi Off-Set Technology valve will be equipped
with a conical seat for internal sealing and a magnetic coupling for leak-proof
actuation. The commercial potential of this project will provide the Petroleum
industry with valves that are emission-free which will result in a cleaner
environment.
