The correct functioning of living systems requires maintaining a certain level
of fidelity in all processes dealing with the transfer of information.
Translation is the process by which genetic information is transferred from a
nucleic acid sequence into the amino acid sequence of a protein. The fidelity of
translation is determined at two major points: the accuracy of aminoacyl-tRNA
selection by the ribosomes and synthesis of cognate amino acid/tRNA pairs by
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) in the course of the aminoacylation reaction.
The aaRSs define the genetic code by pairing tRNAs with the corresponding amino
acids. Accurate aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis often involves an additional editing
activity intrinsic to many aaRSs. The editing activity significantly decreases
the level of mistakes in aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis in vitro and in vivo, although
quantitative analysis of its contribution to the overall fidelity of translation
has not been performed. The overall aim of this project is to develop
experimental systems to quantitatively measure the frequency of aaRS-dependent
misincorporation for several amino acids and evaluate the contribution of aaRS
editing to overall translational fidelity. The intellectual merits of this
research are in achieving significant progress in understanding fundamental
biological problems, namely fidelity control in general and the editing
mechanisms employed during translation in particular. The broader impacts
resulting from the project will be to provide integrated laboratory research and
training programs for both undergraduate and graduate students and to establish
a new collaborative network.
