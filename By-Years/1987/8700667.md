This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The
principal investigator proposes to design/build in situ flow-through/high
temperature reaction probes for the first time and to use them for the nuclear
magnetic resonance study of important heterogeneous catalysis problems. The
catalysis research will focus on the structure, dynamics, and reactivity of
adsorbates on supported catalysts and the formation of coke on oxide catalysts.
If the probe can be built as proposed, nuclear magnetic resonance will become
one of the most useful techniques for the study of real catalysts.
