9302173 Gladfelter At the core of all materials research is the need to know
composition and structure. These determine the physical properties and may
reflect the synthesis and processing history of the materials. Rutherford
backscattering (RBS) and forward recoil spectrometry (FRES) are two powerful
tools for establishing the compositions and depth profiles of thin films.
Several programs at the University of Minnesota will make use of this RBS
System, including a) using RBS to evaluate diffusion processes in olivine that
may contribute to movement of material in the earth's mantle, b) using RBS to
characterize compositions of high temperature superconducting metal oxide films
c) using RBS to characterize chemical reactions that occur at interfaces and
control the fracture mechanics of the films, d) using FRES to quantify the
hydrogen (or deuterium) content of films grown from organometallic precursors,
e) using FRES to study diffusion of polymers. ***
