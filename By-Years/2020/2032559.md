Soil moisture is important for the climate system because it controls
evaporation, transpiration, and energy movement from the land to the atmosphere.
Through these mechanisms, soil moisture can influence the timing and intensity
of precipitation at daily to seasonal timescales. However, there is a lack of
scientific consensus on the sign, strength, and overall importance of soil
moisture-precipitation feedbacks. This project will improve our understanding of
the land and atmosphere processes that are important to convection initiation
and precipitation during the warm season (May to September) in the central
United States. The knowledge gained from this project will be used to improve
the accuracy of simulations in operational weather and climate models. The
project will provide undergraduate students, a graduate student, and
postdoctoral researchers with training in research, science communication, and
public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will assess the nature and
strength of soil moisture feedbacks on convective precipitation in the central
United States using a coupled observation-modeling framework to examine the
physical processes linking the soil and boundary layer atmosphere. The
objectives of the project are to: (1) evaluate whether convection occurs
preferentially over wet or dry soils in the central United States, (2) quantify
the influence of soil moisture on convection and precipitation using process-
based metrics and high quality land and atmosphere observations, and (3)
evaluate the response of convection and precipitation to changes in soil
moisture conditions using the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. This
project will utilize soil moisture observations from the National Coordinated
Soil Moisture Monitoring Network and hundreds of thousands of convection events
identified by the ThOR algorithm. This combination of in situ observations and
the immense sample size of convective events provides an unprecedented
opportunity to evaluate soil moisture â€“ precipitation feedbacks. The results of
this study will lead to improvements in the parameterization schemes that are
used in weather and climate models. This study focuses on a region that has the
densest land-surface and boundary layer observations, but the process-based
understanding of land-atmosphere interactions and their role in modulating the
climate is readily transferable to other regions around the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
