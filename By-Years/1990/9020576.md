Investigators from the Naval Research Laboratory and Lamont- Doherty Geological
Observatory will integrate airborne gravity measurement with the combined
airborne radar and aeromagnetic Corridor Aerogeophysics of the Southeastern Ross
Transect Zone (CASERTZ) program. This program will survey two 220 x 330 km
regions between the Transantarctic Mountains and Marie Byrd Land during the
1990-1991 and 1991- 1992 field seasons. The survey will consist of a normal 5 x
5 km track spacing and will be designed to determine the motion, volcanism and
deformation history of the Ellsworth- Whitmore crustal block of West Antarctic
and the relationship of the tectonics of this block to the evolution of the Byrd
Subglacial Basin, the Interior Ross Embayment and the Transantarctic Mountains.
The airborne gravimentry will improve the capability to model crustal thickness.
The airborne gravity system will consist of a modified BGM- 3 gravimeter and
carrier-phase GPS. Secondary measurement sources will include precision pressure
altimetry and raw inertial sensor data as aids to the primary measurement
sources.
