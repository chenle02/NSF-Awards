The proposed planning activity seeks to undertake planning of the establishment
of a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) site at
Indiana University of the existing Center for Cloud and Autonomic Computing. The
center currently involves Arizona, Florida, Mississippi State and Rutgers, and
industry and government partners in the field. The Indiana University site
intends to provide additional capabilities for the center to cover the areas of
basic cloud infrastructure including tools to support the FutureGrid testbed,
security, networking, storage, programming models and applications. The site
intends to explore the utility of clouds to support scientific research
including infrastructure tools and development of innovations in extensions of
the MapReduce programming model, identification of science applications suitable
for clouds, privacy preserving algorithms for health informatics on clouds,
integration of high performance networking and data
architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned site, in combination with the
existing center plans to help build innovation capacity in cloud computing and
its supporting science and engineering through cooperatively defined research on
key challenges with industry. The outcomes from the center have the potential to
broadly impact the public and private sectors. The site plans to have a
significant impact on curriculum and student training at the undergraduate and
graduate levels. The planned site intends to actively engage in outreach to
Minority Serving Institutions through existing consortia.
