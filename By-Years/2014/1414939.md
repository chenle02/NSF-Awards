Personalized medicine is a medical model that the healthcare community is
actively striving to achieve. Related to personalized care are technologies that
allow affordable and efficient access to a patient's unique molecular
characteristics (i.e genetic distinctions). This research will lead to the
development of a nanoparticle based biosensor which observes changes in genetic
material, such as DNA, under simulated environments. Understanding the behavior
of biomolecules is important in determining their functions. This research will
be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Kang Wang, responsible for a dark-field
microscopy system, a vital component for the proposed sensor, at Nanjing
University in China.

The aforementioned microscopy system is a single particle scattering
spectroscopy system consisting of a dark-field microscope mounted with a
spectroscopy unit and a charge-coupled device (CCD). This system can observe the
scattering spectroscopy of nanoparticles. The scattering spectroscopy of these
nanoparticles can vary based on biorecognition reactions and their ability to
cause a change in the dielectric constant on the nanoparticle surface. The
proposed research explores this phenomenon further by looking at conformational
changes that occur in nanoparticle-tethered- DNA sequences under stimulated
environments and determining the effects of these changes on the dielectric
constant of the nanoparticle. Being able to observe a change in the dieletric
constant will lead to the development of a system which characterizes
conformational changes of DNA, thus a nanoprobe for detecting micro-environments
in living cells that will provide greater signal intensity than conventional
fluorescence probes. This system would be useful to researches looking for an
analysis technique that would characterize microprocesses of several types
(e.g., metabolism of cells or the corrosion of metals). This NSF EAPSI award is
funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.
