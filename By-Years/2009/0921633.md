There is a large body of research concerning factors related to eyewitness
accuracy and on the influence of eyewitness evidence on juror judgments.
However, this research largely ignores that approximately 90 percent of cases
are resolved through plea bargaining.

Existing research on factors influencing attorneys' plea bargaining suggests
decisions are driven by the strength of evidence against a defendant.
Prosecutors offer a plea bargain when the evidence is weak and defense attorneys
recommend a plea bargain when evidence is strong. It is possible that aspects of
eyewitness identification evidence may influence attorneys' plea bargaining
decisions. However, it is unclear whether attorneys are sensitive to variations
in the quality of eyewitness evidence.

Research indicates attorneys report awareness about the influence of some
witnessing factors on identification accuracy while demonstrating a lack of
knowledge about the influence of other factors. In addition, defense attorneys
and prosecuting attorneys may have different levels of awareness of the
relationships among different witnessing factors and identification accuracy.
Thus, it is unclear how variations in eyewitness evidence strength will
influence attorneys' actual behavior. In addition, it is not known how other
legal factors (i.e., pretrial publicity, defendant's prior record) will interact
with eyewitness evidence quality to influence attorneys' plea bargaining
decisions.

This project consists of two studies to investigate factors that influence plea
bargaining decisions. Study 1 explores whether prosecutors and defense attorneys
are sensitive to variations in the quality of eyewitness evidence. Several
factors related to eyewitness accuracy are manipulated. After reading a case
summary, attorneys will rate their willingness to offer/recommend a plea bargain
and their expectations about a jury verdict if the case were to go to trial.
Study 2 manipulates the quality of eyewitness identification evidence and the
presence of other legal factors that may influence plea bargaining behavior.
