The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project between Dr.
Lawrence A. Kappers of the University of Connecticut and Dr. I. Foldvari of the
Research Laboratory for Crystal Physics, Budapest is to study the defect
properties of nonlinear optical crystals. Specific materials to be investigated
include doped and undoped single crystals of a new bismuth oxide, Bi2TeO5 as
well as other materials that possess an intrinsic luminescence, (ZnWO4,
Bi4Ge3O12, Bi12GeO20, Bi12SiO20 and Bi12TiO20). Single crystals will be grown at
the Research Laboratory for Crystal Physics in Hungary using the Czochralski
technique while crystal characterization will be performed at the University of
Connecticut before and after electron irradiation using electron paramagnetic
resonance, optical and spectroscopy. The experimental efforts will include
studies of point defects and their involvement in scintillation,
photorefractive, and photochromic processes in these materials. Comparisons of
the results for the different crystals will contribute to our basic
understanding of these phenomena. In addition, complementary theoretical studies
will build upon results of the researchers' previous collaboration on cluster
modeling of defects in paratellurite and will extend those methods to Bi2TeO5.
Overall, combined results should improve our knowledge of those oxide crystals
with properties that also have a potential for applications in optical devices.
This project in condensed matter physics fulfills the program objectives of
advancing science by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Hungary to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in the areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
