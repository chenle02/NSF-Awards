The proposed research program will investigate the effect of temperature
distributions on the flexural behavior of frozen soil to have better handle on
designing frozen soil retaining walls. Artificial ground freezing in a weak soil
and high water table conditions present economical means of for retaining earth
pressures. Through an analytical/experimental reseasrch scheme frozen soil beams
with non-uniform temperature distibution will be analyzed, and a finite element
computer code will be developed to accomodate temperature effects.
