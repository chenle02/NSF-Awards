This research will focus on analytical and numerical aspects of inverse
problems for partial differential equations, and in particular: 1) inverse
"source" problems for semilinear elliptic equations, and 2) inverse
"coefficient" problems for linear elliptic equations with spatially varying
coefficients. The data used for reconstruction in both cases consists of
overdetermined (Dirichlet or Neumann) boundary data. The analytical component of
the work concerns such questions as identifiability and continuous dependence.
For the inverse "source problem", the PI furthermore will investigate the
relation to the well known Schiffer (or Pompeiu) conjecture; for the inverse
"coefficient" problem the PI will continue his investigation of bounds as well
as the relation between the isotropic and aniostropic cases. The numerical work
will be devoted to the design of effective reconstruction methods which to the
largest extent possible rely on structural information about the solutions of
the underlying PDE. The research has direct applications to several important
practical problems, for instance: 1) the interpretation of magnetic diagnostics
for Tokamak (fusion) devices, 2) medical impedance imaging, and 3)
nondestructive testing of mechanical parts. Part of the research is concerned
with determining the sufficiency of the proposed boundary data for the various
reconstructions (proving uniqueness and continuous dependence results). Another
part of the research involves the design of effective algorithms, for instance
for the detection and location of cracks using real experimental data. There
will be an active involvement of post-doctoral researchers as well graduate
students and hopefully even some advanced undergraduate students in various
aspects of the research.
