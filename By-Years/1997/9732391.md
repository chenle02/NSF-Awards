This Chemistry Division award provides support for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry Department, University of Puerto
Rico, Rio Piedras, directed by Dr. Ana R. Guadalupe. Ten students will
participate each year over the next three years in an 8-week summer program. The
students will be exposed to a variety of research topics across all the fields
of chemistry, and through a series of orientation lectures, seminars, and
workshops they will be introduced to safety practices, ethical issues, modern
chemical instrumentation, communication and presentation skills, and use of the
internet. Students will be required to report research results at an
undergraduate research symposium
