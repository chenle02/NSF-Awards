PROGRAM DIRECTOR?S RECOMMENDATION

IIP 0934197 Drexel University Hu

Drexel University (DU) is planning to partner with the University of Louisiana-
Lafayette (UL) to form a new NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
(I/UCRC) entitled "Center for Visual Decision Informatics." The mission of the
Center will be to develop new visual and analytical methods that leverage modern
computer hardware and software, and develop analysis and discovery tools that
can be applied to this complex data-based decision-making process.

DU's research projects in biomedical image mining, analysis of brain circuits,
exploration of large-scale knowledge maps, and visual analysis for reasoning
demonstrate research strengths that are complementary to those at the University
of Louisiana-Lafayette. The proposed site will provide a platform to stimulate
innovation through collaboration among members, and will improve the training
and education of employees of Center members using immersive visualization.

The proposed site will provide students and faculty a platform to conduct
industry-relevant research, an effective and convenient mechanism for
collaboration formation and maintenance; and will also promote, catalyze and
accelerate the commercialization of technology innovations. DU is committed to
recruiting participants from groups that are traditionally under-represented in
computer science and other scientific disciplines; and will promote this program
through its ongoing working relationships with colleagues at minority
institutions including Lincoln University at Pennsylvania.
