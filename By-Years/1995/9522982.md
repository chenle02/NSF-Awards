9522982 Khoshnevis The current state of the art of rapid prototyping technology
is limited by parts size, surface quality and geometric tolerance. In this one
year research project, a novel approach to improving surface quality will be
attempted. It is a synergistic approach combining extrusion of a paste like
consistency materials with a trowel like smoothing tool controlled by a robot.
Eventhough this contour crafting approach builds on established 3D additive
fabrication techniques, several fundamental design issues of components and
their assembly into a prototype machine need to be addressed in order to test
out the feasibility of this innovative approach. Rapid prototyping technology
has been well accepted by designers to test out form and fit of new parts. The
technology is slowly evolving to the stage of making final parts directly from a
computer design eliminating several manufacturing steps. This leads to the
potential of very fast cycle time from design state to the product launch.
Additional benefits could be envisioned in reduced work in process and reduced
inventory of finished goods.
