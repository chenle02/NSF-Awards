9315127 Janecke This award supports a two-year cooperative research project
between Professor Joachim Janecke, Department of Physics, University of
Michigan, and Professor Mamoru Fujiwara, Research Center for Nuclear Physics,
(RCNP) Osaka University, Osaka, Japan. In addition to Professor Janecke, a
postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student from the University of Michigan will
visit Japan to participate in the joint research project. The Michigan
researchers will perform experiments related to the study of charge-exchange
reactions and the properties of giant resonances at the new Ring Cyclotron
Facility and the new magnetic spectrometer Grand Raiden at Osaka University. The
particle energy available at the RCNP facility favors spinflip transitions. The
proposed experiments to investigate microscopic structures of Gamow-Teller
resonances and characteristics of the charge-reaction mechanisms in terms of
isovector non-spinflip, spinflip, and tensor interactions represent an extension
and continuation of work performed by the U.S. principal investigator at the
Indiana University Cyclotron Facility over the past several years. These
experiments will yield new data that may shed light on the character of isobaric
analog states. ***
