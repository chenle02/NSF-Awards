This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
blood-compatible biomaterials for end-stage renal dialysis (ESRD) catheters
through an integrated biological coating (IBC) that combines protein
passivation, anticoagulation, and fibrinolytic mechanisms on the surface. Phase
II work will build on the Phase I demonstration that internal and external
surfaces of BaSO4-loaded polyurethane catheters were activated by an electron
cyclotron resonance (ECR) process that promoted uniform deposition of an IBC
coating. In the Phase II project, the coating process will be optimized and
deposition equipment will be upgraded to enhance reliability and repeatability.
Finished catheters will be produced and evaluated for blood compatibility
through in vitro human blood testing and ex vivo sheep shunt model experiments.
Finished IBC catheters will also undergo rigorous mechanical, biocompatibility,
and toxicity testing to show compliance with FDA standards.

The principal commercial application of this project will be on the catheter
industry. The proposed technology will also find applications in coatings for
other blood-contacting devices such as grafts, polymeric stents , valves and by-
pass systems.
