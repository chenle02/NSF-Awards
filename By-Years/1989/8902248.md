This project is concerned with both classical and quantum mechanical spin
systems on a lattice. The research will begin by developing techniques for
rigorously studying systems which are in a phase in which there is a unique
Gibbs state and exponential decay of the correlations. These techniques will be
applied to various problems which can be cast in the form of showing that a
given system is in such a phase. These problems include the majority rule
renormalization group transformation, the predictions of Haldane for the spin 1
Heisenberg chain, and some classical statistical mechanics models that are
believed to have a unique Gibbs state at all temperatures. Other problems to be
studied include the existence of antiferromagnetic order in the two-dimensional
spin 1/2 Heisberg antiferromagnet, Rayleigh- Schrodinger perturbation theory for
quantum spin systems, and the generalization of Dobrushin and Schlosman's work
on the uniqueness of the Gibbs state in classical systems to quantum systems.
