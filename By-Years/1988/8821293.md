The electronic structure of magnetic surfaces will be studied by spin-polarized
electron energy loss spectroscopy, combining a polarized source with
polarization analysis of the scattered electrons. Specifically, they will study
the temperature dependence of the Stoner excitation spectrum in nickel, measure
the exchange splitting of the chromium(100) surface and explore the potential of
spin-polarized Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy in probing the electronic
structure of antiferromagnetically ordered materials, using thin nickel oxide
layers. Nickel oxide is the model antiferromagnetic Mott insulator. In addition,
they will study the magnetization profile and its temperature dependence of
clean and adsorbate covered surfaces by angle dependent spin polarized secondary
electron spectroscopy.
