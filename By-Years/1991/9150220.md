A computer classroom/laboratory is being established and classroom materials in
discrete mathematics and algebra is being developed. Based upon these materials,
courses in discrete mathematics and algebra are being taught which emphasize
student activity (experimentation, interaction and discovery) rather than
student passivity (listening to lectures). These courses will serve as models
for other upper division mathematics courses.
