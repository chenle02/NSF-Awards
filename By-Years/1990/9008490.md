This proposal requested support form the National Science Foundation statewide
connectivity for the Massachusetts system of public higher education to the
NSFNET through the New England Academic and Research Network (NEARNET). The
proposal can be divided into two parts. One part would connect eight
institutions to the NSFNET using routers and TCP/IP. The second part would be to
provide another 21 campuses (mostly two year institutions) the ability to do a
terminal logon to a central computer that had access to the internet by
utilizing an existing X.25 network that supports terminal logons.
