This three-year REU site program located at Cornell University, Center for
Nanoscale Systems in Information Technologies (CNS) will provide an opportunity
for twelve undergraduate students each year to participate in hands-on research
in the interdisciplinary field of Nanotechnology.

The objectives of the program are to motivate the student participants to pursue
graduate education in nanoengineering and nanoscale science, and to encourage
them to pursue post-graduate careers in the nanotechnology area, in either
industry or academia. To enhance the research experience, a variety of
activities have been incorporated. These include a series of seminars and
workshops designed to introduce the students to, and inform them about "hot
topics" in nanotechnology, and about career opportunities in both academic and
industrial nanotechnology research. Students will take short "NanoCourses" on
topics that are not addressed in the standard undergraduate engineering and
science curriculum, including a two-day "Introduction to Nanoscale Science and
Engineering (NSE) Lab Techniques Course". Some of the topics covered in this Lab
Techniques NanoCourse include scanned probe instrumentation, lithography, and
pattern-transfer. The students will also participate in an ethics workshop, a
workshop on research presentation techniques, and various community-building
activities; (i.e. group dinners, field trips, and week-end social events). At
the end of the summer, each student will present an oral report on his/her
research project at the REU Research Symposium.

This program will focus recruitment efforts on students from underrepresented
groups in the engineering and science fields. Students will be encouraged and
motivated to pursue graduate education and a professional career in
nanotechnology or a related technical field.
