9317502 Schoener This research continues investigations into how top predators
(lizards) affect indirectly, via influences on middle predators (other insects
and spiders) and herbivores, the amount of leaf damage on plants. It also
examines the effects of variation in rainfall on these dynamics. Data are also
being collected on the extinctions of populations in relation to population and
species characteristics and presence of predators. These studies will yield new
insights on what controls the number of species that occur in given areas and
how food webs respond dynamically to perturbation. %%% This research is
significant in providing new insights into how top predators influence the
population dynamics and interactions of species lower down in the food web and
how changes in the physical environment directly and indirectly affect the food-
web dynamics. Information from this research could have important applications
to understanding ecosystem response to climate change and to biological control
and other pest management methods in agriculture and forestry. ***
