The Physics Department of Dickinson teaches its introductory physics courses in
a workshop setting. Instead of attending lectures, Workshop Physics students
learn physics by using direct observations and the computer as a primary tool
for data collection, data analysis, and numerical problem solution. The
Equipment provided by the grant allows students to explore two-dimensional
motion by videotaping, digitizing, and analyzing sequenced events using existing
Macintosh SE computer systems. Software, a Workstation, Macintosh SE computer
enhancements, and LAN equipment are used to allow introductory physics students
to use a symbolic computer language such as Mathematics on a regular basis. This
allows students to relate the results of experiments to more abstract and
general behavior of functions derivable from theory. As a result of this
laboratory improvement program, the Workshop Physics Activity Guides currently
under development for dissemination to other colleges and universities are being
enhanced to include activities made possible with more versatile equipment and
software. The college is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
