This proposal requests support for a two-day workshop to be held at North
Carolina State University to create an implementation plan for "Transforming
Combustion Research through CI." A small group of people will develop this plan
based on findings of a recent National Research Council study
(https://download.nap.edu/login.php?record_id=1) and existing
cyberinfrastructure as exemplified by primekinetics.org. Day 1 and the pre-
workshop preparation will focus on working out proposed strategies and tactics
of the plan. Day 2 will be devoted to writing and vetting the specific details.

The intellectual merit of the activity is to advance combustion science through
creation of technical and organizational tools for data archiving, curation, and
collaboration. Near-term broader impacts are expected to be technological and
educational, creating databases and computational tools for individual,
scientific-community, and industrial development and evaluation of a wide range
of combustion data. This operational model of software, databases, and support
staff should be extensible to other data-generating research communities,
transforming the progress of science by allowing improved access and
interpretation of data. It should be a model for community development of data-
management plans, as well.
