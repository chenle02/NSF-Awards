The aim of this proposal is to advance fundamental understanding in low
dimensional topology, geometric group theory, as well as logic and computer
science. Three projects in this proposal target a very promising and active area
of low dimensional topology, namely the study of Vassiliev invariants of
classical knots. The aim is to, on the one hand, expose more internal structure,
but on the other hand to make them more relevant to topological questions, such
as whether a classical knot can be the boundary of a disk in the four
dimensional ball. Somewhat related to this area is the Schneiderman-Teichner
theory of intersections of two dimensional spheres in 4-manifolds. Together with
Schneiderman and Teichner, the P.I. hopes to fill in a missing step and complete
the theory to a complete classification scheme. Another cluster of projects
revolves around the algebraic object called "graph homology," which has
relevance to the study of invariants of manifolds, the study of the mapping
class group of surfaces, the study of the important group Out(F_n), and to the
deformation quantization problem. The P.I. proposes to make a deeper study of
the general theory of graph homology, on the one hand, while on the other
analyzing the specific examples of relevance to topology. More specifically the
P.I. will continue a program, joint with Vogtmann, for enlarging the known set
of rational homology classes for Out(F_n) from 2 to infinity. Lastly, probing
the interface between topology and computer science, the P.I. proposes to take
some steps toward distinguishing P from NP, utilizing ideas of Mike Freedman.

This proposal concerns fundamental research in several core areas of
mathematics, including topology, group theory and computer science. The projects
in the proposal aim at making significant breakthroughs in our understanding of
some of the most rapidly developing subdisciplines. A common theme to the
projects is the elucidation of connections between seemingly disparate fields,
such as topology and computer science. For example, the P.I. will explore ideas
of Mike Freedman to apply topology to the study of how efficiently alogrithms
can solve problems. The proposed research offers ample oppurtunity to
meaningfully involve undegraduates and graduate students.
