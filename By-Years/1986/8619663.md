The theme of this project at the University of Washington is parallel computing.
The award will aid in providing equipment, maintenance and support staff to
enhance the existing experimental computer research facility in order to
coordinate and stimulate work in the area of parallel computing. The Department
has groups with recognized strengths in six distinct areas of computer science:
computer architecture, performance analysis, image analysis and graphics,
programming environments, computer systems and theory of computation. In each of
these groups, significant research will be undertaken that would not be possible
without the Infrastructure support. The work will utilize a shared-memory
multiprocessor, a networked multiprocessor and a number of workstations to be
acquired under the grant as well as other pieces of equipment acquired from both
industrial sources and from previous NSF grants. In addition to providing
facilities to allow extensions of the previous contributions in each of the
areas noted above, it is expected that major steps forward will be made in the
overall understanding and effective use of parallel computing.
