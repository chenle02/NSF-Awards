This award supports participation in the 31st International Symposium on
Computational Geometry, Jun 22-25, 2015. SOCG is a focused conference that
considers how to develop algorithms to solve problems best stated in geometric
form. Research presented at previous SOCG conferences has had significant impact
on the US economy in diverse areas that include algorithms for geometric data
processing, computer vision, geographic information systems, manufacturing,
graphics and visualization, optimization, computer-aided design, and
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award aims to increase the impact of this
conference on students, particularly those&lt;br/&gt;from under-represented
groups, by encouraging and enabling their participation, especially in
cases&lt;br/&gt;where travel expenses would otherwise preclude their attendance.
Participation in a top-level event&lt;br/&gt;such as SOCG can be educating,
motivating, and useful for networking, both with other students&lt;br/&gt;and
with more senior scientists. This support dovetails nicely with the Young
Researchers&lt;br/&gt;Forum, a successful satellite event added to the
conference in 2012 to encourage and promote&lt;br/&gt;computational geometry
research by students and postdocs.
