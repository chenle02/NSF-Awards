A characteristic feature of materials undergoing martensitic phase transitions
is hysteresis they exhibit in response to cyclic loading. The process involves
formation and evolution of finely layered microstructures which depend in a
crucial way on the orientation and history of the loading. The origin of energy
dissipation, phase nucleation and kinetics of phase boundaries are important
open problems in modeling of martensites and other active materials. This
research program seeks to advance the understanding of these phenomena from the
perspective of mesoscopic and microscopic frameworks. It will focus on a series
of prototypical lattice models of increasing complexity with a goal of capturing
the essential features of phase nucleation, interface kinetics and the
associated hysteresis. The models have two main ingredients: (i) nonconvex
interactions between nearest neighbors allowing for existence of two or more
stable homogeneous states and (ii) the long-range interactions. Among the
outcomes of this research will be derivation of an interface kinetic law and
prediction of nucleated microstructural patterns. These results will be compared
to experimental observations. In particular, the proposed work will relate the
macroscopic observations such as the size and other features of a hysteresis
loop to the microscopic characteristics of the material.

Results of this research will be important for emerging civil, aerospace and
industrial applications which require significant passive damping exhibited by
martensites. These include damage and vibration control in composite structures
and attenuation of earthquake and wind-induced vibrations in buildings and
bridges. The work will impact many other scientific areas where similar discrete
systems are encountered, including dislocation theory, fracture mechanics,
biology, image recognition and numerical analysis. The broader impact of this
program will be also achieved through training of graduate and undergraduate
students in an interdisciplinary research program and a variety of educational
and outreach activities. These include developing new courses, mentoring women
graduate students and running programs for middle and high school students.
These activities will promote mathematics and science in general as an
interesting intellectual pursuit and a prospective career path.
