This award provides partial travel support for approximately 28 U.S. academic
researchers to the 1989 International Fluidization Conference scheduled for May
7-12, 1989, in Banff, Canada. This conference will bring together a total of 200
researchers from university, industry, and government. Topics to be covered
include catalytic cracking and other chemical processes; biochemical processes
and three phase fluidization; and erosion, attrition, and agglomeration in
fluidized beds. Fluidization is a means for solids-fluid contacting of great
importance to both old and new technologies.
