9531674 Tull This project will construct a high resolution spectrograph (30,000
&lt; R &lt; 120,000) for the 9-meter Hobby Eberly Telescope. The spectrograph
will operate in the visible region of the spectrum and is adapted from a
successful design used in the Ultraviolet-Visible Echelle Spectrograph of the
European Southern Observatory. The spectrograph uses a 20 cm by 80 cm echelle
and cross-dispersing gratings. The detector is a mosaic of two 2048 x 4096 pixel
CCD's with 15 micrometer pixels. The spectrograph is fiber fed and is located in
a spectrograph room under the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. ***
