To understand complicated objects, it is useful to know how they are built from
simpler pieces. For example, the individual parts of a car are relatively
simple, but assemble into a complex and powerful machine; sectional images from
MRI can be used to reconstruct a picture of the human body that carries enough
information to diagnose medical problems. Studying objects as the amalgam of
simpler pieces has great utility in mathematics. This project concerns
complicated spaces that can be built out of simpler ones, namely surfaces, like
the surface of a ball or a doughnut (as well as more complicated surfaces). The
instructions for assembling the pieces are described by a mathematical object
called the mapping class group, which carries all the information necessary to
build certain spaces from surfaces. The PI will work with a diverse team of PhD
students, postdocs, and colleagues and investigate the kinds of spaces that can
be built from surfaces, and their geometric, algebraic, and analytic features.

This project involves the study of surfaces of finite and infinite type, their
mapping class groups, and geometric features of manifolds and bundles we can
understand from these. The PI, together with his students, postdocs, and
collaborators, will focus on the following themes: (1) Convex cocompact and
geometrically finite subgroups of the mapping class group for finite type
surfaces and the geometry of the associated extension groups/surface bundles.
(2) The hyperbolic geometry of depth-one foliations via mapping tori of end-
periodic homeomorphism. (3) The geometric group theory of ``medium size‚Äù mapping
class groups naturally containing end-periodic homeomorphisms. (4) Relations
amongst pseudo-Anosov monodromies for fibered classes in a fixed hyperbolic
3-manifold. (5) Decoding geometry of billiard tables from the symbolic coding of
its billiard flow. The PI will continue his investigations of these themes, and
probe the intricate ways they interact with each other.
