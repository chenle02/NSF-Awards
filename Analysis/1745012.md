This award provides funding to defray travel related expenses of participants at
the conference "Midwestern Workshop on Asymptotic Analysis" that will be held at
Indiana University- Purdue University Indianapolis, October 6-8, 2017.

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
fields of mathematical physics, approximation theory, and complex analysis. A
number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this
conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of
underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an
opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing
committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups
through a number of different activities. More information will be made
