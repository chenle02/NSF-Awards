9507349 Cook This is a proposal by three faculty and two senior staff in the
physics department at the Univ. of Washington to continue a diverse program in
experimental high energy physics. They are engaged in the SLD experiment at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, the ALEPH experiment at the CERN laboratory
in Geneva, Switzerland and they are members of the U.S. group which is planning
for participation in the ATLAS experiment which will be a part of the LHC
experimental program at CERN when the accelerator is finished in 2004. ***
