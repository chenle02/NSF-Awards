This project is funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the
Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation. Professor Shigeru Amemiya
of the University of Pittsburgh is developing new experimental strategies to
measure the high electrochemical reactivity of clean graphitic surfaces of
traditional carbon materials and emerging carbon nanomaterials. A simple
approach is developed to maintain clean graphitic surfaces in the research
laboratory as well as in industrial settings where the mass production of carbon
electrodes is important. Clean graphitic surfaces may improve the performance of
the low-cost carbon electrodes that are widely used for fuel cells, batteries,
solar cells, and supercapacitors. In addition, undergraduate students, female
students, and students from underrepresented groups are recruited and trained
through various nanoelectrochemical research activities. Other activities
include industrial collaborations, and the implementation of
nanoelectrochemistry experiments for the undergraduate
laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on the electrochemical
study of clean graphitic surfaces for a greater fundamental understanding and
better future applications of carbon electrochemistry. New technologies
developed in the Amemiya laboratory are combined to enable the first reactivity
measurement of unambiguously clean graphitic surfaces. Specifically, the clean
graphitic surface is protected from airborne hydrophobic contaminants by
condensing a nanometer-thick adlayer of water on the surfaces in humidified air.
The surface is maintained in electrolyte solutions containing extremely low
concentrations of organic impurities. The ultrafast electron-transfer kinetics
of water-protected clean graphitic surfaces are then measured quantitatively and
reliably by employing nanogap voltammetry and scanning electrochemical
microscopy.
