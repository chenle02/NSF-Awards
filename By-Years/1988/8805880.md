The expressive power of sentences on finite models and the computational power
of circuits with unbounded fan-in will be studied. Lower bounds on the depth and
size of two kinds of circuits will be considered: those whose gates are AND, or,
and NOT, and those whose gates are threshold functions. In addition, the
effectiveness of some learning algorithms for threshold circuits will be
investigated. Another topic is the average behavior of relational data bases
that are subjected to random updates. Recent results of the principal
investigator show that, in certain cases, as the data base evolves, the truth of
a query approaches a limiting value independent of the initial configuration of
the data base. The proposed research is to extend these results to more general
cases. Work in finite model theory is planned. One topic is to obtain nonlinear
time lower bounds using model-theoretic reductions. The other is to analyze the
asymptotic behavior of the probability of sentences over certain classes of
finite models.
