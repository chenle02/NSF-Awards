This study will look at factors affecting compliance to emergency shelter-in-
place orders. Surprisingly little is known about this topic from a scientific
perspective. This study will be an important step to drive our scientific
understanding of shelter-in-place compliance. The application to public safety
is highly significant. Problems in this critical tool for emergency response can
place the lives of both citizens and emergency responders at risk. The new
knowledge generated by this study will provide a unique and greatly needed
resource for emergency planning. In that way it will serve the national welfare
by providing a comprehensive report written specifically for the community of
professional emergency planners. Finally, this study will directly serve the
goal of improving national security. It will do so concerning the hazards
associated with our technological society and also concerning potential
terrorist acts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have two parts. The first
part of the project will look at the experience of sheltering-in-place. We will
locate five appropriate incidents and send a rapid response mail survey to 500
individuals in each case. The survey will look at compliance and a wide variety
of characteristics that may affect that behavior. The second part of the project
will model shelter-in-place behavior. A sample of 1,200 participants will take
part in an online experiment. The experiment will present 16 different emergency
scenarios that the participants will be randomly assigned to. Participants will
complete a questionnaire after they have been shown one of the scenario
descriptions. The questionnaire will be identical across all treatment
conditions and will be very similar to the questionnaires in the first part of
the project. It will then be possible to make a comparison between what is
learned from individuals who have actually experienced a recent shelter-in-place
order and what is learned from the experiment.
