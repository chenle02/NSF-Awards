9415551 Leivant This award supports an international workshop on Logic and
Computational Complexity on the Bloomington campus of Indiana University, from
Friday, October 14, through Sunday, October 16, 1994. In spite of a high degree
of conceptual unity, the interdisciplinary relations between logic and
computational complexity have not been as yet the focal point of any scientific
meeting. Instead, they have appeared as subareas in various meetings on
Structural Computational complexity, Logic in Computer Science, Feasible
Mathematics, Database Theory, Programming Language Theory, Mathematical Logic,
Proof Theory, and Category Theory. The absence of meetings has hampered the
area's development at the conceptual as well as the personal levels. Important
connections between the various approaches have rarely come to the surface, and
people who have joined this research community from different background have
had only fragmented and incomplete opportunities to meet and discuss their
common interests. The proposed workshop would, for the first time, bring
together this research community, with the potential of infusing even greater
vigor into its research activity and its practical as well as theoretical
applications. ***
