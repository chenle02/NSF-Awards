This proof of concept project targets the improvement of undergraduate
engineering students' communication skills. Faculty in the School of Industrial
and System Engineering are working with colleagues in the School of Language,
Communication, and Culture, and a group of senior advisors, to glean information
from workplace interviews with practicing engineers, their managers, and senior
executives. This information forms the basis for a new curriculum and course on
Technical Communication. Four prototype instructional tools that use paper-and-
pencil, electronic, video, and web-based media, are also being integrated into
the course.&lt;br/&gt;
