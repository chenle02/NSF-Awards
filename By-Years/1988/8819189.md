Newborns of many species learn to identify their mother and their home
environment through the use of olfactory cues. For altricial (late- developing)
animals, learning these cues is critical to survival, as the mother is the sole
source of nutrition and warmth during the pre- weanling period. Dr. Wilson and
his colleagues have shown that rodents, and especially neonatal animals, possess
an extraordinarily good ability to learn about odors. In fact, rodents'
olfactory learning capabilities may be quite as powerful as are the visual
memories of humans and monkeys. He is utilizing these striking olfactory
learning capacities to clarify both how and where memories are encoded within
specific regions of the olfactory bulb. Dr. Wilson's previous work has shown
that this early learning is associated with a measurable change in the neonate's
brain, and that the response of the olfactory neurons to the learned olfactory
cues shows a unique spatio-temporal pattern of activity. He is now combining
intracellular electrophysiology with neuroanatomy and cellular metabolism
techniques, to investigate (a) how individual cells in the olfactory bulb change
their electrophysiological response as a function of learning an odor, and (b)
the overall pattern of electrophysiological and metabolic activity occurring
within adjacent and distant layers of the olfactory bulb. This work will further
define this unique, learned response pattern, and will attempt to provide an
understanding of the mechanisms involved in producing these neuronal changes,
which are perhaps the cellular mechanisms of learning.
