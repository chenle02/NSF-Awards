9454335 Stoddart The LASERS project focuses on implementing systemic change in
the teaching of elementary school science to bilingual students so that they
have access to a challenging science curriculum that builds on their cultural
and linguistic resources. In achieving this aim, the program will become a
vehicle for integrating, restructuring, and enhancing the science curriculum and
language development programs in seven school districts and for establishing
links to the Latino families and rural agricultural communities from which
students come. The locus of the project activities will be the school site. The
staff development program will be tailored to address school and district
priorities, and will support teachers in the implementation and planning of a
comprehensive science curriculum that addresses content and language development
goals. In addition, the evaluation of the project will include a research
component designed to gather information that will help teachers forge links
between learning science and doing science in an authentic context that relates
to students' scientific conceptions, language and culture. ***
