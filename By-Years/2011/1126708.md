With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program Professor
Stephan B. Bach from University of Texas San Antonio and colleagues Miguel Jose
Yacaman, Donald Kurtz, Waldemar Gorski and Harry Jarrett will acquire a matrix-
assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass
spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education
at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) transition metal oxides, (b)
metalloprotein characterization and intracellular location, (c) transcription
factor proteome, proteomics and protein biomarkers, and (d) fundamental insights
on the formation of stellated gold polyhedra at the nanoscale
level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometers (MS) are used to identify the
chemical composition of a sample by measuring the mass of the molecular
constituents in the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass
spectrometer. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) is a technique
for preparing the sample to be ionized by a laser before injection into the mass
spectrometer. The time of flight (TOF) mass analyzer has high sensitivity and
mass accuracy to assist the analyses and interpretation of the resultant data.
This open access instrument will provide training to undergraduate, graduate and
post doctoral students in state-of-the-art mass spectrometry usage not only at
the University of Texas San Antonio but also at neighboring institutions.
