9301313 Azzam Grating diffraction has been central to spectroscopy and its many
application in virtually every branch of science and technology. In this project
the domain of use of diffraction gratings will be broadened to include
spectroscopic polarimetry and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Specifically, the
polarizing and dispersive properties of multipe-beam grating diffraction will be
combined with high resolution detector arrays to realize new Stokes-parameter
spectrophotopolarimeter that is capable of time- resolved and complete spectral
polarization analysis without employing any moving parts or modulators. The
development of such an instrument will represent a major advance in fast
optoelectronics and is expected to have an important impact on many fields,
particularly in materials research. As an application, we will use grating
diffraction spectroscopic ellipsometry for the characterization, and studying
the dynamic switching properties of liquid-crystal films. ***
