This is an award to provide support for a symposium and workshop on results of
research from projects supported by NSF relating to the diffusion, dispersion
and interactions of pollutants in groundwater aquifers. The objective of this
conference is to provide the investigators who have conducted research supported
by NSF on groundwater issues with a forum at which they can present their
findings and have them subjected to review. Discussion is expected to provide
guidance for future directions in subsurface research that can be utilized by
the research community in addressing needs.
