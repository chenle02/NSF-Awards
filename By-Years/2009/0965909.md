Oregon State University's (OSU) Transition to University and Careers Program
(TUCP) is enhancing the successful transition of qualified STEM students from
seventeen partner community colleges to OSU's University Honors College (UHC).
The program is providing 20 students annually with $5,000 in support to ease the
students' financial transition from an Oregon community college to OSU. The TUCP
program includes a targeted course, participation in the UHC and opportunities
for experiential learning. It is providing support at several levels, including
financial, academic, career counseling, and general OSU and UHC support
services.
