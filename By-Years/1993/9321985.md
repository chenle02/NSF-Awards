9321985 Beaton Under the direction of Dr. John Beaton, Mr. Douglas Bird will
collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will continue his research among
Australian Aborigines who live along the shoreline of the Torres Straits.
Although these groups no longer follow a strictly traditional hunting and
gathering way of life and have been partially integrated into the larger
Australian economy, they still rely heavily on shellfish which they gather from
reefs in the region. Mr. Beaton will use models based on optimal foraging
strategy and analyze subsistence practices. He and his associate will observe
foragers during the entire yearly round and determine what factors govern
shellfish collecting behavior. This will involve intensive sampling and
observation of individual collectors. Activity diaries will be kept and the
amount of food per species and associated processing activities will be noted.
Because food is essential for life and food collecting strategies are
behaviorally determined, both biologists and anthropologists wish to understand
subsistence strategies which different species follow. When multiple kinds of
resources of varying nutritional value are unevenly distributed across a
landscape, how do foragers determine where to go and how to focus their efforts?
Because shellfish are sessile and their distribution is easy to determine, they
provide an excellent context in which to study this issue. This research is
important because it will offer insight into human foraging behavior. It will
provide data of interest to both cultural anthropologists and archaeologists and
will also assist in the training of a promising young scientist. ***
