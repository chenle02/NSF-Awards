PATH: &lt;br/&gt;An Integrated Program to Examine the Moisture-related
Performance &lt;br/&gt;of Fiber-cement Composites&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
effect of wet/dry cycling on fiber-cement composites and the resulting
mechanisms of damage have not been the subject of an extensive systematic
examination. This lack of fundamental knowledge limits our ability to accurately
predict service lives of fiber-cement materials and our ability to select
materials for fiber-cement composites which are expected to exhibit good
performance in exposures where moisture fluctuations are expected. A
comprehensive research plan is necessary to fully understand the implications of
fiber swelling/shrinking on the fiber-cement composite system - the changes that
occur in the fiber, surrounding brittle matrix, and the performance of the
composite as a whole. The objective of the integrated research project, to be
undertaken by a research team composed of concrete technologists from Civil
Engineering and paper physicists from Paper Science and Technology, is to link
changes that occur on a microstructural level as a result of cyclical moisture
changes to the changes in macroscale mechanical properties of the fiber-cement
composite. The goals of the proposed research are (1) to assess the effects of
repeated wetting and drying (rain and heat) cycles on dimensional changes of
wood fibers, physical bonding at the fiber/cement paste interface, and bond
strength between the fiber and matrix and (2) to assess if improved bonding can
be produced through tailoring the fiber processing for this application. The
proposal includes preparation of special aligned fiber cement-composites that
will offer improved opportunities for both qualitative and quantitative
microstructural analysis. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
