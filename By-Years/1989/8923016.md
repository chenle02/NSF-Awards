In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Wyatt plans to develop new methods designed to
further our fundamental understanding of the way in which molecules collide with
each other and with solid surfaces, to form new species or to emit light of
particular wavelengths. A new basis set for translations, called Lobatto shape
functions, will be combined with the Kohn and Newton variational principles to
extend our current capabilities for investigating quantum reactive scattering to
a broader variety of molecules. A new time-independent variational method will
be developed, also using the Lobatto shape functions, for studies of surface
scattering. New quantal methods will be developed for studying the high energy
vibrational dynamics of nonrigid molecules.
