Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most versatile tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spcectroscopy is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Chemistry Department of
the University of South Florida to acquire, maintain and operate a high-field
NMR spectrometer. Among the areas of research that will be enhanced by the
acquisition are included: 1) Structure and characterization of highly branched
macromolecules 2) Geometric isomerization in 1:1 electron donor-acceptor
complexes 3) Assignment of congested 1-H and 13-C NMR spectra of complex
polycyclic heteroaromatic systems using two-dimensional and multiple-quantum
techniques 4) Synthesis and characterization of nucleosides.
