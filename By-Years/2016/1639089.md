This award will provide support for travel, registration, and other expenses for
students and early career researchers (post-doctoral researchers, entry-level
faculty), to attend the 23rd International Workshop on Electromagnetic (EM)
Induction in the Earth to be held in Chiang Mai, Thailand August 14-20, 2016.
Funds will be used primarily to support participants from the USA, with any
residual funds used to support attendees from underdeveloped countries. The
biennial EM induction workshops, which are sponsored by Division VI of the
International Union of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA), represent the only
international meetings dedicated specifically to EM geophysical research. For
over 40 years these meetings have provided the principal venue for presentation
and discussion of methodological advances, including instrumentation, data
processing, inversion, and interpretation practice. The meeting brings together
researchers from around the world (academia and industry) who share a common
interest in using EM methods for imaging the Earth to address both applied and
basic research questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will benefit the US
EM induction community, by increasing participation of students and early career
researchers from the US, by helping US researchers to develop the international
contacts that will ultimately lead to collaborative projects around the world,
and by promoting international exchange of software, data, and results.
