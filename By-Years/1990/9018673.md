This project seeks to create a disseminable, multi-functional, inexpensive and
well-documented laboratory course sequence, with the primary goal of improving
practical skills of undergraduate students specializing in robotics, vision, AI
and manufactoring disciplines. The project will include the building of a robot,
as well as supporting simulation and real-time software and hardware, and it
will develop comprehensive laboratory manuals to support an undergraduate
sequence of courses in robotics, AI and vision. The laboratory will be
transportable.
