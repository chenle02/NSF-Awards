The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) Program of the Division of Chemistry
supports the research program of Prof. Maryanne Collinson of Virginia
Commonwealth University. Prof. Collinson and her students will design and
fabricate three new classes of high surface area materials using a multifaceted
approach that merges key features of sol-gel chemistry, templating, lithography,
electrodeposition, and thin film preparation. At the heart of this proposal is
the use of recessed electrodes as nanoscale flower pots to electrochemically
grow 3D arrays of vertically aligned silica pillars using newly developed
electrodeposition techniques. From an analytical perspective, such high surface
area, three-dimensional supports provide a means to significantly improve
response times, recovery rates, and throughput by enabling reagents encapsulated
in the porous network to be more accessible to a diffusing substrate, a task
that is necessary to improve their performance in chemical analysis. The study
will provide excellent training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate
students in a highly inter-disciplinary area at the interface between chemistry
and material science and engineering. In addition to their research, Prof.
Collinson and her students will promote chemistry to a broader audience through
the development of an outreach activity specifically designed for K-5 children.
