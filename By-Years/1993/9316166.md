9316166 Harrison This project proposes experiments that will lead to a better
understanding of monazite as a thermochronometer. Monazite was selected for
study because its retentive nature for Pb* and its unusual (for an accessory
mineral) behavior during diagenesis suggests its use as a system capable of
continuously recording thermochronological information during prograde
metamorphism of a pelite. Three distinct, but ultimately interconnected, studies
are required to exploit this observation: development of U-Th-Pb microanalysis
for monazite, the stability and reaction kinetics of LREE oxides in pelitic
assemblages, and Pb diffusion in monazite. These studies will lead to
utilization of the Th-Pb system to date discrete reaction events in the heating
phase of orogenic terranes as well as a refined knowledge of the closure
temperature for Pb in monazie.
