This proposal will develop an empirically-tested model to investigate factors
contributing to near and actual mid-air collisions between aircraft. The model
will contribute generally to an improved understanding of the use of influence
diagrams to study incident sequences and sub-system failures in an wide range of
low risk-high consequence events that are important to the fields of operations
research, risk analysis, and transportation. The specific applications area,
involving mid-air airplane collisions, will improve our understanding of the
interrelationships between human errors, collision avoidance systems on
airplanes, and new air-traffic control systems. These linkages, although vital
to the successful operation of the air traffic control system in the U.S., have
not been addresssed satisfactorily by existing models. Previous research using
probabilistic models conducted by the principal investigator suggests that the
results of this study will have an influence on both the theory and the practice
of modeling low risk-high consequence accidents.
