Human behavioral lateralization as preferential hand use has existed at least
throughout recorded history. Lateralization became a matter of even greater
interest in the present century when it was discovered that such other human
functions as language and spatial abilities are lateralized between the cerebral
hemispheres. However, the development of a theory of neural lateralization has
been impeded by an assumption that behavioral functions with lateralized neural
mediation are only to be found in humans. This view has been particularly
strengthened by studies of nonhuman primates that have concluded that handedness
is characteristic of human primates only. Dr. Ward has recently found that
prosimians, the most primitive primates, do have hand preferences in reaching
for food, and that use of the dominant hand is systematically affected by
posture. This research project will explore a variety of lateralized behaviors
and the factors that affect their expression in ten species of prosimians. Two
species will be studied in Dr. Ward's laboratory with a battery of formal tests
and informal observations. Eight other species will be observed at the Duke
University Primate Center under free-ranging conditions. Observations will be
videotaped and analyzed for patterns of lateralized behavior specific to
individuals and families, by task, activity, and posture, and for species-
typical patterns. The data base will permit Dr. Ward to evaluate the generality
of prosimian laterality, will contribute to development of a biological theory
of neural lateralization, and will enable scientists to identify suitable animal
models for further study.
