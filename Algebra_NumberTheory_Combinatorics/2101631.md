Algebraic geometry is the field of mathematics that studies objects defined by
polynomial equations, called varieties. One of the aims of moduli theory is to
try to understand properties of a given variety by thinking about the space of
all possible shapes such a variety can have. This space of all shapes is the
moduli space of a variety of a given numerical type. For example, the cubic
threefold is a variety in 4-space given by one equation of degree 3. Much modern
progress in understanding moduli is due to degeneration techniques ? the idea of
understanding a given variety by thinking how it can break up into simpler
objects. This project aims to further the understanding of the properties of
some of the moduli spaces central to algebraic geometry: the moduli of cubic
threefolds, the moduli of complex curves (that is, objects that from close up
look like complex numbers), and other related moduli spaces. In particular, the
PI will study how such varieties can degenerate, or break up, and will aim to
understand the behavior of geometric constructions under such degenerations. The
project will support the work of the PI and his PhD students on these topics.
The project aims to better understand the geometry of compactifications of some
of the moduli spaces ubiquitous in algebraic geometry: moduli of of curves, of
curves with a differential, and of cubic threefolds. The PI will also explore
applications to problems in Teichmueller dynamics and in classical algebraic
geometry. The PI will apply the compactification of the strata of differentials
(that is, of moduli of curves with a differential with prescribed multiplicities
of zeroes and poles) that he constructed with other researchers. The PI will
also investigate the birational geometry of strata and will approach the central
orbit classification questions in Teichmueller dynamics by applying degeneration
techniques of algebraic geometry. The PI will apply real-normalized
differentials, the geometry of which he studied, and the degeneration techniques
he co-developed to work towards a sharp upper bound for the number of cusps of
plane curves. Likewise, the PI will co-investigate the relations among cones of
divisors and log-MMP for various compactifications of the moduli space of cubic
threefolds.
