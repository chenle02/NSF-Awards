Jose Cortes-Figueroa, Chemistry Department, University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez,
is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program. The focus of the work is the synthesis and characterization of
transition metal fullerene complexes. Novel fullerene-transition metal carbonyl
complexes will be synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic and
electrochemical techniques. Reaction rates and activation parameters of the
fullerene substitution processes will also be studied. Overall, this project
should provide information on the thermodynamics of the fullerene-transition
metal interaction.

Transition metal fullerenes show unique chemistry and electrochemistry. These
properties may be exploited in the optics, materials science, and electronics
areas. This award is under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions Program
(RUI) and involves several undergraduates at the University of Puerto Rico-
Mayaguez. These students will learn important laboratory skills while conducting
cutting-edge research.
