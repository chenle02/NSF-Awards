This award, made in the Organic Dynamics Program will support the research of
Dr. Paul Kropp dealing with the surface properties and chemical behavior of
alumina in the context of mediating organic reactions. Both mechanistic and
synthetic aspects will be investigated and compared with earlier results using
silica. Reactions that will be studied include dehydrohalogenation of alkyl
halides, Cannizzaro oxidation-reduction of aldehydes, rearrangement of epoxides,
and addition of HNCS to alkenes. Both structure-reactivity and stereochemistry
will be probed. Surface oxide and aluminum sites will be characterized by
quenching with acid and pyridine respectively, and observed by IR, Raman and ESR
techniques. In addition to providing mechanistic insights into the role of
alumina in mediating organic reactions, this research will lead to new
synthetically useful methodologies which, by virtue of easily recovered solid
catalysts, are environmentally benign.
