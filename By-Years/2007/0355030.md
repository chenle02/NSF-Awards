The present proposal covers three interconnected topics: ultracold atom-atom
collisions, &lt;br/&gt;ultracold atom-ion scattering, and modeling of ultracold
samples doped with charged particles. &lt;br/&gt;The scattering properties of
chromium, including dipole-dipole interactions in the presence of &lt;br/&gt;a
magnetic field, will be computed using a within a multichannel treatment.
Understanding &lt;br/&gt;these scattering properties of complex atoms becomes
more important as such species are&lt;br/&gt;cooled to ultracold temperatures.
The effect of Feshbach resonances on ultracold&lt;br/&gt;mixtures, such as Li-H
will also be investigated. Second, the impact of including
hyperfine&lt;br/&gt;interactions in studies of ultracold atom-ion scattering,
will be examined. Finally, the behavior &lt;br/&gt;of ultracold samples of
trapped gases doped with charged particles, will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;
