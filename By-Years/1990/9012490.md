ABSTRACT Wide individual differences have been reported for the production of
early phonetic shapes and structures. On the other hand, infants' abilities to
discriminate speech sounds have been found to be remarkably strong, and
universally available, regardless of the language of the environment. Recent
findings, however, suggest a loss of ability to discriminate non-native speech
sounds between 10 and 12 months. The issue of the relation between perception
and production in development remains unresolved, particularly the completeness
and accuracy of children's perceptual storage of adult words at the onset of
their production of words. The goal of the present project is to test and refine
a promising new methodology for experimental testing of the relationship between
vocal production and perception in infants in the course of their transition
into speech. The technique being developed is an operant conditioning paradigm
which rewards children's presses of an illuminated panel under appropriate
stimulus conditions. If the technique proves reliable, it will be possible for
the investigators and others to use it to examine children's capacities for
phonetic discrimination more thoroughly and accurately than has been done
before.
