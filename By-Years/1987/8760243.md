Rock masses are the host media for engineering ventures of major economic and
defense significance. The performance of a rock mass under engineering
conditions is usually dominated by the discontinuous nature of the medium.
However, the techniques of describing the topography of discontinuities or
joints, which strongly influence their properties, and of experimentally
measuring their mechanical properties, are still rather elementary. The research
identifies an approach for determining joint stiffness and strength properties
under a testing condition of controlled normal stiffness, which is completely
analogous to the state of loading which a joint experiences in situ. A
stiffness-controlled system is proposed for joint testing which can yield joint
stiffness and strength properties in one-directional direct shear and after load
reversal. The ultimate purpose of research is to relate joint mechanical
properties to rock material properties and joint topography. The fractual
dimension of the joint surface is suggested as a parameter which may avoid
current problems in describing the rough state of a joint surface.
