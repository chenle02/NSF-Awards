The Cornell University Astronomy Department currently has 21 professors and
total of 82 students (mostly graduate students) and scientific staff. The
present computing system is a Sun 3/280 file server with 19 satellite
workstations. Data analysis and modelling efforts are severely constrained by
lack of computing facilities. This award will allow the purchase of an
additional file server to permit expansion in the number of diskless
workstations (which will be funded through other sources.)
