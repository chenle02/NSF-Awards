Cell and tissue culture techniques will be addressed in a course with a research
focus. After learning basic procedures of handling monolayer and suspension cell
cultures, students will design and execute experiments that will be centered
around a research problem that they will have developed in consultation with the
instructor. Phase and fluorescence microscopes, laminar flow hood, centrifuges,
photographic equipment, and incubators will permit the students to understand
the process of scientific research, learn how to maintain and characterize cell
lines, discover the diversity of cell types that can be cultured, learn special
culture techniques, and understand the basic principles of microscopy and
photomicrography.
