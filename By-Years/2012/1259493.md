The Doctoral Scholars in Engineering (DSiE) project at Morgan State University
has initiated a community of doctoral scholars in engineering that is focused on
academic achievement and career preparation The objectives of this project are
to: 1) increase access to the doctorate, especially for underrepresented
minority students; 2) improve doctoral degree completion and time to degree by
relieving scholars of the need for off-campus employment; 3) improve support
programs for doctoral students in the School of Engineering; and 4) increase the
preparation and placement of doctoral students in academic and research careers.
This project is producing graduates who are well grounded in their disciplines
and well prepared for career success. The project strategies are designed to
improve doctoral student retention and graduation rates, thereby contributing to
an increased engineering work force.
