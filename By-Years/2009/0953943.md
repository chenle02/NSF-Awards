This research aims to enable the development of the next generation of
collaborative technologies and to study their effects on human collaboration. It
does so by improving our theoretical understanding of how various features of
shared visual context affect communication, coordination and collaboration. The
research develops and makes available the code for a new dual eye tracking
methodology that can be used to study coordination and collaboration. It also
develops a new set of metrics that can be more generally used to understand
coordinated eye movements as they relate to dialogue and conversation. The
results of this work will add to knowledge in a number of disciplines, including
human-computer interaction, language technologies, computer science,
computational linguistics, communication studies, cognitive science, and social
and cognitive psychology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As recent efforts in
telemedicine, distance education, and remote training and repair attest, there
exists enormous potential for technologies to support these activities at a
distance, ultimately resulting in widespread benefits such as equal access to
quality education and medical care. The education activities in this research
include: (1) developing a new Ph.D. course that teaches a theory-driven design
approach; (2) developing a series of course modules that use the dual eye
tracking methodology to teach behavioral coding, statistics and machine
learning; (3) developing a publicly available multimodal corpus with a set of
tutorials, and (4) developing a series of international workshops on dual eye
tracking. Finally, the research will simultaneously advance discovery and
understanding while training both graduate and undergraduate students in
interdisciplinary research methods and will contribute to the development of
traditionally underrepresented individuals in the fields of computer and
information sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
