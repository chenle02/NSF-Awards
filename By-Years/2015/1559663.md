As understanding and awareness of the natural world grows, researchers are
seeing increased complexity in the new ecological problems they encounter.
Because of this complexity, mathematical and statistical methods are becoming
increasingly important in the study of biological and ecological systems. This
award supports a three-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at
the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse (UWL) aimed at 1) training undergraduate
students in various sub-disciplines of mathematical ecology, 2) motivating
undergraduate students, especially underrepresented and/or first-generation
college students with limited access to research at their home institution, to
attend graduate school in a STEM area, and 3) preparing participants to be
successful in an interdisciplinary, collaborative setting. The UWL site will
host eight students per year for 10 weeks during the summers of 2016, 2017, and
2018. The award is supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in
the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of
Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences
(BIO).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research at this REU Site will contribute to the
overall body of knowledge in mathematical and theoretical ecology by tackling
research questions in mathematical areas such as ordinary and stochastic
differential equations, decision theory, game theory, the theory of inverse
problems, graph theory, probability theory and branching processes, as well as
ecological questions that arise from the study of topics such as the parasite
propagation in snail and waterfowl hosts in the Upper Mississippi River and the
effects of wind energy on the population viability of bird and bat populations.
