Nashville State Technical Institute is one of five small Nashville institutions
which Vanderbilt University is assisting in connecting to NSFNET. The 56,000 bit
per second connection is made through the mid-level network SURANET using the
SURANET connection Vanderbilt has had for two years. Two of the institutions are
historically black, two are small liberal arts institutions that emphasize
teaching rather than research, and one is a two-year technological school.
Nashville State is the two-year technical school. Benefits of the NSFNET
connection include file transfers, electronic mail communication between local
and remote researchers, and remote login to and use of supercomputers and other
research facilities. In addition, the local institutions have access to
Vanderbilt's resources, and add another dimension to the diversity of resources
Vanderbilt can offer its students. Cross- registration, software sharing and
other benefits also result from the network.
