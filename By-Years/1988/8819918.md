Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the enzyme which catalyzes the rate limiting step
in the biosynthesis of catecholamines. TH is subject to both short-term and
long-term regulation. Regulation of TH is influenced by steroids, growth
factors, increased neuronal activity, cold and immolization stress, treatment
with protein kinases and drug treatment. The short-term activation of TH (within
minutes) involves phosphorylation of the enzyme. Four phosphorylation sites have
been localized on the N-terminal regulatory alteration of mRNA levels. This
research project will study the mechanism for long-term regulation of TH
activity, protein and mRNA levels by treatment with elevated potassium, which
depolarizes the neurons and is a model for sustained neuronal activity. A full-
length cDNA for this enzyme will be cloned and expressed in a tissue culture
cell which does not normally make tyrosine hydroxylase. This will be a first
step to begin to change specific phosphorylation sites in the cDNA and determine
the activation of the enzyme. The study should lead to valuable information in
understanding the molecular basis for the complex regulation of catecholamine
biosynthesis.
