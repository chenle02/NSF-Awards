A system has resilient security if it retains a degree of secure functioning
despite the compromise of some components. Since vulnerable components will long
be in widespread use, resilient security is what counts against sophisticated
adversaries with persistent footholds in American
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resiliency infrastructures can help secure
application components that may have many intrinsic weaknesses. They can
structure systems so the risk of successful attack can be meaningfully
measured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resiliency is more achievable than previously,
because of recent architectural changes. One is virtualization , allowing many
virtual machines to execute on a physical platform. Some virtual machines may
serve as resiliency infrastructure nodes, controlling adjacent application
nodes. Second, software attestation and appraisal, supported by Trusted Platform
Modules and secure virtualization, allow a component to appraise the software
state of remote peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We add three architectural ideas.
Emulsification means breaking application functionality into small pieces,
implemented as separate virtual machines. Second, their interactions can be
monitored and secured by infrastructure nodes. Monitoring includes auditing,
filtering , and modifying messages among application components. Third, data
provenance uses annotations prepared by infrastructure nodes and stored with
data objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game theory applies to attacks that must
succeed against several components, spread between the infrastructure level and
the application level. Networks with randomized components force the adversary
to use probabilistic strategies with low probability of defeating all of a
sequence of components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Our society
depends on information systems riddled with vulnerabilities. New architectures
will reduce the severity of this problem , and provide measurements of risk.
