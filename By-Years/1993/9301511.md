We seek to develop reliable automatic structural nonparametric estimators of
densities and hazards on multidimensional domains. The structure, ANOVA
decomposition of functions, can be built in via tensor product splines. For
density estimation, the structure allows conditional independence to be built
into multivariate densities; for hazard estimation, it yields survival models
more general than, but reducible to, proportional hazard models. The targeted
results are asymptotic theory and automatic algorithms implemented in portable
public domain code. Our research is on the estimation (reconstruction) of
curves/surfaces based on imperfect data collected in designed experiments or
other scientific studies. The curves/surfaces to be reconstructed may represent
geographical distribution of acid rain deposition as is useful for environmental
monitoring, or may characterize the effectiveness of medical treatments in
clinical trials, etc. Prior results of the research have found applications in
modeling weather data, environmental data, and AIDS data.
