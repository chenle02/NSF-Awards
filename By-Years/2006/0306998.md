In this collaborative project funded by the Americas Program of the Office of
International Science and Engineering, M. Helena Noronha of California State
University Northridge and Carlos Tomei of the Pontifical Catholic University in
Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) will initiate a pilot International REU/RET site in
Brazil. Under the guidance of faculty at both PUC-Rio and the University of
Campinas (UNICAMP), U.S. undergraduate students and high-school teachers will
work on problems in applied and industrial mathematics, differential geometry,
probability, and statistics. This pilot program will start with a small number
of students and teachers in two summer institutes held at these Brazilian
universities. Mathematical topics to be covered include cellular communication
systems, optimal hydrothermal operation, simulations in computer graphics, and
techniques in soliton theory. Among the enrichment activities planned are field
trips to research centers in both government and industrial
laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the course of this project, U.S. students
and teachers will interact with Brazilian undergraduates and teachers in
research activities that will enhance their education and introduce them to the
excitement of discovery. The international dimension will also have a great
impact on the cultural attitudes of these students as well as on their career
choices. This project will provide two undergraduate students who have had
previous research experiences the opportunity to work as a tutor, a learning
experience not only for the person receiving the tutoring, but also for the
person providing the tutoring. Students will be encouraged to publish their work
and make presentations at professional meetings. The organizers will recruit
students from under-represented groups. Brazilian participants will have their
expenses covered by Brazilian agencies.&lt;br/&gt;
