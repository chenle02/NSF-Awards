Even though theoreticians agree that supernova explosions derive their energy
from the collapse of the progenitor star's core, they have found it very
difficult to confirm this theory numerically. Recently, J. Wilson has succeeded
in modelling SN ejection by the "delayed supernova explosion mechanism."
According to this mechanism, energy from the progenitor star's core collapse is
transferred to the envelope by neutrinos in a delayed fashion. The Principal
Investigator (PI) proposes to investigate the viability and necessary conditions
of Wilson's mechanism. The PI will use a one-dimensional relativistic
hydrodynamic computer code, originally developed by Myra et al. The PI's
specific focus will be on how the explosion, the resulting neutron star, and the
neutrino emission spectrum are dependent upon the progenitor star's mass and
structure. Furthermore, he will calculate theoretical neutrino burst signatures,
simulate the star's mantle convection two- dimensionally, and investigate the
evolution of X-ray and gamma- ray emissions. The 2-D code has been developed,
debugged, and tested by Fryxell. As a final topic, unrelated to SN, the PI
proposes to continue with his evolutionary calculations of brown dwarfs and very
low mass stars.
