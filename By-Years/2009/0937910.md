This Pathway II project extends the Computational Science Education Reference
Desk (CSERD), an interdisciplinary numerical models and interactive computing
pathway. The continuation funding is enabling the establishment of a secure
future by positioning CSERD to respond to shifts in web technologies and
building a self-sustaining enterprise model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; CSERD
partnerships with Sigma Xi, and national associations representing Hispanic,
American Indian, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities, along with
the SuperComputing conference, offers focused, customized faculty training for
use of CSERD and NSDL resources across the curriculum. By leveraging
partnerships with TeraGrid and the new XD program, CSERD is bringing
underrepresented groups into the computational sciences, and by extension, to
all STEM areas.&lt;br/&gt;
