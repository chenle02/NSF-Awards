Voulgaris The objective of this project is to develop complete, systematic,
robust and high performance methodologies for multirate sampled data systems
that take directly into account the hybrid nature of the problem. More
specifically, the modern, robust control ? design methodologies of H infinity
and l 1 are established for the hybrid multirate problem. In addition, stability
robustness and performance robustness non conservative criteria, which can be
directly incorporated into the design process, are provided for the hybrid
multirate system. Furthermore, the case of asynchronous sampling is investigated
in the hybrid multirate framework and analysis and synthesis tools emerge. The
above results are integrated into user friendly computer software in order to be
easily used in multirate applications. Finally, an inherently multirate
experiment, where computer vision is utilized for feedback to the motion control
system of a two link direct drive, is used for testing and evaluating the
analytical developments. ***
