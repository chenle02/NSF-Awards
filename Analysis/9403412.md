Souganidis 9403412 Work supported by this grant covers a broad range of problems
arising in the areas of hyperbolic and parabolic nonlinear partial differential
equations. Three primary themes will be emphasized. First, work will be done on
the kinetic theory of conservation laws. The goal is to obtain new regularity
and compactness results for systems of conservationlaws, using a kinetic type
formulation/approximation for these systems. Second, studies will be made on
first- and second-order fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic and parabolic
equations. The emphasis is on the analysis of discontinuous control problems, on
proving convergence, on obtaining error estimates for numerical schemes and
finally, on studying several issues regarding the regularity and uniqueness of
weak solutions. Lastly, work will be done on generalized front propagation and
phase transitions. Much of the focus will be on studying the regularity of
moving fronts past their singularities as well as the theory of phase
transitions. The latter includes singular limits of reaction-diffusion equations
and systems, macroscopic (hydrodynamic) limits of particle systems and large
scale front dynamics for turbulent combustion. Partial differential equations
form a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role of
mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to provide
qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions. This may include
answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition,
analysis often develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on
the accuracy of these approximations. ***
