An artificial intelligence (AI) LISP workstation and a hybrid knowledge-based
system development software are acquired to enhance the facilities in the
Kowledge-Based Expert System Research Laboratory. The research emphasis is the
development of intelligent decision-making framework and knowledge-based expert
system for design and manufacturing tasks. AI techniques are combined with
conventional problem-solving methods to develop intelligent systems in which
qualitative reasoning can be incorporated with quantitative skills. The long
term goal is to design a computer-based framework by which different types of
problem-solving paradigms and different sources of knowledge can be utilized for
intelligent decision-making of engineering tasks.
