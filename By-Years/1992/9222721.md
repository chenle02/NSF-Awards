Many anthropologists have suggested that carnivores played an important role in
human evolution, as predators, competitors, and carcass providers. However, the
details of these relationships remain fuzzy, largely because of a dearth of
quantitative work on the ecological adaptations of the extinct carnivores. This
research in the functional morphology and guild structure of large bodied
carnivores will greatly improve the quality of our inferences concerning
hominid-carnivore interactions in the African Plio-Pleistocene. The graduate
student will test hypotheses concerning critical behaviors of the predators,
such as their ability to cache prey in trees, kill large prey, and scavenge from
kills. It is significant to hominid evolutionary studies because it will fill in
significant information on the paleoecology of our ancestors.
