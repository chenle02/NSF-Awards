This research aims to develop software tools which aid the programmer in
analyzing the efficiency of parallel programs. Of special interest are
interactive software tools for aiding the analyst in obtaining (worst-case and
average-case) estimates of parallel program performance without executing the
program. Theoretical models of execution are used to develop symbolic analysis
tools.
