Intellectual Merit:

The long-term goal of this project is to create computational tools which can
accurately predict the structure of proteins when they interact with interfaces.
The specific goals are (1) to develop and apply techniques for sampling protein
conformations in the presence of a solid, (2) to develop and apply techniques
for exploring the relevant structural variations in the solid substrate in the
presence of protein, and (3) to elucidate the nature of molecular recognition
for proteins on solid surfaces relative to other biomolecular interactions. The
PI will apply the developed techniques to natural mineralization proteins which
have been well studied and offer some structural data for validating the PI?s
approaches. Successful creation of predictive tools for determining protein
structure on surfaces will be invaluable to the progressive growth and evolution
of devices at the interfaces of biology and solid-state (nano)technology.

Broader Impact:

In addition to the broad impact of these scientific studies on interfacial
chemistry, biotechnology, biomaterials, and bionanotechnology, the PI proposes
an accompanying educational program which includes new courses, computational
modules for broad distribution, and outreach to young scientists within
Baltimore. The PI will create a new course on computational design of
biomolecules and continue to redesign the undergraduate modeling and control
course, contributing to the transformation of the chemical engineering field as
it incorporates biology in the curriculum. Computational modules will teach
structure prediction tools from basic energetic calculations and structural
manipulations to prediction of complex structures and design of custom
biomolecules. Software developed from this research will be distributed freely
via the Rosetta Commons consortium. Outreach in Baltimore will have a direct
impact on minority and low-income populations through the Ingenuity Project
which targets exceptional high-school and middle-school students from at-risk
populations for advanced curricula and research mentorship.
