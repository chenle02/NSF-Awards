In all mammalian species, reproductive success is critically dependant upon
normal function of the ovary. Normal ovarian function serves two purposes,
production of the oocyte, and appropriate production and secretion of specific
steroid and protein hormones. In the mammalian ovary, the oocyte is encased in
several layers of cells which secrete the female sex steroid hormone estrogen.
At ovualation, the oocyte is extruded from the ovary and the cells which
previously surrounded the oocyte are changed into a structure called the corpus
luteum. The cells of the corpus luteum, the luteal cells, secrete the female sex
steroid hormone, progesterone. The secretion of progesterone from the corpus
luteum in the proper amounts for the proper time period is required for
successful reproduction. Thus, progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum is
a critical determinant of reproductive success. The cells of the corpus luteum
must respond, through biochemical mechanisms, to blood born hormonal substances
which control the normal secretion of progesterone. The specific biochemical
mechanisms which allow the luteal to respond to those hormones which control
progesterone secretion are at present unknown. It is, in fact, these mechanisms
that are responsible for normal luteal function. Dr. Goldsmith has recently
discovered that, in the rat, the expression of a particular gene, the K-ras
gene, increases greatly at the same time that the seretion of progesterone from
the corpus luteum is at its maximum. Furthermore, when an antibody against the
protein coded for by this gene was incorporated into luteal cells in vitro,
progesterone secretion from these cells was significantly decreased, thus
demonstrating that the protein encoded by the K-ras gene, the p21 protein, plays
a role in the production/secretion of progesterone by the luteal cell. It is the
objective of this proposal to determine the specific way in which the p21
protein affects luteal progesterone secretion and whether the p21 protein plays
a role in the secretion of other hormones from the corpus luteum. The K-ras gene
product, the p21 protein, is present in all mammalian cells. Thus, the results
of the proposed studies will have a significant impact upon the understanding of
ovarian hormone secretory mechanisms as well as our understanding of the ways in
which all mammalian cells respond to hormones and growth factors.
