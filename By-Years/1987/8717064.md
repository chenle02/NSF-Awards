The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will conduct a
conference on advances in the development of parallel processing systems for
scientific computing. The development of effective large-scale, high-performance
scientific computing systems depends, at least in part, on the continuing
interaction of algorithm developers, numerical analysts, computer architects,
and scientists concerned with scientific computing. This conference has been
organized by SIAM to bring these groups together and promote their interaction.
The conference will focus on the development of analytic methods, efficient
algorithms, and applications software in context with advances in computer
architecture as applied to high-performance systems. The DASC Program Director
recommends support of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)
for FY 1987 in the amount of $20,500.
