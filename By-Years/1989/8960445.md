This project focuses on an investigation of advanced neural network methods of
dynamics modeling of complex robotic systems for the purpose of achieving real
time execution while maintaining the accuracy of the model. Both neural network
approaches, the cerebellar model arithmetic computer type network, and the multi
layered type network will be employed. Phase 1 efforts will attempt to answer 1)
how is overall network configuration dependent on intended application, 2) which
of the two commonly used neural networks is more appropriate for this
application, 3) what is the optimal training methodology for the hybrid network,
and 4) can a network trained for simulation purposes be used for controls, and
vice versa?
