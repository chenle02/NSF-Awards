This grant supports a symposium is on the kinetics of diffusional phase
transformations. The emphasis of the program is to focus on essentials of theory
of homogeneous nucleation and how it compares to experimental results. The
symposium considers all three common states of matter, as follows: seven papers
on homogeneous nucleation theory; six papers where homogeneous nucleation theory
is compared to experiments in which the reactions, solid -&gt; solid, metallic
glass -&gt; crystalline solid, liquid -&gt; solid, and vapor -&gt; solid
nucleation, take place; eight papers in which nucleation and/or growth theory
are applied to fundamental and practical problems. The symposium honors the late
G. Marshall Pound, a distinguished scientist who worked effectively in this
field of research.
