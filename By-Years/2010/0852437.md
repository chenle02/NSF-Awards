This proposal seeks travel support for the US participants at an international
meeting that&lt;br/&gt;will be held in Rome, Italy, in 2009. The topic of the
meeting will be Kahler and &lt;br/&gt;Sasakian geometry. These two flavors of
geometry currently provide us&lt;br/&gt;with the best methods available for
proving the existence of Einstein metrics on many smooth compact manifolds. The
primary intellectual merit of the project stems from the manner in which the
meeting is expected to lead to an exchange of key technical insights between
leading researchers in these distinct but intimately related areas of global
differential geometry.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;International meetings play a key
role in the development of both pure mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and theoretical
physics. Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the &lt;br/&gt;real
importance of a new idea or technique really only becomes a matter of
broad&lt;br/&gt;consensus after it has been given prominent treatment at such an
international &lt;br/&gt;gathering. The Rome meeting will thus offer a key
opportunity to highlight the &lt;br/&gt;ground-breaking contributions recently
made by US-based mathematicians &lt;br/&gt; to the study of Einstein's
gravitational field equations in Euclidean signature. &lt;br/&gt;This topic
represents an important arena of interaction between &lt;br/&gt;mathematical
fields as diverse as topology and partial differential equations, and
&lt;br/&gt;moreover has profound ramifications for areas of theoretical physics
such as &lt;br/&gt;quantum gravity and string theory. The Rome meeting should
thus result in a &lt;br/&gt;lively exchange of ideas, not only between
mathematicians and physicists, but also &lt;br/&gt;between American and foreign
scientists. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
