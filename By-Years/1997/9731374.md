9731374 Moore This four year project is awarded $743,603 to provide enhancement
activities for 160 chemistry teachers, 40 each year, in materials science. The
workshops will be three weeks long and will have additional follow-up. These
workshops will begin in the summer of 1998, continuing through the summer of
2001. The major content of the workshops will be the vast body of materials
science and solid-state chemistry that can be used to illustrate typical high
school chemistry topics. The workshops will: 1) Introduce teachers to a large
body of chemistry that was not included in their pare-service education; 2)
Provide teachers with real world examples of state-of-the-art chemistry and
hands-on materials that will stimulate students' interest in science and
chemistry; 3) Model up-to-date pedagogy and enable teachers to merge the new
content and pedagogy into their chemistry curricula and classes; 4) Help
teachers develop the leadership skills necessary to bring about positive
changes; 5) Publish a materials science resource book that will be developed by
the participant of the workshops and will be specifically geared to high school
science teachers. Participants will be selected on the basis of their potential
for significant outreach, evidence of leadership qualities, connections to ICE
Affiliates, district support, and potential for enhancing their current
chemistry curriculum with new materials. There will be continuous and on-going
ICE follow-up. This project will provide matching funds from non-Federal sources
totaling $178,652 which represents 24% of the award amount.
