The objective of this SBIR proposal (phase I and II) is to explore new
technology that can be used to ultimately develop during phase III a low cost
modular NMR console that can replace any commercially available console and
provide up to date performance at a cost of less than $100,000. During Phase I,
new RF technology currently used in cellular phone and other consumer product
technology will be evaluated in an NMR spectrometer. In particular new Frequency
Generation and new IF Detection schemes for NMR Observe Unit will be studied in
an NMR spectrometer and their respective performance will be assessed. During
Phase II, several units derived from the technology explored in phase I will be
designed, built and tested in an NMR environment. This will include a complete
broadband observe unit, a multi-nuclei decoupler and a field-frequency lock
channel. The end result will be a complete low-cost modular NMR console. This
should be an attractive alternative to expensive NMR spectrometers and should
help improve the funding problems for state of the art equipment. Commercial
development and application will follow during Phase III.
