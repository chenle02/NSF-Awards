ABSTRACT Proposal #01122628 Purdue Research Palsberg,Jens

Static Timing of Interrupt-driven Software

Real-time, reactive and embedded systems are widely and increasingly used
throughout society (e.g., flight control, railway signaling, vehicle management
systems, medical devices). This trend is likely to continue, as applications
that would have been unthinkable only a few short years ago come into the reach
of ever more complex processors. Many such applications are long lived, interact
with their environment continuously, and are under important real-time
constraints. As these reactive systems permeate our lives, bringing us
everything from intelligent pace-makers to tiny freshness-tracking devices in
groceries, the need for cost-effective, confidence-inspiring software validation
techniques grows proportionately. This project focuses on building new tools for
checking a common class of reactive real-time systems known as interrupt-driven
systems. This proposed research has four facets that complement and support each
other. The first continues our preliminary work on analyzing seven commercial
microcontrollers to identify a static timing analysis that is sufficiently
precise for a single interrupt handler. Second, ways of specifying and checking
timing properties for multiple interrupt handlers are being investigated. Third,
a typed assembly language is being developed with time bounds in which timing
properties can be specified in a modular way, one handler at a time. Fourth, a
timed interrupt-handler calculus is being designed that will embody our results
in a language-independent way and make it tractable to prove key properties. The
new tools will automatically derive a model of the software by static analysis
and type checking, and submit the result to a model checker. The tools can lead
to significantly reduced testing requirements, and provide support for
maintenance throughout the system life-cycle.
