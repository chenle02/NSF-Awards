The Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML), a research unit of the University of
California, is situated on a 326 acre multi-habitat ecological reserve, part of
the UC Natural Reserve System. For the past 20 years, researchers from
throughout the UC system and elsewhere around the world have worked at BML on
terrestrial and marine research topics. UC Davis is currently carrying out a
major continuing commitment of support for BML both in terms of construction of
new facilities and recruitment of new faculty and support staff. In addition,
the Natural Reserve System is substantially increasing its support of BML. As a
result, the number of current and proposed research projects utilizing the
terrestrial portions of the Reserve has increased significantly. This proposal
will facilitate three activities at BML: establishment of a surveyed,
permanently marked and photo-mapped, standardized grid system; development and
expansion of portable, microclimate datalogger monitoring stations; and
renovation and expansion of an avian research laboratory. These improvements
will facilitate studies of plant and insect community ecology, physiological
ecology and ecological genetics of plants, avian ecology, competition, and
plant-insect interactions.
