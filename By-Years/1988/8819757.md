This proposal is for support of a joint symposium on tribology involving
scientists from US and Taiwan, and organized by Ward O. Winer of Georgia
Institute of Technology and Lu Shui-shong of National Taiwan University.
Tribology, an important field in mechanical engineering, is a study of
interacting surfaces in relative motion including friction, lubrication, and
wear. The proposed symposium on tribology is the first such conference in Taiwan
with participation of US researchers. The conference is expected to provide a
significant opportunity for researchers from both countries to discuss and
exchange data on this area of research and to further enhance collaborative
activity on tribology. This symposium is jointly supported by the NSF and the
Taiwan National Science Council.
