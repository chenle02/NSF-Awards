The automation of classification learning is an ongoing concern in the machine
learning, pattern recognition and statistics communities. People are very good
at designing and collecting data, but less good at analyzing it and extracting
useful generalizations. It is necessary to improve the techniques for automatic
data analysis. The state of the art in inductive learning is that there exist
several dozen inductive learning algorithms/concept representations, each of
which is best on some proper subset of the possible inductive learning tasks.
The project will develop an efficient method for selecting the best
algorithm/concept representation for each recursive call of a divide-and-conquer
tree induction algorithm. The combination of different representations into a
hybrid significantly improves the ability of the inductive learning program to
find a highly accurate generalization of the data. The major objective of this
research will be an approach to learning that includes an efficient search for
an appropriate hybrid representation, guided by detection of specific forms of
hypothesis pathology. The creation of systems that search multiple
representation spaces greatly increases the autonomy of learning machine, which
will make data analysis techniques accessible to a wider range of scientists.//
