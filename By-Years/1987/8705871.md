Metal cluster compounds are an important class of catalysts and are also of
substantial current interest as models of species which exist at the metal
surfaces when they are used as catalysts. Such cluster compounds absorb light
strongly and the high-energy (excited state) species which are formed thereby
are very reactive in bringing about chemical transformations of organic
molecules. This research project is expected to provide information which is
essential to effective use of metal clusters as catalysts for light-induced
chemical reactions. The proposed research is focused on providing general
guidelines for multielectron photochemistry beginning with two classes of
transition metal compounds: multiply bonded metal- metal (M-n-M) dimers and
hexanuclear clusters of Mo(II) and W(II). The excited states of these compounds
are highly luminescent and long-lived. The factors governing the excited state
dynamics of the hexanuclear clusters and the M-n-M dimers will be defined using
electronic absorption, emission and time-resolved spectroscopies. Preliminary
data indicate that the oxidation-reduction chemistry of these species is derived
from the metal cores. The studies will be extended by using cyclic voltammetry,
chronoamperometry and electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ecl) to identify
reaction pathways. Of special importance are experiments in which ecl will be
used to probe several mechanistic features of the hexanuclear cluster oxidation-
reduction processes. The spectroscopic and electrochemical studies are
complementary and will be used to define a framework in which to construct
multielectron transformations of excited state metal clusters. Excited state
reaction pathways that rely on redox reactions of small molecule reactants and
organic substrates at electronically excited, coordinatively unsaturated metal
cluster cores will be developed.
