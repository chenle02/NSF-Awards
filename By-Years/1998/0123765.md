A new generation of sophisticated, multi-party distributed applications are
being proposed and implemented over the Internet. Many of these applications,
such as distributed publish-subscribe services, ubiquitous files system and
distributed auctions, require the location and coordination of a large number of
resources dispersed throughout the network. A fundamental building block for
these applications, is a distributed directory. The distributed directory
enables applications to locate required resources in a timely and efficient
manner, and helps the application to scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal
describes TerraDir; a set of protocols for implementing customizable,
distributed, peer-to-peer directories over which a range of wide-area resource
discovery applications can be implemented. The architecture addresses
scalability and flexibility. The research will concentrate on:&lt;br/&gt;-
dynamic view implementation (decoupling naming from location)&lt;br/&gt;-
configurability (applications are not monolithic, must address wide
needs)&lt;br/&gt;- caching (multiple locations of caches)&lt;br/&gt;- fault
tolerance (required for success), and&lt;br/&gt;- network layer techniques for
finding peers and distributing applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each TerraDir
Directory is a private namespace, and multiple TerraDirs can be active at the
same time to provide other virtual directors. Since the TerraDir is designed to
be implemented over the existing Internet, the protocols address end-to-end
requirements and do not require any special network support.&lt;br/&gt;
