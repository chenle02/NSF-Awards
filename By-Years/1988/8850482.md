1. History of Science in the Elementary Schools is a two- year project
sponsored by the University of Florida Program in the History of Science in
conjunction with the Departments of Astronomy, Zoology and History and with the
National History Alliance. A three-week summer seminar for a total of 58
participants in the two years will be followed by four bi- monthly seminars and
classroom visits to all participating schools in Florida. In the second year the
project will also have participants from Georgia and Virginia. The follow-up
seminars will be at Emory University and in Virginia at VPI and staff from those
institutions will visit the schools. The University of Florida is contributing
in cost-sharing an amount that is equal to 60.7% of the NSF award.
