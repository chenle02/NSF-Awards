In higher plants, the division of the zygote is asymmetric and establishes two
fundamentally different cell types: the smaller daughter of the zygote assumes
an embryonic cell-fate, while the larger daughter forms the mainly extra-
embryonic suspensor. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the
signaling events responsible for this fundamental cell-fate decision. Previous
work by the P.I. has led to the discovery of a mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase kinase gene, YDA, that functions as part of a molecular switch to
regulate extra-embryonic cell fates. This project will further characterize the
YDA signal transduction pathway in the model plant Arabidopsis by: (1)
characterizing the receptor-like protein kinase gene SSP, which is predicted to
link YDA function to the activation of a cell surface receptor, with standard
methods of molecular biology and histology; (2) identifying as yet unknown
components of the signaling chain with genetic and biochemical approaches. This
research will elucidate a fundamental aspect of plant embryonic development with
potentially important results for the efficient production of plant embryos and
seedlings in culture. The project will provide training opportunities for a
postdoctoral researcher as well as undergraduate and high school students in
cutting edge molecular biology and genetics.
