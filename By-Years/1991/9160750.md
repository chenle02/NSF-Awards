Production of recombinant products of pharmaceutical and industrial importance
in a variety of microorganisms has yielded a wide variety of biologically active
proteins. Fungi offer the advantage of reduced culturing and downstream
processing cost because they are capable of secreting prodigious quantities of
protein. The genetics and biochemistry of Neurospora crassa are the most fully
characterized of the filamentious fungi. The development of a high activity,
efficient secretion expression vector system for N. crassa will facilitate
efficient production of heterologous proteins in this fungus. This proposal aims
to identify and clone an abundantly secreted native protein of N. crassa and
characterize its promoter and secretion signal. The new N. crassa expression and
secretion vectors capable of producing high levels of secreted recombinant
proteins.
