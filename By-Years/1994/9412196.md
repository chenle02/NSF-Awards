9412196 Wang The award is for the development of a process and machinery for
net-shape production of parts made from semi-solid materials. The materials
could be metal alloys or metal-matrix composites. Semi-solid processing enables
use of lower die temperatures, higher viscosity, lower part porosity, lower
thermal shrinkage, and better grain structure. A screw injection molding machine
has been modified for die casting of semi-solid material. The feasibility of
changing properties of the castings such as solid fraction, particle size, etc.
by manipulating process control variables will be investigated. Net shape die
casting experiments to produce simple three-dimensional parts will be conducted.
If the research is successful, the process may have a great impact on the die-
casting industry and could make the traditional die-casting process obsolete.
