The present proposal is a request to the NSF to assist in equipping research
facilities for the evolutionary biology program at Yale University. The six
principal investigators on this proposal represent a diversity of research
programs yet with common research strategies that make it very effective to
share common facilities. The overall theme of the research is to understand
evolutionary mechanisms as they apply to molecular cellular, and developmental
system. The major pieces of equipment to be purchased are an oligonucleotide
synthesizer for synthesis of primers for DNA sequencing, an automated DNA
sequencer, a computerized analytic system for acquisition and analysis of
molecular data, especially DNA sequence data, a microscopic video computer
system to allow analysis of still and motion images, and centrifuges and a
scintillation counter. In addition to solely research purposes, the new
facilities will serve as training for graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows, as well as visiting scientists, in the most modern approaches to
evolutionary questions.
