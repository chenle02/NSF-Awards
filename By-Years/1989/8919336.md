The enzyme Na, K-ATPase is the protein that is responsible for the active
transport of Na+ and K+ across animal cell membranes. Two non-covalently linked
polypeptide subunits, alpha and beta, are known to be essential for Na,K-ATPase
function, although the role of the beta subunit is not known. The goal of this
research is to use an in vivo expression system for mammalian Na, K-ATPase in
the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to obtain information about the structure of
the enzyme. The two subunits are currently synthesized in low abundance in yeast
cells. the specific objective of this award is achieve efficient expression of
the subunits in yeast so that the enzyme can be prepared on a large scale for
detailed studies of its structure and function. The results of this research
will help to elucidate the mechanism essential for the function of all living
cells.
