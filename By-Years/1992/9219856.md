This research is to continue the recording and analysis of a triaxial set of 10
Hz geophones placed at a depth of 2.5 km in the Cajon Pass deep drill hole near
the San Andreas fault in southern California. To date, the instrumentation has
recorded several hundred earthquakes at frequencies up to 400 Hz. Most larger
events were recorded simultaneously by a 2 Hz triaxial surface seismometer.
Results suggest that surface seismograms are severely depleted in high frequency
wave amplitudes and downhole seismograms have high corner frequencies and high
frequency power law amplitude decays. Additional wide-band seismic sensors will
be installed at 2.0 and 3.5 km depths in order to give an improved measure of
natural seismicity and record microearthquake scaling in a volume of seismically
active crust. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program.
