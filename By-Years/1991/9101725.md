The analysis or reconstructions of rotations can be accomplished from data
gathered from a spherical surface or from three-dimensional space. These
problems arise in determining an unknown coordinate system, such as the
orientation of a satellite or the crystallographic axes of a crystal, and in
reconstructing the past position of tectonic plates. This research will develop
statistical techniques for these problems that are not overly sensitive to
outliers and will examine the statistical properties for inferences drawn by
these methods. Applications to Procrustes analysis will be emphasized for the
study of tectonic plate reconstructions.
