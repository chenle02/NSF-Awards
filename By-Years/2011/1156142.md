No single discipline has sufficient breadth of perspective and tools to address
the societal challenges posed by crime, violence, and lawlessness. Yet currently
there is no adequate forum for creating a sustained inter-disciplinary community
of researchers to address these issues and train new scholars to adopt this
broader perspective. A second problem is that while some of the most cost-
effective alternatives to incarceration may include efforts to address human
capital deficits and change the social environment, research on those issues too
often ignores crime-related outcomes. A third limitation is that research on
crime tends to be provincial, and ignores potential insights from variation in
policy or social conditions within or across other countries. This proposal is
to establish a research coordination network (RCN) that would seek to create an
international inter-disciplinary network of researchers to study these issues,
and which would include: annual meetings to discuss new research; a training
component via an interdisciplinary cohort of pre-doctoral and post-doctoral "NSF
/ NBER fellows" to help organize the meetings and actively participate; a data
component through which fellows would identify new data sources to add to the
those available on the NBER websites and other sources; and a dissemination
component that leverages the outstanding capacities of the NBER website.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific benefits will flow from shared data and
research methods, new research collaborations across disciplines and nations,
the expanded consideration of crime-related outcomes in conjunction with the
cost-benefit evaluation of social programs, and mentorship of junior
researchers. New knowledge generated from this process will serve the public
interest in reducing criminal behavior at lowest possible social cost.
