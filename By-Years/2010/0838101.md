A Darwin 2009 Celebration Meeting will be held at the American Museum of Natural
History and Stony Brook University over a 5-day period to honor the 150th
anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin?s Origin of Species. The
meeting will combine public outreach and teacher workshop activities at the
Museum with formal presentations and informal discussions at the University. The
goals of the meeting are to analyze history of ideas in evolutionary biology,
discuss contemporary fields of inquiry and future research directions, analyze
the impact of evolutionary thinking for disciplines outside biology, such as
philosophy, sociology and humanities, and promote translation of science to the
general public and media through education and outreach. The meeting is designed
to provide opportunities for intellectual discourse and development of
evolutionary biology in a broad sense with potential impact on research agendas
and funding priorities for the near future. The meeting also will include
significant outreach components targeted at science teachers and the general
public with the goal of increasing understanding of science. &lt;br/&gt;
