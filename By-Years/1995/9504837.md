9506734 Linde This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Alan Linde,
Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, the Carnegie Institute of Washington and
Dr. I. Furuya, Seismology and Volcanology Research Department, Japan
Meteorological Research Institute. Project funding will enable Dr. Linde to
spend twelve months in Japan, resident at the Japan Meteorological Research
Institute, in order to study crustal deformation data recorded by a network of
borehole strainmeters operating in south-east Honshu, Japan. Close collaboration
with scientists at the Japan Meteorological Research Institute will allow
combined studies of these unique data sets for several different tectonically
active regions. Such studies are expected to yield new insights into these major
tectonic processes. This proposal brings together research scientists from two
countries working in the area of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. The U.S.
scientist will have the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques,
data, equipment, and facilities at the Japan Meteorological Research Institute
while contributing to the overall research effort. Therefore, this proposal
fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
