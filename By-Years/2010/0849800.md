Reports of damage to regions of the brain specialized for processing and storage
of distinct types of memory suggest that in some cases neural systems may
interact cooperatively and in other cases they may interact competitively during
memory storage or recall. To date, the mechanisms of interactions among brain
systems specialized for memory have not been tested in the mammalian brain as it
functions normally. In the present study, interactions among brain regions of
the rodent are tested following local administration of viruses engineered to
alter expression of genes required for long-term memory without influencing
normal information processing or short-term memory. Thus the current experiments
constitute the first empirical tests of interactions among brain regions
specialized for memory in the intact brain. The results of these experiments
will elucidate neuronal mechanisms and conditions that determine the extent to
which distinct brain regions interact during memory formation and consolidation.
As such, these experiments have the potential to transform our understanding of
how and where memory is stored in the mammalian brain. A primary educational
goal of this study is to recruit undergraduate students from groups
traditionally underrepresented in the neurosciences to participate in research
training internships during the summer months at Tulane University. Students who
decide to continue to train in neuroscience research can conduct further studies
for course credit in laboratories supervised by the PI and colleagues.
