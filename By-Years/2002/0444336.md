With this award, the Chemistry Special Projects Office and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences are supporting Dr. David L. Schutt, Chief Strategy Officer of the
American Chemical Society (ACS). Dr. Schutt, along with Dr. Charles Casey,
President of ACS will organize and lead a workshop entitled "Molecular Basis of
Life Processes". The workshop, academic, government and private sector leaders
will identify a limited number of science drivers that frame a molecular
understanding of life processes. There is potential for broader impact of the
workshop for many fields ranging from pharmaceuticals to biomaterials to
agrochemicals.
