WENK Drs. Olton and Wenk are continuing their highly productive investigations
of the neurochemical bases of learning and memory. This project focuses
particularly on the interactions between two different neurotransmitter systems,
and how they interact to influence memory. Of particular interest are
acetylcholine and serotonin, both of which have been shown to be profoundly
important in different types, and phases, of learning. These investigators are
using a combination of behavioral and physiological techniques to study the
neurochemical interactions that underlie learned behavior. In addition to
contributing to our understanding of the "molecular mechanisms" of learning and
memory, these experiments will also address a question of paramount importance:
Can these neurochemical interactions be enhanced or impaired to alter recovery
of function after one system is damaged? The answer is of extreme significance,
for it could help to form the foundation of new treatment strategies for people
who have suffered memory and cognition losses as the result of brain damage
caused by head injury.
