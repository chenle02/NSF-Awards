The main problems in this proposal concern finding a general framework for Hodge
theory, which can be applied to families of algebraic varieties. The proposed
framework is a theory of motivic sheaves or motives with parameters. In
particular, there would be a theory of motivic local systems. The latter would
then lead to a notion of motivic fundamental group, which would provide a link
between the topology and arithmetic of varieties. This also connects to Hodge
theory in a more traditional sense, as in the study of variations of Hodge
structures. A sub-project involves refinements of the Kodaira vanishing theorem
using algebraic methods.

Hodge theory lies at the core of this proposal. It is the part of algebraic
geometry (the study of algebraic varieties or sets of solutions of systems of
algebraic equations) that interacts most closely with differential geometry,
topology and to a lesser extent, mathematical physics. There are nontrivial and
surprising connections with number theory as well; the theory of motives, which
is also central to this proposal, arose in part to explain some of these.
