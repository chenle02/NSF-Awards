This is a project to determine the time of origin, linkage to mantle upwelling,
and mode of development of cross-grain gravity rolls on the southern East
Pacific Rise. The principal Investigators will carry out SeaMARC II and gravity
surveys of 0 to 6 million year old crust on west flank of the East Pacific Rise
between 16 and 19 South. The extensive SeaMARC coverage will also be used to
address problems relating to the evolution of large offset overlapping spreading
centers. %%% SeaMARC II is a sea floor mapping tool that is used extensively to
provide extensive bathymetric and side scan imagery. The data will provide
important information on the morphology and tectonic history of the sea floor
and will also assist in making better determinations of topographic corrections
to the gravity data. The cross grain gravity rolls are anomalous features
originally detected in satellite data. These interesting and anomalous features
have not been thoroughly studied from a surface ship. The Principal
Investigators have provided leadership in the area of marine tectonics and
gravity data interpretation for many years. They are uniquely well qualified for
this study.
