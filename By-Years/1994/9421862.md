9421862 Clark This project is on research to study the production of enzymes
from extremophiles by expression of these enzymes in mesophiles, using
recombinant DNA technology. The objective is to make available large quantities
of these enzymes for biophysical and biochemical characterization and ultimately
for enzymatic applications, without the need for culturing extremophiles
directly. The specific objectives of this research include: (1) to clone and
identify gene sequences from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus and
related thermophiles; (2) to express genes in heterologous systems at high
pressure, and characterize recombinant enzymes under elevated pressure and
temperature to establish optimal specific activity and assembly; and (3) to
develop bioprocessing methods for obtaining enzymes in sufficient quantity for
structural determination and biotechnological applications. ***
