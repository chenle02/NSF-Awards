This award supports the participation of Dr. David C. Spray and others of the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine in a program of cooperative research with
Dr. Antonio Campos de Carvalho of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in a
project aimed at understanding the role of gap junctions in the heart ventricle
in maintaining normal cardiac function. Gap junctions are a class of membrane
channels that uniquely span the membranes of adjacent cells to form
intercellular pathways for ions and uncharged molecules. The functional and
biochemical properties of these junctions, and of the ions which they transmit,
may be of profound importance in understanding how muscle impulses are
transmitted within the heart. The U.S. principal investigator has participated
in pioneering work on gap junctions between isolated pairs of ventricular
myocytes, and has also studied the electrical behavior of adult rat ventricular
myocytes and cell pairs. He has also studied the properties of junctional
proteins in liver tissue, thereby becoming expert in techniques that he will
extend, in this research, to the study of heart tissue. The Brazilian
collaborator has considerable experience in the isolation of cardiac gap
junctions, and also has experience in cardiac tissue electro-physiology.
Complementary expertise will be utilized as U.S. investigators perform
electrophysiological experiments in Brazil, on gap junctions isolated there; and
in a subsequent visit by the Brazilian collaborators to the U.S., where they
will participate in biochemical studies. By increasing our understanding of the
operation and function of these important components of the heart, more will be
learned about the maintenance of normal human cardiac function.
