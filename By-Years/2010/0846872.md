ABSTRACT Geometric modeling for simulation of complex physical phenomena raises
many challenges including algorithmic efficiency, practicality, scalability,
robustness, theoretical guarantees, and compatibility with the emerging
numerical methods. We study solutions for geometric discretization problems for
spatial domains (encountered in conventional scientific computing) and for
space-time domains (motivated by the next-generation numerical methods being
developed for solving PDEs directly in the space-time continuum). Our approach
combines the strengths of theoretical algorithms (time complexity, output size
optimality, and quality guarantees) and practical heuristics (ease of
implementation, performance in practice, scalability). Two broad classes of
problems are studied: (i) We develop fast, sequential and parallel algorithms
and software to compute premium-quality, size-optimal, simplicial and cubical
meshes of spatial domains which can evolve as the simulation progress for
isotropic and anisotropic problems. (ii) We develop scalable, provably-good
meshing algorithms and software to compute space-time triangulations which
enables us to perform simulations directly in the space-time domain. The
algorithms and the software tools developed within this project are being
integrated with applications and contributing to the fundamental research in
engineering, scientific computing, solid modeling, computer-aided design,
graphics, geographic information systems, computational biology, visualization
and molecular modeling. As a result, this project has broader impact across a
number of scientific, medical and industrial fields. Moreover, the project has
academic impact through the inclusion of underrepresented groups, the
development of interdisciplinary courses which focus on linking fundamental
concepts in theoretical areas such as graph theory, geometry and topology to
application problems in biology and engineering.
