High speed computer workstations will be purchased and dedicated to supporting
research in mechanics and materials. The Workstations will be used to support
several research projects, including in particular: o Mechanical modeling of
polymer behavior and simulation of polymer processing. o Finite element study of
mechanical forces on the growth plate in bones. o Micromechanics of failure in
random microstructures. o Constitutive modeling of creep in sea ice. o Finite
dynamic elements.
