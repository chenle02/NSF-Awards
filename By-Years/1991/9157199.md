This research is directed toward the design and analysis of combinatorial
algorithms. In particular, it is concerned with strongly polynomial algorithms
for combinatorial optimization problems and problems related to linear and
integer programming. Network, transportation, and matching problems are being
pursued. The value of results in this problem area is extremely high.
