The goals of this research are to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of data
flow and mutation testing and to develop a new methodology, named Compiler
Integrated Testing, for integrating data flow and mutation into a conventional
compiler. The effectiveness study will be carried out using Donald Knuth's TEX
program and two testing tools, Mothra for mutation testing and ATAC for data
flow testing. The ten year error log of TEX will serve as a data base to
determine the effectiveness of data flow and mutation testing. To avoid
computational bottlenecks that arise in using these testing methods for large
programs, the CIT methodology will be integrated into Mothra and ATAC for
parallel execution on SIMD and MIMD machines.
