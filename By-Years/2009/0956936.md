&lt;br/&gt;The SDR 09 Technical Conference and Product Exhibition will be held
December 1st to 4th in Washington D.C. This preeminent technical conference is
the primary venue for presenting new research results in the software define and
cognitive radio technologies including multimode/multiprotocol terminal design,
Multimode Terminal and Infrastructure Design, Security Services, Mobile Ad-Hoc

Testing and Tools. Participants have the opportunity to present their work,
attend panel and keynote talk sessions, and interact with many others performing
leading-edge research in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attending this
conference will provide students with exposure to industry and the real problems
they will face when entering the workforce in the design, development,
manufacture and deployment of advanced wireless systems. Such exposure will help
them to better understand how their course work at university applies in a real
world setting, and will accelerate the pace at which they become productive upon
graduation. At the conference they will meet and interact the leading
researchers and practitioners in this field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
will support approximately 16 graduate and undergraduate students to attend this
premiere conference. Travel scholarships will be awarded to students based on
academic merit and preference will be given to students under-represented in
science and engineering.
