This research program addresses the design of self-assembled stimulus responsive
peptide complexes. Alpha helical coiled coils consist of two or more helical
strands, wrapped into a superhelix, which bind to one another through
interactions between core hydrophobic and surface hydrophilic amno acid
sidechains. By introducing unnatural amino acids in coiled coil contexts, these
studies will generate more diverse sequences, allowing the design of complexes
suitable for next-generation peptide hydrogels. By engineering the appropriate
behavior into isolated peptide complexes, this research addresses the design of
"smart" materials that respond to physiological stimuli (pH, temperature, salt
gradients). A formal program in Chemical Biology will be established, providing
for the recruitment and training of students at both the undergraduate and
graduate levels in the fundamentals and applications of work in this area,
bridging the gap between chemistry and biology.

With the support of this CAREER Award from the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program, Professor Alan Kennan, of the Department of Chemistry at
Colorado State University, is carrying out fundamental studies related to the
designed aggregation of proteins. By developing information about factors
leading proteins to adopt particular structures, Professor Kennan designs
assemblies of proteins that are expected to display unusual changes in response
to their environment. These studies may lead to the development of "smart"
materials that respond to physiological stimuli such as acidity, temperature and
salt concentration. Professor Kennan will serve as the director of a new program
in Chemical Biology, providing a variety of educational and support activities
to recruit and train students in this interdisciplinary area, bridging the
traditional disciplines of chemistry and biology.
