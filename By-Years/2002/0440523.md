This award supports a project to fully characterize the microstructure in ice
cores, in particular the microstructural locations of impurities, defect
structures and strain gradients. This work will complement the optical
observations, electrical conductivity measurements, and precise, detailed
measurements of the soluble ion and gas contents that are performed by others.
The project will use both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning confocal optical microscopy
coupled with Raman spectroscopy (RS) to determine the microstructural locations
of impurities and correlate this information with depth/age, and impurity type
and concentration for several polar ice cores from different locations,
different elevations, and different meteorological conditions (precipitation,
temperature. The broader impacts of the proposed work are that knowledge of the
location of impurities and the defect structures in the ice, and their effects
on the local mechanical and physical properties, will allow paleoclimatologists
to better interpret ice core data and other scientists to understand and model
the physical and mechanical properties of natural ice sheets. Other broader
impacts are that the project will lead to the education of a Ph.D. student, who
will gain experience in ice specimen preparation and characterization, scanning
electron microscopy, x-ray microanalysis, Raman spectroscopy, electrical
measurements and mechanical testing, as well as the knowledge gained from
coursework. The work will also be performed by a number of undergraduates,
typically two per year. In addition to publishing results from the research in
refereed journals and presenting them at conferences, key data will be placed on
a web page: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~ianbaker/Ice/ice.html
