The PI will develop new methods for analyzing, reasoning about, and making
predictions about graphs and networks. Graphs and networks appear throughout
society and science. They include road and transportation networks,
communication networks, power networks and social networks. They are one of the
dominant abstractions of data in Computer Science, and are used to model
abstract interactions in fields ranging from Genomics to Image Processing and
Machine Learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has two major research
thrusts. The first is the development of faster algorithms for performing
existing analyses. The second is the development of new approaches to
understanding the structure of graphs and networks. During the project, the PI
will also develop and distribute course materials to teach recent developments
in the field, will give public lectures on related material, will train graduate
and undergraduate students in research, and will develop software that others
can use to perform these analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental object
to be studied in this project are graph structured block matrices
(GSBMs)---block matrices whose nonzero structure corresponds to the edges of a
graph. The first part of the project will involve the development of fast
algorithms for the solution of systems of linear equations in GSBMs that can be
written as a sum of positive semindefinte matrices with each matrix
corresponding to one edge of the graph. These GSBMs are generalizations of
Laplacian matrices and arise in many application areas, including Optimization,
Computational Science, and Image Processing. The second part of the project will
involve the generalization of spectral graph theory to the study of the expected
characteristic polynomials of GSBMs with randomly chosen block matrices.
Spectral graph theory has been one of the most useful tools for analyzing graphs
and networks. The extension of the theory to random GSBMs should enable analyses
that are not possible with the standard approach.
