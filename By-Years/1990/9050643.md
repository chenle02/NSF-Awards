William College is purchasing sensing, digitizing, data recording, and data
analyzing equipment which allows them to transform their freshman seminar and
senior seminar solar-astronomy courses in order to reflect current instrumental
capabilities. In particular, they are using the total solar eclipse of 11 July
1991, the longest possible solar eclipse and one with extremely favorable
weather forecasts, to study oscillations in the solar chromosphere as a test of
a mechanism to explain the heating of the solar corona, and to bring the
experimental setup and results into the classroom. The experimental results mesh
nicely with the theoretical studies already being described in the courses. This
augments freshman seminar in solar astronomy, which currently uses only direct
telescopic views of the sun in white light and in hydrogen alpha, and the
junior/senior seminar in solar astronomy, which otherwise has no laboratory
component. Resulting material is also being included in the astronomy general
introductory courses. The observations can be repeated at subsequent eclipses,
and the course involvement repeated on a continuing basis. The college will
match the award with an equal amount of funds.//
