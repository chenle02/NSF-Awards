In response to a State mandate that a third science course, earth/environmental
science, be required in West Virginia a program to enhance teachers' ability to
teach earth science has been developed. To assist secondary teachers with this
new responsibility a series of 8 summer workshops in earth science are proposed
for 1992, 1993, and 1994. Each 12-day workshop will serve 20 teachers (160
total). The workshops will include: a survey of earth science topics, expert
lectures, lab exercises, field trips, and activities to improve teaching shills
and encourage professional growth. A resource "kit" for the participants will be
developed. Mentor teaches will also be prepared to conduct workshops in their
home area. This project will be operated by the Department of Education, and the
West Virginia University Department of Geology and Geography.
