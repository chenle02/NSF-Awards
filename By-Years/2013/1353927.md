The Third Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) will take place as
part of the flagship programming language conference, Principles of Programming
Languages (POPL 2013), which is being held in San Diego California. This grant
will support approximately 20 students to attend the PLMW event plus the POPL
conference. While there is other funding available (through ACM SIGPLAN PAC) for
students who are presenting papers at POPL, this proposal is intended
specifically to increase the numbers of students from underrepresented groups
and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents. The broader impacts
of the grant relate to the need to broaden participation, provide opportunities
for students to receive mentoring from top members of the programming languages
community, and build the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable
practitioners in this important research arena.
