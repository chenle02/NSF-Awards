This project is an extension of previous findings that strongly suggest that
adaptive evolution of flower color in a species of morning glory, Ipomoea
quamoclit, is accompanied by degeneration of part of the anthocyanin pigment
pathway. The primary objectives of this project are (1) to determine
definitively whether such pathway degeneration has occurred in I. quamoclit, and
(2) to determine how general an evolutionary phenomenon such degeneration is.
Pathway degeneration will be assessed by using in vitro enzyme assays and in
vivo complementation assays to determine whether individual genes in the pathway
retain their ancestral function. Phylogenetic analyses and ancestral state
reconstruction will be used to determine whether some loss-of-function
substitutions occurred after the adaptive transition shift in pigmentation, as
would be expected if those substitutions reflect pathway degeneration. In
addition to examining I. quamoclit and closely related red-flowered species in
more detail, we will also assess whether anthocyanin pigment pathway
degeneration has occurred in white-flowered morning glories in the Calonyction
group, and in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, in which only blue and not
red anthocyanins are produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A general principle in
evolutionary biology is that evolutionary loss of characters is often permanent.
While many investigations have documented this pattern, little is known about
why character loss is irreversible. The general scientific importance of this
research is that it seeks to evaluate, and provide mechanistic justification for
or against, the hypothesis that irreversibility results from the evolutionary
breakdown of complex characters that are not currently used. &lt;br/&gt;
