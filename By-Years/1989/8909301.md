This research, supported by a ROW Career Advancement Award, has the goal of
understanding Ca2+-regulated events at the molecular level. Structure-function
relationships and mechanisms of regulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-activated enzymes,
such as the type II calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase II) are
studied. CaM kinase II is found most prominently in the brain, where it is
thought to be involved in regulating synaptic activity. Biochemical treatment of
CaM kinase II produces a catalytic fragment that can serve as a simplified
kinase model for active site-directed structure-function studies. To prepare
this monomeric kinase domain in amounts sufficient for biochemical and
biophysical analyses, and to add new research capabilities to studies of this
enzyme, this research will use recombinant DNA technology. It is the aim of this
particular project to subclone a cDNA corresponding to the first 280 amino acids
of CaM kinase II into secretion-expression vectors for overexpression in
Escherichia coli. The recombinant kinase will be purified and characterized.
This work will enhance the possibility of critical structural analysis of an
important enzyme.
