In Dabob Bay, Washington, the annual cycles of phytoplankton standing stock and
production rate exhibit spectacular increases (phytoplankton blooms) in the
spring and the autumn, indicating a lack of control by the grazer populations.
Yet virtually all of the phytoplankton production is ultimately consumed by
grazers. Dr. Dagg will test a conceptual model hypothesizing the identities of
the micro- and macro-zooplankton grazer species and postulating a mechanism for
the annual balance between phytoplankton growth and grazing. This research will
field test the hypothetical model. The functional dynamics of zooplankton
grazers (both micro and macrozooplankton) will be established on four extended
cruises and budgets of carbon flow will be constructed. Grazing rates will be
experimentally measured in the field.
