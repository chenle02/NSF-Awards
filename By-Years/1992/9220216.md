This award supports a study of sediment cores from the Southern Ocean to extract
and interpret paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic information. The project will
examine the impact that glacial/interglacial changes in Southern Ocean
conditions might have had on the stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
Paleoceanographic conditions, specifically sea-surface temperatures and
circulation patterns in the past, will be reconstructed by studying floral
(diatom) composition, percent opal, percent carbonate, and the Germanium-Silicon
ratio in deep ocean cores. This information is important as input to
paleoclimatic models and models of interaction between oceans and the West
Antarctic Ice Sheet.
