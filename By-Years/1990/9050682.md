We propose to create a next workstation laboratory to complement the two-
semester, junior level sequence in electromagnetics required to all electrical
engineering majors. Initially, the laboratory would be an optional part of the
courses, with perhaps a few homework assignments requiring use of the
laboratory. However, the goal would be to eventually integrate the laboratory
into the coursework in a more substantive role. To accomplish our objective we
have already begun developing an interactive software package. The programs
developed are collective know as EM Notebooks. To create the Noteboooks, a
powerful software language called Mathematica is used. Mathematica has a feature
that can be used to hierarchically structure text, equations, and graphics.
Thus, the EM Notebooks contain animated sequences of EM phenomena such as waves
propagating in a waveguide, and the user can interactively change parameter,
such as frequency, with the moving picture altering in response.
