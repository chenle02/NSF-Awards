Many realistic image synthesis algorithms have been proposed in the last few
years, but unfortunately they tend to be very inefficient, often requiring hours
or days of calculations. As a result, the visual cues provided by these
algorithms (shading, shadows, transparency, reflections, etc.) still have not
been used routinely by applications requiring visualization. This project is
concerned with development of efficient image synthesis algorithms based on the
integral equation representing light transport in the environment. It used
techniques recently developed to solve the N-body problem in linear time.
Preliminary results indicate that the interaction matrix corresponding to the
integral equation with a linear number of blocks can be approximated. Since this
approximation has linear-space complexity, it makes it possible to explore
solution techniques that have been previously too time and memory intensive to
consider. It also studies visibility problems, sampling and meshing problems,
and lazy evaluation strategies within the context of solving the light transport
equation. Finally, these ideas will be implemented and tested. The long range
goal of all this research is to develop robust and practical algorithms that can
be incorporated into 3D graphics workstations of the future.
