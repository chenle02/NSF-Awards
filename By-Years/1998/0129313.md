0129313&lt;br/&gt;Middya&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for US-
Portugal collaboration on the physics of quasimorphous silicon thin-film for
applications in large-area electronics involves Abdul Middya and students at
Syracuse University and Rodrigo F. Martins at the New University of Lisbon,
Portugal. The purpose of the project is to understand how drift mobilities and
other electronic properties of thin-film silicon that are sensitive to disorder-
induced localization vary. The researchers will also explore why defect
metastability varies between quasimorphous and conventional amorphous silicon.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The US researchers bring to this collaboration expertise
in electronic transport, density of-state measurements and device modeling. This
is complemented by Portuguese experience in plasma-processing of materials and
fabrication of devices for photovoltaics and micro-electronics. Defect
metastability is one of the greatest impediments for commercialization of non-
crystalline Si-based thin-film technologies. An understanding of defect
metastability in amorphous silicon has technological significance for use in
laptop computers, solar cells, and laboratory arrays and detectors. &lt;br/&gt;
