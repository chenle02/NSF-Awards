Complementary experimental probes are applied to studies of the dynamics of
small clusters and molecules residing in/on superfluid helium nanodroplets, Hen,
where n is the number of He atoms. The aim is to use the Hen media to probe a
number of fundamental dopant properties. The following topics are explored: (i)
quantum chaotic dynamics in a superfluid environment (ii) the low-temperature
limit of the lifetime of collective excitations in metal clusters; (iii) the
formation and desorption of molecular and cluster anions in helium droplets by
using low-energy electron capture. Photodepletion signals are enhanced greatly
by using a novel "atomic feedback" strategy. Namely, a tube surrounding the
counterpropagating droplet and laser beams constrains helium atoms that are
evaporated as a result of photoabsorption by Hen clusters containing embedded
impurities, and reuses these atoms to further deplete the droplet beam, in an
avalanche-like effect. On a broader impact, the program enhances education via
workshops, summer school programs, interdisciplinary programs and undergraduate
involvement in the research.
