This project is developing interdisciplinary educational content for an
undergraduate course in entrepreneurship for engineers. By becoming familiar
with the fundamentals of entrepreneurship, students are better able to design
engineering solutions that address customers' needs in an increasingly global
marketplace. The project is developing two case studies along with the
associated teaching notes and instructional material. It also is developing
material to support a mini-conference for students that fosters creativity and
encourages them to conceptualize new or improved products or services that might
be commercialized. Finally, they are developing assessment rubrics to evaluate
the project outcomes and these tools and the resulting data are contributing to
the existing body of knowledge and research in teaching entrepreneurship to
engineers and are serving as models to other universities that have courses in
entrepreneurship for engineers. Dissemination plans include conference
presentations, particularly at the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators
Alliance Annual Conference, and journal publication on the case studies. They
also will publish booklets on their cases and make teaching notes available to
instructors.
