The scientific staff of the American Museum of Natural History needs a scanning
electron microscope (SEM) to replace an older model which is frequently
inoperative and does not meet all the needs of the researchers. The instrument
is in constant use during most of the year and is usually booked one month in
advance. This back-up stems from heavy usage and the need for frequent repair.
The new instrument will provide improved image resolution; the ability to study
a greater variety of specimens; enhanced picture quality; and a greater variety
of photographic and electronic recording techniques. The new instrument will
also give researchers the ability to study and identify chemical distributions
in the specimens they examine, giving them deeper understanding of the nature of
those specimens. Many projects are planned for the new instrument including
studies of the symbionts of giant amoebae (foraminifera); systematics of
ammonites, moss animals (bryozoa), pomace fies, fungus gnats, mice, rats, and
termites; fish dentines; living and fossil sharks; tiny spiders; and jade and
asbestos mineralogy.
