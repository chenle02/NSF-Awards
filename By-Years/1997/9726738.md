This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research on charge
transfer photochemistry of rhenium complexes. It involves research groups of
Guillermo Ferraudi of the University of Notre Dame and Mohamed Sarakha of the
Photochemistry Laboratory at the Universite Blaise Pascale. The investigators
will study competing photochemical and photophysical processes in rhenium that
result from the coexistence of metal-to-ligand and ligand-to-ligand charge
transfer states. Practical applications of these reactions to problems of water
decontamination and CO2 (carbon dioxide) fixation will be explored. The US
research group brings to this collaboration expertise in the reaction mechanism
of fast photochemical and thermal reactions. This is complemented by the French
group's expertise in inorganic photochemistry as applied to continuous
photolysis and in environmental photochemistry. The project will advance
understanding of the process of charge separation and formation of photochemical
intermediates which can be utilized in environmental applications.
