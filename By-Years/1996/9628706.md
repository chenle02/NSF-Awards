The investigators will study the electrodynamic coupling between the solar
wind, the Earth's magnetosphere, and the ionosphere. Initial focus will be on
comparison of the magnetometer and incoherent scatter radar data for studying
cusp/cleft dynamics behavior in response to variations in the solar wind and
interplanetary magnetic field. Fundamental questions center around the
identification of ionospheric signatures of phenomena which occur at the
magnetopause and which relate to solar wind- magnetosphere interactions. Later
studies will focus on the magnetometer and radar data comparison with satellite
images. Finally, the investigators will undertake extensive modeling of
ionospheric phenomena through the 3-D adaptive grid MHD model and empirical
ionospheric electrodynamic model developed at the University of Michigan. The
former model has the ability to resolve features over vastly different spatial
scales making the ionospheric predictions meaningful and, therefore, appropriate
for comparisons with measurements and numerical modeling of other iuonospheric
electrodynamic parameters.
