This project is concerned with matrix and combinatorial theory. One of the
investigators will examine problems in combinatorial matrix theory. He will
investigate the polytope of doubly stochastic matrices, determination of the
elementary divisors of the classical invariant matrices and matrix
factorizations of determinants and permanents. The other investigator is
concerned with matrix theory. He will work on non-negative matrices, the related
class of M-matrices, scaling of matrices and inertia theory of matrices. A
matrix is a rectangular array with possible entries from a wide variety of
rings. This is a field which originated in the ninetheenth century as a part of
algebra. It is curently very active in view of its many applications and
connections with other parts of mathematics and other scientific and technical
disciplines.
