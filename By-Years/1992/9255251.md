The Hartford Alliance for Mathematics and Science Education, a coalition of
businesses, educators, universities, public schools, parents, and concerned
citizens, propose to expand upon ninth grade curriculum developed under a
Private sector Partnership grant from fourth year, and two other courses for the
fourth year for those students not planning on going to college. These materials
will be field tested in Connecticut and at five sites nationwide. Inservice
training of teachers, and evaluation are integral to this proposal. Training
videos will be produced.
