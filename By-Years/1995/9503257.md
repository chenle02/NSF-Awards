9503257 HATCHER Although dissolved organic carbon (DOM) in the oceans plays a
major role in the global biogeochemical cycling of carbon, we know little of its
known composition and origin. Terrestrial contribution to the DOM has
traditionally been estimated from analytically determined amounts of lignin-
derived materials produced from oxidative degradation by CuO. Recently, a new
thermal degradative technique has emerged as a powerful tool to examine the
chemical components of lignin. This proposed study seeks to develop and evaluate
this technique for the characterization of lignin in DOM from marine and
riverine systems. Aside from showing greater specificity for lignin-derived
material, the method (thermolysis/gas) chromatography with teramethyl ammonium
hydroxide) is easily implemented in most modern laboratories, in contrast to the
traditional CuO oxidation. Similar lignin phenol parameters are obtained and the
technique is believed to recover the lignin signature from samples which have
been extensively degraded, unlike the CuO method. If this method is tested to
compare well with the CuO procedure, it would provide a rapid and more easily
applied method of evaluating the terrestrial composition of marine and riverine
DOM.
