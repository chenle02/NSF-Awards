Alternative splicing is an important mechanism of gene regulation that
contributes to transcriptome and proteome diversity. Large scale EST/cDNA based
studies suggest that alternative splicing affects at least 20% of the genes in
Arabidopsis thaliana, and its frequency in other plant species may be even
higher. However, in the vast majority of cases, we do not know where and when
splice variants are expressed, or if they have a biological function. Several
recent reviews suggest the importance of alternative splicing in plants as a
mechanism for controlling both development and stress adaptation. The goal of
the proposed project is to further investigate this hypothesis by measuring the
extent and functional significance of alternative splicing in Arabidopsis
thaliana during its defense against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae
pv tomato. The investigators will employ high-throughput sequencing to query the
expression of alternatively spliced genes, determine the impact of alternative
splicing on protein structure and gene function, validate selected splice
isoforms, and perform functional analysis of selected genes. A critical
component of this project will be the development of new computational tools to
detect and quantify alternative splicing in high-throughput sequencing data. So
far, researchers might have avoided investigating alternative splicing due to
technical challenges during data analysis; the tools developed during the course
of this project will help to overcome these difficulties. The end-results of
this study will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of alternative
splicing, and help to conceive new strategies for stress tolerance improvement
in crop plants. This project will provide trans-disciplinary training for two
junior scientists. The PIs will also partner with the NCSU Science House to
offer research opportunities to underrepresented and rural high school students.
