More data is available today than ever before, and this availability has enabled
groundbreaking new applications and societal advances. However, today's
computing technology that stores, organizes, and searches data is struggling to
keep up to the demands imposed by the data's growth and by the requirements of
new applications. Data management systems need to adapt to support the evolving
information needs of modern applications. This project will extend data
management technology to support constrained search for collections of data
items that satisfy complex requirements. The need for this functionality arises
in many domains: Online marketplaces group products into meaningful collections
based on customer preferences, travel agents organize vacation packages that
coordinate travel and hotel reservations, and dietitians design meal plans that
satisfy complex nutritional needs. Currently, such applications have to resort
to ad hoc solutions that lead to suboptimal results and poor performance.

This project will establish the theoretical foundations and will address
practical aspects of providing support for packages. A package is a group of
data items that collectively satisfy a set of constraints. This project will
extend data management technology to provide full-fledged support for packages,
and will make contributions on three fronts: (1) a declarative language to
support querying for packages, (2) evaluation strategies to efficiently compute
answers to package queries, and (3) interaction techniques for package
specification. The broader impact of this work will be the advancement of data
management technology to handle emerging application needs, which in turn will
increase the positive impact that data and computing systems have on society.
