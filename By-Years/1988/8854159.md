Discrete Mathematics is a subject that is being pushed to the forefront of
mathematics curriculum revision, and there is considerable debate over the
topics that should comprise such an undergraduate course, and over its placing
in the curriculum sequence. Many two year colleges are currently developing a
Discrete Mathematics course as a service course for Computer Science.
Mathematics Association of Two Year Colleges of New Jersey will offer a Workshop
on Applications of Discrete Mathematics. Dr. Fred Roberts of Rutgers University,
who is recognized as a major force in current Discrete Mathematics development
will conduct this workshop. The workshop will consist of two sessions with a
summer between them. Thirty participants from two year colleges in New Jersey
and eastern Pennsylvania will be chosen. Discrete Mathematics has become so
important because of the enormous variety of applications of the subject. These
workshops will explore such applications to genetics, engineering, computer
science, and social planning. During the three months between sessions, each
participant will work on individual or small-group projects. The results of
these projects will be evaluated during the Fall sessions. Participants will
receive a printed summary to the group's activities to share with colleagues and
students at their home institutions. In addition to NSF support, participants
will contribute about 15% in travel costs toward the project, and the grantee
institution will contribute another 5% in support costs.
