The telomerase enzyme is crucial for maintaining genome stability and cellular
immortality. Elucidating novel telomerase biogenesis pathways and protein-RNA
co-evolution in unexplored fungal groups will reveal fundamental principles of
enzyme evolution in biology. Notably, the fungi included in this study are known
pathogens of amphibians and food crops. This project will involve training of
high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups.
These students will have hands-on laboratory experiences that will motivate and
encourage them to pursue careers in STEM disciplines. Moreover, the research
experience will improve their applications and competitiveness for college and
graduate school. Students will also participate in updating and improving our
publicly accessible Telomerase Database, which serves as an effective means of
disseminating hypothesis- and curiosity-driven research to the general
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) composition and
biogenesis pathways are extremely divergent among distinct groups of eukaryotes.
The origins and evolutionary connections among telomerase RNAs (TR) from
different groups of species remain unresolved. To understand the mechanism
driving telomerase RNP diversity, telomerases from distinct representative taxa
within eukaryotes need to be studied. This project will employ molecular biology
and biochemical approaches for identifying TRs from key fungal species outside
of the previously explored Ascomycota phylum. The newly identified TRs will
offer novel, exciting models for telomerase RNP structure-function and
biogenesis. Collectively, this project will provide crucial insights into the
molecular evolution of fungal telomerase RNP structure-function and expand our
knowledge of lncRNA (long noncoding RNA) biogenesis
pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is funded jointly by the Genetic
Mechanisms Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the
Division of Biological Infrastructure in the Directorate for Biological
Sciences.
