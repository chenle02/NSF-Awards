This award will provide support for CoPI Hunter Snyder, who is a research
associate at the Arctic Studies Center, to travel to Greenland to do pre-
Dissertation Improvement Grant proposal consultation with local scholars and
community members. In addition, the CoPI would do a proof of concept for his
Photovoices methodology in Greenland by engaging in trial video education and
production training with local community youth. The eventual topic for the video
is how the Inuit balance between traditional hunting and fishing and prospective
work in the newly developing mining industry. Building on over 4,000 years of
Inuit storytelling, and the CoPI?s expertise in video production and
ethnography, the researcher hopes to collaborate with Greenlanders to capture
and analyze their knowledge about changing livelihoods, the lived experience of
varying types of labor, and the local meaning of social and environmental change
through visual media.
