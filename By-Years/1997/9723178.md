IBN: 9723178 PI: Rodman The primary visual cortex of the brain is known to be an
important center for conscious visual perception, but there are other parts of
the brain that also handle visual information in quite complex ways, though
perhaps less "consciously." If the visual cortex is severely damaged, subjects
are for most purposes considered blind. However, special tests can show that
there is some kind of residual ability to detect visual targets and some
properties about their location, movement and other features. This phenomenon is
called "blindsight." It offers an unusual opportunity to study how visual
activity in the brain can be separated from conscious visual perception. It is
interesting that the degree of recovery from cortical loss is greater in early
life, and may actually include some awareness of visual stimuli. This project
utilizes testing of blindsight capabilities to understand differences between
visual capabilities in early and in later life. Anatomical and physiological
techniques will be used to see whether cells and their projections from a
subcortical center called the thalamus still convey normal visual signals to
remaining areas of visual cortex, and whether there are compensatory connections
that develop between the thalamus and other brain regions. Results will be
important to developmental neuroscience and cognitive psychology as well as to
visual neuroscience, to enhance our knowledge of the organization and
development of the visual system.
