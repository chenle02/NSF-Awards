8901879 Mann Professor Mann will investigate two projects in algebraic topology
which, in addition to their topological interest, have applications in
mathematical physics, non-linear partial differential equations, and linear
control theory. The first project, representing joint work with Professor C. P.
Boyer, continues the ongoing program of Professors Boyer and Mann to study the
geometry and topology of moduli spaces of instantons and monopoles which arise
in the differential geometric formulation of Yang-Mills-Higgs gauge theories.
The techniques developed in this program have applications to other moduli
problems which will also be investigated. The second project, representing joint
work with Professor R.J. Milgram, attempts to extend the results of Professors
F.R. Cohen, R.L. Cohen, B.M. Mann, and R.J. Milgram on the more general case of
rational functions from the Riemann sphere to Grassmannians and flag manifolds.
The topology of such spaces is important in several areas, including linear
control theory, and the results of this project will be useful in applications
to other areas of mathematics.
