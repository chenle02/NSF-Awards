Oberlin College will continue the development of two laboratory-based
introductory courses for the computer science major started with a previous UCC
grant of one year. This project supports a faculty member for the development of
the laboratory materials, and student laboratory assistants during the period of
the grant. The two courses follow the recommendations of the recent ACM/IEEE
report Computing Curriculum '91, and gives emphasis to algorithms and conceptual
development of the introductory material. The laboratory sessions are used to
make the courses more realistic introductions to the broad range of topics that
make up computer science, and to speed up and enhance the students' learning of
technical matters that require hands-on experience. These changes are expected
to make the courses more interesting, more useful, and more accurate reflections
of the field, and to create a positive effect on the number of women and
minorities majoring in computer science.
