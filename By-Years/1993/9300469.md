9300469 Yamamoto This award will support a cooperative instrument development
program by scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Scripps
Institution of Oceanography, and the University of Miami. The primary objectives
of the project are to develop an test broad- band seismometers for deployment in
the deep ocean. Such instruments are necessary for studies of ocean crustal
structure and for global seismic studies of the earth's interior. These
instruments will be used too determine the optimum deployment strategy for long-
term seismic stations in the deep sea. ***
