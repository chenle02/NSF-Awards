The objective of the proposed research is to determine how much nitrogen is
fixed per unit land per year by two species of subterranean termites in coastal
Virginia. Field and laboratory studies will be conducted over a three-year
period to examine rates of nitrogen fixation as a function of temperature and
wood nitrogen content and acidity. Seasonal changes in the relative proportions
of workers, soldiers and immatures in termite nests will be examined along with
nest density in order to determine the annual nitrogen contributions by termites
to coastal forests. %%% Nitrogen fixation by termite bacteria may be an
important source of nutrients in forests that are deficient in available
nitrogen. The bacteria resident in the hindguts of termites can fix atmospheric
molecular nitrogen into nitrogen compounds that are incorporated into termite
tissues. When termites die or excrete nitrogenous wastes, free-living bacteria
metabolize the organic nitrogen into ammonia and nitrates which are then
available as nutrients for plants. However, the quantity of nitrogen fixed by
termite bacteria is unknown, because many factors influence rates of nitrogen
fixation. These factors include temperature and the nitrogen content and acidity
of the wood eaten by termites. Also, different species of termites and different
termites castes such as workers, soldiers and immatures vary in the amount of
nitrogen they fix.
