This grant provides partial support for travel for participants in the
"International Conference on Micromechanics of Failure of Quasi-Brittle
Materials" to be held in Albuquerque, New Mexico during June 1990. Quasi-brittle
materials such as concrete, rock, ceramics and ice represent important
engineering materials. Research on their failure is rapidly changing our
understanding of these processes and will be discussed in this conference.
