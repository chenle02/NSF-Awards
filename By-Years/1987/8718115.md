The goal of this project is to understand the interaction of DNA gyrase with
intracellular bacterial DNA. The specific objectives are: l. to establish
quantitative relationships between the occupation of sites in DNA, with which
gyrase intereacts strongly, and the superhelix density of the DNA molecule in
which the sites reside. 2. to examine how transcription influences the
interaction of gyrase with particular sites in plasmid DNA in the vicinity of a
strong, inducible promoter. 3. to map naturally occurring sites on the
chromosome where gyrase interacts with DNA in the vicinity of an inducible
operon before and after induction, and 4. to study the dynamics of gyrase-
chromosome interactions. The latter studies will include chromosomal and
cytoplasmic gyrase are in rapid exchange, whether cytoplasmic gyrase shows a
preference for binding to newly-replicated DNA or for binding to actively
transcribing DNA, and whether gyrase exhibits a preference for binding to DNA
during specific phases of the cell cycle. The chromosome of E. coli exists as a
circular DNA molecule that must be compacted more than 1000-fold in order to fit
inside the cell. Compaction is accomplished in part by supercoiling or twisting
of the DNA as a result of the action of the enzymes known as topoisomerses that
control DNA supercoiling. In addition to compacting the genome, supercoiling
also influences many of the biological activities of DNA such as transcription
and replication. Dr. Drlica's project is designed to investigate the
interactions that occur between gyrase and the bacterial chromosome and to
determine the relationship between supercoiling and gene expression.
