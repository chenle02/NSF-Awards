The department of chemistry is improving and modernizing the undergraduate
laboratory curriculum. Specifically, the department is introducing NMR
spectroscopy into the "project lab" chemistry courses. "Project lab" is the
department's unique approach to laboratory instruction which emphasizes
individual achievement and preparedness in the chemistry laboratory. With the
many applications of NMR spectroscopy the department is implementing NMR
experiments in all areas of chemistry. Experiments are being introduced into the
undergraduate lab which are unique to the NMR phenomenon. Ultimately the
department would like to publish some of these experiments to assist other
undergraduate institutions in fully utilizing their NMR instructional
facilities. The specific piece of equipment that is being utilized is a 60 MHz
spectrometer equipped with a variable temperature probe. The grantee is matching
the award from non-Federal sources.
