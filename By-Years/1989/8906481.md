Ceramic membranes have good pore size uniformity, and good thermal and
mechanical properties. They can be used at high temperatures (1000>C) and in the
corrosive environments often found in the chemical industry. They have the
additional advantage that they can be thermally treated (500>C), steam cleaned
and sterilized. Many industrial catalytic reactions show low conversion and/or
yields due either to unfavorable thermodynamics, product inhibition or
undesirable side reactions. This in turn necessitates more severe operating
conditions (which in turn require higher catalyst replacement rates) and costly
separation operations. Catalytic membrane reactors, units in which the membrane
is an integral part of the reactor, combine reaction and separation in a single
unit operation. Such units have the advantage that the membrane provides for
selective removal of one or more products and/or stable intermediates in
parallel with the reaction, thus driving the reaction continuously towards the
product side and resulting in higher conversions. With higher conversion, the
process can be run at lower pressure and temperature, resulting in longer
catalyst life, reduced recycle, and reduced downstream separation requirements.
The membrane also enables control of surface concentrations and therefore
selectivity and product distribution. It is the primary goal of this Industry
University Cooperative Research (IUCR) project to test the applicability of
ceramic membrane reactor technology in the area of oil and asphaltene hydro
processing. Two types of alumina ceramic membranes will be studied, membranes
prepared by anodic oxidation of aluminum and membranes prepared by the Sol-Gel
technique. Both kinds of membranes have a virtually unimodal pore size
distribution and show excellent separatory functions. They have different
surface properties and different pore structures and could therefore have
different capabilities and/or uses.
