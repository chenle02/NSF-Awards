This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop
a sound and novel Line Scan X-ray instrument to characterize turbulent sprays
and flames inside a windowless combustor. This project will develop and evaluate
a prototype system that will be used by the automotive and gas turbine
industries. The goal of the project is a commercially available diagnostic
technique for obtaining detailed characteristics of flames and sprays inside
windowless combustors.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it will enable
industry to measure relevant information inside combustors, permitting stricter
quality control and reduced pollution emission. Significant advances in the
combustion process are required to enable quantum improvements in fuel
efficiency. This diagnostic tool will provide the information critically needed
to enable improvements in fuel efficiency and pollution reduction.
