&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides support for the development of an ultra-high
vacuum (UHV) surface science chamber at the University of California, Irvine,
for the study of nanometer scale materials, specifically the electronic
properties and potential electronic applications of nanoelectronic devices. The
UHV system will help build a foundation of understanding for the interactions
between nanoscale electronic devices and their chemical environment. The UHV
chamber will be equipped with specialized sample handling for electrical
transport measurements. Surface science techniques will be applied to high-
surface area nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes to help determine their true
transport properties and to investigate their interactions with molecular
adsorbates. The system will provide carefully controlled chemical states and
limited adsorbed species to allow for investigations of electronic nanomaterials
for chemical or biological sensor applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
apparatus will impact the graduate education of more than 20 students enrolled
at UC Irvine in the Chemical and Materials Physics (ChaMP) program. This
graduate program stresses interdisciplinary connections between physics,
chemistry and nanoscience, and it promotes an active learning environment with a
hands-on laboratory rotation to introduce new students to graduate level
research. Students will gain experience through investigations of the effects of
chemical environment on the electronic properties of nanotubes and nanowires or
clusters, by preparing devices with and without adsorbates. Students will gain
new perspectives in the crossing of the disciplines of chemistry, physics and
biology with the nanometer scale systems.&lt;br/&gt;
