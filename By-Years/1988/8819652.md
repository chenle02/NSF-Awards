This research focuses on developing a new fine-grain multiprocessing
architecture, the Distributed Instruction Set Architecture (DISA). DISA is based
on a distributed execution model and combines pipelined and data-flow
architecture to distribute multiple instructions to multiple functional units
with a minimal overhead. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous functional units are
being studied. The design of innovative computer architectures that utilized
advanced VLSI technologies is an important area leading to the next generation
of computers. The project supported addresses this important problem of using
multiple functional units in the Reduced Instruction Set Architecture. The
realization of find-grain parallelism at the chip and board levels will provide
a powerful building block for the next generation multiprocessor. Support is
strongly recommended.
