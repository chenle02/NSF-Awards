The goal of this project is to document how chimpanzee locomotion and anatomy
develop from infancy through adulthood. Specifically, the extent to which
changes in locomotor behavior over time influence changes in skeletal anatomy
will be investigated. Infant chimpanzees are typically carried by their mothers
when traveling and principally move using their upper limbs. In contrast,
juvenile chimpanzees move entirely by themselves, relying more on quadrupedal
locomotion. Quadrupedal knuckle walking increases as individuals age. These
behavioral transitions are predicted to result in correlated changes in anatomy,
with an initial increase in lower limb bone strength and shape as chimpanzees
mature from infancy to juvenility. A second change, in knuckle morphology,
related to the stress of knuckle-walking, is expected to occur as individuals
age and spend more time moving quadrupedally. &lt;br/&gt; This project will
integrate observations of chimpanzees in the wild with measurements of bones in
museums and analysis conducted in the laboratory. Fieldwork will be conducted in
Kibale National Park, Uganda, to document the locomotor behavior of chimpanzees
of different ages. Chimpanzees will also be filmed to analyze individual
variation in performance within and between locomotor modes. Chimpanzee
skeletons from museums will be analyzed using morphological measures, micro CT
scanning, and digital photography. &lt;br/&gt; Chimpanzees are our closest
living relatives and their behavior likely includes elements shared with our
ancestors. A systematic study of how chimpanzee movement affects the shape of
bones may enable us to identify morphological features induced by behaviors such
as knuckle-walking, bipedalism, and suspension. These features can then be used
to reconstruct locomotor behavior in fossil apes and humans and provide a better
understanding of how humans evolved into bipedal creatures. Results promise to
shed light on problems relevant to several fields of study, including functional
morphology, bone growth and development, and human evolution.&lt;br/&gt;
