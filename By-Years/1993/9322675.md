9322675 Jones Jones will conduct research over broad areas in analysis, algebra,
topology and mathematical physics, ranging from work in group cohomology
inspired by an invariant due to Connes on von Neumann algebras to the statistics
of fields in low dimensional(conformal and otherwise) field theory. The
topological implications are in knot theory and 3-manifold topology. The
unifying theme is that of a subfactor which is ultimately related to all these
topics. Endomorphisms onto subfactors are also playing an increasing role. The
general area of the mathematics in this project has its basis in the
mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics one deals
with non-commutative objects that can be analyzed by considering their algebraic
structure as a mathematical construct called a von Neumann algebra. These
abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications. In this project,
invariants associated with these algebras will be investigated with an eye
towards applications in knot theory and quantum statistics. ***
