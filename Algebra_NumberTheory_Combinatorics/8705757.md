This research will concentrate on various problems related to arithmetic
algebraic geometry. Professor Dwork will work on the theory of p-adic
differential equations. More specifically he will work on the p-adic properties
of generalized hypergeometric functions, or more exactly upon the p-adic
properties of the Frobenius matrix associated with the corresponding cohomology.
Professor Shimura will work on arithmeticity properties concerning zeta
functions and automorphic forms. These include special values of Eisenstein
series, certain combinations of zeta functions and periods of automorphic forms
associated with quaternion algebras. Dr. Bien, a post doctoral associate, will
work on the representations of Kac-Moody algebras. Another post doctoral
associate, Dr. Chai, will work on the moduli schemes of abelian varieties. The
theory of arithmetic algebraic geometry has benefited greatly in the past from
the important contributions of the two principle investigators. They are one of
the strongest pairs in arithmetic in the world today. The subject uses geometric
(and in their case analytic, as well) tools to delve deeply into number
theoretic questions. Certain types of special functions play important roles in
number theory. These two researchers attack problems on these types of functions
in complementary ways. Dwork looks at p-adic analogues while Shimura
concentrates on their transformation properties. The post doctoral associates
work in similar areas. Much of great interest will surely result from this work.
