"Teens Exploring and Explaining Nature and Science" (TEENS) is a year-long,
multi-component program serving Chicago public school students from 7th to 12th
grade through three contiguous programs: &lt;br/&gt;(1) SMART Squad; (2) Science
Explorers; and (3) Science Guides which focus on science education and job-
skills training. The purpose of the project is to raise students' expectations
for academic achievement, to enhance their scientific knowledge, and to increase
their academic skills, occupational expectations, aspirations and self-
esteem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
