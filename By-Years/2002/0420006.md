&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0420006&lt;br/&gt;Sundaram&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop anatomically
and physically realistic simulation software for respiratory drug delivery by
applying computational fluid dynamics methods from the aerospace industry.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will be to
enable drug companies to examine the effect of their specific drug on different
individuals. &lt;br/&gt;
