Experimental studies of the instabilities and phase transitions in light-matter
interaction will be continued. These experiments are in part an outgrowth of the
experiments being carried out with NSF support and they build upon experience
and techniques developed to study fluctuation phenomena in laser- matter
interactions. The proposed experiments include investigations of the effects of
colored multiplicative noise on various types of laser instabilities. These
experiments would be very timely in view of the current interest in noise
induced transitions in nonequilibrium systems. The fluctuation and instabilities
in the process of second harmonic generation will also be studied as a way of
initiating a study of the instabilities of nonlinear optical systems. The
proposed experiments will provide much needed experimental data in a rapidly
growing field.
