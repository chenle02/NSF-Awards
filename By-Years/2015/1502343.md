This award partially supports the Santa Fe Alliance For Science (SFAFS), an
organization that utilizes the very large population of STEM professionals in
New Mexico (third per capita among all states) to help improve K-14 math and
science education in the Santa Fe area, and to raise the profile of math and
science. SFAFS volunteers have created a program that brings greatly enriched
math and science content to a large number of students, parents and teachers in
Santa Fe. In 2013-14, these activities, involving over 5,000 student
interactions, utilized over 4,300 volunteer hours. This project will solidify
the very substantial gains that have been made and to add improvements that will
make the program even stronger.

The research questions underlying this work include (1) How this resource of
STEM professionals can be utilized to make effective change happen; (2) How this
group of highly-trained math and science experts can be molded into an effective
pedagogical entity; (3) How existing educational modalities can be modified, or
reshaped, to take advantage of this talent pool; (4) How these specially skilled
individuals can help create greater student and public interest in the beauty,
power and value of math and science, and bring these ideas to all segments of
the community; and (5) How the social and political issues that will certainly
arise can be dealt with most effectively.
