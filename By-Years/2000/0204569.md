Mavriplis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: The Method of Alternating
Projections&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The method of alternating projections (MAP) is
an iterative procedure for determining nearest points from a set that is the
intersection of a finite number of closed convex sets. This method has found use
in at least 15 different areas of mathematics, which includes solving linear
equations and inequalities, signal analysis, and computed tomography. The main
practical drawback of the MAP, at least for some applications, is its slow
convergence. We will study rates of convergence for the MAP by extending the
notion of ``angle'' between subspaces to that of more general convex sets, as
well as determine means for accelerating the convergence of the MAP. In
addition, we expect to show that the speed of convergence of the MAP is directly
related to a property (the ``strong conical hull intersection'' property) of the
convex sets in question that we have studied in several papers over the last 20
years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The method of alternating projections is an
algorithm for computing nearest points in certain sets by a repetitive
application of the same few simple steps. Since the method has applications to
so many different areas of mathematics (one of the earliest being in medical
imaging via X-rays), it is important to know how fast (i.e., how many steps)
this algorithm needs to take before the results give good accuracy of the exact
solution. The ``rate of convergence'' of the algorithm deals with the question
of how fast the algorithm is for any given problem. For those problems when the
rate of convergence is slow, we will also study ways to make the algorithm work
faster by making appropriate modifications of certain steps in the algorithm.
