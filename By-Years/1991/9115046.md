The proposed research deals with the analysis of interconnected power networks
when subjected to large disturbances such as the loss of a generating unit. The
vast majority of analytical work on power system dynamics deals with system
behavior in response to small disturbances. In such cases linearized analysis is
appropriate. For large disturbances, nonlinear interactions can play an
important role. The approach used in this research extends energy-based methods
to account for modal interactions.
