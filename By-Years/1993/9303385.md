9303385 Klusman It is proposed to measure methane and non-methane hydrocarbon
(NMHC) fluxes from the earth in sedimentary basins with a focus on arid and
semiarid environments. The microseepage phenomenon is widespread, though not
generally recognized as a significant contribution to the atmospheric loading by
hydrocarbons. Saturated hydrocarbons, particularly methane, make a significant
contribution to the absorption of infrared radiation from the earth. The 14C
activity of the atmosphere sets an upper limit to the contribution of methane
from all fossil fuel sources in the range of 20-30%. Presumably nearly all of
the C2-C5 saturated hydrocarbons in the atmosphere are from fossil fuel sources.
Research to date attributes the fossil fuel contribution entirely to man-induced
leakage and pollution, but has not measured the natural microseepage rates in
the environments where it is likely to occur. The proposal is to measure the
natural fluxes of CH4 and NMHC in several sedimentary basins in the western
United States using gas chromatography the basins selected are known to have a
wide range of concentrations of hydrocarbons in soil gas. The fluxes are
expected to be proportional to the soil gas concentrations. The research in the
first year will concentrate on preliminary estimates of fluxes using flux
chamber techniques. Second year research will focus on more accurate measurement
of fluxes from additional basins and application of carbon isotopy to support
the nature of the source of methane and NMHCs. The proposed research will be of
significance in global change research if it is found that natural microseepage
is a major contribution to the methane and C2-C5 emission inventories.
