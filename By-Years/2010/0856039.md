Tragoudas&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Embedded systems are application specific
computing systems that have and continue to permeate across every facet of human
and machine interaction. Home appliances, mobile hand-held devices, medical
instrumentation, etc are just a few examples where embedded computing systems
are found today. The proposal is to establish a Center to conduct research on
robust, energy efficient and networked embedded systems. The lead of the
proposed Center will be Arizona State University (ASU)) with site location at
Southern Illinois University at Carbondale (SIUC). The main activities of the
proposed Center will encompass fundamental, industry relevant research,
education and training for undergraduate and graduate students through research
projects and directed industry sponsored internships, and technology transfer
made possible by shared IP arrangements and student employment. The formation of
the proposed Center will significantly enhance the existing research
collaboration and greatly leverage the research capabilities of the
participating institution and industrial partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research activities at the proposed Center would have direct contribution to the
following broad domains: Health Care, Homeland Defense, Energy and Environment,
and Education and Culture. The proposed Center will encourage collaboration, and
the research will expose students and faculty to state-of-the-art research
projects of value to the industry. Graduate and undergraduate students at the
participating universities and engineers from the various industrial members
will benefit from the I/UCRC infrastructure and industry-driven research and
development projects. Both schools have an excellent track record of getting
under-represented populations involved in science, engineering and mathematics.
