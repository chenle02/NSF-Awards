9453031 Schneider The Children's Museum of Manhatten is requesting $267,220 over
two years to create a 2,500 sq.ft. interactive exhibition about the physical and
acoustic properties of sound. The exhibition will use music as a high-interest
point of entry into learning about science, and also as a demonstration of
science as part of our everyday lives. The entire exhibit will be displayed for
two years. Certain elements will then be retired, others displayed indefinitely.
Target audience is children in kindergarten through sixth grades.
