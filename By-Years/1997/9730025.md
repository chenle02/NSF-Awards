9730025 Hansell In this study, researcher at the Bermuda Biological Station will
perform empirical analyses of the principal processes that control the
partitioning of carbon in the surface layer of the ocean in order to improve
model parameterizations of the oceanic carbon cycle. Specific processes to be
evaluated included the export of carbon from the surface layer as particulate
organic and inorganic carbon, the production and accumulation of organic carbon
in the surface layer, and the air-sea exchange of carbon dioxide. The analytical
approach taken will be largely one of mass balance of carbon and nitrogen in the
upper layer of the ocean. Carbon partitioning at US JGOFS process and time-
series sites will be studied in the early phase of the project, while
extrapolation of the findings at the JGOFS sites to the ocean basin and global
scale will take place in the later phase of the project. In the latter analysis,
data from the Global CO2 survey and the NOAA OACES lines will be used to
investigate basin wide expressions of carbon partitioning. The work will lead to
significant improvements in the oceanographic community's modeling of the marine
carbon cycle.
