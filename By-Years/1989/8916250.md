This research will do a systematic, global study of seismic deformation at
convergent plate boundaries within the framework of plate tectonics. The
patterns of seismic deformation observed at convergent plate boundaries are
often not in accord with plate tectonic theory in its simplest form. The work
will make use of catalogs and compilations of earthquake focal mechanisms as
well as geological data regarding rates of late Quaternary fault offsets. The
goal of the proposed work is to develop a global survey or map of seismic
(instantaneous) deformation at and in the vicinity of plate margins, which can
be compared with plate tectonic model predictions and, hopefully, in the near
future, large numbers of geodetic measurements that will become available as
space-based geodetic (GPS and VLBI) surveys progress. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
