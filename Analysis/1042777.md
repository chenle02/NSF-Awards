This award will provide support for participants, especially women, graduate
students, postdocs, and young faculty, in "A Conference on Complex Dynamics and
Hyperbolic Geometry" that will be held at the Graduate Center of the City
University of New York from October 21-23, 2010.

The purpose of this conference is to celebrate the many contributions of Linda
Keen to the field of "complex analysis," broadly construed. The primary focus of
the meeting will be on areas in which Professor Keen has had a major
involvement, specifically complex dynamics, Teichmuller theory, and Kleinian
groups. All three remain central and extremely active subjects of current
research. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample
opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference
activities.
