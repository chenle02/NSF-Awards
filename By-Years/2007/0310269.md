This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2003.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "The identification and functional
analysis of brain patterning genes during the embryonic development of the
amphipod crustacean, Parhyale hawaiensis." Significant differences exist in
brain and head structure between insects and their sister taxon, the
crustaceans. A small number of transcription factors play a major role in the
specification of the Drosophila supraesophageal ganglia. These include the 'head
gap genes' tailless (tll), orthodenticle (otd), and empty spiracles (ems). The
aim of this study is the characterization of the functional roles of tll, otd,
and ems during embryonic development of the supraesophageal brain neuromeres of
Parhyale.
