This project includes two mathematics mini-courses to be part of an enhanced
group of mathematics activities at the 2004 Conference of the Society for
Advancement of Chicano and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) to be held on
October 21-24, 2004 in Austin, Texas. Each mini-course will consist of four one-
hour lectures plus up to two more hours of problem solving/discussion sessions.
Each course will be conducted by two faculty members: an established
mathematician with an excellent record of research,&lt;br/&gt;mentoring and
teaching, and a junior faculty member who has demonstrated exceptional mentoring
ability while carrying out an outstanding research and teaching program. The
mini-course topics will be "Coding Theory" and "Mathematical Methods in
Bioinformatics."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of each mini-course is to
expose a large number of minority students (advanced undergraduates and graduate
students) to a topic in applied or pure mathematics with particular emphasis on
diverse approaches to problems, and connections to other areas of mathematics or
other disciplines. In addition, the aim is to reach a point in the mini-courses
when open problems that have the potential to grow into graduate research
projects can be stated in context. This is designed to encourage students to
continue on to graduate school and boost their confidence by making them realize
that, even at this stage, they are able to understand&lt;br/&gt;where the
motivating questions come from.&lt;br/&gt;
