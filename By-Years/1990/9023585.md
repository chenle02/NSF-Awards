This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at SUNY Albany acquire a 300 MHz spectrometer which will
be used in research investigations in the following areas of chemistry:
organosulfur chemistry, synthetic organofluorine chemistry, synthesis of
polynuclear antibiotics, clay catalysis of organic reactions, chemical diffusion
in polymeric materials and studies of the enzyme Endonuclease III. In each of
these areas knowledge of structure is essential for understanding the reactions
and properties of the materials. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy
is the most powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize
specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and
catalysis, and in biology.
