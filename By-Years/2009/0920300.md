The Affinity Research Group (ARG) model will be extended to a broader range of
students, particularly students from underrepresented groups. The ARG model
gives students the opportunities to use and integrate the scientific knowledge
and research skills with the requisites for collaborative work. Unlike models
that focus on a one-on-one mentor relationship, the ARG model creates an
integrated research environment in which diverse students and faculty contribute
to the research effort. It provides a framework and pedagogy that enable faculty
to create and sustain a cooperative environment that explicitly develops skills
to make students successful in research, academe, and the workforce. As a
result, students and faculty, particularly those from underrepresented groups,
can reach higher levels of productivity and achievement.
