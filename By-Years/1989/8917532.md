Funding is requested for the development of a biological image processing
facility. This facility will be used in support of research in behavior,
neurobiology, structural biology, biochemistry, and marine ecology.
Specifically, projects will investigate: the neuroethological analysis of
regeneration and behavioral recovery following spinal cord transaction in the
sea lamprey; community ecology of the rocky subtidal zone; vertical zonation of
suspension feeders, long-term effects of coral bleaching on the dynamics of
epifaunal reef communities in St. John, USVI; and ultrastructural studies of
sublethal stress effects in the softshell clam with diagnosed hematopetic
disease from Boston Harbor and New Bedford Harbor.
