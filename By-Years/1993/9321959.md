The PI has recently demonstrated that stretch and preferential diffusion can
have a significant effect on laminar burning velocities and consequently on
turbulent flame speeds in practical applications. This proposal is an extension
of this work and will include some measurements of laminar burning velocities
under low-gravity conditions in order to minimize the effects of buoyancy. The
PI proposes to use an outwardly-propagating spherical laminar flame technique
and a short drop tower (test time ~ 500 ms) to carry out these measurements.
Specific objectives will include: (1) New measurements of unstretched laminar
burning velocities and preferential-diffusion/stretch interactions (or Markstein
numbers), using various fuels, oxidant/diluent mixtures and pressures. (2)
Numerical simulation of both unstretched and stretched premixed flames including
detailed models of chemical kinetics and multicomponent diffusion. (3) Use of
these results to evaluate theoretical predictions, and to help diagnose the
mechanism of preferential-diffusion/stretch interactions and estimate flame
behavior under negative stretch conditions.
