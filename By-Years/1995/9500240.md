This award supports a study of paleobotanical material in Holocene peat from
northeastern Siberia. At present, there is little information about past
climatic and environmental conditions in this part of Russia. This work focuses
on samples from the lower Kolyma River terrace deposits, called Yedoma deposits,
which have been dissected by thermokarst activity and river erosion. The
deposits consist of mid to late Pleistocene silt layers capped in depressions by
Holocene peat. The goal is to test the utility of these deposits for yielding
proxy records of paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental conditions. If successful
this work will yield important information on the environmental history of a
climatically sensitive region of the Russian northeast. This work constitutes
the paleobotanical analyses of a field program funded by the National Geographic
Society. This work will include analysis of pollen and spores in addition to the
analysis of fungal and algal remains. This information will be a key component
in reconstructing the late Pleistocene and Holocene depositional and
environmental conditions of this region. In addition, this work has substantial
potential for expanding understanding of a coupled high-latitude vegetation-
landscape-climate system.
