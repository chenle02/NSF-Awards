Florida State University proposes to establish a new protocol whereby underway
meteorological and near-surface oceanographic data (and related metadata) are
transmitted from UNOLS RVs to the SAMOS data assembly center (DAC) at the
Florida State University. This new protocol would take advantage of the NSF
funded Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) pilot project
(http://www.rvdata.us/overview), which proposes to have all UNOLS vessels
transfer their underway data to a common shore side repository. The proposal, in
collaboration with the R2R project and the UNOLS vessel operators, would
identify a subset of routinely collected underway meteorological and near-
surface ocean data that could be transmitted from the vessels in near real-time
to a shore side repository. They envision that the transmitted data will have
temporal sampling resolution as near as possible to sampling rate of the
instruments on the vessel (ranging from 10 to 60 samples per minute depending
upon the instrument). The data will be packaged in a manner that best serves
near real-time user communities. Transmissions will utilize HiSeasNet, a
satellite communications network that provides continuous Internet connectivity
for RVs. The SAMOS DAC will subsequently extract data from the repository.
