Fundamental research directed toward improved understanding at the atomic level
of interatomic bonding, electronic states of surfaces/interfaces, and epitaxial
crystal growth will be conducted. The PI is a recognized expert in surface
science, and is employing a unique combination of surface science analytical
techniques, time-of-flight impact-collision ion-scattering spectrometry(TOF
ICISS), ballistic electron emission microscopy(BEEM), and scanning tunneling
microscopy(STM) to study the properties and behavior of metals(indium, tin, and
lead) deposited on silicon. This material combination was chosen for the study
because little or no metal diffuses into the substrate, the interface is sharp,
and the surface reconstructions which occur as a consequence of metal deposition
on the surface are well-ordered with small defect concentrations. %%% This
research is expected to provide deeper fundamental understanding of atomic
interactions and their relationship to epitaxial crystal growth. From an
application point of view, understanding these properties is helpful to
semiconductor device design and fabrication. The results will be of importance
in a general way to the technology of large scale, high speed integrated
electronic circuits.
