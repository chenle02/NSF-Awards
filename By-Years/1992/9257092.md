David Beratan is supported by an NSF Young Investigator Award in the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry Program to study electron transfer in complex
chemical systems. Beratan's research will be focused in two primary areas: 1)
studies of electronic interactions in proteins and nucleic acids as an approach
to the design of new electron transfer proteins; and 2) the rational design of
new materials with exotic optical and transport properties. Beratan will employ
computational approaches to rational molecular design which are based on
structure-function relationships. %%% Chemists are now attempting to design
optical, magnetic, and superconducting materials starting at the molecular
level. Much of this work involves the use of computer models which capture the
essential physics of the phenomenon of interest. The work which is being
performed by David Beratan will help to improve our understanding of these
physical phenomena, the physical models which simulate the desired molecular
behavior, and the application of these computational models to the design of new
materials.
