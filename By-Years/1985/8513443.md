The objective of this research is to characterize, manipulate and model the
immobilized enzymes used for a high loading analytical sensing application. The
main goal is to experimentally explore the relationship between phenomological
performance (activity, lifetime) and enzyme loading, distribution and lability
as observed with direct techniques in a slab geometry, membrane system.
Experiments will be performed with membrane-bound yeast alcohol dehydrogenase
(YADH) that consist of: (1) characterizing the distribution of labelled YADH
within the membrane, (2) examining the intrinsic lability of bound YADH with
differential scanning calorimetry, and (3) correlating these direct observations
with the activity and lifetime of membrane-bound YADH where substrate flux is
either convective or diffusive.
