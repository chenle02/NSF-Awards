The Archaeological Studies Program is part of the Sociology/Archaeology
Department. In 1993, the university completed an institutional strategic
planning process in order to emphasize the priorities and strengths of the
institution. Archaeological Studies was specifically singled out as a program of
exceptional strength and given high priority for resources. Unlike most
archaeology programs, which tend to focus on one type of archaeology, this
program is designed to be comprehensive and interdisciplinary. The curriculum
includes coursework in prehistoric archaeology, classical archaeology, human
osteology, geoarchaeology, historical archaeology, cultural anthropology, and
cultural resources management. All of this fields are integrated by the unifying
theme of cultural ecology. A minor in geoarchaeology is being added in 1997.
This program is actively involved in the preparation of new classroom teachers
Through the Archaeology Education Program. The Archaeology Education Program
actively involves the School of Education students in hands-on learning in the
science of archaeology and prepares them to incorporate this training into their
classrooms. Classes offered to teachers include "Archaeology for Teachers,"
"Archaeology Field School for Teachers," and "Laboratory Methods for Teachers."
The new laboratory facilities will enable this program to significantly improve
these courses. The staff members of the Archaeology Education program are
certified teachers, which allows them to help education majors incorporate
appropriate material into classes designed for students from the Kindergarten to
the 12th grade level. *
