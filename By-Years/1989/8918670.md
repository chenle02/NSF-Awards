The objective of this research is to identify protein-DNA and protein-protein
interactions that regulate the assembly of the prokaryotic transcriptional
initiation complex, and to gain and understanding of their roles in the control
of its activity. The functions of the E. coli RNA polymerase, lactose (lac)
repressor and cyclic AMP receptor protein (CAP) at the lactose promoter-operator
region will be investigated. The individual activities of these proteins within
this region have been the subjects of a significant amount of research, and are
well characterized. What is lacking at present is an understanding of how they
interact to regulate transcription. To address this crucial issue, studies will
be carried out to: 1. determine the effects of each protein on the lac promoter
binding affinities, stoichiometries and sites of interaction of each of the
others; 2. measure the effects of each protein on the association and
dissociation kinetics of each of others; 3. characterize the transcriptional
activity of each complex containing RNA polymerase in terms of: (a)
isomerization state- whether "open" or "closed"; (b) its abortive initiation
kinetics; (c) the ratio of abortive to productive initiation and (d) the ratio
of transcriptional initiation at each of the two overlapping lac promoters (P1
and P2). 4. determine the effects of extra-promoter regulatory sequences on the
composition, stability and activity of complexes of CAP, lac repressor and RNA
polymerase at the lac promoter in vitro and on the induction of transcription in
vivo. Because each protein has at least two high affinity binding sites within
the lac promoter, several different binding arrangements and transcriptional
activity states may exist for a given binding stoichiometry. For this reason,
specific aims 1 and 3 will be carried out in a concerted manner, allowing
correlation of the protein stoichiometry, binding site occupancy and
transcriptional activity of each complex. //
