*** 9725521 Goodman In response to the low representation of women in
engineering, federal funding agencies, professional societies, foundations,
corporations, industries, and universities have made significant investments in
Women in Engineering (WIE) programs. These undergraduate intervention programs
are designed to increase recruitment and retention of women in engineering.
Approximately 300 institutions have such programs, yet no systematic effort has
been made to evaluate he effectiveness of the programs as a class. While
programs are generally considered "successful," reports of impact are often
based on internal process evaluations with no controls. The study combines state
of art quantitative measures and qualitative case study approach. At each
institution three rounds of surveys will be conducted of all women majoring or
intending to major in engineering. ***
