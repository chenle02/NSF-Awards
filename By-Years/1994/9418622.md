This award is for support for a three year program to continue theoretical study
of the West Antarctic ice sheet, including the enhancement of a three-
dimensional time- dependent whole-ice sheet simulation program developed to help
understand the three dimensional interactions of ice streams B and C and their
boundaries. This work will improve on the basic model and will include those
features necessary to allow the simulation code to be generally useful to the
complete set of problems for which the physics is appropriate in both the
Antarctic and Arctic. The model studies proposed are a general mass balance
study of the West Antarctic ice sheet to get boundary para-meters fixed, then an
in-depth study of Ice Steams B and C to determine the magnitude of different
proposed mechanisms which govern their behavior.
