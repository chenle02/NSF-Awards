9413103 Crumpton This research addresses the problem of work place redesign to
accommodate the needs of disabled persons. The objective of the research is to
undertake a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of using a comprehensive
design methodology to redesign workplaces to accommodate the needs of the
physically challenged person. Should the results from the preliminary study show
some promise, a more detailed and comprehensive investigation will be
undertaken. The ultimate aim is to develop tools which can be used in the
workplaces that clearly recognize the needs of the disabled persons. The outcome
of the research has immediate applications. It can be used to design workplaces
that ensure efficiency and safety not just for the disabled but for the general
workforce. The results are also useful for developing solutions to implement
workplace, equipment and job changes. Through this type of research, workplace
data necessary to obtain better understanding of the needs of the physically
impaired persons at workplaces can be generated.
