At low temperatures and at high magnetic fields, electrons in quantum
semiconductor heterostructures exhibit a wide variety of interesting phases
(e.g., quantum Hall states), due to the combined effects of strong interactions,
reduced dimensionality, disorder, and quantum fluctuations. Measurements of the
electron spin magnetization and spin dynamics provide important insights into
these novel states. This project will directly measure these quantities, on
atomic length-scales, using optically pumped nuclear magnetic resonance (OPNMR)
spectroscopy. The OPNMR measurements will move in new directions to address
emerging questions, e.g., (1) what happens as skyrmions localize?, and (2) what
are the electron "stripe" and "bubble" phases? The undergraduate and graduate
students who carry out this research activity will receive training while
working with advanced instruments, such as a unique NMR magnet (supported by
NSF's MRI program). The proposed research is integrated into the PI's
educational activities, through teaching and
outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today's computers use electronic
circuits that process information using the electron's charge. As circuit
dimensions are rapidly approaching their smallest possible size, the development
of alternative technologies becomes even more important. One approach hopes to
make use of the intrinsic magnetism of electrons known as "spin", to build new
kinds of devices ("spintronics"), or even a powerful new class of computers
("quantum computers"). To reach these long-term goals, it is imperative to
develop local probes of electron spins located inside a semiconductor. This
research project will greatly extend the capabilities of one such probe, called
optically pumped nuclear magnetic resonance (OPNMR) spectroscopy. These
extensions will be driven by the pursuit of fundamental research into the
properties of novel phases of an interacting electron system, at low temperature
and in strong magnetic fields. The undergraduate and graduate students who carry
out this research will receive training while working with advanced instruments,
such &lt;br/&gt;as a unique NMR magnet (supported by NSF's MRI). The research
activity is integrated into the PI's educational activities, through teaching
and outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
