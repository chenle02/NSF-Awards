9307407 Harrison This award provides funding for the installation and testing of
a new prototype secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS) system recently
acquired by the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of
California, Los Angeles. The new SIMS instrument is designed to optimize
capabilities for isotopic analyses of the uranium-lead system with spatial
resolution on the order of ten micrometers for the purpose of dating very old
geological events. After the period of installation and testing the UCLA machine
will be operated as a national facility available to the U.S. geoscience
research community. ***
