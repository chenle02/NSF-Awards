Facial expressions play a significant role in our daily communication. However,
few accurate, robust and portable expression detection and analysis systems
currently exist. The project team has developed a system for real-time tracking
and analyzing of the facial features of humans in video. The system, composed of
software and a single camera can automatically analyze facial expressions,
detect eye blinks and track the head orientation of a human target under varying
conditions of illumination. With facial expression analysis, the barrier of
machine detection of human emotion, which has existed since the invention of the
earliest machines, could finally be lifted. This possibility allows the research
team to explore not only the social innovations, such as expression based rating
of media or sentiment of a social interaction, but the connection of human and
machine through non-verbal, indirect communication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
recognition of human facial expressions through an automated system has
extensive applications, such as; emotional reaction measurement, development of
a facially controlled human-computer interface and a multitude of opportunities
by releasing an individually configured input mapped facially controlled
software interface to the public. Some of the possibilities of facial expression
analysis could include enhanced search results based on the users approval,
automatic word definition triggered by a "confused" expression and general
and/or specific sentiment after the review of textual or video content. Through
the fatigue detection capabilities of our software, the transportation industry
can be made safer by the development of systems that can detect the alertness of
pilots, drivers and vehicle operators at large and pair them with devices to
alert them to their fatigued state.
