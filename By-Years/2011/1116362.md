The goal of this project is to develop new forms of programming that are more
intuitive and more flexible than traditional programming models. Our new
programming model is targeted towards low-level system's programming for systems
like databases and operating systems where performance and reliability
requirements make development particularly challenging. One of the components of
our new programming model is new set of graphical notations to allow programmers
to pictorially describe the behavior of their programs and automatically get
implementations from these high-level drawings. The new programming technologies
developed and released as part of this project could have a dramatic impact in
programmer productivity, particularly for low-level systems programming.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology we are developing relies on new algorithms
for constraint based program synthesis that allow the system to combine
different forms of input ranging from high-level graphical descriptions of
program behavior with more formal notations such as invariants and pre/post
conditions. The project will also explore new forms of interaction between the
software synthesis engine and the programmer, allowing for a more interactive
development model for complex algorithms. These new forms of interaction will be
analyzed and evaluated in terms of their impact on programmer productivity
through user studies and other forms of usability evaluation.
