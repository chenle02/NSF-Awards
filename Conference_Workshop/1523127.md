Since 2010, Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Georgia
State University have hosted 15 mini-conferences of the Atlanta Lecture Series
in Graph Theory and Combinatorics. This award provides support to continue this
series for the academic year 2015/2016, with two more conferences in Fall 2015
and Spring 2016. These will be held at Georgia Institute of Technology and
Georgia State University, respectively. Each conference will feature two one-
hour lectures by one distinguished researcher, four one-hour lectures by
established researchers mainly from the southeast region, and four 30-minute
talks by junior researchers and graduate students. The website is at
http://www.math.gsu.edu/~gchen/ALS17/ALS17.html.

Combinatorics and graph theory have undergone dramatic development in the past
few decades. For the previous 15 meetings, the featured speakers were leading
experts in the following areas of combinaroics and graph theory: structural
graph theory, extremal graph theory, random graphs and graph percolations,
hypergraphs and set theory, and the Szemeredi regularity lemma. The speaker pool
not only has a good gender balance but also consists of a nice blend of senior,
well-known researchers and young rising stars. The series has become a major
event for the combinatorics community in the southeast region and beyond,
providing opportunities to strengthen collaborations among researchers and
institutions within the southeast region of the United States. These two mini-
conferences will be a continuation of the series.
