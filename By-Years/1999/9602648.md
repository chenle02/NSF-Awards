This award will enable Seton Hall University to renovate chemistry facilities
for two research groups in the Department of Chemistry. The investigative teams
conduct a broad spectrum of chemical research from fundamental organic and
inorganic chemistry to applied research in biochemistry and materials sciences
in McNulty Hall, the site of the renovation project. Built in the early 1950's,
laboratories originally designed as undergraduate teaching laboratories, as well
as the other spaces in McNulty have never been renovated. Funds will be used to
create to modern research facilities by installing of new fume hoods and
laboratory benches, upgrading plumbing and electrical systems, and configuring
labs to comply with ADA regulations. Research personnel benefiting from the
renovations include two professors, 10 graduate students, five undergraduates
and one visiting professor. The results of the renovations will be improved
safety and working conditions of the research groups, allowing them to be more
productive and to enhance all aspects of their research effort. Renovated
facilities will provide better preparation and training for both undergraduate
and graduate students at Seton Hall.
