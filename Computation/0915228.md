Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) factorizes an input nonnegative matrix
into two nonnegative matrices of lower rank. It was recently discovered that NMF
has unique ability to solve challenging data mining and machine learning
problems. The advantage of NMF over existing unsupervised learning methods are
(1) NMF can model widely varying data distributions, (2) NMF performs both hard
and soft clustering simultaneously. (3) Many other data mining problems such as
semi-supervised clustering problems can be reformulated as NMF problem. Building
upon these foundations, the investigators propose to establish a NMF-based
comprehensive framework for data mining: (a) Provide deeper understanding of
NMF's clustering capability; (b) Extend data mining capability of NMF for
solving various data mining and machine learning problems; (c) Develop fast
numerical algorithms which incorporate the state-of-the-art developments from
numerical optimization for various matrix factorization models; (d) Develop
novel and rigorous proof strategies to prove the correctness and convergence
properties of the numerical algorithms; (e) Apply and evaluate these new
algorithms in real-world applications.

The proposed work creates a new paradigm of analyzing vast amount of data and
discovering new knowledge from the data by transforming established matrix
computational methodologies. This new technology can automatically group news
articles into meaningful categories, discover protein modules in protein
networks, extract weather patterns in climate data, segment pictures into
distinct objects, detect communities on the Web, and enable many other
scientific discoveries and new technologies creation. On a fundamental level,
the proposed work establishes that a simple matrix factorization in fact solves
challenging data mining problems. This research reinforces the importance of
mathematics in today's data centric world and encourages students to learn
mathematics.
