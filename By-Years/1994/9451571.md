9451571 Granger Chemistry students will be introduced to modern, state of the
art, chromatography instrumentation and techniques involving high pressure
liquid chromatography (HPLC). The major impact on the undergraduates will be in
the Intermediate and Advanced integrated laboratory courses directed by the
Chemistry department. These upper level courses are designed to present
laboratory techniques and methods as applied to realistic questions and
applications. As well, we plan to initiate exposure to the technique and the
instrument in at least one introductory (general) chemistry laboratory for
science and non-science majors. These underclassmen will be introduced to
chromatographic principles in lecture as well as lab. Juniors and Seniors will
be involved in using the system in mini-research projects at the end of the
Integrated and Advanced laboratory series and will also have the opportunity to
use the system in faculty directed undergraduate research programs. Applications
involve organic and biochemical systems as well as fundamental analytical
chemistry and techniques.
