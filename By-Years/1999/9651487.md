The particle-size distribution (PSD) of sediment reflects the energy of the
transporting medium (e.g., water or wind), depositional environment, degree of
chemical weathering, and provenance. Similarly, the concentration of carbon
(either total, organic, or inorganic) may reflect the balance between elastic
and biogenic inputs to a lake basin, provenance, dissolution of primary
carbonate, and eolian influx of carbonate dust to a soil. This project involves
purchase of a laser diffraction particle-size analyzer and a coulometry-based
carbon analyzer to enable the integration of quantitative sedimentology into
three areas of the geology curriculum: global change, surficial process and
physical sedimentology, and applied geology. This equipment is increasing the
significance and scale of independent research projects in these areas. Also,
the instrumentation enables undergraduates to measure PSD and carbon content
accurately, precisely, and rapidly with a minimum of laboratory experience. This
project is making it possible to further develop research-oriented, hands-on
laboratory components.
