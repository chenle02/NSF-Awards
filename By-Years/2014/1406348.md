High energy physicists believe that the Yang-Mills Equations model the behavior
of quarks. The Yang-Mills Equations turn out to have a remarkably rich
mathematical structure. These equations enable the study of models of space-time
inaccessible by other means and in addition give tools for the study of the
topological structure of DNA. The PI will continue his research on the Yang-
Mills equations and their connections to many different parts of mathematics,
the study of nonlinear partial differential equations, low dimensional topology,
algebraic geometry, representation theory and graph theory.

The PI with study Floer homology invariants for three manifolds and knotted
graphs in them. In particular with Peter Kronheimer, the PI is studying a family
of Floer homology theories built from connections with a prescribed singularity
along knotted graphs in three manifolds. Certain versions of these theories
appear to be related to Khovanov-Rozansky SL(N)-homology for foams and the
relations will be explored and elucidated. Other versions point to theories more
general than Khovanov-Rozansky homology. Yet another rather delicate version
appears to have bearing on questions of tri-colorability of spacial graphs, and
in particular appears likely to provide novel insight to the question of tri-
colorability of planar graphs.
