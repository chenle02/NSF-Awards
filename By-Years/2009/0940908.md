particles, droplets, and capsules

ABSTRACT

The objective of the proposed project is to significantly improve the
effectiveness of the boundary integral method by "hybridizing" it with a finite-
difference technique. The purpose is to be able to carry out numerical
simulations with many particles suspended in a fluid with the objective to study
flow characteristics of drops, capsules, and particles. The novel aspect of the
approach is to project the point force distribution on the boundary on an
underlying collocation points and solve for the flow field on this grid. The
method will be applied to suspensions, emulsions with and without surfactants,
capsules, and foams. The method is shown to be scalable on large parallel
processors.
