This research involves studying the environment and nature of the high
luminosity galaxies discovered by the IRAS satellite. One possible cause for the
large amounts of energy emitted may be that the galaxy has undergone an
interaction or a merger with another galaxy. If this is correct one would expect
to find that these active galaxies occur preferentially in galaxy clusters where
the space density of galaxies is larger and the probability of collision higher.
The surrounding environment of the galaxies will be studied using the Palomar
survey plates and CCD images acquired with the Mt. Lemmon telescope. The CCD
images themselves will provide a resource for study of the type of activity
present, which may be due to a huge excess of star formation, or to an active
nuclear region, or possibly to both. This project furthers VPW program
objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their
careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and
(2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing
greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,
government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the participation of women
in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific
vitality.
