Equipment and software to establish a VLSI computer-aided design laboratory to
support two-quarter senior design projects associated with upper-division
undergraduate elective courses in digital systems and electronics is provided.
Six computer workstations, software for design capture, analog and digital
simulation, and custom and semi-custom device physical design, a programmable
logic device programmer to create semi-custom digital devices, and a test
station to allow test procedures to be applied to custom and semi-custom digital
devices are included. This laboratory will allow undergraduate students to use
state-of-the- art computer-aided design procedures to apply their accumulated
knowledge in electronics and digital systems to the design of significant VLSI
circuits.
