Glycine Reductase (GR) The mechanism of action of GR will be investigated. GR
catalyzes: CH2NH3+COO- + Pi 2e CH3COOPO3= + NH4+ The reaction involves reductive
cleavage of the C-N bond, a very difficult reaction. Additionally, it leads to
the formation of a high energy bond. GR contains a seleno-cysteine residue. For
these reasons the mechanism of action is of interest. A Methionine Salvage
Pathway Throughout this pathway, 5'-S-methyl adenosine is converted to formate
and methionine. This pathway occurs in all living organisms. We have elucidated
some, but not all intermediates, of this pathway, and have characterized some of
the enzymes. We intend to characterized the remaining enzymes and intermediates.
The pathway in micro-organisms differs in one step from the mammalian pathway.
We plan to make use of this difference to selectively introduce compounds into
bacteria which will be metabolized to bacteriocidal compounds. Cystathionine
Sunthase (CS) CS, a pyridoxal-phosphate dependent enzyme, catalyzes the
replacement of the -OH group of serine by homocysteine. We propose that the
enzyme controls the course of the reaction by rotating the B-carbon between two
positions. Elimination occurs from one, but not from the other. Experiments will
be carried out to test this mechanism.
