This research project will improve the understanding of the physical mechanisms
and the spatio-temporal dynamics of laser filamentation in solids. Laser
filamentation is self-guidance of a high-power laser pulse propagating through a
gas, liquid or solid material when self-focusing of the pulse is balanced by
defocusing due to the laser-induced modifications in the material. This
remarkable phenomenon finds a lot of applications such as table-top ultraviolet
and x-ray generation, lightning guiding, rainmaking, selective radiotherapy on
cancer cells, long-lived waveguides in air, and remote sensing of pollutants.
This project will also promote basic science education to groups, such as
grandparent-led rural families, who have been traditionally underrepresented in
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laser filamentation is self-guidance of a high-
power laser pulse when self-focusing due to the optical Kerr effect is balanced
by defocusing due to material ionization and/or other nonlinear mechanisms.
Although laser filamentation has been studied mainly using near-infrared and
visible wavelengths, recent progress in ultrafast laser technology enables the
investigation of laser filamentation using longer wavelengths such as mid-
infrared and long-wavelength infrared. In this project, laser filamentation in
solids will be experimentally studied by measuring plasma densities directly
inside the filaments, with the experiments guided by 3-dimensional computer
simulations of laser matter interactions. The project will impact filament-based
technology such as new ultrabroadband and ultrashort light generation for
spectroscopy and optical communications.
