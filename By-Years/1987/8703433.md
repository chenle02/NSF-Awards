The area of research is set theory, in particular, large cardinals and forcing.
Set theory may be viewed as containing mathematics, that is, every theorem of
classical mathematics may be formulated as a statement about sets, and then
formally derived from the standard collection ZFC of axioms for set theory.
Beginning with the work of Godel (1936) and Cohen (1963), set theorists have
shown that certain problems, on which mathematicians have worked, are
independent, i.e. neither provable nor disprovable from ZFC. The first and most
well known example of this is the Godel-Cohen result that Cantor's continuum
hypothesis is independent. Some statements, independent of ZFC, are nevertheless
known to be provable when ZFC is augmented by axioms asserting the existence of
large infinite cardinal numbers. This project has two parts: firstly, to
continue the study of a class of very large cardinals, and secondly, to study
the consistency and independence of von Neumann's conjecture and a collection of
related problems. Such studies deepen our understanding of the limits of
mathematical proof.
