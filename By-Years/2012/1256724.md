River systems are becoming progressively recognized as significant components of
the global carbon cycle because they modulate and adjust the carbon dynamics not
only of their watersheds but also of their marine receiving waters. Their
primary role is as an immense source of outgassing of CO2 from inland waters to
the atmosphere. If this effect is important, then the global terrestrial CO2
sink may prove to be smaller than current estimations indicate. Unraveling the
processes that occur as water travels downstream and into the ocean is critical
to understanding the role of freshwater ecosystems in global C cycling, yet a
mechanistic understanding of these fluxes remains elusive. Recent advances in
technology allow exciting new work that has not been previously possible.
Riverine systems can now be effectively examined and understood through the
lenses of Net Ecosystem Exchange. The overall objective of this project is to
examine the processes that govern the movement and transitions of carbon through
the lower reach of the Amazon River, from Ã“bidos (the last traditional measuring
station on the Amazon), to the ocean. An ambitious field and laboratory study,
combining cutting edge geochemical and geospatial analyses, will explore the
influence of downstream processing on globally-relevant geochemical
fluxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research itself will promote significantly
greater understanding of the broader role of tropical rivers in the global
carbon cycle, with the potential to shift the paradigm of how the transport and
reaction of organic matter by rivers is viewed. A unique and extensive
partnership with the Brazilian science community, via support from the funding
agency FAPESP, will promote not only the science but significant capacity
building, of both US and Brazilian students. The project team will address
societal challenges in the region; as agriculture, fossil fuel exploration and
hydropower demands progressively stress the lower Amazon.
