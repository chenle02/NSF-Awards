This award supports theoretical research and education in the area of strongly
correlated electron systems. Research will focus on fundamental issues in two
areas: high temperature superconductivity and quantum magnetism. The work in the
former area has a more phenomenological bent includes the study of the why a
magnetic moment appears with the addition of a nonmagnetic impurity and various
issues related to transport properties in d-wave superconductors. Of particular
interest is the physical origin of the experimentally observed scaling relation
for the thermal hall conductivity and the appearance of a finite Nernst effect
above the superconducting transition temperature. The study of quantum magnetism
will emphasize understanding the role of quantum fluctuations. Of particular
interest is the study of the Capriotti state and the conditions under which a
spin liquid ground state might exist. %%% This award supports theoretical
research in condensed matter physics with a focus on the physics of electrons in
high temperature superconductors and other materials with strong electronic
correlations. The research involves the creation of fundamental new knowledge
and concepts in condensed matter theory that contribute to the formation of the
pillars that support future technologies. More specifically, research will use
the study of aspects of thermal and electronic transport properties in high
temperature superconductivity to illuminate the fundamental nature of the
strongly correlated state and that of the d-wave superconducting state that
arises below the superconducting transition. Theoretical work is needed both to
interpret experimental discoveries and to guide the search for new materials and
new phenomena. This award also supports advanced training at the frontiers of
condensed matter theory. ***
