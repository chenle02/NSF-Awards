This project will develop a sophomore-level lecture and laboratory course
emphasizing processing-structure-property relationships, along with important
concepts in surface science, scanning probe microscopy techniques,
nanotechnology, and nanoscience. The lecture portion will be reinforced in the
accompanying laboratory which will include a number of lab modules involving
scanning force microscopy, materials synthesis, nanolithography, computational
chemistry, self-assembly, microcontact printing and a final student-designed
group project. It is anticipated that upon completion of the proposed course,
students will understand and appreciate the importance and impact of
nanotechnology in both science and society. Through the development and
implementation of this course, Hamilton College will be one of a few liberal
arts institutions nationwide to integrate nanoscience into its mainstream
science curriculum. The course is being designed for ease in dissemination and
accessibility so other institutions can adapt the outline for their own
undergraduate programs.
