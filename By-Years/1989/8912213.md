Doctoral Dissertation Student, Robert S. Kiely; topic: "The Hidden Architect:
17th Century Notions of Structural Genesis in the Living World" Since the
quantum revolution of the 20th century, the foundations of the scientific view
of the universe is based on contingent theories of probability and chance. Such
a view of the world around us, however, would have puzzled and perhaps even
horrified natural philosophers who carried out the great scientific revolutions
of the 16th and 17th centuries. These "scientists," whose work established what
we know as modern science, shared a teleological view of natural objects. The
notion of form played a crucial role in explaining the generation of both living
and non- living structures in nature. Earlier studies have examined the changing
ideas of form in the mineral kingdom as the mechanical philosophy rose to
prominence in the 17th century. Mr. Kiely, for his dissertation research under
the direction of Professor Dobbs, is examining the corresponding views of the
period towards the living realms of nature. An intensive study of these views
promises to reveal 17th century attitudes towards the relationships between the
kingdoms of nature, as well as those between nature and its creator. This study
would also help to evaluate the impact of the mechanical philosophy upon ideas
of structure and generation in the living world, and illustrate how that
philosophy combined with traditional elements to produce important modern
concepts. Mr. Kiely's study requires careful examination of the published and
unpublished work of those 17th century natural philosophers concerned with
questions of life and structure: van Helmont, Gassendi, Boyle, Hooke, and Grew,
among others. For this purpose, Mr. Kiely will use this doctoral dissertation
research grant to travel to England to examine the unpublished documents in
archives there.
