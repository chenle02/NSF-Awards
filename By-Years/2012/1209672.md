This action funds Alexander James Smith of Northwestern University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Layer-by-layer stamping of solution-processed
organic solar cells," during the summer of 2012 at Academia Sinica in Taipei,
Taiwan. The host scientist is Chih-Wei Chu.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to improve the processing
conditions of organic photovoltaics through the use of layer-by-layer stamping
techniques that are compatible with high-throughput manufacturing processes.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
