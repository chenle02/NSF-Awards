Through the purchase of an inverted microscope, a water purification system, an
incubator, and a refrigerated centrifuge, a modern tissue culture facility will
be completed. This will improve the education of biology majors in several
different areas: 1. It will allow observation and measurement of effects of
environmental factors on tissue growth (Biochemical Techniques); 2. It will
permit investigations of nutritional and hormonal control of plant growth and
differentiation (General Botany and Plant Physiology); 3. Experiments in
bacterial genetics and molecular biology will be possible (Genetics and
Microbiology). The tissue culture facility will also be used by students in
research projects. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
