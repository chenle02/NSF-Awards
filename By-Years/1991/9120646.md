This award is for U.S. researchers participation in a comparative multinational
study of networking and high performance computing initiatives. The study is
being conducted under the aegis of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). This proposal is to support U.S. researchers in the initial
planning, design and early data collection phase of the project. Project members
from Europe and Japan will be supported by their national governments. This
project provides an excellent opportunity for the U.S. to learn about programs
of other nations that relate to our high performance computing and networking
activities. This knowledge can lead to future cooperation and also help us in
maintaining international competitiveness.
