Parallel processing is a new and fast growing field of computer science. It is a
comprehensive discipline, covering fundamental concepts and techniques of
parallel architecture, programming, and algorithms. The rapid development of
parallel processing in recent years has been incurring a significant impact on
college education. This project is a nine-day workshop on Parallel Processing:
Architecture and Programming, bringing together 35 college and university
faculty members from all over the country to learn the basic theory and practice
in this new field of Computer Science and discuss the issues of enhancing the
undergraduate curriculum by Parallel Processing. The workshop introduces the
participants to topics that can be used to enhance undergraduate courses in
computer organization, computer architecture, computer systems, parallel
processing, programming languages, concurrent programming, design and analysis
of algorithms, and theory of computation. The workshop emphasizes practical
programming activities in Applied Parallel Processing and Graphics Laboratory at
California State University-Fresno, the establishment of which has been
supported by NSF Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The
workshop offers six two-hour tutorial lectures by Lan Jin, Shigeko Seki, and Lan
Yang. Each lecture is followed by a one-hour discussion and three-hour
laboratory work. The lectures address fundamentals of parallel processing,
shared-variable and message- passing programming, parallel algorithms, and major
parallel architectures. Three panel discussions are organized on the topics such
as curriculum design and teaching methodologies, laboratory development, and
trends of development of parallel processing. The workshop pays great attention
to follow-up activities including an active electronic forum throughout the
academic year after the workshop.
