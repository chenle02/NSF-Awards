This project will investigate the role of stretched magnetic field lines as a
mechanism for the loss of relativistic electrons from the radiation belts.
Relativistic electron precipitation into the ionosphere can be divided into two
categories, brief microbursts lasting for less than a second and precipitation
bands lasting for more than a second. Microbursts have been extensively studied,
but the physics behind the precipitation bands have not received much attention.
This project will focus on the role that the stretching of magnetic field lines
has on the creation of the precipitation bands. A statistical database of
precipitation data from the SAMPEX satellite will be used. In order to examine
the effect of magnetic field line stretching, the Tsyganenko magnetic field
models will be used.
