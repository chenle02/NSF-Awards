Three general classes of problems will be investigated, as a guide to
programming language design and implementations: (1) typically in polymorphic
functional languages as well as in restricted versions of the second-order
-calculus, (2) comparing and calibrating the computational power of higher-order
programming features (polymorphic or not), and (3) transaction of higher-order
programming features into others (polymorphic or not). Principal topics include:
generalized type structures, especially polymorphism; automatic type
reconstruction and its relation to generalized forms of unification; decision
procedures, and evaluation strategies for imperative languages with higher-order
procedures.
