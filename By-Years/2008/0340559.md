This project is developing a new commercial undergraduate teaching laboratory
focused on the physics of tunable diode lasers and Fabry-Perot optical
resonators. Intellectual Merit: The lab includes hands-on experiments that
introduce students to several concepts in advanced optics, including the physics
of optical resonators, optical spectrum analyzers, laser frequency modulation
and demodulation, and control theory. As part of its development, the lab is
being packaged to be sold by TeachSpin to undergraduate physics and engineering
laboratories around the world. The broader impact of the proposed teaching
laboratory is to improve the training of students in the physics and technology
of modern optics, of the type that has become important in many areas of physics
and central to the telecommunications industry.
