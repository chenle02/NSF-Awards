Little is known about the process of long-term reconstruction after damaging
urban earthquakes. Large metropolitan earthquakes are scattered over time and
the globe in a way that makes assembly and sharing of experiences difficult.
Many U.S. metropolitan areas including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Salt Lake
City, Seattle, Charleston, Memphis and Boston face the prospect of a large
magnitude earthquake and the tasks of rebuilding. Many large cities throughout
the world are also subject to major earthquakes. Yet few planners, here or
abroad, are aware of the problems they may face or the resources available to
help before and after an earthquake. Through this project an international
symposium will be organized to discuss specific issues related to reconstruction
after urban earthquakes. Planners or other officials from cities around the
world who have planned for the rebuilding an earthquake- damaged city will be
invited to share experiences with planners from vulnerable U.S. cities and
selected government officials and researchers. The aim is to learn from others'
experiences how to seize opportunities and avoid pitfalls in planning for
rebuilding after large magnitude earthquakes. Foreign participants will have the
opportunity to learn first hand from each other. In addition they will have a
chance to learn informally what actions U.S. and foreign cities are taking to
reduce losses prior to an earthquake and prepare for rebuilding. A report
distilling the main points of the symposium will be prepared to share the
insights of symposium participants with a wider audience.
