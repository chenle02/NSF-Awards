The spatial patterns and properties of beaver ponds change abruptly during
population expansion, and there are scale- dependent pathways of pond
establishment and abandonment. Thus, ecosystem properties of beaver ponds are
not randomly distributed across the landscape nor do they change randomly
through time. This research project suggests the following hypothesis: Ecosystem
dynamics in valleys occupied by beaver are determined by 1) the geomorphology,
hydrologic regimes, and carbon and nutrient pools antecedent to pond
establishment, 2) changes in food supply in uplands as beaver forage, and 3)
changes in the hydrologic regimes and nutrient cycles during pond creation and
abandonment. The relative importance of each of theses factors changes during
beaver population cycles, resulting in multiple successional pathways and
multiple stable states across the landscape. This project will test this
hypothesis at landscape and ecosystem scales by: 1) analyses of spatial patterns
of ponds and adjacent riparian forests using a 65 year sequence of air photos,
geographic information systems, geostatistics, and percolation theory: 2)
manipulating nutrient availabilities in mixed species communities in the field
and manipulating nutrients, water, and litter in monoculture mesocosms; and 3)
constructing a scale- dependent model of the dynamics of boreal landscapes
influenced by beaver.
