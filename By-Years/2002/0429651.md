HRD 04-29651&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Steven F. Watkins is involved with programs at
Louisiana State University known to produce the largest number of African-
American doctorates in chemistry than any other university in the country. The
number of African American graduates increased from 3 to 11 over a ten-year
period and now is sustained annually at that level. The success achieved in
graduation rate is but one of several accomplishments of comparable quality in
which Dr. Steven F. Watkins has played an indispensable role. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The submitted nomination package is in support of a Presidential
Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring
(PAESMEM) to recognize outstanding mentoring efforts or programs that enhance
the participation of historically underrepresented groups in science,
mathematics, and engineering at K-12 grades through the graduate school
level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
