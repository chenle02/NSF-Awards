This grant has allowed the introduction of infrared spectroscopy into first
chemistry courses and expanded the use of IR in the organic courses. Students in
freshman chemistry laboratories will use the instrument to identify functional
groups and analyze unknown compounds. Student in the organic laboratories use
the instrument to collect and process data as well as to do spectral database
searching. These important functions are not currently available to the
students. *
