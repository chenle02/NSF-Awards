Turbo coding is the conventional name given to an exciting and relatively new
digital communication technique capable of approaching the theoretical limits
imposed by Shannon theory. The technique has enjoyed enormous recent attention
from coding theorists, but many practical, engineering-oriented issues remain
before these coding techniques will see widescale practical implementation. We
propose research in the areas of: (1) reduction of decoder latency and
complexity; (2) developing stream encoder and decoder architectures; (3)
efficient synchronization at low SNR; (4) improving performance of small-frame
turbo systems; (5) robustness to channel modeling error, either in estimation of
SNR or non-Gaussian noise; and (6) use of turbo codes on non-coherent or
differentially-coherent channels.
