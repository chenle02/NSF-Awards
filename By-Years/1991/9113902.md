Professor Saulson will initiate a program of research in experimental
gravitational physics concerning mechanical thermal noise. This effort is quite
timely, since the spectrum of thermal noise of the test mass pendulums will
likely be the limit of sensitivity of interferometric gravitational wave
detectors, such as the proposed LIGO. Saulson's research program will have three
main areas of emphasis. One will be a direct measurement of the thermal noise
power spectrum in a test system that is damped by internal losses. A second area
will be a set of tests of possible pendulum flexure materials. Finally, he will
check proposed suspension designs for LIGO to verify that they show the expected
low levels of losses. Applications to other gravitational experiments will also
be explored.
