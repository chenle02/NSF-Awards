9422561 Leng This project will investigate four pairs of nation-states which
have been engaged in recurring militarized crises in the Post WW II era: the
United States and the Soviet Union, India and Pakistan, Israel and Egypt, and
Israel and Syria. these rivalries account for eight of the eighteen wars that
occurred between 1945 and 1980, as well as three nuclear confrontations. The
investigation will attempt to discover whether significant changes in influence
strategies and tactics are employed from one crisis to the next. Event data from
the Behavioral Correlates of war project as well as attributes of participant
states, their relationship with rival states, and the structure of the
international system and regional subsystem will inform the study. It will
identify whether lessons are learned from preceding experiences with the same
adversary, and the conditions under which more or less effective crisis
management evolves. A better understanding of the "lessons" that policy makers
draw from experience may provide an important step toward more effective means
of managing future militarized crises. ***
