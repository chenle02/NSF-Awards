This project concerns research in the area of stochastic games, dealing with
both zero-sum and non-zero-sum games in finite and arbitrary state spaces. THe
value and Nash equilibria in both discounted and undiscounted payoffs are
considered. The following are the main problems of this project. 1. Find an
efficient algorithm to solve undiscounted switching control stochastic games for
value and optimal stationary strategies. 2. Find an efficient algorithm to solve
for Nash equilibria when the stochastic game is non-zero-sum and one player
controls the law of motion. 3. Find an efficient algorithm to solve for pure
optima; stationary strategies in games with perfect information or in games with
additive reward and additive transitions. 4. Are there optimal stationary
strategies for zero-sum stochastic games with additive transitions? 5. Do
switching control non- zero-sum games admit stationary Nash equilibria? 6. Do
they possess order field property? Do discounted stochastic games in arbitrary
state space and compact action spaces possess Nash equilibria in stationary
strategies when they belong to the special structured class such as ARAT, one
player control or switching control 8. Do undiscounted zero-sum games of the
above structured type possess value in stationary strategies when the state
space is arbitrary?
