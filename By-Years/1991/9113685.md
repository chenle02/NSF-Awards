This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropologist from
Southern Methodist University studying the use of pharmaceuticals in urban
Pakistan. The project will provide ethnographic information about people
purchasing and using pharmaceuticals. Using participant observation, and
structured as well as unstructured interviews with consumers and pharmacists the
project will study the marketing, distributing, interpretation and uses of
biomedical pharmaceuticals. The research will enhance our knowledge of the
medical belief system and the resultant treatment-seeking process which will
help researchers, health care providers, and policy makers to better understand
the basis for health care decisions and the use, and misuse, or pharmaceuticals.
This research is important because the "folk medicine" of pharmaceuticals is
very little studied, at the same time that the world's population is urbanizing
at a fast pace, and multinational corporations are providing pharmaceuticals all
over the world in retail outlets with no prescription control. Understand one
case study of urban pharmaceutical use will be valuable indicating areas of
potential concern as well as benefit.
