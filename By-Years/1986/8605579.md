The objective of this study is to establish the process engineering principles
of fine particle flotation in the swirl flow field of an air-sparged
hydrocyclone. The research involves measurements of two-phase fluid flow pattern
(and turbulence structure) using a laser-Doppler anemometer, study of bubble
formation and particle/bubble interactions using a high-speed motion analyzer
video system in conjuction with a fiber-optic system, and the phenomenological
modeling of the performance of the device. Plant tests will involve a study of
design alterations and scale-up relationships.
