This engineering education research award to Rowan University and Camden
Community College will employ researchers to develop virtual reality games to
improve students' reading comprehension and problem-solving abilities. The two-
dimensional virtual reality theme based game system will infuse engineering
literacy into lower division core electrical and computer engineering courses.
The games will be designed to demonstrate problem solving methodology, allow
collaboration, and track student performance. The games will simulate design
challenges, such as power grid simulations, in a broader more realistic context
than simple laboratory exercises, and this setting of technical concepts in a
context of social issues may increase interest in engineering and student
retention. Because this research addresses fundamental skills needed by all
engineering students in a game format that is comfortable for most students, it
has the potential to significantly improve student reading and problem solving
abilities and better prepare students for advanced study and engineering jobs.
