Four state colleges within the State of Nebraska (Kearney, Wayne, Chadron, and
Peru) will be linked to MIDnet and NSFnet. The connection will be at the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Funding will include equipment and line charges
for two years. This network builds an infrastructure in the State of Nebraska
for four-year, technical, and community colleges at both private and public
institutions. The libraries at these institutions will use this network to share
resources between campuses
