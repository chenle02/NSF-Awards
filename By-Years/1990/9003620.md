This project focuses on lessons that can be learned from the October 17, 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake. The study has two broad goals. First, using a variety of
methodological approaches, to determine the impacts (both real and perceived) of
the earthquake on low income, homeless and non-English speaking people. Second,
the study will examine the organizational responses of public agencies (relief
and social service agencies, city departments, etc.) whose task it is to serve
these clients. Data will be collected using random sampling and snowball
sampling techniques and will consist of semi-structured interviews with effected
persons and with staff of public agencies whose task it is to serve these
individuals.
