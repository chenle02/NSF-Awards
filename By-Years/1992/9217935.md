This theoretical research will concentrate on three areas: (i) the dynamics of
interfaces separating phases of matter; (ii) the kinetics of phase transitions;
and, (iii) polymer statistical mechanics. The work on interface dynamics and
pattern formation will involve examples from solidification as well as from
fluid mechanics, and will contain aspects of both conceptual, e.g., defect
dynamics in Hele-Shaw flow, and practical, e.g., materials fabrication, levels.
The kinetics of phase transitions work will involve, for example, studies of the
phase separation process under a variety of conditions, e.g., external driving
fields or shear flows. Aspects of this work may have eventual application to the
fabrication of polymer blends. The polymer statistical mechanics research will
involve fluctuations in inhomogeneous media and will bear on stabilizing
interfaces between different media. %%% The study of interfacial regions between
different phases of matter, water and ice, for instance, is one of the most
fundamental topics in condensed matter physics and one of the most practical in
materials science. Analytical and numerical techniques will be used to study the
evolution of interfaces and the kinetics of associated phase changes under a
variety of conditions. The research will have important consequences for
materials growth and fabrication, as well as basic physics.
