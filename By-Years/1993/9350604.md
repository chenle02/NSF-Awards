Ithaca College will purchase an FT-IR for use in all of its undergraduate
chemistry laboratory courses for science majors and its research programs.
Acquisition of this computer- controlled instrument with a wide spectral range,
excellent resolution and extensive data manipulation capabilities will enhance
the integrated laboratory program. The instrument will allow students to do
better structure determinations and obtain more and better data than is possible
with their present instruments. Biology, biochemistry and chemistry majors will
all benefit from the instrument. This spectrophotometer will also be used by
research students both during the semesters and in the summer. Some high school
students doing research in the summer are also expected to benefit. The
instrument also be networked to improve the teaching in many of the chemistry
lecture courses as well as in the discussion portions of the laboratory courses.
