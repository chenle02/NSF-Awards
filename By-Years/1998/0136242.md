Jeffrey Lucas&lt;br/&gt;University of Akron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigator will complete a pilot study that examines why men are more likely
than females to self-handicap. Individuals self-handicap when they select
actions that they are aware will inhibit future performances, usually with the
goal of deflecting attention away from one's personal abilities. Research on
self-handicapping consistently finds that men are more likely to self-handicap
than women across a variety of age groups and settings. Efforts at determining
the causes of this difference have met with limited success. There are two
potential explanations of the gender difference in self-handicapping. One
explanation comes from socialization theories. These theories indicate that
males are socialized to be more competitive than females. It may be that males
are more concerned with the evaluative outcomes of performances and that this
leads to more self- handicapping behaviors. Status processes also may partially
account for gender &lt;br/&gt;differences in self-handicapping. In US culture in
many situations, men tend to have higher status than women do. Theories of
status indicate that higher performances are expected from high status group
members. The investigator will conduct a controlled laboratory study to test
predictions derived from both socialization theories and status characteristics
theory. The PI will randomly assign male and female participants to high and low
status group positions and measure self- handicapping behavior across gender and
status. Pilot data from the study will be used to develop a larger, regular
proposal to the National Science Foundation. &lt;br/&gt;
