*** 9760265 Hollo This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is
aimed at development of in-process femtosecond energy diffusion sensing of
microscale thermal transfer to control thin film vapor deposition processes.
Recent advances in laser technology and the development of microscale heat
transfer models have made it possible to use ultrashort laser pulses to measure
the thermal conductivity, elastic modulus and thickness of thin films. Phase I
will investigate the feasibility and cost effectiveness of developing an
industrial version of a femtosecond energy diffusion sensor for in-process
measurement of critical material properties during vapor deposition of thin
films. Measurements will be made on thin films produced by chemical vapor
deposition, sputtering, electron beam evaporation and plasma deposition. Micro-
scale thermal transport models will be used to correlate the measurements to
material properties such as thermal conductivity, elastic modulus, defect
concentration, grain size and film composition.. Feedback control of vapor
deposition processes is critical to the cost-effective manufacture of advanced
thin film materials such as high-temperature superconductors, advanced
photovoltaic cells and thermal barrier coatings. An industrial version
femtosecond energy diffusion sensor has the capability to provide required in
process measurements for closed-loop of a wide variety of vapor deposition
processes. ***
