Professor Luther Erickson and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Grinnell College are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92, ten (10)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer actively engaged in
a variety of research projects. Projects range from molecular orbital
calculations on transition metal hydrides to investigation of the diffusion of
analytes in solid polymers. Students will be expected to write a project
proposal, carry out supervised experimental work, present a seminar on the
proposal and a second seminar on the results, and write a detailed final report.
