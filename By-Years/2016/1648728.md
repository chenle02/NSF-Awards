The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project are in various
applications in ecommerce, security, robotics, etc. This project's technology
enables computer systems and their users to better contextually understand
products and locate them. For example, in e-commerce, this technology enables
people to make informed decisions about product selection. This may enhance the
e-tail experience and help to eliminate wasted time as people can easily and
precisely find things they desire. The aggregated data on product searches can
be used by suppliers to better understand and plan for demand. Also, in
robotics, as another example, computer vision is an essential element of the
technology and the multi-object detection system built into software will enable
robots to be more effective as they will "understand" products or objects in the
context of our world. In security, this technology will enable better detection
of theft and threats. Overall, the technology has many applications - many that
can make lives more convenient and safer.

This I-Corps project is based on machine learning technology. Billions of data
points that include images and textual information about products are trained
into artificial neural networks. These neural networks understand products with
context with both images and natural language. Further, the neural networks are
able to self-learn with new information from the internet. This technology was
developed after researching various machine learning methods for large scale
objection detection and search. The result is that neural networks provide the
most scalable and efficient technology in terms of object detection. The
uniqueness of this system is that parts of the learning in the neural network
can be changed without affecting the rest of the network and the network can
self-learn from the internet about products and other choice-centric decisions.
