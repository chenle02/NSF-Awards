The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance new pressure sensors for
wearables. In car seats these sensors can help determine occupancy or measure
driver attentiveness. These sensors can also be used to enable a sense of touch
in robotic platforms, thereby improving automated decision-making processes. In
the virtual and augmented reality sector, this system can measure force and
pressure information to improve the training and learning outcomes across a
range of industries, including sport, medical and military training
applications. In the healthcare and wellness market, the proposed sensors would
provide biometric data on high speed motions and ground reaction forces, as well
as respiration and muscle fatigue information for improved outcomes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project focuses on advancing stretchable photonic sensors in the wearables
industry. These elastomeric sensors are lightguides that change power output
upon stretching, with the change in power output proportional to the amount of
strain applied. The power output from the sensors can be calibrated towards
biometric metric outputs such as high speed kinematics (joint angle velocities)
and muscle fatigue (volume changes due to inflammation). Due to the soft,
stretchable and thin nature of these lightguides, they can easily be integrated
into garments without affecting their mechanical properties, and thereby be
essentially unnoticeable to the wearer. Currently, these sensors can gather data
at rates two orders of magnitude faster than the closest competitive technology.
This project will focus on further increasing the data acquisition speeds and
hardware testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
