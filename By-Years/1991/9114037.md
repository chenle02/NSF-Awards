This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to study the
properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast
Water (NEW) Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order to gain
an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope processes. This element of the
NEW program will measure Tritium as a chemical tracer to determine how much
Atlantic water may be recycled in the region, how effective the gas exchange is
through the polynya surface, and how much ice forms during the freezing season.
Tritium- helium ages will provide corroborative data for biological studies
directed at determination of oxygen utilization rates, a major concern of the
program and therefore serve as important collaborative input to the NEW Program.
