Airborne viruses and microbes are a leading cause of illness and death
worldwide. They can lead to disease outbreaks and pandemics. Some pathogens pose
threats as bioterrorism agents. Current sensing technologies lack the
sensitivity, specificity, and ease of use required to make them effective. The
objective of this project is to create biosensors that can continuously monitor
the presence of a variety of airborne pathogens. The technology will take
advantage of the recognition and specificity that intact cells can exhibit
towards viral particles and pathogenic microbes. The safety, security, ethical
use, and societal impact of these newly developed technologies will also be
evaluated.

The objective is to develop a biosensing platform wherein target pathogens are
captured by bacterially produced engineered living materials. By spatially
patterning the bacteria, the resulting distribution of sensor materials can give
rise to unique patterns of pathogen binding. The resulting system is referred to
as a Nano-augmented Bio-hybrid LIving Sensor System (Nano-BLISS). Bacteria can
be designed to produce material that captures different viruses or microbes, so
the system is tunable. Performing multi-scale modeling will be required to place
the design of the system on a rational basis. Hardware design and development
will be guided by multiscale modeling that combines systems biology with data-
driven agent-based modeling to establish a functional linkage between
intracellular synthetic biology, extracellular engineered nanomaterials, and
emergent behaviors in the surrounding engineered living material. Designed
systems will be created and validated against different pathogens. Finally, the
biosecurity, biosafety, and ethics of integrated living biosensors in built
environments will be explored.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
