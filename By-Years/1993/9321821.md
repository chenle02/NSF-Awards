9321821 Fan This three-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative research in
adaptive signal processing between Hong Fan of the University of Cincinnati and
Erlendur Karlsson of Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. The objective of their
research is to develop and analyze adaptive filter algorithms based on the so-
called delta operator. This "operator" is used in the fields of control and
system identification. The delta operator or the difference operator has been
introduced to the field of automatic control. It has numerical advantages that
have been observed in its implementation. The researchers are proposing to apply
it to adaptive signal processing. The U.S. investigator brings to this
collaboration expertise in adaptive filtering. This is complemented by the
Swedish investigator's considerable expertise in automatic control. His research
group is renown for their excellence in this field. Their joint effort will
result in high performance adaptive filtering algorithms which are useful for
signal processing applications. ***
