This award will provide partial support for a standing Committee on Astronomy
and Astrophysics (CAA). As a joint committee of the National Research Council's
Space Studies Board and Board on Physics and Astronomy, the CAA will be the
primary source of advice at the National Research Council concerning astronomy
and astrophysics and will develop independent strategic advice to Federal
agencies, coordinating across agency boundaries. Support for this activity is
jointly shared with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
