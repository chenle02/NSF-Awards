9409730 Sands The principal objectives of the proposed research are i) to
understand the role of A1 additions in homogenizing the microstructure of MnBi
thin films and ii) to explore the application of nanoscale patterning of these
films to further improving film homogeneity through suppressing the formation of
a metastable low-temperature phase and reducing the effective grain size. These
objectives address the primary obstacles, media noise and stability, in
developing MnBi as a medium for ultra-high density magneto-optic recording at
blue laser wavelengths. This technology, if realized, could offer ubiquitous
access to low-cost removable and rewritable optical media for digital image and
video applications. More generally, the proposed research will contribute to
advances in the control of polycrystalline thin-film properties on the scale of
tens of nanometers through the application of nanoscale film patterning
techniques to fabricate "artificial polycrystallinity." Such control will be
essential to continued application of polycrystalline storage media for ultra-
high density(>1Gbit/in2) magnetic recording, nonvolatile ferroelectric memories,
rewritable optical storage and Gbit dynamic random access memories (DRAM)
utilizing high permittivity polycrystalline oxides for charge storage. ***
