This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of mass spectrometry. With the support of his previous NSF grant
(CHE-8406387), Professor McLafferty has developed a new technique,
neutralization- reionization mass spectrometry (NRMS), with which reactive
neutral gas phase species can be prepared and characterized. The goal of this
experimental program is to now exploit NRMS for the fundamental study of the
behavior of reactive positive and negative ions in neutralization and
reionization processes and to develop analytical mass spectrometric techniques
which utilize this novel approach to ion formation. The results of this research
should enhance our understanding of the behavior of energetic neutral molecules
which can be used in the production of new materials by plasma and beam
processing techniques and could give rise to the development of new
instrumentation for analytical mass spectrometry.
