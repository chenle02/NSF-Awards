This award supports the principal investigator's research on the connections
between Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, and Topology. The goal is to gain a better
understanding of the way that structures in algebraic geometry are reflected by
structures in topology, using a blend of algebraic and topological methods.
Several old conjectures will be attacked, and hopefully settled. In addition the
project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.

One part of the project is to find clean proofs of parts of the proof of the
recently-verified Bloch-Kato conjecture. A related part of the project involves
motivic homotopy theory; one goal is to understand how Voevodsky's slice
filtration is related to algebraic cobordism and other motivic spectra and to
verify several of the slice conjectures. The PI will also study the relationship
between the singularities of a variety, its K-theory and its cdh-cohomology,
using recently developed cohomological techniques. A final part of this project
is to show that the algebraic Witt group of varieties behaves well with respect
to polynomial and Laurent polynomial extensions.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
