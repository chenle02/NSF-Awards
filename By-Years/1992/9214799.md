This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program and the National
Instrumentation and Facilities Program of the Division of Materials Research
will help the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Arizona State
University acquire a console for a 400 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
spectrometer which will be used in the following research projects: structural
and dynamic studies of silicate glasses and solid electrolytes, the synthesis
and characterization of advanced ceramic materials, artificial photosynthesis
and solar energy conversion, mechanisms for the repair of photochemically
damaged DNA, the nature of macromolecular organic materials of extra-terrestrial
orgin, the role of NMR in computer-enhanced structure elucidation, and the
synthesis and complete structural determination of complex natural products and
transition metal complexes. %%% Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
the most powerful tool for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research.
