9411759 Hawkins During the devasting Northridge earthquake in January 1994,
unexpected damage occurred to many parking garages of various prestressed
construction types. Such damage revealed serious questions as to the design
adequacy in terms of gravity as well as lateral load-resistance of such
structures. Important engineering lessons could be learned from studying the
earthquake response or damage data collected from post-event field
investigations. The Principal investigator, with assistance provided by the
prestressed/precast concrete industry and trade association, conducted a
comprehensive field investigation and has collected a rather complete set of
relevant data/information pertaining to parking garage structures and their
damage. This project will enable an indepth study to be carried out to address
some of the critical issues as follows: (1) to determine reasons for observed
damages and identify common features, (2) to determine seismic risk to existing
garages and (3) to recommend necessary building code changes. This Small Grant
for Exploratory Research project is supported, due to the importance of the
anticipated learning, as a part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction
Program's Post- earthquake investigation activity. ***
