This is a travel grant that will provide support for students and young faculty
with no other means of travel support, and to a keynote speaker, to attend the
Symposium on Micro Structures, Sensors, and Actuators, to be held during the
1991 American Society of Mechanical Engineers Winter Annual Meeting at Atlanta,
Georgia, December 1-5, 1991. The funds will be distributed among mechanical and
electrical engineering students with priority on those students giving papers.
This activity will enable student participation in this important conference,
and it will provide a forum for cross disciplinary dialogues between the two
communities.
