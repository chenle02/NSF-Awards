The research concentrates on the theoretical behavior of ultra-cold atomic gases
in low-dimensional systems. Ultra-cold systems exhibit unusual behavior when
confined to 1D or 2D environments by external fields. The research will be
conducted using a combination of quantum defect theory, frame transformations
and accurate quantum calculations.
