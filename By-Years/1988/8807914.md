The hydrodynamic interaction between particles convected in a fluid will be
modeled numerically. Economic computer codes for prediction of many-particle
interactions are to be developed, using a combination of boundary element method
for the fluid and the rigid particle equations of motion. The shape of the
particles will be unrestricted. Validating experiments form a part of this
investigation.
