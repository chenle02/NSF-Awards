The focus of this research is the development of electrochemical processes for
the generation of reactive intermediates. Radical trapping, the use of
1,2-disilanes as synthons for 1,2-dications and 1,2 dications, the synthesis of
quinodimethanes and related neutral entities, the generation of 1,3-dipolar
species, the electrocatalytic oxidation of disilanes, and the use of
microemulsions as solvents for electrolysis will all be investigated. The
replacement of common solvents with microemulsions has the potential for
environmentally friendly synthesis. With this renewal award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Albert J. Fry
of the Department of Chemistry at Weslyan University. Professor fry will focus
his work on developing new synthetic applications based upon electrochemical
generation and trapping of a variety of reactive organic intermediates. Success
of the project could lead to conditions that replace conventional solvents in
industrial processes.
