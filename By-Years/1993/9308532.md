9308532 Haghi A theoretical framework is developed for constitutive equations
and failure criteria for a material whose properties are nonuniform, and are
characterized by distribution functions. Evolution equations are derived for the
distribution functions based on different models of how the body's parts
interact with one another, such as the equal strains (or Taylor) model, and
compared with full finite element calculations. A set of experiments will be
conducted on Lead specimens with precise arrangements of embedded spherical
voids, at high homologous temperatures typical of hot working operations. These
experiments will systematically examine the effect of the distribution of
porosity on ductile fracture. ***
