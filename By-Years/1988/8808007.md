Atmospheric ozone seems to be increasing in the troposphere (where it causes
air pollution and is directly toxic to plants), but decreasing in the
stratosphere (where it shields the Earth's surface from harmful solar
ultraviolet radiation). We have long recognized the critical role played by
ozone in the lower and middle atmosphere, but only recently have come to
understand some aspects of the cycles that control its formation and
destruction. This proposal deals with a series of experimental projects designed
to determine critical kinetic and photochemical parameters involving ozone
chemistry. The latter include the yield of electronically excited oxygen atoms
following 0.3 photolysis above 300 nm (of importance in the troposphere) and
below 250 nm (vital in the upper stratosphere). Reactivity of the highly labile
atomic product with H.20 and HCI will also be examined, with a view toward
elucidating the detailed mechanisms by which such reactions occur. Such studies
will be vital in developing a comprehensive understanding of photochemical
interferences in proposed detection schemes of atmospheric OH by laser.induced
fluorescence. Also planned are refinement of off.diagonal LIF techniques for
detection of OH and O.2, the latter including direct measurements of excited
state predissociation lifetimes (on a picosecond time scale|) critical to the
quantification of observed spectra. In addition, we shall continue our initial
efforts in which the techniques of molecular simulation on a supercomputer are
applied to the mechanistic examination of reactions not conveniently studied in
the laboratory. Together, these laboratory and computer experiments will support
the development of field techniques and mathematical models used to integrate
our understanding of ozone's behavior in the increasingly perturbed atmosphere.
