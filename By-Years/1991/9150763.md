There often exists a polarization of students in engineering programs. Changing
demographics have significantly increased the minority population, many of whom
are under-prepared to meet the rigorous demands of the engineering curriculum.
Simultaneously, engineering very often attracts exceptionally gifted students,
including minorities. This project develops a multi-faceted tutorial program for
developmental students in the freshman engineering graphics class. Peer tutors
act as mentors, academic advisors and mathematics tutors. The primary purpose of
the project is to increase retention of engineering students, both those who are
considered at-risk because of poor academic backgrounds and those who are honors
students.
