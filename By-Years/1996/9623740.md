*** 9623740 Pritsker This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project will build the Factory-in-the-Computer, abbreviated by F=>C, which
provides information to improve the management of a company's value-added chain.
F=>C will assist manufacturing managers in understanding of the performance
implications of manufacturing-related business process changes due to customer
pressures. Management needs, not technology innovation, will drive the design of
the F=>C. To accomplish this, the model of a generic manufacturing company,
developed in Phase I, will provide a classification of business data and
decision processes related to the software capabilities of the F=>C. The
classification system provides a means to identify business processes and to
build sample problems demonstrating how they will be resolved. At the conclusion
of Phase II, reference models will be available for describing applications of
the F=>C, templates for marketing and sales procedures related to the F=>C will
be available, and a prototype F=>C will have demonstrated how management needs
are met in manufacturing organizations with the new software tool. Manufacturing
industries are investing heavily in programs for improved manufacturing
practices. This commitment has created a software market estimated at $2.3
billion/year. The F=>C concept is expected to contribute significantly to this
market because it directly relates manufacturing change to changing financial
conditions of a company.
