DMS-9805495 David F. Shanno Interior Point Methods for Nonconvex Nonlinear
Programming Abstract: The research is concerned with studying logarithmic
barrier methods for nonconvex nonlinear programming. The problem studied is the
problem of minimizing a nonlinear objective function subject to nonlinear
inequality constraints. Topics to be studied include merit functions, trust
regions, and matrix modification methods for nonconvex problems. A topic of
extensive study will be higher order methods for solving the nonlinear system of
equations arising from the first order conditions for the problem, with
particular emphasis on extending Mehrotra's predictor-corrector method to
nonconvex problems. The general nonlinear programming problem, which has
equality contraints, bounds and ranges as well as inequality constraints will be
adapted so as to be solvable with the algorithms developed. Careful study will
be made of the problem of determining infeasiblility and unboundedness for
nonconvex nonlinear programs. Special algorithms will be developed for problems
where second derivatives are not available. All developed algorithms will be
coded and extensively tested. Nonlinear programming problems arise in a wide
variety of applications drawn from a broad spectrum of engineering and science
problems, statistics problems, economics problems, and logistics problems to
name a few of the many areas where such problems are common. For example,
drawing inference from data bases is a statistics problem that often requires
the minimization of a nonlinear likelihood function subject to parametric
constraints. This problem becomes particularly difficult when the dtabase is
very large. The proposed research will develop methods for these nonlinear
problems that are akin to the interior point methods that have proved so
efficient for very large scale linear problems. These methods are also highly
applicable to solving nonlinear partial differential equations with n onlinear
boundary conditions, which are used in everything from aircraft design to design
of structures such as bridges to estimating the reserves in an underground
groundwater or oil reserve, as a few examples of the myriad applications. Part
of the project will be to collect as broad a problem set of real applications as
possible to adapt the algorithms to be efficient for these problems, and to
demonstrate the use of the algoritms across the widest possible spectrum of
applications. In all cases, the the algorithms will be designed to solve very
large problems efficiently, as these methods are proving extremely efficient for
large problems on high performance computers.
