9405927 Romanowicz This research is a continuation of investigations of the 3-D
anelastic structure of the mantle using seismological data. The recent work with
mantle Rayleigh waves has resulted in a 3-D model of Q in the upper mantle,
which has demonstrated that there is hope to extract useful information on the
mantle's thermal structure, not redundant with elastic tomography results.
Features of interest of this model include correlation with cooling plate models
in the first 200 km of depth as well as two maxima in attenuation in the
transition zone, correlated with hotspot strength distribution. This research
will 1) investigate ways in which anelastic tomography results can be
incorporated as additional constraints in dynamical modeling of the earth's
mantle; 2) improve the resolution of the upper-mantle model by a) including new
data available with the rapid expansion of the IRIS/GSN network, b) adding
constraints form Love waves, c) taking into account effects of focusing
explicitly; and 3) investigate lateral variations of Q in the lower mantle,
using both body wave and normal mode data. ***
