CDA-9628591 Aiken, Robert Association for Computing Machinery Special Project:
U.S. Attendance at the 14th IFIP World Computer Congress This award provides
partial support for 20 representatives from the U.S. to attend the 14th IFIP
World Computer Congress, in Canberra, Australia, September 2-6, 1996. The
International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) is a multinational
federation of technical organizations concerned with information processing. The
Federation on Computing in the U.S. (FOCUS), a joint activity of the ACM and the
IEEE Computer Society, serves as the U.S. representative to IFIP and is
administering this project. The participants in the project are selected on a
competitive basis by a committee of reviewers, with emphasis given to young
researchers doing outstanding work and to applicants who have been accepted to
present papers or are otherwise significantly involved in the conference.
