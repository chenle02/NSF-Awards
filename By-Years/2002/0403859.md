The objective of this research is to manufacture boron nitride (BN) and boron
carbon nitride (BCN) nanostructures on a large scale in high yield and with high
monodispersity in size (diameter), composition, and alignment using a simple set
of experimental protocols. The goal is to generate large-scale quantities of BN
and BCN nanostructures by using traditional inorganic chemistry principles to
rationally develop appropriate synthetic strategies. The approach is to develop
(a) novel substrates to spatially constrain the reaction process and to induce
monodispersity; (b) novel, tunable catalysts; and (c) readily processable boron-
rich organometallic and polymer-derived precursors. Chemical vapor deposition
techniques using a two-stage furnace system will employed for the manufacturing
processes as these are appropriate for the rapid and high-throughput screening
of the proposed catalysts, substrates and precursors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research is of high societal benefit because of the importance of BN and BCN
nanostructures for the practical development of high-strength lightweight
materials, field emitters, photoluminescent devices, thermally stable
lubricants, and microwave and infrared-transparent materials. Moreover, these
materials possess industrially useful gas storage and catalytic capabilities.
Generated research results will be channeled into an existing graduate-level
surface science course, that already highlights cutting edge research from the
Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory scientists. Most
importantly, this project will inspire the creation of an interdisciplinary
joint Stony Brook - BNL Nanoscience Sunday, open to the general public, which
will involve not only leading nanoscale researchers but also graduate,
undergraduate, community college, and high-school participants from the local
community. &lt;br/&gt;
