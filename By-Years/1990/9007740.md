This award will support the publication of the proceedings of the Workshop on
Phi Factories and Related Physics Issues - UCLA; April 20-27, 1990. The Workshop
addresses the theory and experimental issues related to increased precision in
the test of the discrete symmetries of nature namely Charge Conjugation, Parity,
Time Reversal (CPT) and the product Charge Conjugation Parity (CP). A review of
the theoretical arguments for the CPT conservation and for the observed
phenomenology in the K meson system is treated. A detailed evaluation of the
various design approaches for a phi meson factory with sufficient intensity for
probing these symmetries of nature at very high precision is given.
