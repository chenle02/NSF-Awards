ABSTRACT CTS-9411656 MIT P.I.: Karen Gleason The Chemical Engineering Department
at MIT requests support to purchase off-the-shelf components to upgrade an
existing spectrometer with the capabilities to perform state-of-the-art nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR). In particular, support is requested for the purchase
of a dynamic angle spinning NMR probe, a pulse programmer for generating shaped
pulses, commercial software for setting-up NMR experiments and analyzing multi-
dimensional NMR experiments, an amplifier and filter for deuterium spectroscopy
and a superconducting magnet. This including: 1) Study of the anisotropy of
molecular organization induced by solventless process- ing of thin films of
poly(acrylate-co-acrylic acid)s and by fiber-spinning of high performance liquid
crystal aromatic polyesters. (Prof. Gregory C. Rutledge) 2) Elucidation of
deformation and toughening mechanisms in particle-modified nylon copolymers and
blends. (Prof. Robert E. Cohen) 3) Quantification of photosensitive salt
segregation within the polymeric matrices of chemically amplified resists.
(Prof. Karen K. Gleason) In addition, this equipment will support research on
electronic, optical, and biological solids which is currently active within our
department. These components will impart new advanced capabilities to and
enhance the user friendliness of the existing radiofrequency system of a
homebuilt spectrometer in order to create a productive multi-user instrument
dedicated to engineering research on polymeric materials and other
technologically significant solids.
