This project is for a detailed sedimentological, geochemical, and
micropaleontological study of piston cores from the continental margin of the
eastern USA. The results will include new stable isotopic data, census and
computerized shape analysis of benthic foraminifera, organic carbon analysis,
determination of C/N ratios on selected samples and accelerator carbon -14
dating from cores at continental slope and rise depths. The goal is to integrate
this new information into a paleoceanographic/sedimentologic model which
compares the dynamics of intermediate depth water masses along the western
boundary of the North Atlantic with the deep water basins of this ocean during
the late Quaternary. %%% An understanding of the paleoceanographic history of
the North Atlantic is important because oceanographic processes in this region
and climatic changes on the surrounding land masses have major effects world-
wide. Studies of paleoceanography shed light on paleoclimates. An understanding
of paleoclimates, their evolution and ties to the pale ocean can help us
understand present ocean-climate interactions.
