The existing research is extended to include logical-operational
characterizations of computational complexity, i.e., applicative calculi and
proof formalisms. Various applications in computing theory and programming
methodology also is explored. The PI introduced a new approach to proof
theoretic study of computational complexity, which was applied to feasible
complexity classes. That approach is exo-algebraic, i.e., referring to free
algebras within broader structures. While earlier work used second-order logic
to explicitly define free algebras, recent work shows that the exo-algebraic
approach can be easily applied also to first-order theories. That approach has
the advantages of being free of any initial functions, of permitting
foundational delineations of complexity classes, of allowing explicit reference
to all computable functions without extending the logic to partially-defined
terms, and of having particularly streamlined proof theory and model theory.
This work (1) applies exo-algebraic formalisms as above to obtain logic-based,
machine-independent classifications of computational complexity classes, thereby
relating computational complexity to fundamental parameters of logical
complexity; (2) uses these characterizations to obtain new relations between
computational complexity and foundations of programming, program verification,
type theory, and computational mathematics; and (3) applies the logic-based
characterizations to investigate computation complexity proper.
