This proposal is for studies in, "The Nonstationary Nanoworld: The Mechanical
and Optical Properties of Localized States in Molecules". The program calls for
investigations of the optical and mechanical properties of nonstationary states
in small molecules that exhibit both classical and quantum behavior. The states
will be created in the vibrational degree of freedom of a diatomic molecule
using ultrashort pulse laser technology and will be detected via the time- and
frequency-resolved spectrum of spontaneous emission. This will be used to
completely reconstruct the quantum state.
