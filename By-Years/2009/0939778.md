0939778&lt;br/&gt;Backman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes a new paradigm
where the presence of lung cancer is detected by analysis of readily accessible
histologically normal-appearing buccal cells that are readily obtained by a
check swab from the buccal mucosa. This idea is based on Dr. Backman's
development of partial wave spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy, which quantifies
statistical properties of nanoscale cell structure. Using PWS, he demonstrated
that an increase in the disorder of cell nanoarchitecture is one of the earliest
events in carcinogenesis, which precedes any known microscale alterations.
Importantly, it is not restricted to tumor cells but also present outside of
cancerous or precancerous lesions. In this project they propose to extend this
concept to lung cancer: Namely, PWS detection of field effect changes in buccal
cells that are associated with lung cancer.
