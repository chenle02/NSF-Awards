This NSF CAREER award supports the integration of scientific research and
education within the context of developing a deeper understanding of climate
processes. The research objective is to improve our understanding of large-scale
climate variability in the Southern Hemisphere in the context of the Southern
Hemisphere "annular oscillation" (AO), a robust feature of the atmosphere's
general circulation that accounts for a substantial amount of climate variance.
The education activities are the following: the development of new curriculum
and mentoring of graduate students. This research is important because the AO, a
natural mode of the atmosphere, has been shown to have a large influence on
weather and climate; however, the basic processes that control its development
and characteristics are poorly understood and controversial.
