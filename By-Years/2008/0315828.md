Advances in the development of materials having desired properties provide the
basis of future technologies. Many advances are dependent on synthesis and
careful characterization. This grant provides support for an X-ray powder
diffractometer for use in research at UCLA on the development of new materials
that address several areas of need including chemical control of nanostructured
inorganic materials; nitrides; antiferroelectric liquid crystals; and
mesostructured thin films. This new instrument will provide rapid data
collection capabilities important for dynamic studies of sample reactions as a
function of temperature. This new instrument provides for low angle
measurements, important for structure measurements, and simultaneous collection
of low and high angle X-ray scattering data. The research topics include the
synthesis of Zintl phases, the control of high temperature phase stability of
tetragonal zirconia, development of metathesis routes to nitrides by control of
pressure and/or temperature, the design of antiferromagnetic liquid crystals and
the design of mesostructured thin films. The new instrument will be used
primarily by the UCLA Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry crystallography
laboratory.

This work has potential benefits in the near and long term: potential to impact
fundamental technology related to the synthesis, assembly and characterization
of materials with future practical applications and, more immediately, through
the training of graduate and undergraduate students. The UCLA Department of
Chemistry and Biochemistry will place this instrument in a shared facility,
accessible to all graduate students in the department. This department has
eleven tenure track women faculty; also, UCLA is able to attract
underrepresented students from across the nation. In keeping with the
educational mission of the University, trained student technicians and faculty
operate the instruments in the X-ray laboratory.
