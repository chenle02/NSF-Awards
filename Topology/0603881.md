This project is aimed at studying the geometry of subgroups of the mapping
class group of a surface acting on the Teichmuller space and other related
spaces. The guiding principal is an analogy between this action and the action
of a Kleinian group on hyperbolic space. The primary topics studied by the PI
are convex cocompactness (characterizations and examples), generalized
combination theorems for Veech groups (geometric structure and ideal boundary
behavior), and translation lengths for pseudo-Anosov mapping classes acting on
Teichmuller space (especially its relation to minimal dilatation questions).
Various parts of this work involve ongoing joint projects with R. Kent, B. Farb,
and D. Margalit.

Homeomorphisms of a surface (which can be thought of as self-symmetries of the
surface in a very weak sense) and the mapping class group (which is the
collection of all such self-symmetries) are widely studied in mathematics. While
these objects are primarily of interest in low dimensional topology and
geometric group theory--two fields which have seen significant growth over the
last 20 to 30 years--they also arise in a variety of other areas including
complex analysis, algebraic geometry, and dynamics. For example, one of the most
intriguing spaces in mathematics is the space which classifies surfaces equipped
with a variety of geometric or algebraic structures (the so-called ``moduli
space of Riemann surfaces''). This space is encoded in the Teichmuller space and
the action of the mapping class group on it. The goal of this project is to
develop a better understanding of certain classes of subgroups of the mapping
class group through the geometry of their action on Teichmuller space.
