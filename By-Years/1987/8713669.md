The IR internal reflectance spectroscopy will be used to follow the adsorbed
species from aqueous solutions of surfactants and/or polymers. This novel
technique allows both kinetic and molecular/bonding-change information. This
basic information is important to tertiary oil recovery and polymer processing.
