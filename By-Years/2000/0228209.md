This award is to support a postdoctoral researcher to study polar mesospheric
clouds (PMC). The study will make use of a combination of satellite observations
and numerical models to study the global variation of PMC brightness and
occurrence frequency, and determine the dependence on transient mesospheric
dynamics. The satellite observations are from the Student Nitric Oxide Explorer
(SNOE) and the Thermosphere, Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics
(TIMED) spacecraft. The combined data sets will be used to establish the
connection between dynamical features seen in the SNOE observations and their
counterpart in temperature and water vapor measured by TIMED. The data will be
combined with an atmospheric climate model and a cloud microphysics model to
help clarify the dynamical processes that give rise to observed variability in
temperature and water vapor in the middle atmosphere.
