The 2nd ASTFE/IWHT Conference and Workshop on Fluid Flow and Heat Transfer is
the primary and most important international conference being organized by the
American Society of Thermal and Fluids Engineers (ASTFE). This is the second
conference being organized by the society, following the successful first
conference held in New York last year. This conference is rapidly becoming the
main conference in thermal transport and fluids, providing a new venue for
dissemination of top research in the thermal-fluids area.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference also provides a forum for the open
exchange of progress in the research, development, manufacturing and application
of thermal-fluids engineering. Last year the conference attracted researchers
and practitioners from all over the world, and from academia, industry, and
government and served as a conduit for knowledge dissemination and collaboration
among its participants. The conference also attempts to connect a diverse global
engineering community and already has support from the International Centre of
Heat and Mass Transfer (the premier international institution of the thermal
transport processes community), Begell House Publishing and from the UNLV.
