This award supports cooperation between US and Chinese investigators on a study
of political behavior in China, which is undergoing a rapid socio-economic
transformation. Using data already collected in China in 1990, combined with new
data scheduled to be acquired in the summer of 1993, the research team hopes to
explore issues of political participation in a non- democratic regime which is
in transition, and to develop a scientifically credible database from which to
test hypotheses about political culture which have been largely constructed from
study of liberal democracies. Political participation, defined in this study as
voluntary citizen activity directed at influencing government policies or
personnel, has largely been unexamined in countries such as China. This study
will provide a crucial building block in understanding any contemporary
political system. Additionally, the study should shed light on one of the
looming questions about the twentyfirst century, the prospects for political
change in the remaining communist power, the People's Republic of China. The
research will be conducted by U.S. researchers from the University of Iowa,
Columbia University, and Chinese researchers from People's University in
Beijing, China.
