central question in physiology, "what are the required levels of metabolic
enzymes for the optimal performance of muscles?" Paradoxically, most studies
suggest that muscles possess higher enzyme levels than is necessary for optimal
performance. Studying the relationship between the levels of these enzymes and
muscle performance requires an experimental system where muscles are required to
operate at extremes. Flying insects are an ideal system for studying high
performance exercise because they beat their wings, and consequently flex their
muscles, hundreds of times a second. It is not known, however, to what extent
altering the activities of the enzymes involved in energy production will impair
muscle metabolism and flight ability. To address this issue, fruit flies will be
genetically manipulated in order to reduce or increase the levels of critical
enzymes involved in the production of energy from sugars. The flight performance
of these flies will then be monitored with high speed video cameras. This
research may provide important insights into human disease because mutations of
these same enzymes are implicated in many metabolic disorders in humans. This
project will also afford graduate and undergraduate students with hands-on
training in genetics, biochemistry, and experimental design. &lt;br/&gt;
