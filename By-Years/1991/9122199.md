Correlated fermion dynamics are investigated theoretically on a partitioned
space/time lattice. The time evolution of the electronic wavefunctions of atoms
in electromagnetic fields are studied computationally using massively parallel
supercomputers. Initially the project will concentrate on exactly soluble model
systems in order to understand how to proceed beyond standard time-dependent
Hartree-Fock theory. The final phase of the research will use the knowledge and
tools developed in the model study to treat realistic many-electron atoms and
molecules.
