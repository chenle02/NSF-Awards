The broader impact/commercial potential of the I-Corps project is the
development of a prototype geodetic satellite-based gravity observational system
and the associated cloud-based computing tools for the rapid remote monitoring
of floods, droughts, and freshwater resources availability globally at basin
scales. The project is expected to enable efficient, dynamic, big data
quantifications of freshwater transport for a wide range of potential commercial
applications. The potential commercialization of this tool and the timely
availability of the associate data products could provide critical information
and impact on commercial applications including precision agriculture, disaster
planning and management, as well as general water resources management.

This I-Corps project will explore the commercialization of a cloud-based
satellite temporal gravity observation processing and visualization tool. This
is designed for rapid monitoring with up to daily temporal sampling for natural
or anthropogenic features. The project builds from prior developments improving
the temporal resolution of water storage change and potentially improving its
spatial resolution. Current commercially available tools for agricultural and
disaster/water resources management services are primarily based on passive
remote sensing imaging which are typically limited by cloud cover or are
prohibitively expensive for acquiring timely data sets. As Earth satellite
gravity mission data sets continue into the next decade, the data underpinning
this work is freely available and potentially updated in near real time.
