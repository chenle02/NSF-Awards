The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will demonstrate the promise of transforming proteins found in
agricultural waste into high-performance, cost-effective and environmentally
friendly cotton, silk and polyester-like fibers. Textile production negatively
impacts the environment and wastewater. Structural proteins found in
agricultural waste are a substitute to natural silk, cotton, and theoretically
polyester. The proposed project will advance a new, tough, cost-effective,
environmentally friendly, protein-based textile fiber. The proposed textile will
be both recyclable and biodegradable. Protein-based fibers will transform the
$981 B global textile industry and enable new use of billions of pounds of
agricultural waste. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will advance a
technology to maintain protein primary structure (backbone chemistry) for
synthetic textile development. The challenge is to simultaneously restore the
protein secondary and tertiary structure responsible for the excellent balance
of mechanical and aesthetic properties inherent in natural plant and animal
sourced fibers. The proposed process integrates protein molecular biology with
novel, ecologically sound fiber formation engineering. Advanced manufacturing
will be used to recreate fibers in a closed-loop process recycling chemicals and
water without harmful byproducts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
