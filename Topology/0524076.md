he first Arkansas-Oklahoma workshop in topology and geometry will be held at the
University of Arkansas May 18-20, 2005. The purpose of the conference is to
bring together researcher from the region as well as researcher whose work is
directly relevant to researchers in the area, in the fields of 3-manifolds
(hyperbolic 3-manifolds, Dehn surgery, Heegaard splittings, efficient
triangulations) and related subjects (2 and 3 dimensional hyperbolic geometry
and geometric group theory).

In more general terms, topology is the branch of mathematics that, much like
geometry, studies shapes. In recent years much progress has been made in
understanding 3 and 4 dimensional topology. Although topology ignores some of
the basic terms of geometry (such as length area or volume) much of recent
progress shows very deep connection between topology and geometry, especially
hyperbolic geometry. Our goal in this conference is bringing together people
from closely related (yet distinct) fields in order to update each other on
recent developments and establish future collaboration.
