9315331 Flemings This awards supports the participation of seven U.S. scientists
and engineers in a U.s.-Japan Seminar on Solidification Processing for the 21st
Century, scheduled for July 1994 in Lenox, MA. The seminar is co-organized by
Professor Merton Flemings, Department of Materials Science and Engineering,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Professor Itsuo Ohnaka, Department of
Materials Science and Processing, Osaka University. This is the fourth in a
series of U.S.-Japan seminars that have been held approximately every five years
since 1977. Discussions at the seminar will range from solidification
fundamentals to industrial practice. Fundamentals will include heat flow, mass
flow, interface kinetics, nucleation and growth, morphological development, and
fundamentals of structure-property relations. These relate in part to advanced
materials including superconducting oxides, fiber reinforced metals, and
intermetallic compounds. Process design and innovations, and process scale-up
for environmentally sound, competitive manufacturing will be a central topic.
Recent and developing processes including strip casting, electro-magnetic
casting, counter-gravity casting, and spray forming will be discussed. This
meeting is the fourth in a series of U.S.- Japan meetings in this field that
have been held approximately every five years since 1977. Because of recent
strong advances in both the United States and Japan, it is timely to hold
another seminar in this field, which is of critical importance to national
competitiveness. ***
