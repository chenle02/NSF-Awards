9512729 Aizenman It is common experience that physical structure found on one
scale, is a manifestation of collective modes of a much finer complex system
with many more degrees of freedom. Fluids which microscopically consist of
particles, Brownian motion, etc. Remarkably, often the physics of the coarser
scale is expressed through simple autonomous laws, and symmetries not found in
the finer description. The proposed research will analyze mathematically the
emergence of such "scaling limits", in the context of a number of models of
statistical mechanics, and field theory. Particular attention will be devoted to
the mathematical analysis of the large scale features seen in critical systems.
Another topic of study will concern the effects of quenched disorder, which
quite often modifies the characteristics of vibration modes, electrical
conduction properties, and the nature of phase transitions. The study aims at
reaching both physical understanding and mathematically satisfactory means of
analyzing significant phenomenon these fields. ***
