As slip accrues on a fault, stress concentrates at its ends, which must be
relieved by a lengthening of the fault. This project will focus on three aspects
of this process, the fault tip processes, the macroscopic fracture criterion
that describes it, and the resulting growth process and fault slip/length
scaling relations. Results are aimed at determining net geological effects but
have a clear impact on earthquake hazard analysis as well.
