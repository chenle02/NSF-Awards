Instrumentation will equip a laboratory for a new course in Physiological
Ecology, a course designed to bridge the gap between Physiology/Cell Biology and
Ecology/Organismal biology. The equipment will also permit the students to
obtain experience in computerized data acquisition. The purchase of an oxygen
analyzer, carbon dioxide analyzer, dew point hygrometer, and bomb calorimeter,
along with a computer and appropriate software, will allow the students to
perform experiments dealing with metabolic rate, evaporative water loss, and
body composition. The goal is to broaden the perspecitives of the undergraduate
majors, to make them more versatile biologists, and make them more competitive
for future employment or further training. The university will provide 50%
matching funds.
