9530873 Sinclair The goal of this research is to make predictions for the
relationship among the operating variables (pressure drop, gas, flux, and solid
flux) in solid transfer lines. These predictions will be generated from
fundamental hydrodynamic models comprising mass, momentum, and energy balances
for the two phases. Representation of fluid-fluid, particle-particle, and fluid-
particle interactions will be investigated in the model development, as well as
proper formulation of boundary conditions. Computer simulation of transient two-
dimensional gas-solids flow will be performed, and the model will be extensively
tested with a full range of available experimental data. The results from this
will lead to improved design and operation of pneumatic systems. This is
continuation of the research begun at Carnegie Mellon University. ***
