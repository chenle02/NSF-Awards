This seminar on "New Aspects of Molecular Photochemistry in Photoconversion" is
supported under the auspices of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative
Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Program. It will be held April 13-17, 1992 in
Tsukuba, Japan. The co-organizers are Professor Richard A. Caldwell of the
University of Texas at Dallas and Professor Katsumi Tokumaru of the University
of Tsukuba. The grant supports the participation of eleven scientists from the
United States, who will discuss new results and concepts in relevant theory,
dynamic measurements, and molecular reactivity. Specific topics to be discussed
include: (1) photo-induced bond cleavages, (2) potential energy surfaces in
photochemical reactions--experimental and theoretical approaches, (3) radical
pair and biradical/biradicaloid intermediates (singlets and triplets), (4)
theories of photochemical reactivity, and (5) photochemical electron transfer
processes and dynamic and molecular aspects.
