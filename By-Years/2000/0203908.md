EIA-0203908 Craig D. Chambers University of Washington Efficient, Adaptable
Software via Staged Compilation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common strategy for
supporting adaptable software is to use a just-in-time run-time compilation
model, as in Java. However, this approach sacrifices performance, since any run-
time optimizations must be quick and therefore simple to avoid slowing the
program, with excessive compilation overhead. To achieve high performance,
particularly for highly modular software, a whole-program static compiler can be
used. But this strategy sacrifices run-time extension and adaptability, and
forgoes the usual benefits of separate compilation as
well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is investigating a more flexible
approach, staged compilation, that strives to combine the high performance
advantages of static compilation with the flexibility advantages of dynamic
compilation. In the staged compilation model, each part of a program passes
through multiple compiler stages on its journey from source code to optimized
machine code, including stages at separate compilation time, library link time,
complete-program link time, and run-time&lt;br/&gt;
