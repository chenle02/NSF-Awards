The Chesapeake Bay Institute of Johns Hopkins University will acquire several
items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use
equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the
R/V RIDGLEY WARFIELD, a research vessel operated by the University. A
substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1989 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -Data storage devices and
other peripheral computer equipment for the ship's data logging and display
system, -Replacement oxygen and conductivity sensors, -Precision acoustic
pingers for determining position of an instrument package relative to the
surface or seafloor, and -Niskin bottles for collecting discrete seawater
samples at various depths in the water column, The instrumentation described
above will increase the capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored
research and engineering projects.
