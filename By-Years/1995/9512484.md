With partial support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Carol Harden and
her colleagues will purchase three sets of equipment: a Bartington MS2 magnetic
susceptibility system with IBM compatible software; a Trimble Navigation
Pathfinder Pro XL geographic position system; a Thermolyne F6020C muffle furnace
with automatic temperature control. All three instruments will aid the
researchers in their geographically- related projects which examine the
interaction between human behavior and environmental change. One focus of the
Geography Department at the University of Tennessee is the reconstruction of
environment through the use of lake cores. The pollen and other materials which
these contain permit researchers to reconstruct vegetation and aspects of
geomorphology at consecutive points in time and thus gain insight into change.
It is also possible, in some cases to determine the cause of this change and
integrate human behavior into the system. Magnetic susceptibility measurements
assist in the chronological correlation of different cores and thus serve,
indirectly, as a dating technique. Through controlled combustion of core
sediment it is possible to determine the amount of organic material present.
Finally a geographical positioning system will allow the researchers to position
cores and other geographic features accurately in space. Dr. Harden and her
colleagues are currently pursuing a number of research projects. Several involve
an ongoing effort to reconstruct Late Quaternary climate patterns in the
neotropics and to identify human impacts on vegetation. The work to date has
yielded new insights on the role of fire in high-altitude contexts and on the
timing and extent of human disturbance in lowland rainforest environments.
