9528570 Slattery This research project will utilize analytical chemical
techniques to evaluate the importance of secondary metabolites and steroids in
the reproduction of 3 species of soft corals from Guam. This project builds on
ongoing research which has identified and examined the importance of secondary
metabolites, organic extracts, and morphological defenses in soft coral predator
deterrence. This project will extract, isolate, and determine the structures of
new secondary metabolites in adult colonies and their eggs. Temporal changes in
concentrations of these compounds will be correlated with reproductive indices
to assess the role of the compounds in maturation and spawning. Standard
bioassays will be conducted to guide isolation of bioactive compounds and to
determine the importance of isolated natural products in egg release, sperm
chemotaxis, and feeding deterrence. Novel compounds identified in this project
will expand upon a growing database of metabolites that can be used as
chemotaxonomic markers and will be incorporated into existing pharmacological
programs. Additionally, this project will contribute significant in sights into
the reproductive biology and chemical ecology of the common soft corrals on the
shallow reefs surrounding Guam. ***
