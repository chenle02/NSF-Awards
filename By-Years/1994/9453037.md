9453037 McLean The Exploratorium will develop a hands-on, interactive, traveling
exhibit "Garden of Complexity: Self-Organization in Nature." "Using the metaphor
of a garden (a universally appreciated symbol of beauty and contemplation)" and
arguing "that the essence of science is to extract organized observations from
the complexity of nature," this exhibit will allow visitors to observe some of
the self-organizing systems in a quiet, contemplative environment. The exhibit
will be about pattern and how the natural world emerges into states that are
perceived as pattered or organized. Four sub-sets of this theme will be
explored; organization into patterns; surface effects - rubbing and flow;
rotation, circulation, vortices, and the granular state - a different state of
matter. Both existing and new artworks/activities will be used in this exhibit.
The new additions will be created by individuals in the Exploratorium's Artists-
in-Residence program. Their creations are both aesthetically and educationally
interesting. In addition, the exhibit developers will experiment with new
techniques in exhibit interpretation and they will develop activities that
provide linkages with formal education. The exhibit will be circulated by the
Association of Science and Technology Centers to nine sites over a three year
period. It is estimated that it will reach 2.5 million people.
