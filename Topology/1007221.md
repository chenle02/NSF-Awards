One central question left unanswered by Perelman's geometrization theorem is
exactly how the combinatorial features of a 3-manifold should relate to its
geometry. The principal investigators Futer and Purcell will study several
aspects of this question. The first goal of this project is to use the
combinatorial complexes associated a surface to give explicit estimates on the
geometry of a fibered hyperbolic 3-manifold. A second, closely related, goal is
to use braid presentations of a generic knot or link in order to give explicit,
diagrammatic estimates on the volume of its complement. Third, the PIs will
continue their joint project with Kalfagianni to relate the geometric topology
of knot and link complements to quantum invariants such as the colored Jones
polynomials. Finally, the investigators will continue their joint work with
Cooper to understand the geometric properties of unknotting tunnels.

A 3-manifold is a space where an object such as a helicopter can move around in
three distinct perpendicular directions. The universe that we inhabit is a
3-manifold whose global geometry we do not yet understand. Another rich source
of examples comes from the spaces that surround different knots. Powerful
theorems of Thurston, Perelman, and Mostow imply that almost every knot
complement, and more generally almost every 3-manifold, has a unique hyperbolic
metric. That is, there is a standard way to measure the space, so that every
2-dimensional cross-section curves like a saddle. At the moment, while we know
that this standard hyperbolic metric exists, very little is known about how to
relate it to easily computable quantities such as the complexity of a knot
diagram. The main goal of this project is to make these relations much more
concrete. One important feature of this project is that the geometric problems
studied by the PIs are very visual and hands-on, with natural spin-offs into
both software applications and projects for students.
