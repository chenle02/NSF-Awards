With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division,
Professor John Baldwin of Syracuse University will study the characteristics of
chemical reactions involving diradical intermediates or transition states. The
stereochemistry of the isomerizations of several small, strained ring compounds
will be determined using deuterium, or occasionally carbon-13, labels as
stereochemical markers. The small systems proposed for study allow for high
quality quantum mechanical computations of the appropriate hypersurfaces, which
in turn allows a uniquely detailed comparison between theory and experiment for
organic reactions. Understanding of the simplest, and the most straightforward
appearing, chemical reactions at a level of great detail is a way to understand
the very nature of chemical reactivity. This work provides the experimental
foundation for eventual quantum mechanical understanding of simple thermal
molecular rearrangements.
