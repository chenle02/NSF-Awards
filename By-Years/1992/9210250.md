The research to be performed on this RIA award will investigate, theoretically,
the influence of reinforcement cracking and interfacial debonding on composite
flow strength, creep resistance and fracture toughness. Rigorous finite element
analyses will be carried out to determine how the overall limit flow stress of a
damaged composite depends on the volume fraction and shape of the reinforcing
particles, the percentage of these particles which are damaged, and the
characteristics of the matrix material.
