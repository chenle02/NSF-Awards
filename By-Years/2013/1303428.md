The Southwest Local Algebra Meeting 2013 will take place at the University of
Arizona on March 2-3, 2013. This conference will facilitate interactions between
students and faculty---with interests in ring theory, broadly interpreted---from
institutions in the Southwest. Six speakers will deliver hour-long talks on
topics within their specialty; five speakers will be local to the Southwest
region, and one will be a prominent algebraist from outside the region. The
lectures will be accessible to graduate students. The meeting will also feature
three hour-long poster sessions in which the participating students will present
their research. (More information can be found at the conference webpage:
http://www.math.ttu.edu/~lchriste/slam2013.html.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study
of rings, in the broadest sense, is crucial to many branches of mathematics---
commutative and non-commutative geometry, group representations, number theory,
coding theory, and cryptography to name a few---and touches on even more---
combinatorics, homotopy theory, and statistics, for example. Algebraists in the
Southwest region pursue research on a variety of topics under the umbrella of
pure and applied ring theory. The geographical distances in the region are such
that interactions between people at different institutions rarely happen
spontaneously. The meeting will bring together students and faculty from a
variety of institutions for inspiring talks and ample time for scientific
interaction. One can expect that new collaborations and discoveries may result
from such a meeting. About 50 participants are expected: students, young and
senior faculty from Arizona, California, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and
neighboring states. The participation of students from underrepresented minority
groups, women, untenured faculty, and faculty at non-Ph.D. granting institutions
is particularly encouraged.
