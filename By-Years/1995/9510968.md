A large body of empirical evidence, including evidence from the Committee on
the Status of Women in the Economics Profession, has documented the increasing
proportion of economics Ph.D.s granted to women and the improved job placement
and starting salaries of female assistant ;professors. But, women's longer time
to tenure, lower probability of achieving tenure, relatively low publication
rates, and a stagnating percentage of women in the associate/full ranks and the
top-ranked departments has been documented thoroughly, with very little
explanation offered by empirical research. This project collects information
detailing the critical first seven years in the job market for a cohort of
economists, in order to develop a better explanation of the patterns that appear
later in the career cycle. Specifically, this project collects survey data for
the purpose of exploring gender differences in salary and employment outcomes
among Ph.D. economists. These new data will be merged with a data set
constructed by the investigator in 1988-89 to create a longitudinal data base of
approximately 300 Ph.D. economists who began their careers during Fall 1989.
Women are somewhat over represented in the sample and academia is the major
employment sector. The longitudinal nature of the data allows this project to _
examine current employment outcomes while controlling for an unusually complete
set of explanatory variables collected when participants were just finishing
graduate training A 1 and extensive characteristics collected from the new
survey instrument. A problem with much of the previous research is the lack of
adequate controls, a necessity for discerning whether observed differences
between men and women stem from discrimination or human capital choices on the
part of individuals.
