Abstract Goucher College - L. Bielawski Connection to NSFNET Proposal No.
NCR-9413200 Goucher College requests support from NSF for connection of their
campus networks to SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the
southeastern United States. It will provide operations management and
information services and it will give Goucher College a 56 thousand bits per
second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)
National Backbone network. Students and faculty research will benefit from the
link. By linking to the mid-level and national networks, Goucher College faculty
and academics will maintain a position of leadership in research and educational
innovation by profiting from remote access to super computer centers, data bases
and information services, high speed communications, file transfer and remote
login, and access to library resources. This is also a unique opportunity for
the school to explore innovative educational resources.
