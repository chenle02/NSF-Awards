This project will examine the physics of hot carrier induced degradation in an
alternative gate dielectric, a silicon oxide-nitride, currently being widely
considered. N-channel, silicon gate FETs incorporating various forms of the
oxide-nitride gate dielectric would be fabricated, stressed by hot carrier
injection, and the device parameters evaluated to assess not only the extent of
the charge generation and trapping, but also the nature and characteristics of
the charge generated. A modified form of substrate hot electron (SHE) injection
will be employed in device stressing, a form permitting independent control of
the oxide and accelerating electric fields as well as the injection current
level. Current-voltage and capacitance-voltage characteristics will be examined
to evaluate the type and quantity of charges generated as well as to evaluate
induced changes in device performance.
