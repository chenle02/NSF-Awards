Why do some species live in large groups while others interact only to
reproduce? This project investigates neural sources of variation in mammalian
social behavior, including pathways that support motivation to interact with
others and social tolerance. Most of what is known about the neurobiology of
social attachments comes from research on mothering and monogamy, while little
is known about non-reproductive relationships. The goal of this project is to
examine where and how the hormone oxytocin acts in the brain to influence social
behavior between peers. This is approached with behavioral, pharmacological, and
molecular genetic studies of meadow voles. Meadow voles display environmentally
induced variation in social behavior, acting aggressive and territorial in
summer months, but living in social groups in winter. These experiments will
investigate how seasonal changes in neurochemistry, particularly in oxytocin
circuitry, underlie changing anxiety, social tolerance, and social attachments.
This fills a gap in our understanding of social relationships by adding the
study of non-reproductive peer relationships, and contributes important basic
information on how oxytocin contributes to both prosocial and antisocial
behaviors in different brain regions. These findings will have implications for
understanding sociality across social species, particularly in mammals. These
studies will be conducted at a women's college, providing training opportunities
for undergraduate women, many from under-represented groups. Students will serve
in leadership roles and participate in all aspects of this research including
presentation and publication of work. Anatomical and genomic data from these
studies will be contributed to online repositories (Data Dryad and GenBank), and
custom software will be made available through the lab website
