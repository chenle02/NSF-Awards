AST 0134739&lt;br/&gt;University of Florida&lt;br/&gt;Jonathan
Williams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Williams is awarded funds to initiate a
research program in star formation at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
He will investigate the formation of stars in clusters by observing them at
millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths, taking advantage of newly available
telescope instrumentation. Although it is known that most stars form in
clusters, the physics of star formation in groups is poorly understood relative
to that of the formation of single stars. Dr. Williams will use observations at
continuum wavelengths to locate protostars inside their dusty nascent clouds,
and then use observations of molecular lines to investigate the dynamics and
chemistry of the surrounding gas. The concentration and motions of the
protostars will be used to estimate the relative age of a cluster, allowing Dr.
Williams to trace the evolution of the chemistry and motion of the stars and
surrounding gas as a function of time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Williams will
involve graduate and undergraduate students in his research, and serve as
liaison for a new international student exchange between the University of
Florida and the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias in Spain. He will also
participate in his university's Student Science Training Program by mentoring a
high school student each summer in a seven week program.&lt;br/&gt;
