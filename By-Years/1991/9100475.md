This award provides funds to establish an REU Site project at the Psychology
Department of Clark University. The program is designed to build upon and make
more effective a formal curriculum known as the Research Apprenticeship Program.
The training model features apprenticeship, hands-on teaching, where students
learn by actively participating in all phases of a research study-- from problem
formulation to data collection and analysis to presentation at a professional
meeting, manuscript preparation and publication. Students may work with one of
16 Faculty Associates, whose interests collectively address biological,
physiological and sociocultural aspects of behavior and represent the full
spectrum of university-level scholarship in psychology, from neuroanatomy to
literary analysis, from work with animals to studies of peoples in foreign
cultures. Specific features of the proposed project include (1) funding summer
research, (2) scheduling University Conferences and Summer Seminars to promote
collegial scientific discourse with and among students, (3) funding student
paper presentations at professional meetings and (4) extending opportunities for
research experiences to students outside the Clark community, particularly to
women, blacks, and Hispanics. These features support the principal goal of the
REU program, to promote careers in scientific research.
