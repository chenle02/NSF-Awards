A team from Auburn University and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is
developing a state-of-the-art curriculum in wireless engineering with a strong
hands-on experience. Using senior design projects and master projects, the
investigators are building a 4G wireless engineering sandbox (4G Sandbox)
inspired by a research testbed developed at Telcordia. Once built, the 4G
wireless sandbox will be a center piece of Auburn's unique undergraduate
wireless engineering degree program. Programming assignments and laboratory
projects will be developed on the sandbox. The 4G Sandbox is designed and built
by faculty members assisted by graduate and undergraduate students through
projects. The 4G Sandbox project involves faculty and students from two
departments at Auburn University - Computer Science and Software Engi-neering
(CSSE) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and one faculty member and
students in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineer-ing from the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The 4G Sandbox is a unique
infrastructure that will offer an integrated hands-on experience to our students
in the new wireless engineering program at Auburn. After graduating from the
wireless engineering program, a student will be familiar with 4G wire-less
telecommunications systems and will be able to create, design, and imple-ment
new features or applications on such systems. The investigators expect the 4G
Sandbox to become a model that will help many other educators in the nation to
implement meaningful and helpful laboratory exercises and projects related to
wireless engineering. This 4G Sandbox project will be disseminated through all
means appropriate to the degree of maturity and completion of the project:
education conference and journal papers, web site, and possibly a workshop. The
improved curriculum will produce a highly skilled workforce with a hands-on
experience. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
