This award is made to support an experimental research program in the dynamic
fracture of quasi-brittle materials. The strain rate response range to be
studies is intermediate to those of most existing facilities. A two phase
project is envisioned. The first will evaluate the applied pressure and the
second will involve a qualitative comparison between dynamic microscopic issues
revealed through the use of a new fast scan SEM and dynamic macroscopic issues
revealed through optical diagnostics.
