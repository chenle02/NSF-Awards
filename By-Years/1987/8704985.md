Researchers at NCSU plan to acquire a tightly-coupled multiprocessor system to
complement the 24-node loosely-coupled multiprocessor system, B-HIVE, currently
under development in their Computer Systems Laboratory. Much of the B-HIVE
software can be adopted to work with the tightly-coupled system thereby
providing a convenient mechanism for comparing and contrasting closely-coupled
and tightly-coupled multiprocessor systems. This dual system will provide an
experimental environment for the various research projects in parallel
processing being carried out at North Carolina State University. Research will
be performed on several projects, including: o Architectural Consideration,
Software Support and Compiler Issues in Multicomputer Implementation o Selection
Strategies for SIMD/MIMD Architectures and Performance Evaluation for Radar
Signal Processing Applications o Randomized Algorithms for Tightly Coupled
Multicomputer System o Testing and debugging of concurrent software o Computing
Stationary Probabilities of Markov Chains
