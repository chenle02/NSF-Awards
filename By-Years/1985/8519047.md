The overall objective of this research is to establish a processing science base
for the casting of steel strip by spray forming. This is a process in which
atomized molten steel droplets are interrupted in flight by impacting onto a
subtratge to form a coherent deposit. The research will initially investigate
the spray deposition of thin strip onto planer substrates. A series of
experiments and modeling studies will provide a fundamental understanding of the
spray forming on thin deposits. Subsequently, a large diameter rating substrate
will be used to examine the continuous casting of steel strip by spray forming.
Further, the research will focus on droplet-substrate interactions during the
spray forming of thin deposits having acceptable surface quality.
