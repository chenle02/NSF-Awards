The "Summer Research Experience in Computer Science" will involve ten students
in an intensive eight week research project. Three principal investigators will
supervise, direct and counsel these students. Care will be taken to insure that
minorities and women make up at least 50% of the research team and at least
eight are non-South Alabama students. The major focus of the projects will be
theoretical and applied utilization of supercomputers in the general field of
computer science. Dr. Larry Basenspiler has had prior experience directing an
NSF/REU project and will be the project administrator.
