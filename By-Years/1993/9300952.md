Eight undergraduate students from the Rocky Mountain and Southwest Regions of
the United States will participate in a ten-week, comprehensive research
experience at the University of New Mexico during the summer of 1993. In
accordance with his/her interests, each student will participate as a team
member in one of the following eight projects: 1) participate in the stress
testing and analysis of a steel interstate highway bridge; 2) learn about
various methods for measuring displacements and strains using laser
interferometry techniques; 3) acoustically test an existing bridge on the Rio
Grande River to locate hidden cracks; 4) construct small scale models of
hydraulic structures and test these models in an open channel flow facility; 5)
design foot pad systems for a universal lunar lander currently being designed by
NASA; 6) use the discrete element approach to study micromechanical interactions
between particles modeled as ellipsoids; 7) design a self- sustaining biosphere
to orbit the sun; and 8) develop practical new techniques for the remediation of
polluted ground water. Over half of the students will be selected this year from
applicants at institutions other than UNM, especially those without active
research programs. Women, minority and disabled applicants will be recruited.
The students will become familiar with their projects through early contact with
the research faculty. Each student can expect to learn to work independently
over the course of the summer. He/she will also present a final seminar on the
research, assist in writing a publication describing the work, and may travel to
a meeting to present the results.
