The project analyzes winds due to thunderstorms and large scale extratropical
storms separately to produce more reliable estimates of strong winds. The
present state- of-the-art methods for estimating design wind speeds in non-
hurricane regions of the United States do not distinguish between winds
originating from large scale extratropical pressure systems and the small but
intense thunderstorms occurring in the country. These two different
meteorological phenomena have separate statistical distributions and should not
be handled using a single distribution as is currently the case. The results of
separating wind data associated with each phenomena and studying each separately
will lead to a more statistically reliable estimates, and will provide insight
into the meteorology producing strong winds at different localities and its
application for structures design and safety.
