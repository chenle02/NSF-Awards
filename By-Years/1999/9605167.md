9605167 Schneider The Neural Basis of Cognition Undergraduate Research Summer
Program will annually train ten undergraduate students in an intensive ten-week
interdisciplinary study of cognitive neuroscience. The instruction and research
effort will train students to interpret human cognitive behavior in the language
of modern neuroscience. Through lectures and laboratory activity, students will
be exposed to the methods and results of multiple disciplines, including
neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, neuroimaging, neuropsychology, biophysics,
mathematics, and computational neuroscience. The program takes advantage of the
major joint initiatives of the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon
University in cognitive neuroscience, including the established research-
training program in Neural Processes in Cognition and the Center for the Neural
Basis of Cognition, as well as the basic-research facilities of the University
of Pittsburgh Medical School. The program involves academic lectures and lab
tours in the related scientific disciplines, lectures on career development and
ethics, research reading groups, extensive laboratory-research experience, and
social scientific interactions. The program encourages college students to
pursue graduate training and scientific careers in the emerging area of
cognitive and computational neuroscience. This unique program also provides a
national example of interdisciplinary training for cognitive neuroscience.
