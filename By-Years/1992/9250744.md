The Department of Chemistry is acquiring equipment which functions as a signal
processing module and is being used to teach students in upper level courses how
to interface computers to instruments found in the typical research or
industrial chemistry laboratory. The equipment includes a function generator,
spectrum analyzer, variable bandwidth preamplifier, lock-in amplifier, boxcar
integrator, and various pieces of software and small accessories. The purpose of
this project is to assure that graduating chemistry majors have hands-on
experience with and knowledge of the major means by which signals from various
chemistry lab experiments and apparatus are conditioned, amplified, and
interfaced to computers. The students also are learning how to use a computer to
drive external experiments and are being taught the operating principles behind
Fourier transform and equivalent digital signal processing techniques which are
now ubiquitous in modern chemistry labs. The skills which the students are
learning are being used in their undergraduate research projects.
