The long range goal of this research is to understand the regulation of
juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis by the corpora allata (CA) in insects. JH
Controls metamorphosis in immature insect and reproduction in adult insects. The
emphasis here will be on the molecular analysis of the neuropeptide,
allatotropin (Mas AT), an important stimulatory factor in the regulation of the
reproduction of JH in the tobacco horn worm. This research will enhance our
understanding of insect reproduction.
