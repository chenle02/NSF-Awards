Part of the science base required for development of machine systems is
knowledge and understanding of the phenomena which occur at the interface
between tool and workpiece. These phenomena are generally complex, and the
research required to understand them is difficult. Usually several technical
disciplines are involved, requiring a team of experts. This research is aimed at
understanding what happens in and near workpiece surfaces during the unit
operation of grinding. The approach entails both theory and experiment. The
theory requires use of mechanical, constitutive, and heat transfer equations,
for both surface and cyclindrical grinding. Phase transformations must be taken
into account. The finite element method will be used to calculate temperature
distributions and residual stress fields. The experiments will be performed on
304 stainless steel, 1040 carbon steel, 4340 alloy steel, and 52100 steel.
Measurements will be made of grinding forces, wheel speed, temperatures,
residual strains, microhardness, and volume fractions of transformed products.
Theoretical and experimental results will then be compared.
