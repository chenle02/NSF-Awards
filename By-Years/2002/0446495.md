Despite continued research activity aimed at understanding isoprene behavior,
oxidative pathways involving this critical and ubiquitous photochemical ozone
precursor remain rather poorly constrained mechanistically. This proposal
follows on from the Principal Investigator's previous work in laboratory and
theoretical investigations of the temperature- and pressure-dependant oxidation
rates and nitrate yields of isoprene and select alkene model systems under low-
and high- reactive oxidized nitrogen (NOx) conditions typical of the ambient
troposphere. Another aspect of this project will involve mining existing ambient
data sets from several past programs that acquired field measurements under NOx-
limited photochemical regimes and using a chemical coordinate analysis approach
to assess consistency and mechanistic accuracy in these previous findings.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this study will provide substantial new
insights into the mechanisms of climatically important alkene chemistry and
photochemical cycling, reconcile or at least constrain some current
uncertainties in how models treat these systems, and in doing so lead to a
better understanding of factors contributing to the formation and accumulation
of tropospheric ozone. The broader educational impacts of this work include
support for two graduate students who will gain professional research training
and experience under the mentorship of the PI. Summer undergraduate students
will also be involved in this research performing interpretive data analyses
through a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) activity.
