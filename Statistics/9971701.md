Yang, Song DMS-9971701 ABSTRACT

Multivariate failure time data are frequently encountered in scientific
investigations. Their analysis is much complicated by correlations among
components, censoring, and time-dependent covariates. This project initiates
some new approaches in the semiparametric regression analysis of multivariate
failure time data. Various univariate semiparametric regression models are
considered for the components of multivariate failure time data. They include
some familiar models, such as the Cox model, as well as some new models.
Inference procedures are proposed from diverse considerations, ranging from
pseudo likelihood to martingale residuals and estimating functions. The new
procedures are applicable to the currently two main modeling approaches: the
marginal and the frailty approaches. The proposed methods much enhance and
extend the existing results by considering various semiparametric marginal
models, by proposing several classes of general inference procedures, and by
eliminating the computational burden that is almost always associated with the
existing frailty methods. A key ingredient in the new approaches is the use of
some weighted empirical functions.

Applications of multivariate failure time data analysis may be found in
industrial life testing, clinical trials and genetic epidemiology, among others.
A machine component may break down repeatedly; a patient may experience failures
of several organs; phenotypic traits may be collected on human pedigrees that
consist of blood relatives and their spouses. Often, data of interest are not
observed completely due to the time frame of the study design or loss of follow-
up; also, risk factors, such as treatment indicators, may vary over time. Adding
to the complication are the correlations among observations taken from the same
patient or within the same pedigree. The new approaches deal with these
challenges and propose various modeling and analysis tools to the study of
multivariate failure time data. The emphasis is on developing statistical
procedures that are flexible, robust, simple to interpret and easy to implement,
while maintaining good efficiency properties.
