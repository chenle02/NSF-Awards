Emphasis of the research for this award will be on the dynamic modeling and
optimization of continuous cultures. On-line optical density and glucose
measurements will be used to develop steady-state mathematical models of
microbial growth. Subsequent step response and feedback identification
experiments are to be implemented in order to obtain a mathematical model that
best describes the dynamics of a continuous culture. Saccharomyces cerevisiae
grown anaerobically is to be used as a model organism. Adaptive optimization
algorithms are to be used with the above mathematical model to guide further
experimentation. The success of the algorithms in ensuring operation at an
optimal dilution rate is to be tested. Continuous cultures will be subjected to
dilution rate, temperature, pH and feed glucose concentration changes to see
whether the algorithm succeeds in optimizing the process. Optical density and
glucose concentration in the continuous culture are to be the measured
variables. Plasmid stability studies using periodic temperature variations in
shake flask and continuous cultures of E. coli are also to be carried out.
