It is intended to carry out several theoretical and observational studies
related to nonlinear MHD waves and Langmuir waves in the region of space
upstream to the Earth's bowshock. It is planned to compare the large amplitude
MHD waves, and in particular their steepened appearance, to the solutions of
nonlinear wave equations such as the Derivative Nonlinear Schrondinger Equation
(DNLS). Efforts will be made to append terms to the DNLS which describe
important physical effects such as resonant particle interactions, realistic
particle distribution functions, oblique propagation, and two and three
dimensionality. An extensive investigation, currently in progress, of the
various linear and nonlinear wave processes which are important in the upstream
MHD waves will be completed. Twenty periods of upstream wave activity have been
identified, the data acquired, and power spectra and cross correlation functions
calculated. New work will address the extent to which pondermotive
nonlinearities, the parametric decay instability, and three dimensional wave
effects can be discerned in the data. In the study of Langmuir waves, work will
concentrate on further numerical and analytic studies of the saturated phase of
the beam instability using computer simulations in part. The goal of these
studies will be to better understand such phenomena as wave backscattering,
generation of low frequency waves, and the long time evolution of the beam-
driven waves.
