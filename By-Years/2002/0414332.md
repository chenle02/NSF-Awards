0414332 Reckhow The technical objectives of the proposed project are to (1)
formulate a general plan for the development of a Collaborative Large-Scale
Engineering Analysis Network for Environmental Research and (2) to prepare a
detailed plan for the development of an Environmental Field Facility (EFF)
centered on the Blackstone River Watershed. &lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary
research team for the project will include environmental engineers, computer
scientists, modelers, and educators from three Colleges at UMass Amherst -
Engineering, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and Natural Resources and the
Environment - organized around three focus areas: the Blackstone Environmental
Field Facility, Network Design, and Education. &lt;br/&gt;
