Studies have demonstrated that 238U-206Pb isochrons derived from carbonate
rocks yield dates consistent with depositional ages despite evidence of
diagenesis in the host carbonates. The spread of observed isotope ratios in
carbonates is sufficient to give a potential age resolution of + 1 Ma for the
Paleozoic; however, studies to date have achieved 2o error limits of no better
than roughly + 10 Ma due to scatter about the isochron ('errorchron') beyond
what is attributable to analytical error. The aim of this study is to gain an
understanding of the causes of this scatter by studying U-Pb systematics in
pristine and near-pristine low- Mg calcite fossils from the Lower Jurassic and
in a number of well-preserved marine and diagenetic carbonate phases from the
Permian Reef Complex. The importance of diagenesis and possible trace phases (Fe
oxides, phosphate minerals, organic matter) will be assessed through the use of
microsampling methods, partial leaching and, as applicable, the monitoring of a
variety of isotopic and chemical tracers. A better understanding of the
processes that control l the initial variability of carbonate 238U/204Pb ratios
and that subsequently alter U-Pb isotopic systems will lead to more reliable and
precise carbonate 238U-206Pb and 207Pb-206Pb isochrons. The direct dating of
carbonates has immediate application to a number of problems in the earth
sciences, including the calibration of the Phanerozoic time scale, the dating
and correlation of Precambrian sediments, and the dating of diagenesis.
