*** 9505961 Steegmann This a planning meeting to develop a research protocol for
biocultural modeling of health and work output proposed by Dr. Theodore
Steegmann, SUNY at Buffalo and Professor Francisco Datar, the University of the
Philippines. The goal is to arrive at universal modes that fit a wide range of
natural and cultural environments. Specialists from the U.S., China, the
Philippines and Indonesia will participate in this meeting to pool their field
experience, research specialization and contrasting cultural perspectives to
arrive at broad, realistic structures. The meeting will be held Banaue, Luzon,
the Philippines on June 10-24, 1995. This is an important topic in cultural
anthropology. The results can affect adaptive theory and applications by
community planners. ***
