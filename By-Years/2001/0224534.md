Education Using Audioguides on Research in the Sciences

The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) will pilot the
development of an audioguide that will help to improve knowledge about and
accessibility to science learning for visitors currently underserved by programs
at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Mesa Laboratory. This
creative endeavor, entitled Education Using Audioguides on Research in the
Sciences (EARS), will be informed by experts on the hearing and vision- impaired
and low-income, native Spanish speakers. The goals of EARS are to engage and
inform thousands of visitors who cannot or choose not to take a staff-guided
tour at the Mesa Lab; improve accessibility to exhibits for visitors who have
low vision, blindness, or hearing loss; extend this educational experience to
the region's low-income immigrant population through the audioguide's
translation into Spanish; and enhance family learning about hands-on exhibits
and the science inquiry process. EARS will be developed under the experienced
leadership of staff in UCAR's Office of Education and Outreach, in consultation
with NCAR scientists and representatives of the Colorado Center for the Blind,
Self Help for the Hard of Hearing, and the Family Learning Center. A well-
recognized provider of audioguide technology and production has been selected to
create the new EARS communications resource.
