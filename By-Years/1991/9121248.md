Technical Narrative: This U.S.-Egypt collaborative research project involving
Northeastern University and Alexandria University is in the general area of
polymetallic chemistry. This collaborative effort relates to the metal exchange
of polynuclear materials. Project funding will enable Drs. Mohamed A. El-Sayad
and Ahmed El-Toukhy from Alexandria University, Egypt, to spend approximately
three months in the laboratory of Dr. Geoffrey Davies at Northeastern
University. Dr. Davies will visit and work at Alexandria University for a three
month period as well. The proposed new work will build on the past efforts of
the investigators including the creation of larger and more diverse multi-metal
molecules at lower cost, and the use of these molecules as sources of new metal
alloys and chemical catalysts to be used in still newer systems. Development of
the transmetalation phenomenon will lead to the establishment of new areas of
study in organic and organometallic chemistry. This project in polymetallic
chemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading experts in the United States and Egypt to combine complementary
talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence.
