This project will document the micro and macrofaunal content of the McMurdo Ice
Shelf. Holocene fossil material has been lifted from the seafloor at the
southern limits of McMurdo Sound and moved to the surface of the ice shelf
during ablation. Current investigations involve attempts to characterize
assemblages in different areas of the shelf in terms of bathymetry, substrate,
and degree of faunal degradation. This project will include systematic and
isotope studies in the laboratory. Although debris-rich ice shelves are rare in
Antarctica today, the degree of transport of material (including fossil
material) from the continental interior to the continental margin during the
Cenozoic implies McMurdo Ice Shelf-like bodies were quite common in the past.
The Holocene McMurdo Ice Shelf is the best available analog for these earlier
Cenozoic ice shelves.
