9720641 Martins The "comparative method" is used throughout biology to uncover
historical patterns across diverse groups of organisms. Today, it is widely
accepted that any statistical analysis of comparative or interspecific data
should be conducted in a phylogenetic context. Although several phylogenetic
comparative methods (PCMs) have been developed for conducting such analyses,
these methods suffer from a number of technical problems which make them
difficult to apply. In this project, Emilia Martins and colleagues will use
computer simulation and theoretical development to correct several of the
statistical difficulties involved in the application of PCMs. They will also
continue development of a package of computer programs, COMPARE, which will make
PCMs freely accessible to all biologists over the internet. The primary goal of
the education component of this project is to expose undergraduates to research.
This will be done by 1) further developing our summer program for minority
undergraduates in biology, 2) developing the use of the internet to allow
undergraduates in my courses to interact with researchers from other campuses,
and 3) expanding a course on phylogenetics to include a project in which the
students collect and analyze data and prepare the results for publication in a
scientific journal.
