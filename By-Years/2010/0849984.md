The Transfer Initiative for Engineering Scholars (TIES) provides scholarships
and support services for students transferring from two large minority serving
community colleges to engineering programs at the Georgia Institute of
Technology. This project builds on the success of several other student centered
programs funded by the National Science Foundation. Undergraduate students
transferring into engineering programs at the Georgia Institute of Technology
from community colleges receive scholarships of up to $10,000 per year to
overcome financial barriers of attendance. Engineering scholars receive faculty
and peer mentoring, access to specialized designated teaching assistants and
exposure to research laboratories and undergraduate research opportunities.
Approximately 90 scholarships will be provided during the life of this project.
