In the past decade, market design -- "economic engineering" -- has been central
to the design of public programs including procurement auctions and school
choice mechanisms. Market design's practical applications are made possible by a
growing theoretical and empirical understanding of how to design market-clearing
mechanisms that are robust, efficient, and fair. Many of market design's most
versatile tools are based on the theory of "matching," which provides algorithms
for identifying market outcomes that are resistant to deviations by small groups
of market participants. However, the effectiveness of matching market design
depends crucially upon the structure of market participants' preferences.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many settings, stable matching is only possible when
market participants' preferences satisfy a "substitutability" condition that
rules out complementarities across contracts. The proposed research will develop
the theory and practical algorithms needed to expand matching mechanisms to
allow structured forms of preference complementarity. Additionally, the proposed
investigation will give insight into how the choice of market mechanism affects
the pre-market investments that determine individuals' preferences and
abilities. For example, the work will determine which mechanisms incentivize
individuals to make efficient human capital investments before entering the
labor market. The proposed projects will provide conceptual guidance as to which
real-world markets can be effectively targeted by market design techniques.
Specific applications include the matching of cadets to their branches of
military service, allocation of municipal resources, and the design of policy to
encourage innovation and entrepreneurship.
