Atmospheric trace chemicals interact with cloud and surface ice in complicated
and ill-defined ways. With the recognition that future efforts to model the
atmosphere-earth system will rely increasingly on basic knowledge about such
interactions, a series of laboratory experiments is to be carried out under this
research project. The sorption and chemical reactivity of several trace gases
(SO2, H2O2, O3, HNO3, HCl, CH4, and NO) on ice will be investigated with gas
chromatography frontal analysis over a broad range of temperatures (about -90oC
to -20C). The kinetic and thermodynamic data will elucidate the molecular- scale
mechanisms of incorporation and reaction and help to identify the factors
controlling the reactivity of atmospheric trace gases that come in contact with
ice. Other experimentation will be performed with a recently developed
continuous-flow cloud chamber in order to measure the ability of ice growing in
supercooled clouds to acquire particulate matter and retain volatile gases.
Simple cloud models will be used to ensure that the findings of the laboratory
experimentation are relevant to microphysical and chemical phenomena in
atmospheric clouds.
