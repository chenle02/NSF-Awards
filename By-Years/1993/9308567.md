Sequencing by Hybridization (SBH) is a challenging alternative to the classical
DNA sequencing methods. Remarkable growth of interest in SBH has already led to
building the first sequencing chip, reading the first 100 bp by SBH and
developing a photolithographic technique for building high-capacity sequencing
chips. Some unsolved computer science problems seriously slow down the
development of biochemical and instrumentation aspects of SBH. In close
collaboration with biology and instrumentation SBH groups, the following
computer science problems have been identified and are addressed by this
project: (a) algorithms for sequence reconstruction by optimized chips, (b)
algorithms to optimally choose additional biochemical experiments for SBH, (c)
algorithms to eliminate ``blind'' choice of PCR primers by SBH data and reduce
the amount of conventional sequencing in molecular evolution studies, and (d)
algorithms to combine small-scale SBH and primer walking DNA sequencing and to
parallelize ordered sequencing strategies.
