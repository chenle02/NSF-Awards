9320899 Arrighi This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral
Dissertation Research program. It is a study of the penetration of Japanese
business networks into Indonesia and Malaysia since 1980. The student will
travel to these two countries and collect systematic data on a wide range of
local firms which have received Japanese investment or are involved in other
forms of networking connections to Japanese companies. Through quantitative
analysis of the data collected, the changing pattern of Japanese business
penetration into Indonesia and Malaysia and the impact of such penetration on
the economies of those two countries will be examined. The sources of industrial
competitiveness is a central issue of great practical as well as theoretical
importance. Previous work has suggested that innovative forms of Japanese
economic penetration of other countries which involve networking and
subcontracting, rather than vertical integration, have contributed to Japanese
economic success. Through studying concrete examples of how Japanese economic
penetration is occurring in two of the most dynamic economies of the world, this
project should shed light on such claims. In addition to the scientific gains to
be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly
promising student in completing research for the Ph. D. dissertation. Thus it
contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough
training of the next generation of social scientists. ***
