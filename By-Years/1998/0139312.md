Project STEP, involves graduate and undergraduate Fellows, secondary science and
mathematics teachers, University of Cincinnati faculty and a graphics/web
developer, working in teams to design, develop, and implement hands-on
activities and technology-driven inquiry-based projects which relate to the
students' community issues, as vehicles to teach science and math skills.
Activities will be incorporated into lessons, demonstrations, laboratory
exercises, individual and group projects, and field experiences to enable middle
and high school students to directly experience authentic learning practices
that requires them to use higher-order thinking skills; encourage creative
problem-solving skills that require collaborative learning, teamwork, writing,
and presentation; cultivate an interest in service learning in which students
are active participants, achieve outcomes that show a perceptible impact, and
engage in evaluative reflection; and better motivate and prepare secondary
school students for advanced education. The Fellows will be trained to create
and implement these activities by taking an educational methods course, an
advanced course in instructional technology, and by serving as teaching
assistants and tutors in guiding summer academies for middle and high school
students. Quantitative formative and summative evaluation will be conducted to
assess the project's effectiveness on Fellows' teaching skills, its impact on
middle and high school science and mathematics education, and to continually
improve the program as it develops. This project is receiving partial support
from the Directorate for Engineering.
