Abstract Program for Appropriate Technology in Health - Doug Palm Connection to
NSFNET Proposal No. NCR-9417627 The Program for Appropriate Technology in Health
(PATH) proposes to connect the local area network in its headquarters in
Seattle, Washington to the NSFNET via a 56 thousands bits per second router
connection to NorthWestNet. PATH also proposes acquiring dial-in access to the
NSFNET for its Washington, DC office. Connection to the NSFNET will provide PATH
staff with important information resources which can be used to enhance program
activities, product development, proposal development, and grant administration.
Program staff will also be able to use the NSFNET for communications an file
sharing between PATH offices, with funders, international agencies, U.S.
government offices, and collaborators in North America,. Asia, Africa., Latin
America, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. This Internet connection
will enable researchers, librarians, staff and students to collaborate with
colleagues at other Internet sites. Patient care questions, diagnosis inquires
and treatment plans can be electronically discussed and collaborative research
can be accomplished more readily with an Internet connection.
