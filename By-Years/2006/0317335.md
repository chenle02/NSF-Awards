A grant has been awarded to Ohio State University to build a computer program
that will allow researchers to find matches or matching areas in genetic
sequences even when those matches are very weak. The degree of matching and the
specifics of that matching among protein sequences of different organisms is
central to understanding evolution and fundamental biological processes common
to all organisms. As the databases of sequence data become larger and questions
become more far reaching, the need for smarter search and matching algorithms
becomes crucial. In this project, the PI's will develop a highly sensitive
search algorithm for identifying homologies even in cases in which the actual
homologies are very weak. The algorithm proposed makes much better use than
current algorithms of the calculated statistical costs of insertions and
deletions as they vary across the sequence. The first implementation is proposed
as a redesign of PSI-BLAST but it amounts to a complete replacement of the core
algorithm of that popular protein sequence search algorithm. There will also be
significant changes in the peripheral functions as well. This is a new tool that
will have impacts on research involving matching algorithms in general as well
as within the genomics/proteomics community. &lt;br/&gt;
