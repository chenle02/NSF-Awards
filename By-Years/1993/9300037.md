In 1993 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will operate the Deep Submergence
Vessel ALVIN. the submersible is certified for depth of 4,000M and is designated
a national asset. The ALVIN is supported by the research vessel ATLANTIS II
(AII). Both vehicles have been operated effectively and safely by the institute
for a wide variety of NSF-Sponsored research projects. Through a Memorandum of
Agreement the submersible is operated in support of projects funded by NSF, ONR
or NOAA and is funded accordingly by these agencies. The ALVIN is currently
scheduled for a total of 258 operational days during 1993, of which 165 are in
support of NSF- sponsored programs. NSF-supported cruises will take place in
both the Atlantic and Pacific for biological, chemical and marine geological and
geophysical research.
