The Peabody Fellows Earth Science Program is a professional development
opportunity for middle school educators that is focused on the interpretation of
landforms that result from constructive and destructive geologic forces. The
project is producing curriculum resources for wide-spread dissemination, that
includes lesson plans, content information, model student assessment
instruments, hands-on specimens, and field trip activities. Resource development
teachers are working with Museum staff and researchers to produce materials that
are both aligned with national and state standards and based on current research
and that encourage inquiry-oriented and place-based learning. Through summer
institutes and year-round workshops, participating teachers will gain content
knowledge in this area, learn how to use the curriculum materials, develop their
use of inquiry-oriented and place-based instructional techniques, and increase
their use of field sites. The project also has an informal community education
component in the form of family event days for Museum visitors and the
production of a 'mini-exhibit' for use in outreach programs. Program partners
are the two urban public school districts of New Haven and West Haven, and the
sixth-year certification program, the 'Institute of Science Instruction and
Study' at Southern Connecticut State University. The program is also
collaborating with the Connecticut Department of Education.
