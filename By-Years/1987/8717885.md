Homogeneous materials are often composed of microscopic units which interact
with each other to produce effects that appear on the macroscopic scale. This
research involves an attempt to analyze macroscopic stress-strain behavior by
analyzing behavior of the interfaces between the microscopic units as a
stochastic process.
