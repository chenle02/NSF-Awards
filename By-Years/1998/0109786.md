This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
novel drug delivery method for treatment of diseases and symptoms that currently
require intravenous, subcutaneous injections or oral intake. This method is
based on the use of drugs in an extremely fine and ultra lightweight particle
form called AerohalantTM that is especially formulated for advanced inhalation
therapy. AerohalantTM particles will have much higher tendency to stay aloft
than state-of-the-art inhalants and next generation inhalants currently under
development by the pharmaceutical companies. AerohalantTM particles will reach
mucous membranes of the innermost part of the patients' lungs without depositing
any matter in the throat or the thoracic region, and therefore, utilize most of
the tennis court sized alveolar surface area inside human lungs. These ultra
light drug particles, on contact with thin fluid layer on mucous membranes in
the alveoli, can dissolve and reach the blood stream much faster than by state-
of-the art inhalants, subcutaneous, intravenous injections and orally ingested
medications. Alternately, these particles could also be designed to release
slowly. This Phase I project proposes to produce one commonly injected
pharmacotherapeutic agent in the special powder form and to conduct feasibility
tests with respect to suspension characteristics of Aerohalant TM particulates
in the air, the in vitro activity, and the rate of dissolution and
absorption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project are
in the medical field for production of inhalable forms of common therapeutic
drugs.
