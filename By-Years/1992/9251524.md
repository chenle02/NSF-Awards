This project grows out of curricular needs in cell and molecular biology,
environmental science, and student research. A partnership with International
Business Machine will assist in developing the project. The Division of Natural
Sciences has been funded to build a multi-functional facility comprising a
network that will tie together a central computer classroom with a series of
laboratory satellite stations. Using computer- assisted instrumentation, this
project will enhance our curriculum in four ways: (1) upgrade our offerings in
the structural/functional aspects of cell biology from a descriptive to an
analytical approach to biological principles; (2) enhance the analytical and
conceptual quality of research opportunities for undergraduates via our
required, year-long, Senior Project, in a way that will expand the principles
that can be addressed and introduce students to modern instrumentation; (3)
allow the use of analytical microscopical techniques appropriate for students
concentrating in ecological and environmental biology; and (4) allow active
participation in computer-controlled data collection and analysis with an
integrated system in which students collect data and digitize images in a
microscopy laboratory and prepare analyses and reports in the computer
classroom.
