This research project sets out to document (1) the pre-existing plans and
regulations for search and rescue in Mexico City, (2) the actual organization
and management of search and rescue, (3) the activities of ad hoc and
international assistance teams in search and rescue, and (4) the termination of
search and rescue operations. This documentation will be carried out with the
assistance of Proteccion Civil, a private firm in Mexico City, consultants from
the National Autonomous University of Mexico as well as contributions from U.S.
and international teams that participated in the search and rescue effort.
