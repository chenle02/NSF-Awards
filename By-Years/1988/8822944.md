This project deals with questions on the theory of Azumaya algebras over the
function field of an algebraic variety. Let K be the function field of the
surface S and A a central division algebra over K. The principal investigator
will study the algebra A by using cohomological techniques from algebraic
geometry in order to understand the ramification divisor of A on S. The project
relates properties of the Brauer group of K to the geometry of divisors on S and
considers questions about the factorization of the Brauer class of A into
symbols. This research is in the general area of algebra and is an interesting
combination of algebra, number theory and algebraic geometry. Given a surface it
is possible to associate with it a coordinate ring and with this ring a group.
This project will examine properties of this group in an effort to determine the
geometry of the surface.
