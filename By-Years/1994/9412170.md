Sojka ATM-9412170 A workshop will be held near Boulder, Colorado, from June
27-29 to discuss research and experiments on ionospheric plasma structures at
middle and high latitudes. This is the second workshop convened by the HLPS
(High Latitude Plasma Structures) Working Group of the CEDAR program. This
workshop will also include members of the GAPS (Global Aspects of Plasma
Structures) Working Group which is part of the international Solar Terrestrial
Energy Program (STEP). The discussion topics will emphasize the modeling of
middle and high latitude macro- and meso-scale plasma structures. ***
