Symposium: Ioann Veniaminov in Alaska and Siberia and His Contributions to
Arctic Social Science This symposium on Ioann Veniaminov's contributions to the
development of arctic social sciences, to be held in December 1997 in Fairbanks,
Alaska, brings together Russian and North American scholars. It complements
related activities that have taken place in Russia celebrating the bicentennial
of his 1797 birth. Veniaminov was a 19th century Russian Orthodox cleric who
pioneered ethnographic studies of Aleut and Tlingit peoples, developed language
writing systems for Aleut, Alutiiq, Tlingit, and Yup'ik languages, developed a
bilingual/bicultural educational system, advocated and contributed to the study
of the Alaska environment by keeping records of temperature, wind, and other
climate variables, and contributed to the earliest publication on the natural
history of the Aleutian Islands.
