The PIs will carry out a swath bathymetry survey of the southern Gulf of
California, obtain 3.5 kHz, magnetic and gravity profiles and collect dredge
samples of the volcanic basement. The objectives are to test hypotheses
concerned with the generic problems of how continental rifts are segmented
tectonically and whether this relates to asymmetries of faulting, how rift
propagation occurs tectonically and what type(s) of magmatism accompanies
continental break-up and earlist seafloor spreading. The Gulf of California is a
MARGINS' focus site and this study will complement other research being carried
out and planned for this region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
