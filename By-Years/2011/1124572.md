Every year, lawyers in the United States are called upon to address the legal
claims, as well as care and custody needs, of approximately 8,000 Unaccompanied
Alien Children (UACs). The current research project investigates the degree to
which construction of legal identity, narrowed to fit within limited legal
frames related to both immigration and guardianship, acts to constrain future
life possibilities among these legal minors. It focuses on the case of Chinese
migrants to the US. It considers the relationship of these individual children
to their legal identity, as framed by their lawyers, as well as their ability to
negotiate the rights-claiming required by these immigration hearings. The
research utilizes observation of legal proceedings, interviews with Chinese
legal minors of this category detained in Chicago and New York by US
immigration, and discourse analysis of compiled documents related to these
practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research could contribute
to the development of more prepared immigration policies and legal practices on
behalf of minors detained under the current law.
