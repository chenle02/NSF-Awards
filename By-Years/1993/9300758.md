This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It is a study of the processes by which male and female resident
physicians choose their medical specialties. It will be carried out through both
telephone surveys and intensive, face-to-face interviews with resident
physicians in Nashville, TN. Results will be analyzed to determine the extent to
which the processes by which women physicians tend disproportionately to end up
in specialties such as pediatrics and gynecology involve constraints and
discrimination versus preferences and values. This research will contribute to a
very active field of research on the nature of the processes producing sex
segregation among occupations. In addition to the scientific gains to be
achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising
student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes
to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the
next generation of sociologists.
