In this project, the PIs set up a virtual center for promoting and supporting
exchanges and collaborations in statistical science between US-based and China-
based researchers and educators. The center will be guided by a scientific
committee. The goal is to enable research collaborations in the areas where the
two countries have complementary strengths. The center will sponsor or co-
sponsor Ambassador Lectures in China given by prominent researchers from the US
on cutting-edge topics in statistics, invite prominent Chinese scholars to give
theme lectures in the US and to collaborate with US researchers, co-sponsor
workshops in China on frontiers of statistics and assist US participants to
attend those workshops, and support collaborations between researchers from the
two countries, especially junior researchers. The virtual center recognizes the
importance of enabling US researchers and educators to advance their work
through international collaboration. The activities supported by this proposal
also help ensure that future generations of US researchers in statistical
science have substantial interaction with their counterparts in China, a country
that is accelerating its research and education at a rapid speed.
