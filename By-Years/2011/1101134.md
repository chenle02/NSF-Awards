This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in the 27th
edition of the South Eastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM) on the campus of the
University of Florida, March 17 through March 19, 2011. The SEAM conferences
bring together both experienced and junior researchers, including graduate
students, and postdocs to discuss recent work and advances in operator theory
and function theory and related subjects, including their applications and
connections to other areas of mathematics such as operator algebras, engineering
systems and scattering theory, control theory, several complex variables, semi-
algebraic geometry, and optimization. The purpose of this meeting is to
disseminate and exchange the latest ideas and developments in the vibrant and
active areas of operator theory and function theory and related subjects while
encouraging the participation and professional development of both junior
members of the operator theory community and members of groups underrepresented
in mathematics. The program consists of plenary talks by leaders both senior and
junior and twenty minute contributed talks. The contributed talks are hallmark
of SEAM and many are given by younger mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
accordance with SEAM tradition, priority for funding and speaking opportunities
will be given to graduate students and other young researchers as well as
members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. The professional development
and integration of a diverse group of researchers into the analysis community
are anticipated impacts of the project. Scientifically, there is potential for
advances in function theory and operator theory and their related disciplines
and areas of application in mathematics and its client disciplines.
