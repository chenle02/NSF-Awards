David P. White, Chemistry Department, University of North Carolina at
Wilmington, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program for his work on chiral recognition by organometallic
complexes. The project incorporates molecular modeling, computational and
synthetic approaches to better understand stereoselective prochiral olefin
binding to [(eta-5-C5H4R)Re(CO)(L)(NO)]+ complexes (R = Me, t-Bu, SiMe3, CPh3;
L=PMe3, PMe2Ph, PMePh2, PPh3).

This award is made under the Research at Undergraduate Institutions Program
(RUI) and emphasizes the training of undergraduate researchers in the
complementary tools of synthesis and computation. This work on substituted
cyclopentadienyl complexes of rhenium may also lead to better routes for
enantioselective hydrogenation of olefins and other chiral transformations.
