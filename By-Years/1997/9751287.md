The university acquired a 16-inch telescope in 1975; this telescope has severe
drive problems that limit the guiding accuracy and speed of target acquisition.
The telescope does not offer the astronomy majors and other users at one of the
largest astronomy programs in the country an adequate system for education or
research. This project replaces the mount and drive system with a more accurate
system and incorporate computer controls. The new system is capable of tracking
at different rates, thus allowing the observation of solar system objects. In
conjunction with the modernization of the telescope, new laboratory exercises
can be written and field-tested. The telescope is used primarily in three upper
division astronomy courses: in a new course on "Astronomical Techniques," as a
supplement to an existing course on "Positional, Dynamical, and Kinematical
Astronomy," and within an existing laboratory course designed for future
secondary science teachers on "Methods of Astronomy." Time permitting, some use
by lower division students within a current one-credit-hour course is
envisioned.
