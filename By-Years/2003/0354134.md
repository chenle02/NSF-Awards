This award provides funding to the University of Notre Dame for a three-year REU
Sie Program entitled, "Nano-Bio Engineering at the University of Notre Dame,"
under the direction of Dr. Marya Lieberman. This ten-week summer program will
provide in depth research opportunities for 12-14 students per year (plus an
additional 3-5 international students) in projects which apply nanofabrication
and mathematical modeling to biological or biochemical problems, or which draw
on biological approaches to solve engineering problems. This REU Site will give
students and faculty pariticpants a chance to carry out collaborative research
in the "nano-bio" area and students will become part of an interdisciplinary
team.
