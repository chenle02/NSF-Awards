Optical Memory Disc Recording (OMDR) technology represents a significant
advancement over videotape technology; this equipment--an Optical Memory Disc
Recorder, high speed CCD video camera, player, and recording media--can be
brought directly into several projects including Building Safety: Fundamental
Studies in Reducing the Severity of Injuries Resulting from Stairway Falls. The
technology will provide greater efficiency in visual data acquisition, storage,
and retrieval, and will provide notable increases in accuracy over the videotape
methods currently employed.
