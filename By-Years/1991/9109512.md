The weighted graph mapping problem is motivated by the problem of assigning
program modules to processors in parallel architectures. The formulation of the
weighted graph mapping problem has not only led to a novel approach to assigning
modules, but has also suggested new and challenging graph-theoretic problems.
The main objectives of this Research Planning Grant proposal are to develop a
good understanding of the proposed research problems, to establish a competitive
research project, and to prepare a grant proposal to NSF.//
