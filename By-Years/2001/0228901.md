This research program investigates the theory and pragmatics of naming
and&lt;br/&gt;sharing data and computation threads, using principles of
optimal&lt;br/&gt;evaluation and linear logic. These tools explicitly highlight
the&lt;br/&gt;operations of copying and discarding that are essential in
procedure&lt;br/&gt;calling protocols. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will analyze the
algorithmics of optimal evaluation, the complexity of&lt;br/&gt;box management,
and the evaluation pragmatics for languages with explicit&lt;br/&gt;control.
Also included in the research agenda are intensional full&lt;br/&gt;abstraction
theorems, where the meaning of a term includes operational&lt;br/&gt;information
about how computations are shared, and the use of context&lt;br/&gt;semantics as
a flow analysis tool, where the so-called "geometry of&lt;br/&gt;interaction"
can give information about how procedures access their&lt;br/&gt;arguments.
Finally, we want to give a refined explanation of the bus&lt;br/&gt;system of
graph reduction in terms of linear logic, in the hope of giving a&lt;br/&gt;new
categorical rendition of the incremental computation in
optimal&lt;br/&gt;evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;
