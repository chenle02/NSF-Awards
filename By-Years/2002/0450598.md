This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will scale-up a
new technology for producing high-surface area tantalum powders for the
electronic capacitor industry. The existing technology is over 30 years old and
cannot keep pace with the needs of smaller electronics, which require tantalum
particles in the nanometer size range. In addition, environmental factors are
driving the industry away from the fluorinated precursors that are presently
used to make tantalum. The proposed technology employs the Sodium Flame
Encapsulation (SFE) technology to address this problem by producing nano-
tantalum powders encapsulated in sodium chloride. In-situ encapsulation allows
for control of morphology and prevents oxidation of the nano-tantalum by air or
moisture. The technology has been shown to produce state-of-the-art capacitor
materials with an environmentally-friendly process. Nonetheless, the present
process is a two step process involving post-processing of the nanopowders into
the agglomerated structure needed by capacitor manufacturers. This program will
specifically develop the flame technology so that the post-processing step is
unnecessary. In this way powders can be produced with the appropriate morphology
such that they only need to be washed and re-encapsulated to be a drop in
replacement for existing materials. The results will be a less expensive, higher
efficiency, higher surface area material that is produced by a green technology.
Commercially, this technology will enable smaller, more versatile electronics by
ensuring that the tantalum capacitor industry can continue to reduce its package
size in line with the rest of the industry.
