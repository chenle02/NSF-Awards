GER-9554521 Ulman We are proposing a Graduate Research Traineeship Program in
Optical Science and Engineering, in two strategic areas: materials for
photonics, and for information storage applications. The Office of Science and
Technology Policy has emphasized that materials synthesis and processing are
critical technologies. Also, the U.S. Army and Air Force are supporting research
in optical science and technology, especially in the two strategic areas
proposed here. The trainees in this program will develop new materials for
photonics applications and for digital image storage. Their research will be
carried out at four levels: * Design and investigations of molecules;* Design
and investigations of polymers;* Processing of polymers;* Device fabrication;
Students will be involved in all research facets, and will interact with a
number of faculty, and enjoy a stimulating interdisciplinary research
environment. Theoretical work will be carried out in collaboration with
Professor Shaul Mukamel at the University of Rochester. Investigations of
Langmuir-Blodgett films will be carried out at the NSF Center for Photoinduced
Electron Transfer, at the University of Rochester, in collaboration with
Professor David Whitten. The trainees in this program could enter a PhD track in
the Chemistry or Chemical Engineering Department at the Polytechnic University,
and would be drawn from Chemistry and/or Chemical Engineering. The goals of the
nonlinear optics part of program have been defined together with Dr. David
Williams of Eastman Kodak Company, and training opportunities for the trainees
at Kodak Research Laboratories, through summer employment, are now being
discussed. Also included in this program are high school and undergraduate
mentoring. Plans for recruiting trainees will emphasize underrepresented groups.
Five students would be recruited for these traineeships and would complete their
PhD programs in 5 years or less.
