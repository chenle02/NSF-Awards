Implementation Projects in the Historically Black Colleges and Universities -
Undergraduate program provide support to design, implement, study and assess
comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the numbers of students and the
quality of their preparation by strengthening science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM) education and research. This implementation project at
Claflin University focuses on the disciplines of biology, chemistry, computer
science and mathematics to provide an array of computational technologies in
order to support and educate the next-generation of data scientists who can work
in a multi-disciplinary environment. Claflin University has a proven record of
graduating a significant number of African-American students in STEM fields and
through this implementation project that number is projected to increase. The
project is guided and informed by an on-going
evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the proposed project are to
increase graduation and placement rates of students in the STEM workforce; to
infuse research and education in a STEM-based computational curriculum; to
promote computational science research to improve the quality of experiences and
prepare STEM students to compete in a global society; and to use the strengths
and assets of core partners to propel students towards a STEM career. The
project will create relationships with federal and national laboratories,
industry and other universities. The project involves faculty and undergraduate
students to conduct research in the areas of metabolites and biomolecules using
analytical instrumentation and methodology; in methods for retrieving and
analyzing biological data; as well as in optimization, computational complexity,
statistical modeling and machine learning.
