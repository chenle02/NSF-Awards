ABSTRACT: PI-Biermann, 9354643: A simulator for a simple computer hardware
software system is being constructed for educational uses. The simulator will
enable the user to observe the details of a computation as it proceeds: It will
display the internals of a compiler as it translates higher level language code
to assemble language; it will show the architecture fetch execute cycle as it
executes the machine language; and it will enable the user to see the details of
some of the switching circuits that implement the architecture. The system will
furthermore be able to operate in training mode to give the user instruction on
the displayed mechanisms and in testing mode to query the user and evaluate his
or her understanding. This project is ongoing and the first two level of the
system, compiler and architecture are operative now in the simulation mode. The
work in the coming year will add the switching circuit level and the training
and testing m odes for all levels. The purpose of the system is to provide a
variety of support services in a first course in computer science that teaches
the fundamentals of computer hardware software. The systems is usable for
classroom demonstrations to illustrate points during a lecture. It is also
usable for student laboratory assignments, and can be taken home and studied on
personal machines. The project will continue during 1994 on the implementation
phase while constantly incorporating the most recent version into classes as
they are being taught. It is also being offered to other institutions for
experimentation and evaluation. A later phase of the project will schedule a
formal evaluation of the system after is becomes more completely refined. This
project is designed to support courses that emphasize the breadth first approach
to introducing computer science as recommend by the Task Force on the Core of
Computer Science (Denning et al., Jan., 1989). The simulator should be useful
wherever courses are taught that follow this approach.
