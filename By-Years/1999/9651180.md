This project is developing an undergraduate laboratory in the behavioral
neurosciences to be included as a requirement in the psychology curriculum. This
laboratory is designed to introduce students to research in the neurosciences
that spans basic structural neuroanatomy and neurocognitive processing. To
achieve this end, students complete laboratory exercises that encompass three
domains: gross structural neuroanatomy and cell morphology, single neuron
electrophysiology in simple invertebrate preparations and in freely moving rats,
and human cognitive psychophysiology. Both traditional laboratory and computer-
based exercises are designed to reinforce and augment the traditional laboratory
exercises. Students will also be required to read both classic and contemporary
papers in the areas covered by the laboratory exercises. Approximately 120
students can complete this laboratory each academic year.
