involved in fields including archaeology, hydrology, climatology, ecology, and
global change science. This workshop-- AmeriDendro 2013, to be held in Tucson,
Arizona, in May 2013-- focuses on dendrochronology in both North and South
America, and will cover more than a dozen topics ranging from tree-ring
formation, fire ecology, and dendroclimatology to dendrogeomorphology, New- and
Old-World archaeology, and tree-ring networks. The meeting will be hosted by the
Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona. Over 200
scientists from North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa will present
results of their research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding supports student
participation in the workshop. Students will gain valuable academic and
professional experience, including networking with international colleagues.
