The ability of individuals to successfully undertake curricula in science and
technology is acutely impacted by the availability of appropriate assistive
technology. In many cases, neither the individual, his/her therapist, or the
college counselor is aware of all the available technology or the sources of
funding for that technology. This project is designing, developing, and testing
a prototype expert system-based tool for accurately matching assistive
technology and funding sources with individuals . The prototype is based on a
unique concept of multidimensional taxonomies for disability causes and
conditions, life purpose and needs, and available products. The prototype system
is being evaluated in three institutional environments and the results assessed.
Based on the results of this study, the prototype system may be converted to a
fully functional product by Meeting the Challenge, Inc. and made available to
institutions across the country thus providing a coherent mechanism for
enhancing the success potential of many students with disabilities.
