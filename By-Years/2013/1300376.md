This grant provides funding to explore a novel automated optical method for
precisely measuring three-dimensional (3D) structures at micrometer accuracy for
shiny objects (e.g., metal parts) and simultaneously process 3D contents in real
time for in-situ applications (e.g. sensing, monitoring, and inspection). The
objective of the research is to test the hypothesis that better accuracy, higher
speed, and more flexibility can be achieved with the binary defocusing technique
for 3D optical metrology and for 3D information processing. The approach is 1)
to theoretically and experimentally investigate binary defocusing technique for
overcoming the limitations of existing 3D optical metrology methods; 2) to
explore an automated 3D optical metrology framework for measuring shiny object
surfaces, and 3) to further investigate novel methods to process 3D video
contents in real time for in-situ applications.

If successful, this project will result in two major research outcomes: 1) a
novel instrumentation for automatically measuring objects difficult to be
measured (e.g., shiny objects), and 2) a novel computational framework for 3D
video data processing. This proposed technique will transform many fields by
providing quantitative measure of physical objects including monitoring,
sensing, and control for advanced manufacturing (e.g., additive manufacturing)
and in-situ inspection; and will also introduce new paradigms to scientific
areas including medicine, computer science, as well as other engineering
disciplines. Knowledge gained from this research will also have many benefits to
the society. For example, the high-speed 3D sensing techniques will drastically
strengthen the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry by providing a
novel tool for in-situ inspection and sensing. The 3D camera/sensor
manufacturing is a multi-billion dollar industry, and thus commercializing 3D
camera/sensor could have great economic benefits to the United States.
