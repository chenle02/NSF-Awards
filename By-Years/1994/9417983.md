9417983 Thiq project is a study of the dynamic interaction of transient weather
systems with the surface katabatic wind system inland from the Siple Coast in
East Antarctica. The topography of the Siple Coast channels the cold air from
the interior into intense and persistent streams of katabatic winds which flow
out over the Ross Ice Shelf. The periodic passage of synoptic-scale cyclonic
storms affects the structure and behavior of the surface wind streams by
reinforcing the surface flow into surge events, extending for as much as a
thousand miles across the Ross Ice Shelf, and the katabatic winds may affect the
generation of cyclonic storms by forming a strongly baroclinic zone on the Ice
Shelf. This project will integrate observations from a network of nine automatic
weather stations, multi-spectral satellite imagery, and numerical modeling with
the goal of testing and elaborating upon hypotheses established from prior
investigations of the dynamics of katabatic winds. Specific aspects to be
addressed include the relative importance of katabatic flows in West and East
Antarctica, evaluation of the impacts of pressure gradient and cloud- radiative
forcing, and the interaction of the katabatic flow field with mesoscale
cyclones. ***
