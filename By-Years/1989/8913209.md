This project is a CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences
entitled "Curves and Surfaces: An Algorithmic Viewpoint". This conference will
be held at Kent State University May 21-25, 1990. Spline functions have proved
their usefulness in many areas of mathematics and its applications. The general
scientific community often uses these functions when it needs to extrapolate
data, do a least squares fit, or model a surface. Fast algorithms for splines
make effective computation possible. One of the leading contributors to the area
is the principal speaker, Dr. C. A. Micchelli. His lectures will emphasize the
geometry of various spline or spline-like surfaces and the associated
computation of these surfaces.
