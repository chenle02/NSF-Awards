In the past several decades neuroscience and biological science have greatly
benefited from insights gathered from mathematical models and studies. The
investigators will study the generic behaviors of periodically forced Hopf
oscillators, based on a more general normal form, in the analysis of mammalian
auditory system. This includes gaining an understanding of the implication of
multiple periodic responses. A very simple mode-interaction bifurcation with
square symmetry that may lead to large-scale symmetric chaotic attractors will
be investigated as well. Such symmetry is defined in a natural way that physical
experiments can be performed more easily, such as to have a reaction-diffusion
model setup more naturally. The research of planar neural field model used in
developing studies of brain?s electrical activity will also be carried out. The
model studied will incorporate axonal delay in nonlocal interactions, and we
investigate such effects on patterning. The investigation of a simple
equivariant system reveals a heteroclinic-like orbit which does not require a
perturbation. This study will provide an alternative mechanism to observe such
cycle without going through symmetry breaking bifurcation.

There has been no abstract theory for observing or understanding multiple
periodic responses in modeling auditory system, hence this study will be of
interest in neuroscience study. The success of large-scale symmetry chaos study
would be the first situation where widespread symmetric chaos could be
systematically investigated in experimental situations. The study of neural
field model with nonlocal connections will provide patterning resulting from the
delay effect, thus help to further develop an understanding in the studies of
epilepsy, coma and brain injury. Heteroclinic-like cycles play a role in
analyzing neural computation, hunting behavior and olfaction selection. Graduate
students involved in this research will receive training in an interdisciplinary
field, and will gain a broad perspective on mathematical neuroscience. The
active involvement of the investigators in student research and course
development will provide an opportunity to translate the research here into
compelling educational topics.
