This funding renews a highly-successful CISE Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site at the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical
Computer Science, headquartered at Rutgers University (DIMACS). The site focuses
on research in theoretical computer science, discrete mathematics, and their
multidisciplinary applications. It exposes students to a broad range of Computer
Science topics, applied in contexts that range from bioinformatics to big data.
The site uses mentoring teams to support interdisciplinary research projects.
The site has a long-standing collaboration with The DIMATIA Center at Charles
University in the Czech Republic, and five students from the Czech Republic will
participate in the first 7 weeks of the program each
summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will allow 10 undergraduate students
per year from the United States to experience research in theoretical computer
science, discrete mathematics, and their application to multidisciplinary
research. These students will be joined by five Czech students each year and
will have the opportunity to participate in the full range of scientific
activities at DIMACS. The program aims to influence the choices about further
education and future careers of the students involved, and to give them the
confidence to pursue these choices. The site has a strong record of recruiting
students from underrepresented groups and of publication of research results by
the participating students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is co-funded by the
Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.
