Work to be done on this project concerns several related problems concerning
Volterra integrodifferential equations in Banach spaces. Applications are
planned to partial differential integral equations of the type occurring in the
modeling of viscoelastic media and associated control problems. The work builds
on earlier investigations and involves semigroups, cosine families and the
related theory. Emphasis will be placed on finding appropriate settings and
models which will yield qualitative information which can conveniently be
applied. Specific problems to be analyzed include the examination of equations
in Banach spaces which depend on data that incorporate all past history. The
role of one of these equations representing the limiting equation for equations
which do not depend on the full past history will be considered. A semigroup
formulation for certain infinite history problems developed earlier will
continue to receive attention. Work on symmetric hyperbolic systems will also be
continued. The connecting theme in this effort is that of boundary control.
