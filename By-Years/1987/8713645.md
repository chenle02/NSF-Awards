The primary objective of site visits conducted jointly by representatives of the
Hungarian Academy of Science and the National Science Foundation is to observe
the scientific work and interview researchers supported by grants awarded under
the U.S.-Hungary Cooperative Science Program. Laboratories to be visited
represent the fields of chemistry, neurobiology and physics and are located at
two institutions, the University of North Carolina and the College of William
and Mary. While on-site, official representatives will seek to determine if
overall program objectives are being met through shared research experience in
designated areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
