This university-industry collaboration research project is aimed to discover
the underlying principles for design of computer-controlled devices for the
assistance of assembly workers in handling heavy-weight objects. The research
tasks include: understanding of common maneuvers to lift, move and transfer
loads; design of human assist devices; adaptive control of human-machine system;
computer hardware and software design; and overall system performance
evaluation. The project is unique and innovative in the study of human-machine
interface and the development of a computer-controlled device including this
interface. The research is academically challenging and is likely to lead to an
effective solution for work-related back injury problems when handling heavy
loads.
