The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive model of the inner
magnetosphere that includes the interactions of the plasmasphere, the ring
current and the radiation belts. The model will be an enhancement of the
Comprehensive Ring Current Model (CRCM) and the Radiation Belt Environment (RBE)
model. The coupled model will include the processes by which particles are
accelerated, the loss and transport processes and will include a self-consistent
description of the electric and magnetic fields.

The project will examine how the inner magnetosphere responds dynamically to the
solar wind drivers and how the response to the external drivers is modulated by
internal processes. Specific questions that will be addressed are: (1) what is
the relationship between EMIC (electromagnetic ion-cyclotron)waves and the loss
of ring current ions via particle precipitation, (2) what are the roles of
radial transport, wave-particle interactions, and induced electric fields on the
variations in relativistic electron fluxes in the radiation belt during
different phases of geomagnetic storms, and (3) what determines the sometimes
partial, sometimes complete filling of the slot region between the inner and
outer radiation belts.

Understanding the interactions between the solar wind drivers, the ring current
and the radiation belts has important impacts on our understanding of space
weather, including radiation hazards to space-based technological systems and
geomagnetic effects on the ground.
