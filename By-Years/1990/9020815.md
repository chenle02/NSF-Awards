Computer hardware will be purchased and used to enhance meteorological
instructions and research at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. The
acquired hardware will run software supplied and supported by the UNIDATA
Program Center (UPC). The equipment would be placed in the joint Earth Sciences
and Geography departments. The common vision shared by these departments is to
bring computer-based spatial analysis systems and enhanced, interactive
meteorology instruction into both the undergraduate curriculum and research
initiatives. The proposal is directed towards upgrading computer equipment for
meteorological investigations that will have the capability of interfacing with
a unix-based Geographic Information System. The faculty are prepared to
immediately implement a host of physical-based applications to teach
meteorological principles and access data that allows for applied research in
drought analysis, water-resource planning, and development of predictive indices
of air-pollution.
