Anthropogenic stresses to reefs coupled with climate change impacts are causing
unprecedented declines in coral reefs globally yet automated technology to
monitor the health of coral reefs at large temporal and spatial scales does not
exist. This project will develop and deploy automated technology to monitor the
health of coral reefs at large temporal and spatial scales. It will create a
cyber-enabled Computer Vision Coral Ecology Portal that will allow upload, and
expert classification remotely via an interactive web-based server paradigm
where the external user need not manage the hardware or software. To achieve
this goal new computer vision technology is needed. The effort has the potential
to not only advance computer vision technology but also transform the way that
coral reef ecology is performed. Fundamental computer vision problems in
underwater imaging and illumination modeling, registration of RGB and
fluorescence images from a moving camera rig will be addressed. Progressive
improvement in the computer vision system combined with new data collected with
these enabling technologies, will allow for transformational ecological outcomes
including: 1) creation of baselines of coral reef health at diverse locations
essential for understanding impacts of climate change; 2) development of rapid
methods for quantitative surveying in support of ecology research or management;
3) estimates of growth, mortality, and recruitment rates and competitive
abilities of the key coral reef species and the changes associated with warming
and acidification; 4) improved knowledge of deep coral reefs for which very
little is known; 5) rapid and spatially extensive in situ classification in
support work by our collaborators on using airborne and satellite remote sensing
and 6) creation of novel methods for multi-spectral image acquisition and
processing to improve cyber-based ecological classification of coral reef
communities.

The project includes participation and education for undergraduate students,
graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The project also includes an
interdisciplinary education and out-reach program to involve high school
students and teachers, using an innovative web-based "Coral Quiz" that will
communicate details of ecology, computer science and the biology of coral reefs.
