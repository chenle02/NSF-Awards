Geomorphologic processes associated with cataclysmic flows defy direct
measurement. As such, very little is understood regarding flow conditions,
sediment transport, erosional and depositional threshold, and patterns of energy
expenditure associated with these extreme hydrologic events. Recent develop-
ments in paleohydraulic and paleohydrologic techniques provide an avenue for
quantitative exploration of these phenomena. Late Pleistocene cataclysmic
flooding along the Snake and Big Lost Rivers of southern Idaho and in the
Channeled Scabland of eastern Washington has provided an excellent field
laboratory for application of these methodologies. Utilizing field evidence of
maximum flow stages in conjunction with step-backwater and hydraulic flow
routing models, we propose to reconstruct the hydraulics (discharge, velocity,
shear stress, and unit-area stream power) of these flows. It is hypothesized
that these variables, and their spatial variations, can be directly related to
the abundant field evidence of depositional and erosional thresholds. We will
test these relationships at several different scales and within different flow
environments to determine their general applicability for cataclysmically
flooded terrains.
