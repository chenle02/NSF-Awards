Abstract: This award provides funding for an REU site based at the Marine
Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The program will bring 5 undergraduate
students to MBL for a 10-week independent research experience. Mentoring
scientists will be drawn from MLB, Boston University and Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution. Interns will work closely with the scientists to
develop and execute an independent research project. At the end of the program,
interns give an oral presentation of their work and submit a paper for peer
review. Most of the papers are published in the MBL publication Biological
Bulletin. Interns also participate in weekly seminars on topics such as
statistical analyses, research design, scientific presentations, scientific
ethics, and careers in science.
