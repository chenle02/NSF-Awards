This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in population
and evolutionary genetics between Daniel L. Hartl, Harvard University, and Jean
R. David, Biology and Evolutionary Genetics Laboratory, the French National
Center for Scientific Research in Gif-sur-Yvette, France. The research focuses
on the evolutionary genetics of the transposable element mariner among species
of Drosophila. The investigators will study the rates and patterns of sequence
evolution to determine the mode of inheritance of these elements in different
lineages of Drosophila. The transposable element in mariner makes it a very
strong candidate for genetic engineering by means of germline transformation.
The element is short and has a simple sequence organization. Mariner sequences
are found in a wide range of genomes. The U.S. investigator brings to this
collaboration expertise in cloning, sequencing and analysis of the mariner
elements. The French group has an internationally recognized collection of
Drosophila species. They will carry out the Drosophila screening of mariner
elements and some of the cloning and sequencing. The project will provide data
on the evolutionary biology of the transposable mariner element and may assist
in the development of new tools for genetic manipulation of diverse organisms.
