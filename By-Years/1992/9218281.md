The infrared and bolometric luminosities of elliptical galaxies and the bulges
of spiral galaxies are dominated by light from K and M giants. The objective of
this project is to determine the physical characteristics of such stars of
different ages and compositions and in different environments. This will be
accomplished using infrared spectroscopy and photometry supplemented by some
optical spectroscopy. The implications include testing and calibrating models of
stellar interiors and evolution and information on the stellar systems
themselves. The results will also be useful for future investigations of the
integrated light from stellar systems.
