Professor Huennekens and his graduate students will embark on a series of
experiments exploring collisional and radiative processes in alkali and
alkaline-earth vapors. These studies will include determination of the alkali
dimer excited-state potentials, a novel method of elucidating the nature of
velocity- changing collisions, and investigation of predicted excimer bands in
barium-noble gas molecules.
