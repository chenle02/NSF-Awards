9513306 Cahoon This award will partially cover travel and related equipment
shipping costs for Dr. Lawrence Cahoon, Department of Biological Sciences at the
Wilmington Campus of the University of North Carolina, to enable him to conduct
collaborative research with William Vant of the National Institute of Water and
Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in Hamilton, New Zealand. The focus of this
investigation is on the ecology of benthic microalgae in an estuarine ecosystem.
The research will investigate the relationship between microalgal and
phytoplankton biomass and production in the Manukau Harbor. This estuarine
ecosystem receives treated sewage effluent from Auckland, creating a strong
gradient of nutrient loading and turbidity. The study will test the hypothesis
that light attenuation by phytoplankton, and its derived detritus, drives an
inverse relationship between the algal and plankton biomass. The study brings
together the expertise of the New Zealand investigator in light attenuation in
aquatic ecosystems and the American researcher in the measurement of benthic
microalgal biomass and production. ***
