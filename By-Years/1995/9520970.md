9520970 Srdanov The proposed research focuses on synthesis and physical
properties of a new class of materials that are created when zeolites are doped
with electron donors such as alkali metals. This proposal aims to open a new
area in zeolite research and explore whether zeilites densely populated with
electrons turn out to be a new class of interesting electronic and magnetic
materials. On a more fundamental level, the experimental results will provide
presently unavailable data that can be used for theoretical modeling of the
electron-framework and electron-electron interactions in zeolites. Detailed
knowledge regarding electric fields in zeolites, which can be deduced from these
studies, is of particular importance in their technological applications. The
structural and physical properties of the materials will be investigated by
various techniques including x-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy, ESR, NMR and magnetic susceptibility measurements. %%% The
