Earth is unique among the known planets in exhibiting plate tectonics as the
primary means of transporting internally generated heat. Plate tectonics is
responsible for Earth's unusual topography distribution, geochemical interaction
between the surface and the deep interior, and the strength of the geodynamo,
among other factors that make our home planet special. The timing of the origin
of plate tectonics on Earth has been difficult to establish observationally, but
there are hints of very early (Hadean) geochemical processes with modern plate
tectonic analogues. The mechanism and timing of plate tectonic initiation have
direct bearing on models of the geochemical and thermal evolution of our planet,
the uniqueness of Earth as an abode for life, and our understanding terrestrial
planets in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will primarily support a
graduate student to carry out, under the mentoring of the PI, numerical
simulations of heat transport in the pre-plate tectonic Earth in order to
understand the transition to plate tectonic behavior. This period of history is
dominated by volcanic heat transport, called the heat-pipe mode of planetary
cooling. Numerical simulation of the flow of Earth?s mantle materials including
heat transport by melting and melt segregation (volcanism) will be accomplished
using a specialized code. A systematic investigation of the parameters governing
convection and melting will be undertaken, and bounds on the transition to plate
tectonics will be established. The implications for early Earth will be compared
with published petrological and geochemical data.
