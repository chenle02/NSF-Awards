Computing technology offers the science disciplines the opportunity to extend
laboratory experiences to all areas of their curriculum. In economics, one or
two courses in econometrics, set apart from the theory courses, serve this
purpose. Students are presented with statistical theory and are then asked to
reinforce the theory by practising statistical and computing techniques. They
are so involved with connecting the statistical theory to the techniques that
they seldom make the further connection to the economic theory presented in
other classes. An economics computing laboratory is being set up at Macalester
College to unite the practise and theory of econometrics, and serve as a model
for other economic theory courses. This facility, equipped with a network of
Macintosh computers, enables students to focus on the interpretation of the
econometric study. Instead of concentrating on computing skills and statistical
techniques, students can participate in research projects using facilities in
the lab as well as through the campus network. The college will contribute an
amount equal to the award.
