Cognitive robotics has been identified as a research area of common interest to
Japan and the US; in addition, it is of mutual benefit to both countries to
explore areas for collaborative work where each side brings complementary
strength to the project. Moreover, there is already a good start in
collaborative research among some US-Japan roboticists. We propose to propel
this joint cooperative research to a higher level of impact by holding a joint
NSF-JST workshop which brings together the best researchers from both countries
and have them discuss and exchange ideas about the most opportune research
directions, then work at a deeper level on some specific challenges in these
areas in order to be well-positioned for a next round of collaborative funding
opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop has the potential to result
not only in new research directions which could ultimately impact many
industries (e.g., elderly care, logistics, security, medical, exploration,
monitoring, etc.), but also lead to broader international opportunities for
faculty and students. The goal is to have the results of this workshop result in
high-impact collaborative US-Japan research with student and faculty exchanges
and long-term visits. This renders our students and faculty more globally aware
and competitive.
