The primary objective of the "Workshop on the Future of Database Systems
Research" is to enumerate the most promising directions for database research in
the broadest sense and to explore what can be expected to be achieved in the
next decade. A secondary purpose is to examine existing technologies in related
fields and foster interaction with researchers in those fields. The emphasis
will be placed on collaborative research leading towards building of the next
generation of intelligent information systems, comprised of multi-media
databases distributed over a large geographical area. To that end, a panel
including representatives of all aspects of database systems, with special care
to include researchers from related fields will be chosen. The workshop
participants will prepare a position paper that will be submitted to NSF and
also will be made available to a wide community involved in database research
and development, management or planning. The objective of this report is to make
valid predictions and to explain the field and its challenges.
