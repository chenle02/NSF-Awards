This project provides the tools and assistance that faculty need to create the
next generation robotics laboratory at their own institutions: (1) a well-
supported research-level hardware platform; (2) an open source software system
that abstracts from the details of any particular robot and allows users to
explore complex control methods at a high level; and (3) a project-based
curriculum integrated with the hardware and software. The PIs serve as mentors
through on-site visits, close e-mail contact, and yearly workshops.
