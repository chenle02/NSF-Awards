2 I 9309133 Weisband ? X This research examines the social and technological
factors that lead people using computer based information to share information
and solve problems. It also addresses some design questions about new
technologies and group work. Conflicting results from the research on computer
mediated group decision making are particularly troublesome, not because they
exist, but because they are not empirically examined. One stream of research
suggests that computer networks "open up" communication and ease coordination in
some tasks. A second stream of research suggests that computer communication
makes it difficult to regulate interaction and reach consensus. The same
technology apparently results in different group behaviors, depending on the
kind of task that is performed. The research proposed here will attempt to
explore these task and media effects empirically. Using theories from social
psychology and group interaction, a series of experiments will be conducted to
test the implication that computer supported group work may best be suited for
divergent, information sharing tasks, but not well suited for convergent,
consensus rea ching tasks. These studies focus particularly on how the
distribution of shared and unshared information affects the way in which groups
exchange information and solve problems in face to face and computer mediated
group decision making. They also replicate and extend previous work on first
advocacy and status effects to examine the effects of unshared information on
expert behavior in groups.
