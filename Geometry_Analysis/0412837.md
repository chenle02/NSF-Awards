The subject of geometry and deformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds has
seen considerable change and advancement over the last three years. Central
conjectures have been resolved, presenting a significant need and opportunity
for results to be disseminated and absorbed and for new directions to be
evaluated. The Department of Mathematics at Wesleyan University is holding a
special semester on the topic of Hyperbolic Manifolds and Geometric Analysis in
the Fall of 2004. The department has already invited Professor Richard Canary of
the University of Michigan as distinguished visiting professor for the Fall
semester 2004. Wesleyan faculty members Petra Bonfert-Taylor and Edward Taylor
will also be leaders and organizers of this special semester.

A centerpiece of the special semester will be a three-day conference to be held
in October 2004. This conference will gather many of the originators of the
recent exciting advances in hyperbolic 3-manifolds. It is expected that this
conference will draw many graduate students and young mathematicians from the
area, as well as established researchers in the field. The conference will be
preceded by a one-day workshop for graduate students. The department further
plans to invite a series of longer-term visitors, to enable more sustained
research activity. It is hoped that hyperbolic geometers and geometric analysts
from the area will also be involved in the special semester on an ongoing basis.
For the finale of this special semester Wesleyan University will host a public
lecture designed to be accessible to the entire Wesleyan community.
