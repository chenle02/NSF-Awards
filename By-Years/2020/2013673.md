This proposal is to fund student travel to the Security and Human Behavior (SHB)
workshop to be held in June 2020 at Cambridge University. The goals of SHB are
to discuss, in an informal and interdisciplinary setting, issues where security,
psychology, and behavior interact. The scope is broad: topics that have been
covered in the past include the misperception of risk, security usability,
deception, security and privacy decision making. As the Secure and Trustworthy
Cyberspace (SaTC) research program was expanded to include social sciences in
addition to its core in computer science, gatherings such as SHB provide a key
venue for interaction between the different
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students from U.S. universities, or U.S.
students from other universities, will greatly benefit from participating in the
workshop, where they will interact with research leaders from a variety of
disciplines and will be exposed to the most recent developments in information
security and privacy research. In particular, the first rule of the SHB Workshop
is that everyone who attends participates in the discussion. This will ensure
that students are more involved and improve the benefits from attending SHB than
many conferences and workshops where they can simply listen. Further, the
organizers will ask invited senior scholars for suggestions of student
participants who are from underrepresented groups to invite, increasing the
chance that the workshop will broaden participation in the SaTC
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
