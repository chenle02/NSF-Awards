The Psychology Research Experience Program (PREP) provides a systematic and
thorough exposure to research in psychology with a focus on professional
development as a researcher in psychology. PREP students become members of the
mentor's laboratory, taking part in all aspects of research from reading the
appropriate literature and discussing research ideas with the mentor, to
gathering and analyzing data, to organizing and interpreting the results. PREP
students interact closely with other undergraduate and graduate students in the
mentor's lab. The end of the PREP program is marked by a symposium in the last
week where each PREP student makes a 15-minute oral presentation of the work
they did during the summer.

Additionally, weekly group meetings are held with all PREP students. At these
meetings, each mentor presents his or her research to the PREP students. In this
way, each PREP student is exposed to a broad range of psychological research.
Also, films are shown each week to spark student discussion of ethical issues in
science. PREP students are housed with other young scientists in similar
programs in other scientific disciplines.

This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract
talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
experiences.
