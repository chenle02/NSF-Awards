This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for an OC-3 connection to the enhance and acomodate research needs for
the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee by establishing a connection to the Very
High Performance Backbone Network Service (vBNS) via MREN community connection
at the Ameritech NAP. Projects in this proposal include: the Advanced Light
Source Synchrotron Radiation Facility, high speed arithmetic using the Chinese
Remainder Representation, experiments on electron holography, mesoscale modeling
in making qualitative precipitation forecasts, two-phase thermal control system
for the space station, and scanning tunneling microscopes. With this high
performance network capability the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee will expand
current research and collaboration with both academic institutions and federal
laboratories. On this project, collaborating institutions include: Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
NASA-Goddard, Caltech and the University of Michigan
