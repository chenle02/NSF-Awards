Analyzing the chemical and physical processes occurring in chemical reactor
dynamics has practical uses over and above the elucidation of fundamental
phenomena. An understanding of these processes and being able to determine the
controlling parameters is necessary for design and scaleup of industrial
reactors. This research project is a continuation of the principal
investigator's work on the unsteady state behavior of electrochemical reactors.
Such systems are ideal for fundamental studies of reaction dynamics because they
are relatively stationary (they have less drift over the time scale of the
dynamics) and they exhibit many types of interesting dynamic behavior such as
complex periodic oscillations, low order chaos, quasiperiodicity, etc. The
parameters are easily controlled (potential or current, for example) so that
transitions among states can be investigated. In this project several dynamic
phenomena will be studied using electrochemical reactions. The studies will
include surface patterns and the relationship of temporal and spatial behavior,
transitions from low order chaos to more complex phenomena, coupled systems, and
studies of bifurcation among states. The experimental work will involve
electrodissolution of metals, electrodeposition, and electrocatalytic reactions.
The results will be analyzed using methods from nonlinear dynamics (including
neural networks) and will compare experimental data with model predictions.
