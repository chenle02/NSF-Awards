Flows of partially ionized plasma are frequently characterized by the presence
of both thermal and nonthermal populations of ions. This occurs, e. g., in the
outer heliosphere, the part of interstellar space beyond the solar system whose
properties are determined by the solar wind (SW) interaction with the local
interstellar medium (LISM). Understanding the behavior of such flows requires us
toinvestigate a variety of physical phenomena occurring throughout the solar
system. The current proposal addresses the question the sky-spanning "ribbon" of
unexpectedly intense emissions of ENAs detected by the Interstellar Boundary
Explorer (IBEX) mission. By modeling the heliosphere using the resources of the
Blue Waters facility at NCSA its becomes possible to analyze such puzzling
astrophysical flows as those in the Guitar nebula, and compare modeling with
remote observations. Numerical solution of these problems with the realistic
boundary conditions provided by remote and in situ observations of the SW
properties, requires the application of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
technologies and petascale supercomputers. Codes developed during the NSF ITR
program and various NASA projects will be used for the modeling and compared
with observations by IBEX.
