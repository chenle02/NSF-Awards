Five undergraduate geology students will spend the summer doing research at the
department of Geology at the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg. Library
research, field work and laboratory investigation will be combined in each
project to give the student a broad range of experience. The emphasis will be on
independent work by the student under the guidance and in the direct field of
interest of the research supervisors. Each student will have his or her own
research project to work on. Each student will present the results of his or her
work orally and in a formal written report and each will be urged to present his
or her findings at a professional meeting. Research projects will focus on the
geology of the Coastal Plain and Peidmont of Virginia.
