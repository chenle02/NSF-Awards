This project develops a broad-based, interdisciplinary approach for future
elementary school teachers leading to a positive attitude toward science. Twenty
teaching modules are developed that covers major science concepts and inquiry
skills outlined in national and states standards. Each module is designed for
two weeks of class time. While the approach is specifically designed for pre-
service teachers, it also meets well the needs of all non-SMET majors. The
modules also provide an excellent format for in-service development.
