Direct observations of the atmosphere through immersion and remote sensing are
necessary for advancements in the atmospheric sciences. Instrumented research
aircraft have been invaluable in providing these observations over the last four
decades. The need for such aircraft will be great over the next few years for
research covering a broad range of research problems including atmospheric
chemistry, mesoscale meteorology and cloud physics which have been identified as
high priority research areas in the atmospheric sciences. This award will make
available to the entire atmospheric sciences community the University of Wyoming
King Air research aircraft. The Wyoming King Air will be treated as all other
atmospheric sciences community facilities with allocation being made by a peer
review process. The University of Wyoming personnel have much experience in
airborne research and the King Air is a state.of.the.art research platform. This
award also will help in maintaining an active program in airborne research at
the University of Wyoming which over the last few years has produced many of the
scientists in this area.
