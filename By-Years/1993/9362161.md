9362161 Coleman The objective of this project is to evaluate a biological
nutrient removal process that provides an alternative to chemical treatment
methods, which produce a residue for disposal. The success and reliability of
the biological process depends on the ability to produce a fermentation product
from the wastewater; namely acetate and propionate. Primary treatment sludge is
fermented to provide additional acetate, but where this has been used, the
acetate production has been below theoretical expectations. This may be due to
the growth of other sulfate reducing and methane forming organisms that consume
the acetate. The process to be evaluated in this project involves a primary
sludge fermentation system that uses intermittent oxygenation to inhibit the
organisms and thus greatly increase the fermentation yield. Experiments designed
to test this concept will also investigate the use of oxidation-reduction
potential measurements to control the process. A higher acetate and propionate
production will greatly improve the reliability and performance of biological
phosphorus removal systems. Experiments are designed to test this innovative
concept using primary sludge at the City of Yakima WWTP. Oxygenation frequency,
duration and control methods will be studied and the effect on acetate and
propionate yield will be followed. This is a Phase I award based on a proposal
submitted in response to NSF 93-18, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Program Solicitation. An improved primary sludge fermentation process with a
process control system using ORP measurements is expected. This involves process
technology, equipment design and a process control system that can be marketed.
There is a significant need for improved technology for biological phosphorus
removal economically competitive with chemical treatment systems.
