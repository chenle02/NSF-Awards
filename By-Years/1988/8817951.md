Experimental studies of coherence and fluctuation phenomena in lasers and
nonlinear optical interactions of light matter will continue. Studies of the
laser with a saturable absorber will study fluctuation phenomena in light-matter
interactions. A new component to the project has been added to study
instabilities and fluctuations in nonlinear optical processes. These studies
will be carried out in the processes of sub/second harmonic generation with the
emphasis on the quantum statistical properties of the electromagnetic field.
These experiments will probe novel regimes of operation of nonequilibrium
systems and will lay the groundwork for future studies of the interaction of
simple atomic systems with quantum states of light.
