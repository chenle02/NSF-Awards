Weber State College is offering a series of three intensive two-week summer
institutes and academic year seminars for 60 elementary teachers each year from
intermountain northern Utah. The program will provide broad, comprehensive
instruction and activities in life, physical and earth sciences as they apply to
the state of Utah's new guidelines for elementary school science. Each
participant will have to make a six- week commitment to insure that all three
workshops will be completed. One-on-one follow-up visits by staff to each
participant's classroom will aid in implementing changes in teaching/learning
strategies. Academic year seminars will provide the opportunity for discussion,
support, and evaluation. Each participant will develop his/her own resource
guide and construct inexpensive equipment for use in the classroom. A unique
component of this project is the involvement of preservice elementary school
majors who will be interning with participants during the summer program.
