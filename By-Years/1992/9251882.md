The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a flame and graphite furnace atomic
absorption spectrophotometer with automatic furnace sample changer for use in
chemistry and environmental science courses. Students are undertaking trace
metal analysis in natural water systems, body fluids, commercial products, and
in soils. The instrument is benefiting a growing undergraduate research program
and is being used in summer programs for high school students and middle school
teachers.
