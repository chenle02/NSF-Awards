This Small Business Innovation Research Project (SBIR) Phase II project will
advance the development of an electrochemical process, addressing the need for
elimination of the use of lead-based finishes and solders in the printed circuit
board, electronics packaging and semiconductor industries. This technology
utilizes pulsed electrolysis to deposit a lead-free tin solder with the desired
grain size, matte finish and control of internal stresses, to avoid whisker
growth which can lead to component failure. The Phase II objectives/research
tasks include: 1) pilot-scale facilities design and modification for electro-
deposition of lead-free solder onto full size printed circuit boards and wafers,
2) demonstration and optimization of the process to deposit lead-free solder for
chip and wafer scale packaging, 3) development of analysis methods to
characterize deposit properties and evaluate the correlations between the
process and deposit properties, 4) demonstration of qualification and
reliability tests for tin whisker evaluation and characterization of
corresponding acceleration factors, and 5) comparison of the data to that
obtained by other alternatives lead-free materials, e.g. tin-silver. The
anticipated results of the Phase II program are a marketable manufacturing
process/manufacturing tool in the form of an electrochemical module
incorporating the lead-free process.

Commercially the project addresses the needs of the printed circuit board and
semiconductor industry, to minimize chemical waste and environmental impact and
at the same time increase cost-effectiveness.
