9402397 Shine This research is an experimental and theoretical study of a new
class of electroheological fluids. The properties of a liquid crystalline
solution in a hydrocarbon solvent of a rigid rod polymer having a large
permanent axial dipole moment will be investigated. This research will integrate
the molecular design of the liquid crystalline polymer structure with the
modeling of the rheological material behavior when an electric field is applied.
