The title of this program is "Boston Harbor Marine Research Program for
Teachers." Twenty well-prepared junior high school teachers will carry out
marine research in Boston Harbor, focusing on a topic relevant to its pollution.
Teachers will use a research vessel, oceanographic equipment and laboratory
provided by Project Oceanology, a marine education center, and the University of
Massachusetts/Boston. With the guidance of oceanographers and science educators,
teachers will gain first-hand experience doing scientific research and will
strengthen their understanding of the nature of science. The program will also
help teachers translate their experience into teaching methods and transfer it
to their own classrooms to engage their students in scientific inquiry. The
program includes experimental design, laboratory investigations and field
studies, data collection and analysis, presentation of results, and the design
and testing of student research programs. During 1993 and 1994, teachers will
implement and test student applications of this program in a special summer
session for minority and under-represented students at UMass/Boston and in
programs in their schools. Student programming will be designed and developed
with the mutual support of their colleagues and the supervision of program
staff. The program duration is 3 years, from Nov. 1, 1991 to Sept. 30, 1994.
Non-NSF cost sharing is over 19% of the amount requested from NSF.
