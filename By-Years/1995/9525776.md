The purpose of this project is to investigate the possibility of radar detection
of atmospheric changes resulting from red sprites. Sprites are flashes of light
extending upward from cloud tops into the ionosphere. They occur in association
with large thunderstorm systems. Current theories suggest that sprites are
produced by large electric fields in the upper atmosphere that accelerate
charged particles. These particles produce ionization that may be detectable by
ground-based radar systems. The investigators will deploy a portable radar in
Colorado so that the measurements can be made in coordination with optical
observations as part of a campaign to be conducted in the summer of 1995. They
also intend to make measurements of midlatitude spread F echoes, a recently
discovered phenomenon that only occurs during periods of low solar activity.
These echoes were previously detected by a much larger radar in Japan, but it is
possible that they may also be detectable the portable radar to be used in this
experiment. If successful, these experiments will lead to the development of new
diagnostic techniques for these two atmospheric phenomena.***
