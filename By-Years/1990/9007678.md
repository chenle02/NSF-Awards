A new instruction-level parallel (ILP) architecture called XIMD is proposed.
This architecture model can provide better performance and efficiency for a
broader range of applications than traditional scalar uniprocessors including
pipelined RISC. The XIMD architecture employs multiple functional units and can
support the concurrent execution of a variable number of instruction streams.
The regularity and simplicity of its hardware implementation makes it highly
scalable and retargetable to accommodate diverse application code
characteristics. Currently, the XIMD architecture model is being developed and
evaluated. A functional level simulator for a baseline XIMD architecture is
being implemented. Using this simulator the performance and efficiency of the
XIMD can be quantitatively analyzed. A practical prototype XIMD machine is also
being designed. Implementation feasibility and achievable performance using
currently available parts are being assessed. Compilation methodology and
techniques to support the XIMD architecture model are also being investigated.
