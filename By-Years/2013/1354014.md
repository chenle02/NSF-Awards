Seeds provide the majority of protein and calories in the diets of humans and
livestock and are the primary means of propagation of field crops. Ovules are
the developmental precursors to seeds and knowledge of the control of their
development can enable modification of seed structure to alter stability,
germination, nutrition, and processability, and to eliminate undesirable seeds
from some fruits. While some genes controlling ovule development have been
identified, there are significant gaps in our knowledge of the genetic
regulation of this essential process. The awardees will utilize mutagenesis,
genetics and emerging high-throughput sequencing and analysis methods to
identify novel genes regulating ovule development through screening for
modifiers of existing mutants. Once novel genes are identified, genetic
interactions with known ovule developmental regulators will provide initial
information on how the genes act during morphogenesis. Further analysis will
include evaluation of protein interactions, determination of expression patterns
and, if indicated, protein activity assays. The researchers will use these
results to formulate a more complete picture of molecular regulation of ovule
development and of mechanisms regulating morphogenesis in general.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project spans the areas of genetics, molecular
biology, developmental biology and agriculture, and leverages new concepts in
sequencing and bioinformatics for rapid gene identification. The project will
provide training to junior scientists and students in a research laboratory
setting in genetics, plant biology and the latest methods of gene and sequence
analysis. Outreach efforts will promote interest in science and scientific
research among high school and middle school students at institutions with high
under-represented minority enrollment.
