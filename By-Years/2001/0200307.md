This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled
"Bacterial-fungal interactions: novel signals and response mechanisms that
influence development of bacterial communities in the presence of fungi." In the
natural environment, many microorganisms construct complex communities known as
biofilms. This research focuses on signaling interactions between bacteria and
fungi in the context of biofilms through characterization of multiple bacterial-
fungal pairs. Genetic techniques and microarray analyses are being used to
identify genes involved in dual-species interactions, in order to define
signaling mechanisms important to bacterial-fungal
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
