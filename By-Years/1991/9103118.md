A joint theoretical and experimental study will be made of defects in materials.
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) investigations will be carried out in amorphous
semiconductors, hydrogen-metal systems, and in very small samples at high
pressures. The NMR measurements will be correlated with studies via infrared
spectroscopy, electron scattering, mass spectrometry, electrical conductivity,
etc. A principle goal is to examine the role of hydrogen rearrangements in
changing the properties of amorphous semiconductors and metallic alloys. The
theoretical work still include first principles molecular dynamics simulations
of large supercells of amorphous silicon, hydrogenated amorphous silicon, and
amorphous silicon with a range of dopants. These experimental and theoretical
studies are intended to provide information that will allow a microscopic
understanding of degradations of photovoltaic properties which accompany
exposure to light of a dark-annealed amorphous hydrogenated silicon film. These
degradations currently limit the wide commercial usage of hydrogenated amorphous
silicon solar cells.
