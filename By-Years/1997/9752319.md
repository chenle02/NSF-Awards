The NSF-funded IDEA project has successfully delivered differential equations in
instructional materials over the Internet to students and their instructors
throughout the world. It encompasses classroom exercises, Java applets to
illustrate principles of differential equations, Java code generation
facilities, and Microsoft Windows based differential equations solving software.
The current project is intended to broaden and deepen the scope of IDEA. It will
provide for additional software to solve boundary value problems and partial
differential equations, and to illustrate the solutions graphically. The project
will include continued development of additional exercises from fields as
diverse as mathematics, chemistry, agriculture, and economics. In addition,
there will be an effort to evaluate the usefulness of the realistic problems and
technological tools associated with the project in the classroom.
