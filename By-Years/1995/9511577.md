9511577 O'Loughlin This research investigation uses a political geography
perspective to examine the diffusion of democratic norms and practices across
time and space. The study encompasses the period since the emergence of the
modern nation-state beginning with the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and covers the
subsequent waves of democratization, including the 19th century,
decolonialization in the mid-20th century, and the most recent period of
democratic transition, starting in the 1980s and continuing in the mid-1990s.
This investigation rejects the atomistic frameworks that have been used to date
to study the diffusion of democracy. These frameworks have focused separately on
globalism, regionalism, and localism. Rather, the investigators develop and test
theoretical propositions that integrate all three levels of scale, yet retain a
temporal dimension. The approach integrates internal political economic
processes, regional political economic competition, as well as the impact and
influence of the global political economy upon the spread of democratic norms
and practices. Context sensitive models of this process attuned to the across-
space and over-time variations are developed and tested. Using dynamic
cartographic techniques designed to display quantitative information
intuitively, the investigators show how the ebbs and flows of democratic norms
have regional and local, as well as global causes. Using dynamic space-time
statistical techniques, the investigators develop parameters to describe this
process. The objective is a more complete, contextually informed model of the
ways in which democratic norms and processes have been extended over time and
over space. This investigation will help elaborate how political and economic
changes implicate each other at different levels of scale. It will also
contribute to an understanding of what encourages the development and survival
of democratic norms and rules in new contexts. Importantly, it will al so
address the debate between different views of the sources of democracy,
integrating each into a contextually sensitive perspective that spans the
global, regional, and local scale. ***
