ABSTRACT McDonald This grant will enable the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences to continue to manage U.S. scientific participation in the
International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) through the U.S.
Committee for IIASA, for which it serves as secretariat. IIASA, located near
Vienna, Austria, is a non-governmental multilateral research institution, one of
whose areas of particular emphasis is the human dimensions of global change. The
institute is comprised of 18 National Member Organizations (NMOs), including the
United States, Canada, Japan, Russia, and several Western European countries.
Representatives of these NMOs serve as its governing council. The U.S. National
Committee for IIASA serves as the NMO for the United States. The grant will
support a part time executive secretary to the committee, in addition to
expenses for committee meetings and travel to IIASA, when necessary. It will
also support six new U.S. scientists and engineers per year to participate in
research at IIASA through its Young Summer Scientists Program.
