As robots become more widely available and more capable, end-users of such
consumer robots will inevitably expect to be able to teach robots how to perform
new tasks. Learning from demonstration (or LfD, for short) is a popular paradigm
for this problem, where a user demonstrates how to perform the task, and the
robot learns a policy that captures what sequence of actions to perform to
complete the task. Most existing LfD techniques rely on neural networks to learn
such policies. While promising in some settings, such techniques suffer from key
limitations, such as requiring large amounts of training data and lacking
interpretability. This project's novelties are in addressing these limitations
for robot LfD by combining neural networks (which are very effective for
perception tasks) with symbolic learning, which excels at reasoning skills. The
project's impacts are 1) introducing a new language to seamlessly merge learning
programs consisting of both neural- and symbolic- components, 2) providing
guarantees that the learned programs satisfy desired notions of correctness, and
3) allowing such learning to be performed with more realistic, noisy, real-world
data. The project's contributions also include training and mentoring of
students, developing novel teaching curriculum that integrate robotics with
formal methods, and empowering more scalable, safe, and interpretable learning
for robots.

The research objective of this project is to develop a new LfD paradigm based on
program synthesis, with the goal of putting robot learning on a more formal,
interpretable, and less data-hungry footing. The key intellectual merit of the
project lies in the development of a new set of foundational LfD techniques
based on program synthesis. The project will advance the state-of-the-art in
robot learning from demonstration by making it possible to learn, in a data-
efficient way, programmatic policies that are interpretable and verifiable. The
project will also advance the state-of-the-art in program synthesis by
developing novel techniques that target the unique challenges of the robotics
domain, including noisy and high-dimensional sensor data and uncertain
interactions with the environment. In addition, the project will also advance
the state-of-the-art in verified learning by considering desired correctness
criteria. Finally, the project will make advances in the field of learning from
unlabeled demonstrations by learning robot execution policies in the absence of
a mapping from states to high-level robot actions.
