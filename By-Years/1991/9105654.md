Although steroid ligand receptor interactions are known to be important in
vertebrate embryogenesis and pattern formation, their role in determining the
segmentation pattern of the Drosophila embryo is not as clear. Several proteins
required for embryonic development in Drosophila have homology to vertebrate
steroid receptors, but the ligands for these putative receptors have not yet
been identified. Thus, the biological significance of the homology between the
ligand binding domains in Drosophila and vertebrate proteins remains in
question. This proposal aims to identify the ligand for the putative steroid
receptor in Drosophila encoded by the tailless gene. Using a genetic assay for
the functional activation of the tailless protein, ten different steroids will
be tested for their effects on the segmentation pattern of Drosophila embryos.
Upon the identification of a putative ligand for the tailless receptor, the
activation of genes regulated by tailless will be measured in the presence of
the tailless ligand. Using this approach, it will be possible to elucidate more
easily the role of steroid receptor ligand interactions in embryonic pattern
formation through the application of Drosophila molecular genetics.
