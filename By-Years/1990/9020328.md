The goal of this research is to develop a detailed, quantitative,
experimentally verified model of the chip breaking process using high pressure,
two-phase coolant. The chip control system injects this high pressure, two-phase
stream of cutting fluid into the chip formation zone. The fluid stream breaks
the forming chip into short segments. While this process is relatively simple in
practice, the details of it are not known. The research is aimed at developing a
fundamental understanding of this new chip control scheme by postulating an
appropriate model. The analytical model will relate the chip breaking process to
machining and chip control system conditions. The end result of this research
will be an experimentally verified model which can be used to predict broken
chip length given work material properties, cutting conditions, and coolant and
coolant flow characteristics. Further, the experimental work will include
measurements of machined surface finish and cutting tool wear. These results
will be useful in themselves and will also indicate the extent of the effects of
the chip control system on the chip formation process.
