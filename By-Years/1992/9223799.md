This is a study of the effect of power differentials in exchanges, the
influence of different social network structures, and alternative strategies of
interaction. The first of two phases will use computer simulations to extend
Network Exchange Theory to effects of different strategic approaches by actors.
A second part of the research will use laboratory experiments on exchange
between human beings to explore these issues in social networks chosen to permit
comparative tests of competing theories. This study is important for two
reasons. First, it significantly extends existing research on power in social
exchange, which has considerable application in several fields of social
science. Second, it is an innovative combination of two distinctive approaches,
computer simulation and laboratory social psychology.
