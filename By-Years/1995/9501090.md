This award supports research on the representation theory of finite groups and
group cohomology. The principal investigator will work on: (1) functors on
categories constructed from bisets; (2) Alperin's conjecture for specific
classes of groups; (3) development of computer software for representation
theory; (4) Broue's conjecture on isotypies of blocks; (5) the structure of
Brown's complex of p-groups. The two conjectures mentioned are considered
fundamental in the representation theory of finite groups, and solutions of
either of these would have considerable ramifications in ths area. The research
supported concerns the representation theory of finite groups. A group is an
algebraic object used to study transformations. Because of this, groups are a
fundamental tool in physics, chemistry, computer science, and biology as well as
mathematics. Representation theory is an important method for determining the
structure of groups.
