In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Burrow and Jordan (at the Universities of Nebraska and Pittsburgh,
respectively) will continue joint experimental and theoretical studies of low-
energy electron scattering from a number of hydrocarbons. Experimental studies
at both institutions will examine vibrational excitation and angular
distributions using photoelectron spectroscopy to locate temporary anion states
(resonances). Jordan will calculate the location of resonances at Pittsburgh,
first using ethylene and propene as model systems, and then applying those
results to methyl and ethyl chloride. %%% A powerful means of visualizing
molecular structure and chemical reactivity is provided by the concept of
occupied and unoccupied electron states, which are also known as orbitals.
Photoelectron spectroscopy has long provided a means of studying occupied
orbitals, but until recently the corresponding data for normally unoccupied
orbitals has been scarce. This work aims at gathering such data, thereby helping
to answer key chemical questions on structure and bonding in complex molecules.
It also offers data crucial to models of electron transfer, which is the
mechanism involved in a large number of chemical processes such as
photosynthesis.
