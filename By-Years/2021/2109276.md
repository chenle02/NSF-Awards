A team from the California Institute of Technology will build a full picture for
the formation and early evolution of the most commonly occurring planets found
around nearby stars. Over the past two decades, surveys have shown that planet
formation is efficient across the Galaxy. The most common mode of planet
formation appears to generate planets a few times larger than Earth, with
orbital periods smaller than one year. Scientists have further shown that
systems of planets outside our Solar System exhibit a uniform pattern in their
orbits and masses. The project will build a model for the formation and early
evolution of these planets. The program will involve public engagement, training
of graduate students, and collaborations with teachers and students from local
high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research program will quantify
the dynamical instability-driven early evolution of Super-Earths, with an eye
towards identifying scattering mechanisms, modeling physical consequences, and
compiling the associated observational predictions. First and foremost, the
execution of this work will answer the fundamental question of how orbital
instabilities among sub-Jovian planets are activated in the proportion needed to
explain their period ratio distribution. Second, the investigators will
determine whether or not instability-driven sculpting can satisfy existing
observational constraints. The investigators will determine how tidal
dissipation and interactions of planets with leftover debris shape the current
architectures of sub-Jovian extrasolar planetary
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
