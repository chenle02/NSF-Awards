The medium of small pore zeolites exhibits shape - selectivity, which has been
exploited commercially in processes such as the catalytic production of
p-xylene, the dewaxing of fuel and lube oils, and the absorptive separation of
linear paraffins. When the guest molecules are comparable in diameters to the
channels, diffusion takes place by configurational diffusion, which is poorly
understood. The diffusion of n-paraffins with carbon numbers in the range of
30-100 is important in the lube and fuel oil dewaxing process to lower pour
point for cold weather uses. This project proposes an associated theoretical and
experimental program to study the conformation of n-paraffin chains and their
creeping diffusion in zeolite channels. The experiment concerns the diffusivity
and cracking rates of n-5. The experiments will be compared with a new
theoretical approach, "reptation theory" recommended by de Genne for diffusion
in polymer melts. The theoretical program (supported elsewhere) studies the
conformation of paraffin chains by Monte Carlo methods, the energy changes
associated with the creeping motion of chains and the temperature effects, and
to proposes diffusion models that may be termed the "Snake-in-Maze" model.
