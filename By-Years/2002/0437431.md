Key individuals from the petrotechnical community will describe relevant best
practices and will provide a forward-looking view of the challenges and
opportunities in extending high-temperature, high pressure drilling technologies
toward fit-for-purpose applicability to enhanced geothermal recovery efforts. An
important element of each presentation will be devoted to needed research and
development in the topical area, especially that R&D that could be undertaken in
a deep underground science and technology laboratory (DUSEL) facility.

There will be ample time for questions and interaction between the
petrotechnical, geothermal and rock mechanics representatives, and the R&D
experts invited. A designated rapporteur will summarize the session in the wrap-
up session. Electronic copies of presentations and discussion will be assembled
into a report that will be available on the Web and in hard copy.

This project will advance the field of geo-engineering and rock mechanics by
identifying for consideration needed research, some of which might be undertaken
at the proposed deep underground science and engineering laboratory. In the
high-temperature, high-pressure drilling arena, research advances would open the
way for exploitation of geothermal energy resources.
