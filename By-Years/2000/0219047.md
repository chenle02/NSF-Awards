Software systems have become increasingly complex, and are expected
to&lt;br/&gt;provide service over wide operating ranges. To meet service
goals,&lt;br/&gt;software developers provide many tuning parameters that must
be&lt;br/&gt;set carefully for the system to provide acceptable performance
and&lt;br/&gt;functionality. Tuning these parameters adequately often requires
extensive&lt;br/&gt;trial-and-error experimentation by system administrators. As
workloads and&lt;br/&gt;operating conditions continually change, the parameters
must be endlessly&lt;br/&gt;re-tuned to provide good
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will apply feedback
control to automate this&lt;br/&gt;parameter tuning loop in two example systems.
The first, a wide-area&lt;br/&gt;replicated file system, provides variable
consistency and performance&lt;br/&gt;through optimistic concurrency control.
Feedback will be used to schedule&lt;br/&gt;replica reconciliation and data
migration to provide acceptable&lt;br/&gt;performance and consistency to end
users. The second system, a database&lt;br/&gt;engine, offers a large variety of
tuning parameters to be considered.&lt;br/&gt;Feedback control will be used to
enable database administrators to manage&lt;br/&gt;the growing complexity of
their server systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; From these two examples and other
work, a framework for feedback control of&lt;br/&gt;dynamic computing systems
will begin to emerge. This framework will enable&lt;br/&gt;future computing
systems to offer reliable and robust operation and&lt;br/&gt;predictable
performance, without costly maintenance and continual
manual&lt;br/&gt;tuning.&lt;br/&gt;
