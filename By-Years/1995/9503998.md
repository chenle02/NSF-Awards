Brooks 9503998 The objective of this proposal is the development novel and
efficient computational approaches to free energy perturbation (FEP)
calculations. FEP calculations, carried out extensively on high performance
parallel computing systems, hold a great potential for assisting the unraveling
of questions regarding structure, dynamics and thermodynamics of biological
macromolecules. In this project they will (a) explore the development of new
extended sytem methods for chemical FEP calculations which allow the
conventional variables associated with "progress" in the chemical coordinates to
evolve dynamically; (b) systematically determine an umbrella or biasing
potential used in sampling, (c) develop new techiques to further extend and
automate the processing methods and advance the error analysis capabilities of
weighted histogram analysis method.
