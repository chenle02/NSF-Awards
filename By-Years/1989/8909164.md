Dr. Juraska will continue her work on sex differences in the rat cerebral
cortex. These structures are important for understanding the basis of cognitive
learning abilities. She will combine neuroanatomical analyses with perinatal
hormonal manipulations to investigate how widespread sex differences are in
mammalian brain, how hormones influence the development of sex differences, and
the implications of sex differences for normal brain function. There are
dramatic sex differences in developmental pathologies such as the learning
disorder dyslexia, and it has been suggested that testosterone in early
development may play a role in this syndrome. Dr. Juraska will also examine the
possibility of sex differences in the connectivity of the cortex by mapping the
distribution of neurons that project through the corpus callosum, the major
track that connects the right and left hemispheres. Her results will have
important implications for understanding the importance of lateralization and
its relationship to possible sex differences in verbal and spatial learning
abilities in humans.
