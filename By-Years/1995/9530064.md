Nunez This proposal will assemble a team of scientists for a three day workshop
in Argentina to discuss the organization of a proposal to the IAI for a Research
Center to investigate the modeling and prediction of the ENSO phenomenon and its
regional consequences for Southern South America. The Research Center would
consist of the following core institutions: CIMA, the Center for Marine and
Atmospheric Research of the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina; CPTEC, the
Center for Weather Prediction and Climate Studies of the National Space Research
Institute of Brazil; the Cooperative Institute for Climate Studies of the
University of Maryland; and the Cooperative Institute for Research in the
Environmental Sciences of NOAA in Colorado. This proposal explicitly includes
participants from Argentina, Brazil, and the United States. The workshop will
also include other participants from Uruguay and Paraguay. These countries are
all members of the IAI, an initiative to stimulate global change research among
the scientific institutions of the Americas. The National Science Foundation is
the designated U.S. Government agency to carry out the U.S. responsibilities
within the IAI. %%% This proposal will assemble a team of scientists for a three
