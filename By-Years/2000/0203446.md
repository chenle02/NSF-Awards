0203446&lt;br/&gt;Michael Georgiopoulos&lt;br/&gt;University of Central
Florida&lt;br/&gt;Orlando, FL&lt;br/&gt;"Machine Learning Advances for
Engineering Education"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, at the University of
Central Florida (UCF), integrates research results from the theory and
applications of Machine Learning into the Engineering/Computer Science
curricula. Two new courses and several revised courses include material from
Adaptive Reasoning Theory, Genetic Algorithms, Human Behavior Representation,
and Simulation Meta-modeling. The objectives of this CRCD project include: 1.
Incorporating current state-of-the-art Machine Learning research results into
the undergraduate and first year graduate curriculum to enhance students'
critical thinking, intellectual growth and communication skills, 2. Offering a
unique curriculum, by traditional undergraduate standards, where the PIs
integrate their current research results into the curriculum. This curriculum is
timely and dynamic, reflecting the PIs' and the machine learning community's
research interest changes with time, 3. Offering the opportunity to a multi-
disciplinary group of students (spanning the spectrum of electrical, computer,
industrial, civil, mechanical, and computer science students) to benefit from
research and its transfer into curricula, 4. Assessing and evaluating the
educational impact of the project through a sequence of carefully chosen
evaluation instruments developed by an educational consultant, and 5.
Disseminating the curriculum development efforts to a number of affiliate
Universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
