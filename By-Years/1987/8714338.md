The theory of nonlinear wave equations has long played a prominent role in
physics and applied mathematics, for instance in theories of gases and liquids,
in the theory of elementary particles, and in cosmology. Their mathematical
study goes back to Riemann, but methods of analysis were not sufficiently
developed for a systematic study until the 1960's. In this decade there were
several major breakthroughs, including the beginnings of theories of global
existence, blow up, solitons, scattering, the inverse scattering method, and
shock waves. The subject has continued to undergo rapid change. Major
developments in the 1980's have included the study of important special systems
like the Minkowski-Yang-Mills equations and the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, the
development of a stability theory of solitary waves, and general results on
solutions of small amplitude and on the propagation of weak singularities. This
conference will be devoted to nonlinear wave equations. Walter A. Strauss, one
of the principal architects of the subject, will be the main speaker and will
deliver a series of ten lectures.
