Neuhoff&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0336906&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minerals containing molecular
water are important phases at shallow levels in Earth's crust. Quantitative
models of the stability of these minerals are necessary for predicting their
role in the overall geochemical behavior of the earth; however, the fact that
molecular water readily enters and leaves these minerals complicates such
models. This research project addresses this difficulty through experimental
determination of the effects of hydration and dehydration on the stability of
zeolites, which are one of the most abundant types of water-bearing minerals.
This is accomplished through direct observations of the water content of
zeolites as a function of temperature and humidity, and direct measurements of
the heat consumed or produced as these minerals hydrate and dehydrate.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the proposed study include integrated
research and educational experiences derived from the direct involvement of
graduate and undergraduate students, who will receive training and experience in
modern experimental methods and thermodynamic analysis. In addition, the methods
of the proposed study will be used to develop innovative classroom exercises to
give students hands-on experience in thermochemical methods in the P.I.'s
physical geochemistry course. Data generated in the study will be disseminated
not only as publications in international scholarly journals, but will also be
available for free download on the Internet, thereby contributing to the
infrastructure of science. The resultant data will have application not only in
geochemistry, but also in materials science (where zeolites are important
catalysts and sorbent materials).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
