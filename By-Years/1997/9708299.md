9708299 DaSilva The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae is a very important industrial
microorganism, and a key laboratory microorganism for understanding eucaryotic
cell processes. The strains employed range from genetically well-characterized
haploid or diploid strains to the relatively uncharacterized industrial
polyploid strains. The ability to introduce stable foreign genes at optimum copy
number is extremely important, and the ability to engineer the metabolism of
this yeast has tremendous potential. Straightforward methods to stably insert a
series of the same or different genes at precise copy numbers have not been
developed, and the regulated insertion of multiple genes into the industrially
important polyploid yeast has not been addressed. This project addresses these
needs by developing and applying methods for the sequential integration of
pathway and product genes in both laboratory and industrial (including
polyploid) yeast strains. The knowledge to be obtained is to contribute to the
improvement of recombinant yeast expression systems, and may provide insight
into integration methods of higher eucaryotic cells. ***
