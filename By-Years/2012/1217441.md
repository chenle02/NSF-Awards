The Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) and its collaborators are
conducting a set of research and development activities focusing on early
childhood astronomy in the first field-wide effort to increase the capacity of
informal science education (ISE) institutions to effectively engage their
youngest visitors (ages 3 - 5) in astronomy. Leading the project is an Action
Research Group comprised of the ASP; experts in cognitive development, early
childhood, and astronomy learning progressions from UC Santa Cruz, Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo, and Penn State; and the Lawrence Hall of Science at UC Berkeley,
Children?s Discovery Museum of San Jose, and San Luis Obispo Children?s Museum
as sites for research, field testing, and implementation.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The project will identify critical areas of focus for early childhood
astronomy and will test the hypothesis that early astronomy learning is not only
possible but may contribute to a more sophisticated understanding of the domain.
A key question is: How can the ISE field scaffold children's early curiosity and
ideas about astronomy to position them for greater understanding and interest in
the topic? The results of the research and the materials that are created for
educators will receive broad distribution nationally.
