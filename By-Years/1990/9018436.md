Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University is establishing the Charles
Minor Engineering Fellowship Program to encourage women, minorities, and persons
with disabilities to pursue a Ph.D. in engineering. Nine departments within the
College of Engineering will compete internally for Charles Minor Engineering
Fellowships. The project director of the Fellowship Program is Dean of the
College of Engineering. An advisory committee and a selection committee will
assist him. Once named a fellow, each student will be assigned a mentor, and
fellows will be assured of support throughout their academic career. An
aggressive ten-step recruitment plan for potential applicants has been
developed. Two important initiatives include (1) locating Tech alumni and (2)
approaching corporations and federal agencies that employ large numbers of
engineers.
