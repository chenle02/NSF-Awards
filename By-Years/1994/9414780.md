9414780 Garg As man-made systems such as automated factories, communication
networks, and computers continue to grow in size, "cut and try" approaches to
design and supervision become less realistic. What is needed instead are
controller synthesis techniques that allow optimal control laws to be derived
mathematically and with performance properties that can be verified
automatically. A well-established framework exists for control of systems
without explicit real-time constraints. However, if timing is of concern in the
system dynamics and its performance specification then the situation becomes
much more complex. Certain real-time discrete event systems can be described by
linear equations in a non-traditional algebraic system called max-algebra. For
these systems, the problem of supervisory control is to impose delays on the
execution of selected events to achieve some specified performance goal. The
objective of the proposed research is to examine the existence and synthesis of
controllers for DES which include such time constraints. Our method relies on
the max-algebra model for timed DES which permits control theory results for
untimed DES to be related to timed systems. ***
