This project will study the development of socio-economic class distinctions in
a fishing community in Spain. The investigators will look at the conversion of
small-scale, community relations into larger-scale business relations in a
context of rapid economic development of the Spanish fishing industry. Methods
to be used include in-depth interviews, work- and life-histories, participant-
observation, and analysis of business and public documents. This research is
important because the conversion of community- based solidary personal
relationships into relatively impersonal business-oriented relationships is
something that has happened all over the world. Most people appreciate the
productivity and efficiency of "business" while lamenting the lost closeness and
supportiveness of "community". Increased understanding of the social and
cultural processes involved can help us retain the valued parts of the
relationships.
