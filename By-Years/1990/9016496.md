The project will investigate transverse flow and lateral spread in sheet
rolling in order to improve our understanding of the shape changes that occur in
conventional sheet rolling. The aim is to formulate an analytical theory for
shape rolling which can be used to develop approximate models of three-
dimensional sheet rolling that can be solved rapidly enough to be used in
rolling mill control systems. Although sheet metal is widely used by industry,
it is very difficult to produce highly uniform sheet metal with minimal defects.
In order to do so, sensing and control of the rolling parameters is required.
Existing analysis techniques are too slow and complex to be used at normal
industrial production speeds. The work will develop a simplified but accurate
analytical model which can be effective in high speed rolling.
