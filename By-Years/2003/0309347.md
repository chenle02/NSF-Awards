This study is designed to distinguish the relative roles of climatic factors and
soil properties in determining the outcome of competition among tree and
grassland species at the borders of subalpine meadows in mountain regions of the
southwestern US. The investigators will conduct observational studies along
natural environmental gradients and will perform field experiments to
distinguish the effects of cold air drainage vs. soil fertility on tree seedling
survival and competition with grasses. They will also develop historical
reconstructions of landscape dynamics to complement the gradient and
experimental studies. The project results could help to explain historical
trends in tree-line (grassland-woodland boundaries) migration in relation to
land use practices and climate.
