The study of relativistic theories of fluids will be analyzed in detail,
including its fundamental properties regarding stability, causality, and
hyperbolicity. Studies in the area of relativistic dissipative fluids will
examine the connection between hyperbolicity in a fluid theory and the existence
of an upper limit for continuous shock solutions. Gravitational effects on the
vacuum decay rate, and gravitational effects caused by vacuum decay, will also
be studied. The interior structure of charged black holes will be more
accurately modeled by including the effects of charged particle production. This
investigation will help clarify whether black hole interiors contain all-
encompassing crushing singularities, or whether matter could conceivably escape
destruction and emerge into "another" universe.
