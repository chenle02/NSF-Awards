Numerous databases, rich media archives, and educational projects focused on
animal behavior are now Internet-accessible. However, each site has adopted its
own vocabulary for cataloging its resources and there is currently no mechanism
to translate between them. This project funds two successive workshops to create
an international metadata standard that will allow users to search across all of
these sites and locate similar resources regardless of local catalog names and
structures. The meetings will convene experts in animal behavior, zoo
management, conservation, and metadata architecture to create a draft standard
and design protocols for crosstalk between each database and the standard. The
drafts will be circulated through relevant newsletters, journals, and at society
meetings worldwide for review and comment. The second workshop will pool
comments from all of these sources into a final draft to be mounted on multiple
websites and advertised in suitable journals. This project is a key step towards
providing worldwide but integrated access to the increasing diversity of animal
behavior archives by students, educators, researchers, conservation and wildlife
management staff, zoos and aquaria, and both public and commercial media.
