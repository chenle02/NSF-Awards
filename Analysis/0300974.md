This project is centered around issues related to localization type effects for
ergodic Schroedinger operators and the study of anomalous quantum transport in
the quasiperiodic and Anderson model-type settings. It involves the continuing
development of non-perturbative methods for the proofs of localization and other
properties as well as studying phenomena that demonstrate the limitations of
non-perturbative results. Another major goal is the development of methods to
study anomalous quantum transport to be applied to both deterministic and random
potentials.

Our research concerns the anomalous spectral and diffusive properties of
quasiperiodic and other deterministic and random structures. This is therefore
research on the fundamental properties of disordered systems that serve as
models of systems with impurities. Deterministic ergodic, particularly
quasiperiodic, potentials are often used to model quasicrystals. Study of the
spectral and quantum transport properties of the microscopic models is important
to understand and interpret much of the experimental data on quasicrystals. Such
understanding may lead to finding new materials with desired physical
properties. Disordered systems are also used in modeling many other micro and
macro effects: from quantum localization to earthquakes. The proposed topics
include studying properties of both highly and weakly disordered systems of
Quantum Mechanics that demonstrate certain anomalous behavior.
