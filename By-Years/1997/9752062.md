This two-year project encompasses curriculum development, faculty enhancement
and instrumentation and laboratory improvement. It provides continuity in hands-
on training in advanced manufacturing at the secondary and postsecondary levels
and links with manufacturers in order to create a skilled workforce that can
compete in a global manufacturing environment. Curriculum development activities
include the creation of two advanced manufacturing courses that provide hands-on
experience with state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing equipment. The project
addresses the need for "recruiting" secondary students into manufacturing
technology careers by developing a course for high school students that provides
manufacturing career information and exposure to manufacturing technology design
and implementation processes. A summer camp for middle school students provides
them with exposure to manufacturing technology and careers in manufacturing.
Professional development experiences are provided for middle school and high
school manufacturing technology teachers, high school guidance counselors,
technical college faculty from throughout South Carolina, and manufacturing
employees who need to upgrade their skills.
