In this CAREER award, the investigator will study how African American and
Latino middle and high school students construct their sense of self-identity
with and in mathematics and the role that teachers play in helping to shape
those self-opinions. This is important because many students, particularly in
urban settings, have a poor sense of their own potential in mathematics learning
which restricts their attainment in high school and future college studies. If
researchers can better understand how students form these opinions of their own
abilities, future programs could be designed to improve this
situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has two specific research
objectives: (1) to examine how teacher socialization messages in urban math
classrooms relate to students' construction of math identities, and (2) to trace
how math identities form and change over time, from middle school to the
transition into high school. This project will also model how these various
identities predict math achievement outcomes. Survey methodology, semi-
structured interviews, and cognitive assessments will be employed to address
these objectives. For his CAREER award education plan, the investigator proposes
to train undergraduate students to mentor urban middle school students around
math identity building and self-efficacy issues. Results of this research will
be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles and conferences and
presentations.
