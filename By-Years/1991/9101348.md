Professor Price will consider some questions in the theory of operator algebras
related to the index theory for semigroups of endomorphisms. In this work
Professor Price will continue his work with Jorgensen on their extension of the
Arveson-Powers index to a setting which assigns an index to certain derivations
on operator algebras. He expects to continue his work with Powers on a related
problem of analyzing the generator extensions of the second quantization of a
symmetric unbounded operator. He also will study isomorphism invariants for a
class of operator algebras whose structure resembles that of a one parameter
family of Cuntz algebras. Finally Price will continue his project of acquainting
undergraduates with certain research topics involving operator algebras.
Professor Price's project involves self-adjoint operator algebras. These objects
consist of families of Hilbert space operators (infinite matrices of complex
numbers) which have an interesting property: the algebra is generated by
operators whose value in any state on the algebra is a real number. This
property makes these algebras important for physics and indeed physics was the
original motivation for their study.
