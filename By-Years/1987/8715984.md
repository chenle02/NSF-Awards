The "Conference on the Genetics and Evolutionary Biology of "Meiotic Drive" will
be held in Honolulu, Hawaii during January 6-8, 1988. Investigators from
different sub-disciplines of biology and using different experimental organisms
will have the opportunity to discuss their results with each other as well as
with students. Understanding this fundamental genetic mechanism is important for
several reasons related to understanding genetic mechanisms and evolutionary
considerations, but because meiotic drive can confer advantages upon specific
gametes it may also become relevant to economic considerations.
