The manner in which internal waves interact through flux divergences at critical
layers to drive cross-stream circulations and geostrophic accelerations of the
background flow will be investigated. This interaction will be studied
analytically by setting internal waves with a Garrett-Munk spectrum in
vertically and horizontally sheared geostrophic flows such as narrow and broad
jets.
