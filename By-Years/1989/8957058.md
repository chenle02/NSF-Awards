Meng This research focuses on architectures and applications for digital signal
processing (DSP). A specific goal is a machine vision system for optical
lithography alignment using DSP techniques. To accomplish this goal, new
adaptive filtering techniques for edge and line detection and overlay
measurements are being developed. To help with the design of the algorithm, a
high-level simulator for evaluating algorithms is being developed to run on a
distrubutive system. Research is concentrating on automated gate-level synthesis
of efficient hazard-free asynchronous circuits (using standard cell libraries),
developing a unified approach to synchronous and asynchronous circuit synthesis,
and integration of synthesis and verification of both synchronous and
asynchronous designs into the same toolset.
