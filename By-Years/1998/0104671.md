"Kinetic City After School" is a two-year project that will produce a web-based
after-school program for children ages 9-11. The on-line adventure will enable
users to enter a virtual universe where a computer virus (Deep Delete)
systematically attacks a new area of science each month (analogous to one of the
12 Project 2061 Benchmarks for Science Literacy). As students battle the virus,
they learn Benchmarks learning goals. Each unit invites children to think about
the problem, take action and reflect on their experience. The activities
accommodate different learning styles and are supplemented by live audio chats
with scientists and a self-assessment enables students to earn Kinetic City
Power Points. Power Points can be donated to after school programs without
computers and Internet access. These sites may in turn, exchange their
accumulated Power Points to obtain computers, Internet service and a site
license for "Kinetic City After School." Although the program is web-based, most
of the activity extensions are done off-line. "Kinetic City After School" will
be introduced to after-school sites with a two-day training workshop, with
follow-up via phone meetings and site visits. Supporting materials will include
a Leader Guide, Journal and Kinetic City Home Crew activity pages for use in the
home.
