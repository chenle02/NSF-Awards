The objective of this project is to investigate a new sampling technology that
could serve as a useful alternative to ceramic cup or hollow fiber technology
when sampling for ions. The new method will allow determination of the mobile
ion composition of soil solid and solution phases in a single, insitu ,
operation, ideal for routine monitoring of contaminant transport through soils,
and for evaluating the efficacy of soil-cleanup procedures.
