This research program is designed to add to our understanding of the
neurobiological basis of memory. Dr. Jarrard is examining the types of memory
deficit which occur when a very specific part of the brain sustains damage.
While there is considerable evidence that this region of the brain, the
hippocampus, is important in the formation of memories, the exact nature of this
involvement is not yet known. The long history of the search for the memory
trace, or "engram," is filled with attempts to attach functional relevance to
many different parts of the brain. Unfortunately, most of this previous work has
been performed using mechanical or electrical lesions, that is, a rather
imprecise part of the brain had been damaged. Dr. Jarrard has developed a new
technique which uses specific neurotoxins for selectively depleting nerve cells
within the hippocampus, but which spares nerve fibers. The result of this
procedure is that the overall damage to the hippocampus is markedly reduced. As
a consequence, functional specificity can be attributed to groups of nerve cells
within this brain area. The knowledge gained from these experiments provides us
with a better understanding of how the hippocampus is involved in learning and
memory. At the human level, the hippocampus is often found to be damaged in
patients with Alzheimer's Disease, those who have suffered from stroke, in some
types of epilepsy, in perinatal asphyxia, and in postoperative complications
resulting from cardiothoracic surgery. As a result of this hippocampal damage,
there is a problem in learning and remembering new information. The research
being conducted by Dr. Jarrard is not only adding to what is known about how the
brain controls learning and memory, but is also adding to our understanding of a
part of the brain often associated with memory problems in humans.
