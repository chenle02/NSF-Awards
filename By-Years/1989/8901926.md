The Hawaii Institute of Geophysics at the University of Hawaii will acquire
several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared
use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with
the research vessel MOANA WAVE that the institution operates. A substantial part
of the ships' operating schedule during 1989 is in support of NSF-sponsored
research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of
the ships and of the institution to support research and engineering activities.
The instrumentation includes: -A Cesium beam frequency standard to enhance
precision navigation capabilities, -a digital gravity meter upgrade for
detecting variations in the earth's gravitational field, -a survey quality LORAN
radionavigation receiver, -a pair of two-channel slip rings for the
oceanographic winch, and -a large format digitizing tablet for transcribing
bathymetric and other maps of the seafloor. The University of Hawaii is
providing considerable cost sharing for acquiring this equipment. The
instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the Institution
to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
