The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will reduce energy consumption in buildings and
automobiles via 'smart' solar control window films. The effects of solar heating
are frequently experienced on sunny warm days when the inside temperature of a
car can exceed 130Â°F in minutes. The same solar heating that is such a nuisance
in summer is very much desired in winter. The national problem is that buildings
consume more than 41% of all energy produced (more than 50% directly for
heating, cooling, and lighting) which leads to an estimated 2,236M metric tons
of greenhouse gases. Additionally, 80% of buildings that exist today will exist
in 20 years, many of which are inefficient and outdated. This necessitates a
retrofittable smart solar control film. The consequence of installing smart
solar control film is that the sun's warmth can be harnessed when it is needed
and reflected away when it is unneeded. Installing these highly transparent
films will have significant energy savings in space heating, cooling, and
lighting. If smart solar control films are implemented, the Department of Energy
estimates as much as 1.0 quadrillion BTUs ($10B in cost savings) can be saved
annually.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on
commercializing a family of doped nanoceramic materials that exhibit near-room
temperature metal-to-insulator phase transitions. Slight changes to the
composition of matter produce remarkably tunable thermochromic transitions over
a broad range of temperatures, filling a key technological gap for their
deployment as a smart solar control window film. No visible change occurs during
the transition from the low-temperature/infrared transparent (insulating-like
phase) to the high-temperature/infrared reflective (metal-like phase), and vice
versa. The nanomaterials are also of sufficient stability, optical clarity, and
compatible with commonly used polymers found in film. Phase II efforts address
optimizing the composition of matter for peak performance and developing a
unique in-line nanomanufacturing process compatible with scalable production and
achieving more precise control. In order for these materials to perform
correctly they need to be of the correct elemental composition and be in the
form of nanoparticles of the correct size. The films will be optimized and then
thoroughly tested in the laboratory and in the field for their performance,
stability, optical clarity, and a wide variety of application-specific
performance requirements.
