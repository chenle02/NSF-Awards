The study of hydrogen isotopic fractionations during its incorporation into
plant biomass may have important applications in plant biochemistry, physiology,
physiological ecology and several other fields. Of particular interest in this
proposal is the deuterium enrichment observed in non-exchangeable hydrogens of
cellulose from CAM plants. Evidence is presented showing that biochemical
reactions are responsible for this deuterium enrichment. The objective of the
experiments outlined in this proposal is to determine which metabolic pathway is
responsible for deuterium enrichment in CAM plants. Whole plant and tissue
culture experiments are proposed here. The results of these experiments will
determine whether deuterium enrichment can occur during the glycolysis-
gluconeogenesis cycle found in CAM plants. An increased knowledge of the
processes responsible for deuterium enrichment in CAM plants will be significant
in the study of carbohydrate pools and source sink relations. More broadly, the
results of this study will have important applications in the study of
photosynthetic systems in relation to environmental parameters.
