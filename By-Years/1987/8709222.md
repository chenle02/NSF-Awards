The structure of the flagella (swimming organelles) and associated subcellular
components will be examined in golden algae by Dr. Robert Andersen of DePaul
University. These algae are photosynthetic organisms, but they have cell
cytoskeleton features similar to animals. The combination of photosynthetic and
cytoskeletal features with the small size and rapid growth of the organisms
makes the golden algae a good experimental model system where the results can
aid in our understanding plants and animals. Two techniques, electron microscopy
and monoclonal antibody immunofluorescent studies, will be employed.
Microtubules, which are major components of flagella and cell cytoskeletons,
will be identified using a fluorescent stain conjugated to tubulin protein
molecules. The position of microtubules in "ordinary" cells will be compared to
the position of microtubules in dividing cells. Furthermore, as one cell divides
into two cells, the developmental process of producing two flagellar apparatuses
and two cytoskeletons will be investigated. Electron microscopy will be employed
to provide fine details of these structures and processes. The findings should
help us better understand the structure and change in structure of flagellar
apparatuses and cytoskeletons in golden algae. In addition, the findings should
also help us better understand evolutionary relationships among these and other
algae.
