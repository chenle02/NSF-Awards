This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at San Jose State University in
San Jose, California will provide scholarships and support services to
academically-talented students pursing graduate engineering degrees who
demonstrate financial need. This project called the Silicon Valley Innovation
and Entrepreneurship Scholarships (SVIES) Program will provide graduate students
of the College of Engineering with opportunities to learn about innovation and
entrepreneurship, equips them with methods facilitating innovation, and matches
them with Silicon Valley innovators and entrepreneurs as mentors.
Entrepreneurship and innovation are critical factors in a thriving economy. This
project will develop entrepreneurial skills in engineering students from
financially disadvantaged backgrounds. The program will expand the career
options of talented low-income engineering students who may have otherwise been
unfamiliar with opportunities and methods of technological entrepreneurism and
innovation.

The goal of the San Jose State University (SJSU) Silicon Valley Innovation and
Entrepreneurship Scholarships Program is to increase the nation's capacity to
produce technological innovations that drive economic growth. The scholarship
recipients will form a learning community and engage in joint study of
successful Silicon Valley technological innovations and entrepreneurs and in
team practice of the lessons learned. With direct mentoring from Silicon Valley
innovators and entrepreneurs and seven SJSU College of Engineering faculty
members, SVIES scholars will develop their innovation mindsets, acquire
innovation and entrepreneurship skills, and have the opportunity to incorporate
innovation and entrepreneurship into their career plans. The project will help
talented engineering students from low-income backgrounds to become effective
technological entrepreneurs. Evaluation and assessment will focus on measuring
and documenting learning outcomes in high-level competencies associated with
innovation and entrepreneurism. These outcomes include: the mindset of
innovation and entrepreneurship, knowledge of the need-idea-venture process, and
ability to innovate, create and refine a technological invention; develop a
business plan and launch a new business venture. Lessons learned and best
practices that emerge from the program evaluation data will be disseminated
widely to the engineering education community.
