In this project, the investigator and his colleagues will develop, analyze, and
implement quasi-optimal adaptive hybridized Discontinuous Galerkin methods for
acoustic and electromagnetic scattering problems as described by the Helmholtz
equation and the time-harmonic Maxwell equation on bounded domains in two and
three dimensional domains using general local bases. These methods feature
traditional piecewise polynomial bases as well as special purpose wave elements,
and multilevel preconditioned iterative solvers on adaptively refined
simplicial, quadrilateral, and hexahedral meshes. The adaptive mesh refinement
is driven by residual-type a posteriori error estimators. In particular, the
team will prove convergence of the adaptive solution process as well as its
quasi-optimality in terms of the computational complexity with respect to a
properly specified approximation class. High quality software implementations
will be used to test the algorithms and inform the analysis.

Advances in the state of the art in numerical methods for performing acoustic
and electromagnetic simulations have potentially high impact in several
applications. As an example more accurate simulation of acoustic wave
propagation can be used to considerably enhance resolution of medical ultra
sound scans, and thus expand the reach of non-invasive diagnostics. The emphasis
of this project is the development of novel numerical methods that compute
provably accurate approximations of physical acoustics and electromagnetics
phenomena.
