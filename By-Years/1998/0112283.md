This is a proposal to investigate the ecological physiology of overwintering
hatchlings of the North American painted turtle (Chrysemys picta). This widely-
distributed and abundant species has become a model organism for studies on the
ecology and evolution of freshwater chelonians. The natural history of painted
turtles differs from that of most other species in an important respect,
however. Whereas neonates of other aquatic turtles usually emerge from their
nest in late summer or autumn and move to a nearby marsh, lake, or stream to
spend their first winter, hatchling painted turtles typically remain inside
their shallow, subterranean nest throughout their first winter and do not come
above ground until the following spring. This behavior commonly causes neonatal
painted turtles at northern localities to be exposed during winter to ice and
cold with temperatures in some nests going below -10oC. Many hatchlings
withstand such exposure and emerge from their nest when the ground finally thaws
in the spring.

Hatchlings tolerate the cold of mid-winter by becoming supercooled (i.e., they
remain unfrozen at temperatures below the equilibrium freezing point for their
bodily fluids). Although this "adaptive strategy" has many benefits for neonatal
turtles, the strategy also has important consequences one of the more important
of which is a shutdown of the circulation at temperatures near -10oC. The
proposed investigation will focus on the use of energy reserves by liver, heart,
and brain in animals subjected to the stagnant anoxia that results from shutdown
of the circulation, and on the patterns of accumulation by different organs of
the lactic acid that is produced in anaerobic respiration. The work will yield
important new insights concerning the physiology of neonatal turtles and also
may identify new methods for storing transplantable organs for use in human
and/or veterinary medicine.
