The principal investigators (PI) will develop and study new non- probabilistic
models to analyze the behavior of control algorithms for resource allocation in
packet switched data communications networks. Their approach to dealing with
uncertainty differs from traditional approaches. Rather than specifying
statistical properties of traffic they plan to employ and extend a non-
probabilistic model for demand that specifies hard constraints satisfied by the
traffic. The model facilitates the rigorous computation of bounds for parameters
such as maximum delay, average delay, and buffering requirements in networks.
They will focus on dynamic routing and flow control which involve the study of
coupled queues. The use of models such as the nonprobabilistic model is likely
to overcome the analytical problems traditionally encountered. They provide
examples of problems that address these issues in networks using point to point
and interacting broadcast links. As the size and demand for data networks grow,
the economic impact of developing useful tools for engineering them will be
quite significant. This approach develops some of these tools. ***//
