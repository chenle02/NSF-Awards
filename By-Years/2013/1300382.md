In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Daniel Seidel of the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers
University, New Brunswick, will attempt to advance the field of asymmetric
catalysis through exploration of conceptually new and underdeveloped methods of
substrate activation. A major goal is the development of reactions that produce
enantiomerically enriched products through intervention of chiral anionic and
zwitterionic intermediates. Catalytic amounts of chiral anion receptors will be
used in combination with simple nucleophilic catalysts, Bronsted acids and other
co-catalysts and promoters to facilitate unprecedented enantioselective
processes. These strategies will be used to address challenging problems such as
the kinetic resolution and desymmetrization of amines and diamines. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The ability to prepare complex chiral molecules in the most cost-
effective way possible is directly dependent on the availability of sustainable
synthetic methodologies. The new synthetic methods that will emerge from this
work will provide enhanced access to biologically significant, chiral nitrogen
containing compounds such as amines, diamines, natural and unnatural amino
acids, tetrahydroquinoline alkaloids, carbolines and other indole containing
substances, which should, in turn, help advance the chemical industry.
Furthermore, this project provides an ideal training ground to prepare the next
generation of researchers in the chemical sciences.
