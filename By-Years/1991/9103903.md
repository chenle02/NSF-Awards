The Lepidoptera Collection of the Milwaukee Public Museum (total holdings of
195,000 specimens) has grown significantly over the past decade through
acquisition of several significant donated collections. The Niedhofer Collection
(95,000 specimens, 30,000 from Brazil) and the Sieker Collection (17,000
Neotropical specimens), as well as several smaller donated collections, are
relatively inaccessible and have not been integrated with the rest of the
Department's holdings. Dr. Allen Young, Curator of the Collection, proposes to
integrate these collections into one comprehensive resource, and to improve the
overall curation of the collection. The donated collections represent endangered
habitats or areas that have already been developed for human use. Making these
specimens accessible to scientists would have a significant impact on current
research on biodiversity, global climate change, biogeography, evolutionary
biology, ecology, and conservation biology in tropical regions. Supporting the
growth and improvement of natural history collections such as this are essential
for future generations of biological research.
