PROPOSAL REVIEW AND ANALYSIS Proposal Number: CTS-9322657 P.I.: R.C. Alkire et
al Institution: Univ. of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Context: (within which
proposal was reviewed) Sixteen proposals were received and reviewed in the
Advanced Materials and Processing Program (AMPP) by the Interfacial Transport
and Separation Processes (ITSP) Program. All 16 proposals were sent out for mail
review. This proposal had reviewers suggested by the following programs or
division; ITSP Chemical Reaction Processes, Chemistry Division and Solid-State
Chemistry and Polymers. The 16 proposals were then reviewed by a panel of five
experts who met at NSF on May 4, 1994. the panelists were given the mail reviews
to consider together with their own individual reviews. They were asked to rank-
order the proposals and place them in one of three groups: Highly Recommended
Recommended (if funds are available) Not Recommended (not rank-ordered)
Analysis: This proposal was placed in the Highly Recommended category (top three
proposals). A grant is highly recommended at a reduced level based upon comments
from the reviewers and panelists. The following programs have agreed to co-fund
this proposal: ITSP, Chemical Reaction Process, and Solid-State Chemistry and
Polymers. CTS-9322657 Alkire et al, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
