The visual cortex of the brain is an area where there now is evidence for
mechanisms of plasticity and learning, even at the earliest stages of
processing, and even in the adult brain. It is appropriate to consider new
approaches to the study of vision in this context. This meeting brings together
researchers whose work focuses on the plastic nature and dynamic representation
of vision. Presentations and discussions cover physiological, anatomical,
behavioral and computational perspectives. Sessions cover the topics of cellular
and anatomical foundations of learning and memory; adult cortical plasticity;
perceptual learning; short-term memory and attention in active observers; and
visual short-term memory. The conference will have an impact on understanding
how the visual system interacts with areas traditionally associated with memory,
and so have an impact across neuroscience and psychology, in addition to visual
science.
