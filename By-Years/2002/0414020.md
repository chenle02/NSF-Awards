ABSTRACT

This proposal is to develop a new 3D jerk sensor for extraction of temporal
characteristics at (tangential acceleration), an (normal acceleration), ?
(temporal torsion) and (temporal curvature) for seismic ground motion and
structural response analysis. The new sensor is based on an innovative coupled
electro-mechanic oscillator. The output of the oscillator is directly
proportional to the measured jerk (derivative of acceleration). This new
approach overcomes the difficulty of differential circuitry in high frequency
resonance, amplitude and phrase measurement error. And the sensor itself does
not require external power for operation, which reduces the noise from the
electrical sources.
