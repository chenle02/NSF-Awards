In this Award from the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability
Fellows (SEES Fellows Program) Dr. Posy Busby from the University of Idaho will
investigate the use of naturally-occurring plant endophytes in the cultivation
of cottonwood trees for use as feedstock for biofuels. This award has support
from: the Directorate for Biological Sciences, the Division of Chemistry in the
Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the Office of
Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
(EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will investigate the potential
that application of plant endophytes to cottonwood trees can help to protect the
trees from a major rust pathogen (Melampsora) in biofuel plantations in the
Pacific Northwest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of studies like that supported
in this award is to develop sustainable agricultural methods for biofuel
production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Busby will be working with collaborators
Prof. George Newcombe of the Department of Forest, Rangeland and Fire Sciences
at the University of Idaho and Dr. Brian Stanton at "Greenwood Resources," and
additional collaborators at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Luc Hoffmann
Institute (Switzerland) and the Yakama Nation Wildlife Resource Management
Program. Dr. Busby will also be working with graduate and undergraduate students
in this project, including students from underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the NSF Science,
Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program,
with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that
lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the
necessary workforce to address these challenges. With SEES Fellows support, this
project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves
in an independent research career related to sustainability.
