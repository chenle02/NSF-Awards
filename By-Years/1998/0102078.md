This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled
"Genetic Diversity in Benzoate Degrading Denitrifying Bacteria and Environmental
Samples." Genetic diversity of 16S rRNA, nitrite reductase, and benzoyl-CoA
reductase in bacteria capable of degrading benzoate under denitrifying
conditions are being investigated with bacterial pure cultures isolated from
estuarine sediments of a contaminated landfill site. In addition, DNAs will be
extracted directly from the same sediment and environmental DNA clonal libraries
(metagenome library) will be constructed to link the different kind of genetic
information obtained from 16S rRNA genes and functional genes involved in
benzoate degradation and denitrification in the environment.&lt;br/&gt;
