This is a proposal to conduct two workshops and an international conference on
the development of a Human Genetic Diversity project. Human genetic diversity
holds the key to understanding the evolution of our species. By documenting
genetic variation we will be able to decipher the forces that guided our
evolution and the paths down which it proceeded. The data will be significant
for both biological scientists and medical researchers. With the advent of new
techniques for manipulating nucleic acids there has never been a better time for
gathering this data but the disappearance of many aboriginal populations places
a time constraint on the gathering of the information. These sessions will bring
together mathematical population geneticists, statisticians, population
biologists and physical anthropologists to develop appropriate strategies for
undertaking the data gathering phase, storage techniques, standardization of
protocols as well as considering which population samples would be most
informative.
