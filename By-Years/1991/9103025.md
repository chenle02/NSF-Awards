The PI has recently developed a new representation of cumulus convection that
attempts to overcome classical problems by relating the convection explicitly to
the dynamics of clouds and tying the moistening effect of clouds explicitly to
cloud microphysical parameters. This grant supports studies to understand the
interaction of convective clouds with large-scale circulations and climate by
attempting to simulate such circulations with simplified numerical models using
various convection schemes, including the new scheme of the PI. The immediate
objectives the PI will pursue under are: 1. Comprehensive radiative-convective
equilibrium simulations using his new scheme; 2. Semiprognostic tests of the new
scheme; 3. Theoretical study of equatorial easterly waves; 4. Construction and
testing of an equatorial beta-plane numerical model using several different
convection schemes, with the main objective of exploring the sensitivity of
simulated intraseasonal oscillations to the various convection schemes and to
parameters used by the schemes. This research is important because it strives to
increase knowledge of the processes by which convective clouds interact with
climate.
