Several closely-related areas of research will be pursued by this Presidential
Young Investigator. One area of research is the creation of an interactive
spatial mechanism synthesis and analysis computer package. Such a package would,
for the first time, place spatial mechanism design capabilities in the hands of
practicing designers. Instrumental in this plan are efficient and understandable
methods for the designer to specify design requirements and to review results. A
significant amount of high- level computer graphics will be necessary for
displaying such information. Further, it will be necessary for such a design
package to contain optimization procedures that eliminate many of the
intermediate, low-level decisions currently required in the interactive design
process. Another area of research is the design of closed-loop robotic
manipulators having many degrees of freedom. These robots will be superior to
present open-loop manipulators in load-carrying capacity, accuracy, and
dexterity. The final area of research is the design of high-speed bearings and
shaft couplings. Improved theories in this area are expected to lead to a
variety of applications including machine tools and turbomachinery.
