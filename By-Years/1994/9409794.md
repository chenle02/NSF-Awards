9409794 Hiatt American Academy of Arts and Sciences Exploring for Consensus on
Major Programs in Education The American Academy of Arts and Sciences will
convene a national conference entitled Exploring for Consensus on Major Programs
in Education. This two and one-half day conference builds on the Initiatives for
Children efforts to develop ties among researchers, practitioners and policy
makers working for systemic reforms in education. Although not exclusively tied
to mathematics and science, the conference has the purpose of improving the
quality of teaching and instruction in secondary schools. The expectation is
that the stature and expertise of the assembled group will result in
recommendations of national import and that the stature of the Academy will
insure wide interest in the dissemination of the findings. Fifteen to twenty
participants drawn form all regions and related interests are expected to
attend. A document representing the consensus of the participants will be
available to all groups concerned with secondary education ranging from policy-
setting agencies to individual classroom teachers. Although some expenses are
absorbed by the center, there is no specific commitment to cost sharing. ***
