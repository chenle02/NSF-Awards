Research data and information are critical parts of science. As science becomes
more international, so does the need for active engagement internationally. The
Council on Data for Science and Technology, as part of the International Council
on Science, provides a platform for top-down planning, development and
integration of data, data standards, and data
access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Academy of Sciences, NAS,
is the adhering body to the International Council for Science and its Committee
on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA). The U.S. CODATA, housed at the NAS,
represents the U.S. data community and coordinates with
CODATA's&lt;br/&gt;international activities. The U.S. CODATA will participate in
the International Council for Science and conduct a meeting of U.S. CODATA to
identify further activities. These might include consensus studies, workshops,
conferences, and other activities within its mission to advance data management
challenges in the U.S.; fulfill a convening function to encourage and facilitate
collaboration across disciplines, sectors, and nations with regard to common
interests in research data and information activities; monitor, assess, and
contribute to the development of U.S. government and research community
positions on research data and information programs and policies; and broadly
disseminate and communicate the results of the U.S. CODATA's activities to the
U.S. scientific community and to the general public.
