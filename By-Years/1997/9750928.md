An astronomy laboratory is being added and the current astronomy curriculum is
being expanded in order to offer non-science-majors the opportunity to take a
physical science laboratory at some point in their community college training,
and to expose a greater proportion of the student body to the excitement of
hands-on science. The new laboratory is focusing on giving students the
opportunity to collect and analyze their own data using small telescopes, CCD
cameras, and personal computers. They are also gaining an understanding of a
wider range of observational methods by analyzing archival data on the
laboratory computers. Through the laboratory experience, students are learning
as much about the scientific process as they are about astronomy. In the second
year of the program, the laboratory can be extended to include an Internet
version to complement the astronomy telecourse already offered. Although lacking
the "hands-on" aspect that students get from taking their own data, it
nonetheless makes a physical science laboratory available to a wider variety of
students. *
