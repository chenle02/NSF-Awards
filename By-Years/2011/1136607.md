The Center for Sustainable Polymers will establish a comprehensive knowledge
base to enable the efficient and economical conversion of natural and abundant
molecules into tomorrow's advanced polymeric materials. It will blend efforts in
polymer design, monomer synthesis, polymerization catalysis, architecture and
morphology control, and polymer property optimization to establish the basic
scientific tenets for innovative renewable resource polymer technologies. The
targets will be (1) architecturally diverse block copolymers as thermoplastic
elastomers, tough plastics, and adhesives; and (2) thermosetting multiblock
copolymers for structural and foam applications. The Center will develop new
scientific understanding that will advance the use of biorenewable materials and
supplant environmentally deleterious versions derived from petrochemicals.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to fostering the development and
implementation of new innovative products for the benefit of society, the Center
will also engage in a wide range of educational and public outreach activities.
An important component will be public outreach aimed at informing citizenry and
policy makers on the societal importance of sustainable technologies. Broad
public dissemination includes the development of an interactive exhibit at the
Minnesota State Fair. The Center will foster collaboration among academic
researchers, industrial partners, environmental advocates, and designers. Center
graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will join interdisciplinary
research teams, participate in an industrial internship program, and receive
cross-disciplinary training in the area of sustainable polymers that will be
vital for their independent careers. Efforts to broaden the participation of
underrepresented students will be undertaken by building partnerships with other
local organizations with similar interests and
expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Sustainable Polymers is funded as
part of the Centers for Chemical Innovation.
