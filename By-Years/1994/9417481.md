Loper 9417481 The proposed research consists of two related projects dealing
with small-scale buoyant magnetostrophic flow in the Earth's core. The first
project has two complementary motivations: to understand better the relation
between the observed secular variation and the dynamical state of the uppermost
portion of the outer core and to investigate whether the presence of a rigid
boundary can break the symmetry of the buoyancy-driven flow and generate
helicity and an alpha effect. The flow and field driven by a prescribed buoyancy
distribution will be found by solving the linearized momentum and magnetic-
diffusion equations in an oblique Caresian coordinate system using a double
Fourier transform. The second project will seek to determine the equilibrium
shape and size of small-scale deformable buoyant parcels in the core, as well as
their rise velocity. The linearized momentum and magnetic-diffusion equation.
