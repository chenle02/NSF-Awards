This proposal focusses on two conflicting objectives in group decision making:
the technical quality of the decision and the degree to which the decision is
accepted by group members. It also focusses on the interaction between problem
content and the problem-solving process(i.e., specifically on how group decision
making in problems with moral content differs from group decision making in
problems without moral content.) The researchers also propose evaluating group
decision making by the degree to which the problem in question is solved and not
by the technical quality of the solution.
