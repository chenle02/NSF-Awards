The nature of species, and to what degree closely related species are
demarcated by barriers to genetics exchange, are perhaps less clear for bacteria
than for any other major group of organisms. Studies of genetic exchange between
the closely related soil bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis
are being conducted by Dr. Kathleen Duncan in order to test hypotheses about
possible mechanisms opposing free gene exchange among bacteria. Knowledge of
mechanisms operating in nature that might prevent the free interchange of genes
among soil bacteria would greatly aid in making decisions about the release of
genetically engineered microorganisms. Investigations will focus on: (1)
spontaneous, natural exchange between spores germinated in sterilized soil; (2)
protoplast fusion; and (3) transformation of competent B. subtilis with purified
DNA. The hybrids produced will be analyzed to determine the extent of DNA
transfer using methods of sequencing, restriction-enzyme digests, allozyme
electrophoresis, and growth tests on selective media to identify the origin of
specific genes. The fitness of hybrid strains will be evaluated during growth in
soil in order to estimate the likelihood of success in nature. %%% New methods
in molecular genetics make possible the monitoring of gene exchange among soil
bacteria, a phenomenon critical to concerns about genetically engineered
organisms. Dr. Kathleen Duncan employs sophisticated DNA analyses to evaluate
the extent and fate of gene transfer among Bacillus soil bacteria, including the
role of hybrid strains carrying blocks of DNA from closely related species.
