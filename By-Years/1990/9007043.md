Theories of design systems do not currently take into account the influence of
organizational and contextual influences. This research team will demonstrate
the concept of optimized design through a case study to be developed in
collaboration with a pioneering concurrent engineering effort of an industrial
partner. The demonstration case will then be compared with national norms for
practice and process in design.
