Biological Sciences (61) The goal of this project is to implement a
biotechnology program that provides the required content knowledge and skills at
the baccalaureate-degree level to allow students to enter biotechnology careers
directly following graduation. To achieve this goal, they are establishing an
inquiry-driven biotechnology program that centers on molecular biology, develops
laboratory skills and provides practical laboratory experience. To accomplish
this, the program is adapting proven components of established biotechnology
programs to their own program, expanding their molecular biology course to
include inquiry-based laboratory experiences, providing biotechnology research
experiences for students, and introducing biotechnology-related courses. The
biotechnology curriculum provides a broad background in molecular biology,
genetics, physiology and biochemistry, emphasizes hands-on research experiences
(e.g., hypothesis formation and testing, problem solving skills, data
management) and provides independent research experiences (e.g. experimental
design and project-oriented research).
