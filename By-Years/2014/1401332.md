NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components
to prepare young scientists for careers in emerging areas where biology
intersects with other scientific disciplines, in this case with mathematics. The
Fellows are expected to lead the nation's scientific workforce of the future.
This fellowship to Holly Moeller supports research and training on metabolic
flexibility and marine ecosystem function. The host institution is the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Matthew
D. Johnson and Michael G. Neubert. Training goals include coupling
microbiological and modeling techniques. Educational and public outreach
includes mentoring undergraduate and high school students at Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution by including them in experimental subprojects and by
continuing as a scientific writer to place environmental issues in the public
eye.

The research investigates the environmental selection pressures that produce
mixotrophs - organisms that can fuel their metabolism through either autotrophy,
i.e., photosynthesis, or heterotrophy, ingestion of organic matter. Mixotrophy
is widespread in aquatic microbial communities, yet remains poorly represented
in ecosystem models. The research examines, from an evolutionary perspective,
how an organism maintains metabolic flexibility, rather than specializing in
just one mode of nutrition, and the importance of these types of organisms to
primary production, nutrient cycling, and other ecosystem functions,
particularly in the ocean where climate change is likely to increase their
numbers. To test the physiological limits and competitive ability of mixotrophic
marine microbes, laboratory studies are being extended to modeling broader
questions of eco-evolutionary dynamics.
