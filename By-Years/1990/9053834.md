This 2-year project at Howard University's Institute for Science, Space and
Technology will conduct activities aimed at (1) improving the quality of science
teaching in area high schools and (2) increasing the number of minority students
who elect to major and pursue a career in the sciences and engineering. Those
activities include an extensive role for minority scientists and engineers and
minority public officials "to communicate the importance of science and
mathematics education to African-American parents and students," the planning
and execution of two summer science academies (one for teachers and one for
students), and recognition of science teachers.
