Dr. Fausto-Sterling is examining the intersection between the ideologies of
social difference and the development of biological knowledge. As a part of a
larger study, she argues that much of contemporary biological knowledge and
theory is covertly marked by cultural values, both past and present, concerning
gender and race. She is examining the mutual interactions between social and
intellectual forces and the development of scientific thought. Each part of this
study probes the social nature of biological ideation with the examination and
explication of the dissection literature drawn from the 19th century being a
cornerstone piece for this undertaking. Starting with Georges Cuvier's detailed
examination of the body of Sarah Bartman, a South African woman of color, and
continuing into the 1870's, biologists published scientific accounts of
dissections of women of color. Under this grant, Dr. Fausto-Sterling is
completing the compilation and examination of that dissection literature
emanating from Europe. She is also extending this study to literature emanating
from the United States. She is searching the biological literature of the United
States for parallel examples of accounts of the bodies of black women. The
examples found both expand and diversify her evidentiary base. She is also
completing the review of a growing body of secondary sources which provide both
historical and theoretical background for placing and interpreting the results
of this project. She will then be in a position to interpret her findings from
her investigation of 19th century biologists and their scientific writings to
create narratives of difference from the presumed norm of the European male. She
hypothesizes that the narratives concerning people of color helped to create
icons: body parts gained symbolical significance with regard to gender and
deviant sexuality. Such icons derived from accounts of black female bodies,
became mobile, appearing form the last quarter of the 19th century, well into
the 20th century in scientific accounts of deviant white women. In amplifying
and documenting her claims, Dr. Fausto-Sterling is moving from an essentially
literal reading of the biological literature to a social and cultural account of
its significance.
