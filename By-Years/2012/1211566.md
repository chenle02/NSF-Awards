Problems involving the analysis and synthesis of data taken from scattered sites
in space or on surfaces arise in diverse fields -- computer-aided design
graphics, data mining, medical imaging, learning networks, geoscience, and many
other areas. This award will support the development of new methods and tools
for attacking the analysis and synthesis of scattered data -- i.e. data
collected from non-uniformly distributed sites -- by means of kernel methods.
The investigators supported by this awards recently discovered highly localized
bases derived from special kernels on manifolds, and this breakthrough will play
a key role both in the problems proposed and in their approach to investigating
them. The problem of finding a good, stable basis for an approximation space
made from kernels is closely connected with determining well-localized bases at
low computational cost. One of the major difficulties in dealing with kernel
interpolation or least squares approximation with the ``standard'' kernel basis
is that collocation matrices are full and frequently ill conditioned. Recent
work by the investigators and collaborators showed that Lagrange-type
interpolating functions associated with certain kernels are exponentially
localized about their centers and, from numerical experiments, appear to be
computationally inexpensive. This award will support exploring the full
potential of these newly discovered basis
functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need for analyzing and modeling
data taken from scattered, irregularly placed sites arises frequently in diverse
fields: computer-aided design graphics, data mining, medical imaging, learning
networks, and geoscience, in addition to many other areas. For example, weather
prediction or climate modeling is based on geophysical data collected at
scattered sites, by sensors on satellites, ground stations, or stations at sea.
Carrying out such tasks presents difficulties for traditional methods, which are
based on collecting data at uniformly placed sites or which require constructing
``meshes'' (think wire fence) that must be carefully tailored to deal with the
data sites involved. Newer methods, the so-called kernel methods, do not require
such meshes and can handle scattered data. This award will further the
development of these kernel methods, making them easy to use, faster, less
expensive to implement, and capable of handling data from a hundred thousand or
more sites. It will provide support for graduate students, who will be trained
in both the theoretical and the applied aspects of using and developing these
methods.
