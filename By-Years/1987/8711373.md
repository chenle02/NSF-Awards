Hormones secreted from the gonads have a major impact on the behavior of
mammals. Most of the behavioral effects of gonadal hormones are thought to be
mediated by the central nervous system; however, very little is known about the
underlying mechanisms. This project will use a functionally significant
communicative behavior of the hamster as a model system to study how gonadal
hormones interact with the brain to control behavior. The communicative behavior
to be studied, called scent marking, was chosen as a model because one of the
neurochemicals (i.e. vasopressin) essential in the central nervous system
control of this behavior has been identified and appears to function within a
specific site of the brain (i.e. the medial preoptic-anterior hypothalamus).
After the effects of gonadal hormones on scent marking behavior have been fully
established, this project will investigate whether gonadal hormones influence
scent marking by acting on cells which produce or respond to vasopressin within
the medial preoptic-anterior hypothalamus. These studies should provide new
information on how the nervous and endocrine systems interact to control
behavior.
