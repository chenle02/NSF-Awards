When caring for offspring of equal value, parents may benefit from equal
allocation of limited resources. However, if some offspring are more promising
than others, parents may instead benefit from diverting resources to high-value
individuals. In birds, nestlings display brightly colored mouth parts that may
allow parents to assess the relative quality of chicks. In nestling house
sparrows, for example, the intensity of yellow mouth coloration is positively
associated with condition, and parents deliver more food to more yellow
nestlings. This project further examines the relationship between coloration and
nestling health. First, a study in which partial broods are cross-fostered will
examine the relative contribution that pre- and post-hatching environment make
to mouth color. If rearing environment explains most variation, this will
suggest that color integrates information about post-hatching conditions (e.g.
diet, parasite infection). If parentage explains most color variation, this will
suggest that colors may instead reveal nestling qualities driven by genetics or
characteristics of the egg (maternal effects). A second experiment examines the
effects of a blood-sucking insect parasite, and a virus that it transmits, on
nestling mouth color. If mouth colors are associated with nestling health,
nestlings exposed to parasites and virus should be less yellow than nestlings
not exposed, and color should positively predict the ability of nestlings to
withstand infection. Together, these two studies examine how nestling mouth
color integrates information about past challenges and predicts future
resilience, as well as identifying possible genetic and pre-hatching constraints
on this signaling system. This project will offer insights into why parents
benefit from favoring certain offspring as well as identify correlates of
infection survival in wild birds. Broader impacts of this project include
training of a graduate student, mentorship of an undergraduate student and
contributions to exhibits at the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History and to the
Oklahoma City Zoo.
