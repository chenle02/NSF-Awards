Bryozoa are colonial invertebrates with a rich fossil record extending back 500
million years. Their classification has traditionally been based on the
morphology of adults within the colony and on the ways in which new individuals
originate and grow within the colony. Principal Investigator Reed has studied
the embryological development of several modern species of byrozoa, and has
found evidence that disputes the accepted classification. He proposes to
investigate the embryology of species representing eight different families and
two orders, and compare the resulting classification with that based on
traditional characters. The proposed work would provide much-needed insight into
the higher-level evolutionary relationships among bryozoa, and would provide a
means of evaluating the current classification. The proposed project would also
serve as a model for bridging the gap between invertebrate embryology and
systematics.
