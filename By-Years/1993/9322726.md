This grant provides partial support for an IEEE-sponsored database comprised of
sampled images and image sequences that has been established at the National
Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) in Urbana, Illinois, with the
Signal Processing Society serving as a gatekeeper. This database is accessible
via the InterNet at no charge to the users. Data is being solicited from
university, industrial and military sources. The data will provide a needed
testbed for evaluation of image processing algorithms.
