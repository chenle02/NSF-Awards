Recent progress in artificial intelligence and machine learning has led to
exceptional performance in tasks involving understanding what objects are in
digital images. These developments enable a new class of algorithms for Magnetic
Resonance Imaging, astronomical imaging, microscopy, and imaging based on X-ray
diffractions. These new algorithms have the potential to drastically reduce the
time and expense of scientific and medical data collection for the purpose of
imaging. For example, using these techniques, MRI machines could increase in
efficiency, allowing shorter scan times and shorter waits for medical care.
Additionally, these new techniques can accelerate the process of drug discovery
and development by minimizing the cost of imaging of molecules. While some new
algorithms have recently appeared, theoretical understanding of them is
currently minimal. This is a serious concern as technology, upon which
professionals make scientific discoveries and medical diagnoses, should be
reliable in common and novel situations. The investigator and his colleagues
introduce novel approaches for recovering images, scientific and medical, that
succeed while needing less data than earlier methods. Additionally, the
investigator and his colleagues provide mathematical justification for why such
imaging methods recover a sufficiently high-quality image. Graduate students are
engaged in the research of the project.

The investigator and his colleagues develop a rigorous recovery theory for
multiple signal recovery problems in the context of generative neural network
priors. These problems are linear compressed sensing, phase retrieval, and blind
deconvolution. In each, the recovery problem is phrased as a nonconvex
optimization under the constraint that the desired signal belongs to the range
of a pre-trained generative model given by an artificial neural network. For
each problem, the investigator and his colleagues provide (1) computationally
efficient, specific numerical algorithms with convergence guarantees that (2)
operate at optimal sample complexity with respect to the dimensionality of the
modeled manifold of natural signals, and (3) apply to realistic neural network
architectures. The impact of this work follows from two ideas: (1) generative
priors learned from data may provide lower-dimensional representations than
sparsity priors in many contexts; and (2) generative priors may be easier to
exploit than sparsity priors in nonlinear inverse problems such as phase
retrieval. Graduate students are engaged in the research of the project.
