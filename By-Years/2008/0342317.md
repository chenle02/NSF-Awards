This action funds continued support for the US National Committee (USNC) for
SCOPE (Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment). Through the
National Research Council, the USNC acts to involve US scientists in many
activities of SCOPE internationally, among them, developing projects and
coordinating efforts to identify significant environmental issues and finding
practical solutions by using broad thinking and interdisciplinary approaches.
The USNC continues to combine social and natural sciences in its approach to
problems of the environment. SCOPE plays a catalytic role in laying the
foundations for research, policy development, and action as well as publishing
and distributing scientific assessments of emerging environmental concerns.
