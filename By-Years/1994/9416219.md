9416219 Dreger This research is a multifaceted study of the Northridge mainshock
and large aftershocks to address the issues of fault zone complexity,
identification of slip planes, slip heterogeneity, as well as the source
contribution to the observed strong ground motions. Moment tensor methods will
be used to study events to the Mw4.5 level. Forward modeling of aftershocks will
be used to refine theoretical Green's functions used in the moment tensor
analysis. The Northridge sequence occurred in a geologically complex region on a
south-dipping reverse fault, adjacent to the north-dipping structures involved
in the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. Aftershocks do not define a clear fault
plane at depths shallower than 10 km and these methods will help to resolve the
complex geometry of faults in the region. This project is a contribution to the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program and is supported by the Northridge
Earthquake Emergency Appropriation. ***
