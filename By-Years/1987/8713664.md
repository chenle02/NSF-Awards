A automated fermenter will be acquired by the Biology and Chemistry Departments
of California Institute of Technology. The fermenter will be used in growing up
microbes for purification of rare cellular proteins or proteins from recombinant
clones. Among the projects to be enhanced are studies on soluble and membrane
proteins involved in RNA processing in yeast, bacterial and yeast DNA
replication proteins, bacterial membrane proteins, electron transport in
metalloproteins; yeast transcription factors; structure, dynamics and folding of
enzymes and blue copper proteins; and proteins involved in signal transduction
and proteins involved in site specific recombination.
