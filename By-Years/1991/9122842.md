This research will focus on the synthesis and metal complexation of
cyclopentadienyl anologs, e.g. 1,2,4-TECp (1,2,4-triethano bridged
bis(cyclopentadienide)), ofcyclophanes. Transition metal complexation of the exo
pi-faces of 1,2,4-TECp and analogous compounds will lead to dimeric, oligomeric
and polymeric metallocene containing materials. These polymeric columnar
metallocenes are electronically linked via powerful interannular through-space
electronic interactions and are expected to show novel electron transfer
properties. %%% With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Mark L. McLaughlin of the Department of Chemistry at Louisiana
State University. Professor McLaughlin will focus his work on the synthesis of
cyclopentadienophanes, compounds having two five-membered rings of carbon atoms
containing two double bonds, with the two rings joined by three side-chains
which hold the two rings rigidly near and parallel to one another. Above and
below each ring sits a doughnut-shaped electron cloud, and a powerful
interaction between the clouds of the two rings exists because of their close
proximity. These compounds will bind to transition metals to form columnar
structures, and the transition metal complexes are likely to exhibit facile
electron transfer, and perhaps also interesting materials properties.
