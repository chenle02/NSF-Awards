CD ROM is a promising new breakthrough in information storage technology. Of
special interest to this workshop will be the potential for applications of CD
ROM in libraries and information centers. In addition to the interchange of
ideas between specialists at the workshop, a summary report will be prepared
identifying the role the National Science Foundation can play in the field and
documenting the opportunities for future development, uses and application of CD
ROM.
