Research will be carried out on the properties of neutrinos, specifically the
oscillation between muon- and electron-like neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, which
occurs by virtue of their having different, albeit very small masses. A large
detector being built at the LAMPF laboratory will be used in conjunction with
the LAMPF beam stop as a source of muon neutrinos. New limits on the mass
difference will be set, thus providing basic information on these fundamental
particles, and facilitating comparison with mass differences inferred from
direct observation of solar neutrinos. The PI and undergraduate students will
carry out development of various elements of the data acquisition system, both
hardware and software.
