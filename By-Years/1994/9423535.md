9423535 Sieracki Researchers at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences will
further develop imaging cytometry instrumentation for the automated measurement
of phytoplankton cells based on the analysis of digital images produced by
microscopy - in this case epifluorescence microscopy. Imaging cytometry has much
potential for addressing basic questions in biological oceanography through the
automated analysis of natural plankton populations. Work will enhance Bigelow's
microscopic imaging system for more rapid analysis of plankton samples and
reduce the need for operator intervention. The system will be improved through a
combination of hardware and software. A computer-controlled, motorized stage and
new dual or triple-band optical filter sets will be added to their
epifluorescence microscope. New techniques and algorithms will also be developed
for image acquisition and analysis. And research will be undertaken on automated
cell classification from digital image data by testing classification algorithms
and by using neural net techniques. The project will facilitate the study of
oceanic plankton community trophic and size structures.
