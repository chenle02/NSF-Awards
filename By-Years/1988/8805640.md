This is a broad program of research in nuclear structure and nuclear reactions
at intermediate energies carried on at the Nuclear Theory Center of Indiana
University. Research includes the study of relativistic effects in reactions and
structure of nuclei and hypernuclei, retardation and non- locality effects on
nuclear response functions, exclusive reactions at intermediate energies, and
quark models of interacting mesons and nucleons. This research contributes to
the planning of new experiments at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility and
to the interpretation of experimental results.
