9402644 Robinson This dissertation enhancement award supports a 6-month research
visit in Japan for Russell Teasley, a graduate student at the University of
South Carolina at Columbia, who works under the direction of Professor Richard
Robinson. The research is on a comparative study of U.S. and Japanese
interorganizational technology transfer, focusing on the computer integrated
manufacturing industry. Mr. Teasley will work with Professor Fumio Kodama,
Department of Innovation Policy, Saitama University, Saitama, Japan. The
objectives of the research project are to collect data from technology transfer
projects in Japanese companies in order to test the model of "technology
transfer project effectiveness" and to evaluate technology transfer differences
between Japanese and U.S. companies. Japanese companies were chosen because of
their perceived ability to quickly and effectively develop new products and
processes from external, basic-level technologies that are transferred into
their organizations. The computer integrated manufacturing industry was chosen
because it experiences a high level of interorganizational exchange between
basic research and engineering development. The results of this study should
contribute to our understanding of Japanese management and cultural practices.
