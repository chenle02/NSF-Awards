ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS 9729189 Principal Investigator: Moser This is a
grant to explore a particularly promising technique for controlling turbulence
by exploiting its chaotic nature. In particular, the details of the evolution of
the turbulence are highly sensitive to small perturbations. Thus, judiciously
chosen small control inputs can in principle produce large changes in the
evolution of the flow. In most situations it is important that the control input
require very little energy so that the benefits of modifying the flow are not
out-weighed by the cost of the control. Several schemes have been developed to
control low dimensional chaotic systems using very small control inputs. In the
research proposed here, these schemes will be applied to a simple turbulent
fluid flow (the minimal turbulent channel), in which drag reduction will be the
objective. In these control techniques, one selects as the goal dynamics for the
system, one of the presumably infinite number of unstable periodic trajectories
that are expected to be embedded in the chaotic attractor of the system. Since
this is a natural, although unstable, system trajectory, controlling to this
goal dynamic just requires stabilizing it, which can be done with very small
control inputs.
