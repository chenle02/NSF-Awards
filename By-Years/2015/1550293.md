This award will provide support to US-based students and post-doctoral fellows
and junior scientists to attend the 2016 Gordon Research Conference on
Thalamocortical Interactions. This five-day meeting will be the first to bring
together researchers to present results and enagage in discussions on the cell
and circuit properties of thalamocortical interactions, and build on these to
explore their roles in cognition and behavior. This conference represents a rare
opportunity for neuroscientists interested in thalamocortical interactions to
exchange new results, hypotheses, and ideas at many levels, from cellular
through systems to cognitive&lt;br/&gt;and clinical. This is especially timely
because this field has been expanding significantly with the recent appreciation
that the thalamus plays an ongoing and critical role in cortical functioning.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this meeting derives from its
small size, which promotes interactions between participants, and the assembly
of many top scientists whose research spans thalamocortical interactions across
multiple sensory modalities, emphasizing the commonalities. This combination
leads to fruitful comparative analyses, raises new questions about underlying
mechanisms and often leads to new collaborations. By maximizing both formal
discussion and informal interactions, the Gordon Conference will highlight
exciting new developments that have implications both for a basic understanding
of the emergent properties of neural circuits as well as pathologies that
involve thalamocortical disruptions. With respect to broader impacts, this
meeting will benefit the larger community in multiple ways. First, it will help
train and inspire the next generation of scientists by exposing students and
postdoctoral fellows to exciting science and scientists. Second, special
emphasis will be given to junior faculty. Finally, a concerted effort will be
made to recruit scientists from under-represented groups.
