ABSTRACT

Principal Investigator: Kapranov, Mikhail Proposal Number: DMS - 0925341
Institution: Yale University Title: Representation Theory and Mathematical
Physics

Lie groups and their representations are a fundamental area of mathematics, with
connections to geometry, topology, number theory, physics, combinatorics, and
many other areas. Representation theory is one of the cornerstones of the
Langlands program in number theory, dating to the 1970s. Zuckerman's work on
derived functors, the translation principle, and coherent continuation lie at
the heart of the modern theory of representations of Lie groups. One of the
major unsolved problems in representation theory is that of the unitary dual.
The fact that there is, in principle, a finite algorithm for computing the
unitary dual relies heavily on Zuckerman's work.

In recent years there has been a fruitful interplay between mathematics and
physics, in geometric representation theory, string theory, and other areas. New
developments on chiral algebras, representation theory of affine Kac-Moody
algebras, and the geometric Langlands correspondence will be some of the focal
points of the conference. Recent developments in the geometric Langlands program
point to exciting connections between certain automorphic representations and
SYZ type fibrations in geometric mirror symmetry. Problems about these
representations may now be amenable to new geometric techniques and insights
developed for mirror symmetry.
