The PI is proposing to develop a new CFD code that will predict the coupled
ventilation behavior of indoor and outdoor airspaces, including species
(pollutants, chemical agents) transport. She will then couple this with large
scale building energy simulation programs (already in existence) that do not
contain sophisticated ventilation capabilities except on an energy balance
basis. Validation, testing, and optimization of this computation "system" as a
design tool is a major part of the proposed effort. Potential impacts include
reliable design tools and guidelines for healthy and energy efficient buildings.
In addition, the theory can be used to design mitigation strategies for chemical
or biological agent attacks, such as determining the best sensing positions for
quick responses to agent releases, activation of suitable ventilation systems to
create a safe zone for occupants, and provision of suitable means to clean the
buildings after an attack. It will also serve to bring architects and engineers
more constructively together at the design phase. The education contribution of
the research will include two new courses directed at architecture and
engineering students in the areas of integrated building systems design and in
the use of computational fluid dynamics in building systems design.
