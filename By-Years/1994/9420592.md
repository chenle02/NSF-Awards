9420592 Morris ABSTRACT The faculty in the Colleges of Engineering, Science and
Earth and Mineral Sciences at the Pennsylvania State University have combined to
develop a curriculum in advanced computation that emphasizes the capabilities
and uses of parallel computers. The goal of the program is to train
undergraduate and graduate students in advanced computation. This will be
achieved through the development of a sequence of undergraduate and graduate
courses that involve the hands-on use of different parallel machines, the
development of software demonstrations for class use, and the use of high-
technology classrooms. The courses will form the basis for a new "Minor in High
Performance Computation." The course will be taught by faculty in different
departments and colleges and will emphasize the common aspects of high
performance computation that cross the boundaries between disciplines. The
project will be evaluated by an external advisory panel with members drawn from
academia and industry with expertise in advanced computation and pedagogy.
Student evaluations will be developed and administered. Information about the
project will be available by provision of external electronic access to
computer-based classroom demonstrations, by publicity through the Engineering
Coalition of Schools for Excellence in Education and Leadership (ECSEL), through
training workshops for instructors, and through the development and distribution
of traditional course materials. ***
