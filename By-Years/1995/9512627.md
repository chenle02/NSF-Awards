9512627 Cohen This award provides partial funding (70% of total cost) for the
acquisition of a computer system with large memory and fast memory access time
that will be installed and operated in the Geophysical Laboratory at the
Carnegie Institution of Washington. The Carnegie Institution is committed to
providing the remaining funds needed for the purchase. The principle
investigator and colleagues at the Geophysical Laboratory are engaged in
research in the field of theoretical mineral physics to calculate the physical
and chemical properties of bulk condensed matter and molecules under the extreme
temperature and pressure combinations existing in the Earth's deep interior. The
calculations involve first principles methods, which are independent of
parametric fits to experimental data, but use theories such as the Density
Functional Theory, electronic structure methods, or ab initio models, all of
which require very intensive computer calculations. ***
