This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona acquire a 500 MHz
spectrometer which will be used in the following research investigations: 1.
Synthesis and Solution Structure of Porphyrins, Metalloporphyrins, and Heme
Proteins; CP/MAS NMR of Diamagnetic and Paramagnetic Porphyrins; and 57Fe NMR of
Model Hemes and Heme Proteins. 2. Multinuclear NMR Structural Studies of Visual
Proteins. 3. NMR Studies of Peptide Hormones and Neurotransmitters. 4. Polymer
Design and Molecular Topology. 5. NMR Investigations of Hydrodenitrogenation
(HDN) Catalysts. 6. Conformational Dependence of 13C Chemical Shifts in the
Solid-State NMR Spectra of Peptides. 7. Solid-State 95Mo NMR Studies of
Molybdoenzyme Models. 8. NMR Studies of Supramolecular Assemblies and Their
Components. 9. New Methodolgy for Glycosides: Glycosphingolipids and O-Linked
Glycopeptides. 10. NMR Structure Determinations of Natural Products and New
Polycerams and Block Copolymers. 11. Probing the E and F Subsites of the
Lysozyme Binding Cleft With N-Acetylglucosaminyl Muramic Acid. 12. Organic
Polymer Chemistry. %%% Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and
catalysis, and in biology.
