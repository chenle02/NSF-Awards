Statistics curricula have required excessive up-front investment in statistical
theory, which many quantitatively-capable students in ``big science'' fields
initially perceive to be unnecessary. A training program at Carnegie Mellon will
expose students to cross-disciplinary research early, showing them the
scientific importance of ideas from statistics and machine learning, and the
intellectual depth of the subject. Graduate students will receive instruction
and mentored feedback on cross-disciplinary interaction, communication skills,
and teaching. Postdoctoral fellows will become productive researchers who
understand the diverse roles and responsibilities they will face as faculty or
members of a research laboratory.

The statistical needs of the scientific establishment are huge, and growing
rapidly, making the current rate of workforce production dangerously inadequate.
The Department of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University will train
undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in an integrated
program that emphasizes the application of statistical and machine learning
methods in scientific research. The program will build on existing connections
with computational neuroscience, computational biology, and
astrophysics.Carnegie Mellon will recruit students from a broad spectrum of
quantitative disciplines, with emphasis on computer science. Carnegie Mellon
already has an unusually large undergraduate statistics program. New efforts
will strengthen the training of these students, and attract additional highly
capable students to be part of the pipeline entering the mathematical sciences.
