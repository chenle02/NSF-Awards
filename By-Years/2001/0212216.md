The objective of this proposal is to use electrochemical nuclear magnetic
resonance (EC-NMR) to study the influence of various platinum alloys on the
electronic properties of Pt surfaces. Candidate electrocatalyst materials for
fuel-cell applications will be synthesized through the spontaneous deposition of
monolayer quantities of Pt and other noble metal (Ru, Ir, Os, and Re)
nanoparticles. EC-NMR studies will probe the metal surfaces and poisoning
adsorbates. Carbon monoxide tolerance on Pd/Pt electrodes will also be studied.
Electronic-level information, obtained from EC-NMR, will be correlated with the
results of electrochemical measurements in an effort to better understand the
mechanisms of CO-poisoning. Such correlations are expected to help guide the
preparation of anodes for methanol electro-oxidation. Reviewers recognized the
PIs as pioneers in the development of EC-NMR for examining changes in the
electronic state of the substrate and adsorbate-structure bonding. A correlation
of the surface work function changes as a function of adsorption and
overpotential is important in the fundamental understanding of the
thermodynamics and kinetics of an electrode process. The broader impacts of this
project will be to train graduate and undergraduate students in the methods of
electrocatalysis. This research could help guide the development of improved
fuel-cell catalysts for applications in transportation and mobile applications.
