Research Infrastructure: Acquisition of a High-Performance Parallel Computer for
Computer Science Modeling Research This Academic Research Infrastructure award
supports the acquisition of a four node, high performance computer. The projects
supported by this equipment are the development of optimized parallel
computational models of the dynamics and energetics of global scale atmospheric
circulation and the development of formal methods and models for the
specification and validation of software system requirements.
