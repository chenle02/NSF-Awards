0962533&lt;br/&gt;Dai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory project proposes to
establish the fundamental basis for developing a supercritical fluid (SCF)
process for recycling printed circuit boards. First, the
delamination/degradation mechanism of the bonding materials in printed circuit
boards under supercritical fluid process conditions will be systematically
investigated. The hypothesis is that these results will provide a basis for
creating a supercritical fluid process to recycle printed circuit boards at low
temperatures and pressures. If this hypothesis is proven out, there will be
potential to transform the handling of discarded printed circuit boards,
enabling the recycle of their make-up. The project offers a breakthrough
opportunity for the recycling of printed circuit boards. The proposed SCF
process potentially has important advantages compared to traditional
metallurgical technologies and is anticipated to be environmentally benign as
well as cost and energy saving. Additionally, classroom teaching will be
enhanced by incorporating practical applications of SCF from the project.
Collaborations with industrial partners are planned.
