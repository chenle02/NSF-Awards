This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
anticounterfeiting technology, which is the magnetic analog of thermo-
luminescence. This technology makes use of a series of ternary alloys that
exhibit a unique first order transition and is based on the iron-rhodium
classical antiferromagnetic (AF) to ferromagnetic (F) behavior. Additional
alloying elements such as Rhenium, Platinum and Palladium by varying their
concentration, enable this transition to be precisely varied in temperature.
This material, will be synthesized in perfectly spherical particles ranging in
size from 2-10 microns and will be suitable for use in an ink pigment. This
capability enables standard ink jet printing to be used, to print a series of
complex three dimensional bar codes, two spatial and one in temperature. The bar
code will be non magnetic at ambient temperature. In the proposed program the
ability of the processing technology to yield compositions and particle sizes
which are uniform and small enough to flow in a ink jet printer, will be
explored.

From a commercial point of view, the cost to the US economy of counterfeiting is
conservatively estimated at $200B/year. It is estimated that implementation of
this technology would save between 1 to 10% of this figure or up to about
$20B/year.
