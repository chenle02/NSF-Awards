Meso-Scale Plasticity and Deformation Processing

A recently 'discovered' phenomenon with important consequences for plastic
deformation at the meso-scale (0.1-10 mm) is strain gradient plasticity, which
refers to the collective effects of strain gradient on flow behavior of
materials. The discovery of strain gradient plasticity has its origins in
measurements, which show that materials display strong size effects in their
mechanical response when the characteristic length scale associated with non-
uniform plastic deformation is small. Two novel techniques are explored for
estimating the flow stress-strain curves of metals and alloys in the presence of
strain gradients. The first of these involves simulation and measurement of
meso-scale indentation to study the variation of hardness with indenter apical
angle. A unique aspect of this approach is the use of cone indenters with
different apical angles to impose a wide, but controlled, range of strains and
strain gradients in a solid. The second technique involves a study of material
response in quasi-static, meso-scale machining where strain gradients are even
more intense than in indentation. Here, meso-scale machining is a vehicle for
estimating the constitutive stress-strain curve. The research is intended to
provide fundamental insights into meso-scale plasticity phenomena; develop and
validate techniques for estimating meso-scale flow stress data of relevance to
deformation processing; and generate detailed stress-strain data for multi-scale
modeling of materials processing operations. These should facilitate the
development of sustainable materials processing systems that operate at a high
level of efficiency, while creating products of enhanced quality.
