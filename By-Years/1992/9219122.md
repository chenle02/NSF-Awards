An emerging literature suggests that natriuretic peptides (NPs) from the heart
and brain may play a role in osmoregulation and cardiovascular physiology in
fishes, as they do in mammals. However, current data are somewhat conflicting
and are largely based on use of heterologous peptides and antibodies. We propose
to undertake a series of protocols to clone and sequence the gene(s) for NPs in
two species of fishes with quite dissimilar osmoregulatory problems and
abilities (the toadfish and hagfish). Such studies will form the prelude for
studies of the physiology of these peptides in fish physiology, and will enable
a critical analysis of the evolution of the form and function of this important
family of hormones.
