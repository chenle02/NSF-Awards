9415572 Kadko Hydrothermal circulation away from the ridge axis is an important
process in cooling and altering the crust. The principal investigator will join
a funded cruise by Mottl and Wheat (UHI) on the eastern flank of the Juan de
Fuca Ridge. He will measure radioisotopes in hydrothermal fluids, sediments and
plume to determine fluid residence times, sediment accumulation rate and various
fluxes. ***
