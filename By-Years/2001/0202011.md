The objective of the symposium is to present by example the power of integrative
biology in approaching complex biological phenomena. This includes integration
across all levels of biological organization: taxonomic, habitat, and
methodological; from molecules to global ecosystems; from observation to
experimentation; and from different perspectives, including those from different
cultures. Integrative biology can and should be used both for research and to
train the next generation of biologists so they can better think broadly and
synthetically about solutions to complex problems of pressing importance. With
the Society's strong student membership, we are particularly concerned about
training in integrative biology. Funding from the International Union of
Biological Sciences (IUBS) will bring two prominent foreign scientists (from
France and Japan) together with five US biologists to share their approaches in
integrative biology. The presentations will be published in the Society's
journal, The Journal of Integrative and Comparative Biology, and sent to all
members of the Society, as well as widely distributed to subscribing scientific
libraries around the world.
