Anderson Under the direction of Dr. Douglas Anderson, Mr. Brian Robinson will
collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will obtain radiocarbon dates on
materials associated with 33 Moorehead burial tradition sites from coastal
locations in Maine. While the existence of this tradition has been known for
many years and it has been determined that sites range from ca. 8,500 to 3,700
B.P. most individual occurrences are very poorly dated. Mr. Robinson has
discovered that materials at many of these sites include small amounts of
charcoal; therefore the AMS technique will allow their age to be determined. The
Moorehead tradition is known for its elaborate red ocher human burials which are
grouped into clearly defined cemeteries. Archaeologists have focussed attention
on this phenomenon because such a degree of elaboration is rare among hunters
and gathers and suggests complex levels of social organization among this
Archaic period people. Mr. Robinson believes that he can use the geographical
distribution of cemeteries and their relationships both to each other and to
important natural resources to reconstruct both social and ecological aspects of
this tradition and to determine how these changed over time. However to conduct
such an analysis it is necessary to obtain chronological control over individual
sites and this research will accomplish this. This work is important for several
reasons. It will increase our understanding of how peoples at a simple level of
cultural organization adapted to their social and natural environment. It will
provide data of interest to many archaeologists and will assist in the training
of a promising young scientist.
