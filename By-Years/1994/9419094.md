Abstract This award supports a study of volcanic rocks in the Ross Sea area of
Antarctica. Existing strontium (Sr), neodymium (Nd), and lead (Pb) isotopic work
on more than 80 basalts shows that a HIMU (High U/Pb)-like isotopic signature
(low 87/86Sr, high 206/204Pb) is ubiquitous along some 4500 km of the West
Antarctic Rift System (WARS). Three oceanic hotspots have been defined in the
region; Balleny and Scott Islands show the same HIMU-like signature as the rift
volcanics. Peter I Island shows a hint of this component, though these rocks
indicate, in general, a more enriched mantle hotspot source (refered to as an
EM-2-like hotspot). Many of the WARS volcanics also show the presence of an
enriched component, but one which is derived from the continental lithosphere
(low Rb/Cs and Th/Pb). In Victoria Land, the presence or absence of the enriched
component is directly related to location with respect to the boundary between
the Ross Sea rift and the Transantarctic Mountain Front. Its minimal presence in
Marie Byrd Land suggests a thinner and/or younger crust, relative to the
Transantarctic Mountain area. The virtual absence of enriched component in the
rift proper suggests a highly thinned crust, perhaps without significant
underlying lithosphere. In this second phase of a longer term project, the work
will focus on geochemical study three WARS volcanoes (Sidley, Overlord, Pleides)
in detail, to constrain a crustal versus mantle lithospheric source for the
enriched component. A number of cognate and mantle xenoliths will be studied as
a further aid in this source discrimination issue. The geographic extent of the
HIMU-WARS signature will be tested by analyzing Cenozoic basalts from sub-
Antarctic islands on the Campbell Plateau (including cognate and mantle
xenoliths). In all of this work we will, for the first time, employ osmium and
oxygen isotopes in combination as a tool to discriminate crustal versus mantle
lithosphere signatures.
