The proliferation and increasing importance of QoS-aware group applications
coupled with the advancement in high-speed networking are driving the need for
scalable and deployable group communication architectures, algorithms, and
protocols over the Internet. Examples of such applications include on-demand
audio/video services, teleconferencing, server push operations, multimedia
presentations in distant education and entertainment, and real-time information
dissemination. These applications consume high network bandwidth and demand QoS
assurances. Multicasting and differentiated services (DiffServ) are the two
effective technologies that address these requirements. DiffServ attempts to
provide scalable QoS over the Internet, whereas multicasting aims at maximizing
bandwidth sharing among the members of a group. Although these technologies have
complementary goals, their coexistence introduces several unique challenges. The
goal of this research is to develop architectures, algorithms, and protocols
addressing these challenges. This collaborative project concentrates in
particular on viable approaches for DiffServ-aware multicasting addressing key
issues, such as scalability, multicast tree construction and maintenance,
heterogeneous QoS and SLA management, and receiver-initiated differentiated
services. The proposed research will answer many key questions pertaining to
DiffServ multicasting, which will enable QoS multicasting over the Internet a
reality.
