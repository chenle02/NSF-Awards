Methods for the chemical characterization of particles or liquid droplets in the
size range 1 um to 100 um with masses in the range 1 pg to 1 ug (10-12 g to 10-6
g) will be developed based on the researcher's picobalance facility (also called
the electrodynamic balance or quadrupole levitator). The picobalance uses
superposed ac and dc electrical fields to suspend stably a charged microparticle
in a laser beam or other source of electromagnetic radiation. The forces holding
the particle stationary are large enough to permit a particle to be maintained
in the flow of a reactive gas, and as a result the balance chamber can be used
as a chemical reactor. Spectroscopic methods will be developed and applied to
study chemical reactions involving microparticles. The techniques to be explored
are Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and "optical resonance
spectroscopy." A dual monochromator and associated optical equipment will be
added to an existing picobalance facility to upgrade it to measure Raman spectra
and fluorescence spectra. Spectroscopic techniques will then be used to
characterize multicomponent droplets and to study photochemical reactions in
single droplets and rates of gas/liquid-droplet chemical reactions. Reactions of
particular interest include photopolymerization reactions within a droplet and
reactions which can occur in the atmosphere.
