This project is designed to evaluate competing models of biogeography of
freshwater fishes and land vertebrates in the Caribbean islands. Its novel
aspect is that it will emphasize data from two sources that are critical to the
problem, but which have been neglected: the Tertiary fossil record and the
island of Cuba. The investigators' recent successes in discovering Tertiary
vertebrates in the West Indies demonstrate that a significant and relevant
fossil record can be recovered. Cuba is of particular importance because this
island constitutes one-third of the land surface of the Antilles, yet its biota
is known in only a rudimentary way. To maximize results, the investigators will
prospect for fossils in both Quaternary and Tertiary contexts in Hispaniola and
Cuba. Major goals are (1) to increase sample sizes of poorly known taxa and to
prospect for heretofore unknown taxa; (2) to begin a program of dating to
document when the Quaternary fauna of large animals went extinct; (3) to
establish the nature of pre-Quaternary biodiversity in the Greater Antilles; (4)
to utilize ancient biodiversity as a means for evaluating the comparative
importance of dispersal and vicariance (i.e., plate tectonic events) in
formation of the Antillean fauna; and (5) to develop human resources in the
Dominican Republic in order to enhance local ability to study and conserve
biodiversity. These goals are complementary to the investigators' general
program of investigating causes and consequences of reduction in biodiversity on
island and in islandlike settings.
