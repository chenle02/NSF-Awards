Enumerative combinatorics is the branch of mathematics that deals with counting
the number of objects, such as sets, permutations, matrices,..., satisfying
certain prescribed conditions. In the past several decades enumerative
combinatorics has been one of the most rapidly developing areas of mathematical
research, with numerous connections and applications. The area pushed away
traditional boundaries and joined forces with a variety of fields in mathematics
and beyond, ranging from computer science to statistical physics.

The investigator will undertake a profound study of integer sequences using a
broad and powerful range of mathematical tools. The central sequences that will
be studied arise in enumerative combinatorics, involving counting pattern-
avoiding permutations, graphs in a hereditary property, and closed walks in
Cayley graphs. The investigator will involve students at all levels in his
research.
