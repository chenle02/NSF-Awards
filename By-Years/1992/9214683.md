This award is for partial support for the Twentieth Annual Telecommunications
Policy Research Conference (TPRC) in Solomons, Maryland, September 12-14, 1992.
The conference provides a forum for interactions between national and
international scholars in basic and applied research (from engineering,
communications and information science, operations research, economics, law and
public policy) and leaders in communications and information industries,
government policymakers and specialists from public-interest organizations. A
major function of the conference is to provide a forum for the presentation of
preliminary studies to alert policymakers to new work relevant to their
interests and to provide an opportunity for early critical review by peers.
After revision, based in part on comments from their TPRC presentation, the
papers are published in professional journals or elsewhere. All TPRC papers are
collected and made available upon request from the TPRC office in Washington,
D.C.
