9401163 Reshetikhin This project is concerned with the study of quantized
universal enveloping algebras and their representations together with their
applications to low-dimensional topology and to 1+1-dimension models of quantum
field theory. The principal investigator will investigate the relations between
the structure of the category of modules over quantized universal enveloping
algebras and corresponding affine Lie algebras. He will further study invariants
of 3-manifolds to better understand the relation between the combinatorial
approach to topological field theory and the differential-geometric one. He will
continue studying the quantized universal enveloping algebras of infinite-
dimensional Lie algebras and their representation theory and, in particular,
when the parameter of deformations is a root of 1. Quantum groups are a new area
of research for both mathematicians and physicists. On the mathematical side, it
combines three of the oldest areas of "pure" mathematics, algebra, analysis and
geometry, yet it is of great interest to physicists working on conformal quantum
field theory.
