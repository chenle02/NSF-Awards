This group will participate in a collaboration of fourteen institutions working
at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, CESR. CESR is presently the most intense
source for studying the properties of the b quark. By the end of 1990, CESR will
be measuring b quarks at forty times the rate available at other accelerators.
Quarks are considered to be amongst the most elementary building blocks of all
matter. The b quark weighs about five times the weight of the proton (hydrogen
nucleus) and is the heaviest quark ever "observed". Measurements of the
properties of the of the b quark are expected to yield a wide range of new
physics insights concerning such topics as the origin of the matter-antimatter
asymmetry in the universe. The field of research is that of experimental
elementary particle physics. This research studies the basic building blocks of
matter (e.g., electrons, positrons, quarks, and weak bosons) at very high
energies. The experiments use accelera- tors and colliders which provide the
highest energy particles made in the laboratory. The data is collected and
analyzed using highly complex and sophisticated apparatus and techniques.
