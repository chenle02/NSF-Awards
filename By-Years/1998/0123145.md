The investigators will use observations from the Atmospheric Lidar Observatory
at Utah State University to study the temperature structure of the mesosphere
and lower thermosphere. A recent upgrade to the lidar has increased the
sensitivity of the system by a factor of 30. The first task is to continue and
extend ongoing research that involves comparison of measured temperatures with
those computed using a first-principles model. Resolution of discrepancies will
reveal information about the role of gravity waves and chemistry in heating, and
the effects of the large-scale circulation pattern. The second task is to relate
processes occurring below 80 km altitude with processes at higher altitudes
where measurements have not been possible before. The third task is to look for
effects of stratospheric winds and waves in the lower thermosphere. Finally, the
lidar will be used to look for further evidence of noctilucent cloud formation
at mid-latitudes. Previously confined to high latitudes only, the appearance of
a noctilucent cloud over Utah in June of 1999 may be an indication of cooler
mesospheric temperatures caused by global climate change.
