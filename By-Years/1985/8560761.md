This research focuses on the feasibility of applying the known effect that small
concentrations of hydrocarbons have in air on its sparking potential in the
development of a device that could be used as a detector of air pollution. This
device could be of particular value in detecting a potential for explosition of
the hydrocarbon-air mixture.
