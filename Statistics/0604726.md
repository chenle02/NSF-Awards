The problem of classifying entities into one of several groups has been one of
the main goals of many scientific investigations. This is a very important
statistical problem with many applications in science and engineering. This is
an inherently multivariate problem since measurements are made on several
aspects (variables) of the entity as an attempt to best capture its place among
others. As it is not generally possible to obtain a measure all variables
pertaining to an entity we wish to classify or even get perfect measurements of
the measured variables, classifications are usually performed in the presence of
uncertainty. It is important that this activity is done in a manner that
minimizes the misclassification error rate with efficiency and in a way that is
robust to outlying cases. In this project the investigators develops a new
classification technique that is based on statistical depth function, an
extension of the robust rank-based nonparametric procedures. Issues of
asymptotic optimality, robustness, computational algorithms and finite sample
performance are dealt with step by step and methodically throughout the duration
of the project. The project also includes implementations of the newly developed
classifier using genetic data sets that are publicly available and comparing its
performance to existing classifiers.

The problem of classifying entities into one of several groups has been one of
the main goals of many scientific investigations. For instance, identifying a
tumor or a case of flu as one of the many different possibilities is potentially
life-saving and hence is indespensable to physicians. This is an inherently
multivariate problem since measurements are made on several aspects (variables)
of the entity as an attempt to best capture its place among others. As it is not
generally possible to obtain a measure all variables pertaining to an entity we
wish to classify or even get perfect measurements of the measured variables,
classifications are usually performed in the presence of uncertainty. It is
important that this activity is done in a manner that minimizes the
misclassification error rate with efficiency and in a way that is robust to
outlying cases. In this research the investigators develops a new classification
technique that is insensitive to erroneous or extraordinary data. Such methods
are very important to for researchers in areas such as genetics and oncology
where these qualities are of the utmost importance, as well as cancer
classification using gene expression data where a precise and accurate
classification of tumors is essential for successful treatment of cancer.
