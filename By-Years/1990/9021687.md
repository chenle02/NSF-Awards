The evaluation of the testing techniques, and the development of an approach to
the constitutive modeling of cemented soils are proposed. Concerns are raised
about the validity of the current experimental approaches on cemented soils and
remedies are proposed. A constitutive modeling approach is also proposed for the
cemented sands. The approach is based on the theory of mixtures. It describes
the damage of the material as the cementation bonds brake. the expected
developments will be verified through a series of example experiments and a
miniature foundation set up.
