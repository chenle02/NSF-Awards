This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research proposal addresses
synergistic integration of navigation and environmental sensing instruments on
manned or autonomous ground or air vehicles to both improve information
registration accuracy and reduce costs of hardware. This will enable use of low
cost Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) Inertial Measurement Units (IMU)
and will relax export requirements for remote sensing hardware heretofore based
upon military-derived IMU components. This research will address the use of a
digital camera and MEMS IMU that are tightly integrated in a novel manner so
that navigation will occur within a coordinate frame that is fixed within the
surrounding scene as observed by the digital remote sensing
camera.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remote Sensing involves sensing physical properties
of terrestrial objects from a distance and registering the sensed information
into a geodetic reference frame. Such registration is critical for merging
related data sources and for change detection from sequential data collects.
Direct Geo-registration (DG) involves performing registration without prior
knowledge of geodetic survey information collected from the vicinity of the
sensed feature. Precision navigation using inertial navigation and GPS is a
fundamental aspect of modern approaches to DG. Detection, tracking and
subsequent re-acquisition of sensed features can be used as additional aides for
improved navigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
