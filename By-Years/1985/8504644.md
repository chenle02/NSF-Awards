The purpose of this research is to develop mathematical methods of determining
safety stock quantities for dealing most economically with uncertainties in
demand and supply when multistage production systems are used. Three kinds of
production will be investigated: make to order; make to stock; and production
where demand exceeds capacity. The work, if successful, should assist managers
in deciding on production levels in the face of uncertainties.
