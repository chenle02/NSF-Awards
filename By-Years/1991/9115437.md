This award will support the research of Dr. Havel, who will develop new
computational methods and software for determining the conformational states and
kinematic behavior of mobile molecules by means of geometric reasoning. The
resultant computer programs are expected to be of value to researchers in many
areas of structural chemistry and biochemistry, including spectroscopists who
wish to interpret their data in terms of a precise molecular modes,
stereochemists who need to find all conformers consistent with a given bonding
arrangement, and molecular biologists attempting to predict protein and nucleic
acid conformation. Because a wide variety of information concerning the
structure of molecules can be encoded in terms of constraints on their
interatomic distances, the first goal is to improve understanding of and ability
to reason directly with these constraints. The next goal is to devise more
efficient and reliable methods of finding atomic coordinates compatible with the
constraints, and determining what motions are consistent with them. The final
goal is to have the resulting program integrated into a widely available
molecular mechanics package, so that they can be easily applied to a wide
variety of problems.
