The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the
National Science Foundation supports the research of Professors Giuseppe
Petrucci from the University of Vermont and Scot T. Martin from Harvard
University who will elucidate the relationships between molecular composition
and phase of biogenic secondary aerosols (BSOA) and the subsequent impact on
BSOA optical properties and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity. This
research will build an unprecedented understanding of the link between
molecular-level aerosol properties and the role of BSOA in regulating Earth's
radiative balance. The synergism made possible by bringing together established
expertise and research infrastructure within each institution would ensure rapid
advance of the understanding of this critical aspect of atmospheric organic
aerosol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The improved understanding of the complex
interdependent relationships between chemical, phase and optical properties of
organic aerosols, as well as the fundamental data that will be obtained will be
of great benefit to the atmospheric sciences community at large. Furthermore,
the collaborative research and training infrastructure as well as training
opportunities, will be enhanced significantly and provide a critical foundation
for future advances in this area.
