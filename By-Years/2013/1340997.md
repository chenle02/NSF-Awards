This planning activity supports Wittenberg University's efforts in developing a
plan to improve campus network infrastructure aligning with the goals and
guidance described in NSF CISE/ACI's CC-NIE program. The 6-month planning period
includes the following activities: assessing network infrastructure needs driven
by science and education activities on campus; defining partnerships and
collaborations on campus and elsewhere to create leveraging opportunities and
help define those opportunities; and develop a complete plan documenting design,
re-architecting, and implementation of an improved campus network that includes
the science DMZ concept. Wittenberg University will also host a "campus CI" day.
The activity creates the opportunity to make the most of existing
infrastructure, both locally and regionally, and in turn enhance research
capabilities internally and with partners outside the institution.
