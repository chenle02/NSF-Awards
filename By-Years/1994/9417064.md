Abstract Wyoming Medical Center - R. Tobin Connection to NSFNET Proposal No.
NCR-9417064 This proposal for connecting the Wyoming Medical Center to the
Internet will be introducing Internet as a new information service to
participating hospitals. As a valuable new service, promotion, awareness, and
training are critical components of this project. Training for WMC personnel
will be accomplished by formal instruction on Internet access and usage through
collaborative effort between Casper College and Wyoming Medical Center's
Information Services Department and health Sciences Library. Internet access
will have a positive impact on patient care by enhancing communication among
healthcare providers and by expanding access t health-related information via
databases, discussion lists, libraries and academic centers for physicians,
clinical staff and management personnel. Internet access for participating
Wyoming hospitals will reduce the sense of professional isolation that exists in
an area that suffers from a shortage of health professionals.
