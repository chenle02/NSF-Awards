The heat transfer characteristics of turbulent air flow in the sharp turns in
multipass rib-roughened cooling channels in high temperature gas turbine
airfoils are to be studied. The cooling channels will be modeled as a series of
rectangular channels, with rib-roughened walls, connected with two 180 degree
turns. The local heat transfer coefficient distribution in and near the turns
will be determined with both the naphthalene sublimation mass transfer technique
and conventional foil heaters-thermocouples method. Experimental results will be
obtained for various channel aspect ratios, turn clearance gaps, curvatures of
the turn corners, rib geometries, and flow Reynolds numbers typical of turbine
engine applications. Corresponding flow visualization experiments with the oil-
lampblack technique will supplement the forced convection experiments. Effective
blade cooling prolongs the life of advanced gas turbines. The results of this
research will contribute to the understanding of the heat transfer and flow
characteristics of multipass rib-roughened channels, which is important in the
design of turbine engines.
