This project will use INSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) and GPS
(Global Positioning System) measurements to monitor detailed patterns of
deformation in the continental collision zone in eastern Turkey. The project
will take advantage of the synergistic aspects of these two techniques. In
addition to providing quantitative constraints on the kinematics and dynamics of
the early stages of continental collision, the investigators anticipate that
this research will result in new and improved tools for combining INSAR and GPS
for monitoring secular deformation of the Earth's surface.
