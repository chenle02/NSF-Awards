9407857 Forster This study addresses the patterns of historical diversification
of the duck-billed dinosaurs, or Hadrosauridae. This group of dinosaurs is not
only the largest, but the most diverse and biogeographically widespread lineage
of ornithischian dinosaurs of the Late Cretaceous period. Hadrosaurids have a
rich fossil history, and are among the best collected groups of dinosaurs with
the best prepared specimens. Their unique anatomical specializations, including
elaborate features of the jaws, provide ample information for reconstructing
their genealogical relationships. No such reconstruction currently exists, and
this proposal seeks to provide one. This reconstruction will form the basis for
exploring hypotheses about the history and biogeography of this important group
of dinosaurs.
