Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) in particular has evolved into
major analytical technique for thin film and complements that available from
existing instrumentation which emphasizes either bulk characterization or
surface analysis. RBS offers good elemental specificity. The compositional
information is quantitative and the analysis is nondestructive. The research
projects using the instrumentation are quite diverse, and indication of the
growing interest in this technique within the materials science community. The
major users of the equipment emphasize areas related to thin films,
semiconductor materials and interfacial structures. Auxiliary users utilize RBS
to characterize the materials and reactions involved in corrosion and
segregation processes, in semiconductor technology and in plasma fusion
applications. Substantial support from the university and industrial sources
will contribute to the purchase of the RBS system.
