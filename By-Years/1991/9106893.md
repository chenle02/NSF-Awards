The Third International Congress of Plant Molecular Biology will be held October
6-11, 1991 in Tucson, Arizona. The previous meetings were highly successful in
bringing together plant scientists from throughout the world. This projected
meeting promises to be even more exciting and thus probably even more truly
global.***
