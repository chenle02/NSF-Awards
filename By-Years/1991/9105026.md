The pacific northwest consists of several allochthonous terranes that were
joined to North America during the Mesozoic and Tertiary. The Coast Plutonic
Complex, an 1800 km-long belt of metamorphic and plutonic rocks obscures the
contact between two extensive and probably far-traveled crustal fragments, the
Intermontane and Insular superterranes. Models for the accretion of the western
fragment depend on a clear understanding of the structural evolution of the
Coast Plutonic Complex, yet the age and style of deformation are poorly known.
This project will address these issues by a detailed structural and metamorphic
investigation of these rocks near Bella Coola, British Columbia. Results are
important to understanding of the tectonics of terrane accretion.
