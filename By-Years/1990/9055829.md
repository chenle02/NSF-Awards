Negative attitudes prevent students from doing well in the introductory
chemistry laboratory course and enjoying the subject. To deal with the problems
of anxiety and naivete among entering students, we will develop a two-day
workshop called "Reduce Your Lab Anxiety" to be offered several times each year.
This ungraded workshop will introduce unconfident or underprepared students to
the expectations of a lab course. We will also develop a new laboratory entitled
"Science in Practice" to accompany the pre-general chemistry course. This course
will target the same clientele as the workshop. Through new exercises based on
everyday substances and processes, it will provide a solid technical foundation
for the courses that follow. A guidebook will be made available to report these
developments.
