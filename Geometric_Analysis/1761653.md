During June 18-22, 2018, the University of Pittsburgh will host an international
conference entitled "From the Fundamental Lemma, to Discrete Geometry, to Formal
Verification". The conference website can be accessed at
http://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/hales60/. The aim of the conference is to
explore the interface between the subjects listed in the title, with the primary
focus on emphasizing similarities between different fields and finding new
applications of existing techniques and methods from different areas. Major
experts in each individual field will lecture on the main developments and
applications, with the goal of making the ideas accessible to a non-expert
audience. By bringing together researchers from the areas of Automorphic Forms,
Motivic Integration, Discrete Geometry, and Formal Verification, we hope to
highlight and deepen the connections between these areas.

Among other things, the conference will highlight the structural relationship
between the classical geometric methods of partitioning space used to prove the
Kepler conjecture and the new methods of harmonic analysis used to prove the
sphere packing results in higher dimensions. In addition, the conference will
attempt to bring together the Formal Verification community and the community of
researchers working on the formal logic-based version of motivic integration.
Both fields share similar techniques and the exchange of ideas between the two
fields should be very fruitful. Formal verification of (broadly adopted)
encryption standards is ultimately an issue pertaining to the foundation of
society, and the involvement of the mathematical community in such efforts is
absolutely crucial. The conference will feature a session on formal verification
of encryption standards, including a public lecture on a recently verified NIST
cryptographic standard. The Formal Abstracts project aims to provide a semantic
representation of (ultimately all) mathematical knowledge accessible to the
society, and many of participants of this conference are active members of the
project.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
