In the polar regions there have been a number of satellite observations of
dense collections of aerosol particles at altitudes around 85 km during the
summer months. These phenomena have been named polar mesospheric clouds (PMC).
This project is a continuation of research into the origin and nature of these
clouds. Included in this project is a generalization of the one- dimensional,
time-dependent cloud physics model to study the multi-dimensional aspects of the
PMC structure. In particular, emphasis will be on the seasonal and latitudinal
structure and the impact of horizontal winds. The climatology will be studied
using the (1977-87) SBUV satellite data as well as from a new PMC data base. ***
