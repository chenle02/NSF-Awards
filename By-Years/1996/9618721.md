How do leaders lead? Why do followers follow? Why are some leaders successful
in some situations but unsuccessful in others? Although scholars have long
recognized the importance of leadership in social interaction, a solid
conceptual hold on these basic and important questions has proven elusive. This
weakness has not precluded, however, a renewed scholarly interest in leadership.
Leaders are central to many current and prominent accounts of economic firms,
social and political groups, policy outputs, and political institutions, yet our
understanding of the dynamics of the leader-follower relationship remains
incomplete. This Doctoral Dissertation research will addresses a basic question>
how and when can leaders strategically employ information to induce a Pareto-
enhancing norm among a set of rational followers? Specifically, it develops and
tests a series of models that explicitly map leadership signals onto follower
strategies, and examines how this mapping changes as one systematically alter
the environmental context in which leaders and followers interact. The research
consists of two components. In the first, a series of simple game-theoretic
models are developed of leaders, followers, and the leadership process. These
models offer a distinct conceptualization of leadership: Leaders `lead` because
they are able and motivated to disseminate information that affects the strategy
selection of followers. Leadership, then, is the act and process by which
leaders disseminate information in order to crate a series of socially
beneficial norms. From these models, hypotheses are derived to address how and
when leaders will successfully employ information to affect outcomes. The models
highlight both the strategic context in which leader sand followers interact as
well as the informational conditions surrounding their interaction. The second
component consists of testing these models under laboratory conditions. Game-
theoretic models, critically dependent on such concepts as `beliefs` and
`information,` are extraordinarily difficult to test in the natural world.
Experimental designs, through their tremendous levels of control, offer the
potential of a direct test with a high level of internal validity. This
investigation promises to provide insight into the nature of leadership in
social and political interaction. It will shed light on the circumstances under
which leaders can productively employ information as a tool of their trade, and
will increase our understanding of why individuals follow some leaders but not
others.
