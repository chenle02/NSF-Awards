DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is the principal replicative enzyme of E. coli.
High catalytic rates are achieved by having the polymerase subunit (called
alpha) of the 10- subunit enzyme clamped to the template by auxiliary subunits;
its high fidelity of replication is achieved by complexing of the alpha subunit
with the epsilon subunit to enable effective proofreading at the growing end of
the chain. The holoenzyme is in fact part of a more complex machine which
contains two polymerase subunits and together with priming proteins and
helicases may constitute a "replisome." Seated at the replication fork of a
chromosome, the replisome may effect a relatively concurrent replication of both
strands of the duplex chromosome rather than the spasmodic, jerky,
semidiscontinuous model now in use. Toward establishing the detailed structure
and individual functions of several forms of this extraordinary polymerase
molecule, various techniques of genetic engineering, protein isolation,
immunocyto- chemistry, electron microscopy and enzymology will be used. The
significance of understanding replication in molecular detail lies in its
application toward the development of drugs to interrupt the process in
proliferative diseases, such as cancer, and the acquisition of new insights into
growth processes and their aberrations.
