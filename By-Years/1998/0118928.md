A grant has been awarded to Dr. Arthur W. Toga at the Laboratory of Neuro-
Imaging (LONI) of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to enhance
the graphic and compute capabilities of an existing supercomputer for
distributed use in neuroinformatics. Unabated advancements in imaging technology
today has provided researchers with the ability to produce very high-resolution,
time-varying, multidimensional data sets of the structural and functional
development of the dynamic human brain. The complexity of the new data, however,
require immense computing power for effective analyzation and
study.&lt;br/&gt;LONI and its collaborators will upgrade the facility's SGI
Onyx2 supercomputer with additional graphics pipelines, computational nodes, and
the incorporation of high speed networking equipment. The graphics pipelines
will allow the visual interpretation of brain data and, in addition, drive a
Data Immersive Visualization Environment (DIVE). The premise behind the DIVE is
to provide investigators with the unique ability to visually step inside their
data and analyze it in new, unexpected ways. The additional computational nodes
will accelerate the speed of both interactive manipulation of multidimensional
brain data sets and complex offline computations. The incorporation of high
speed networking equipment will facilitate local and offsite network access to
these computer resources and improve overall communication between the local,
national, and international communities of neuroscientists.&lt;br/&gt;This
instrumentation not only benefits ongoing research in brain development,
heritability and function but because analysis and interpretation of
multidimensional brain data is elevated to the next level, it will open the
doors to new insights and better understanding of brain structure and function
in health and disease.&lt;br/&gt;
