The CHMPR/NCSU site will conduct transdisciplinary translational research by
working across academic, industry, and user boundaries, to work on problems
relevant to industry needs. In particular, CHMPR/NCSU will leverage its
relatively-high-risk fundamental developments to help those industry
organizations that have longer-term, more complex analytic needs. The CHMPR/NCSU
research will develop basic techniques that can be applied across multiple
industry sectors, including national security, health care, manufacturing,
energy, and business intelligence. This vision for the planned site complements
the vision of existing center by providing the core Big-Data expertise domains
and addressing the productivity, performance and scalability issues in meeting
the insatiable computational demands of its sponsors applications through the
continuous evolution of multicore architectures and open source tools.

The CHMPR/NCSU site will address the future Big-Data needs of the industry. It
will contribute to the creation and dissemination of new knowledge in this
important field. In particular, the fundamental research conducted at CHMPR/NCSU
will be translated into technology developments, delivering practical solutions
to hard problems. This translation will apply to federal agencies, government
organizations, and industry sectors facing the hard Big-Data problems. NCSU is
incorporating multidisciplinary approaches to Big-Data problems into their core-
course curricula. The CHMPR/NCSU site will significantly expand the number of
industry or government organizations sponsoring student research projects
addressing the real-problem applications, and will expose the students to
disciplines relevant to the industry-application problems. CHMPR/NCSU will
produce a cadre of graduate students with hands-on data-enablement expertise to
meet the growing critical shortage of qualified data scientists in the country.
The site will leverage extensive resources available at NCSU to address the
broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.
