The Small Grant for Exploratory Research will support a national random digit
dial telephone survey of public reaction to the terrorists attacks on September
11, 2001. The survey will examine the impact of the events from sociological and
psychological perspectives, including behavioral, affective, and cognitive
aspects. It will consider responses at both the individual and collective
levels. Survey items will focus on four major areas: (1) interpersonal
communication, (2) personal and communal responses, (3) psychological and
psycho-physiological responses, and (4) basic beliefs and values. In selecting
questions for the survey the investigators will draw significantly from the 1963
Presidential Assignation Study and from the NSF-supported General Social Survey.
By using existing questions, the PIs will be able to compare responses to those
that occurred during both another period of national tragedy and to those that
occur during more normal times. Oversampling will also be done in the New York
City area will allow comparisons of responses of people near ground zero who
likely to have viewed some of the events directly and to have personal ties to
areas and people directly involved with others who were more remote. On a
general theoretical level, the investigators will test existing hypotheses about
how social support and interpersonal networks, socio-economic status, and
religious beliefs affect how people cope with tragedy.
