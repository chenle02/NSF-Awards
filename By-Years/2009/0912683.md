This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on developing
computer aided design (CAD) tools for the design of state-of-the-art Silicon
Carbide (SiC) Power Double-Diffused Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect-
Transistor (DMOSFET) and Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) based electric
power-conversion systems for hybrid and all-electric commercial and military
vehicles.

These tools will aid device manufacturers and power conversion system designers,
to develop high power, energy-efficient, and light-weight, power converters
using SiC power devices. These devices are capable of working at extremely high
temperatures and power levels that are beyond the theoretical limits of
currently used Silicon power semiconductors. Use of this technical know-how and
tool set for designing novel power conversion systems for automobiles will play
a direct role in reducing green-house gases in the atmosphere. This project will
assist the design of energy efficient, ultra-low emission, and environmentally
friendly automobiles.
