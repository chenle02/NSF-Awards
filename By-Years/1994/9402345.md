9402345 Shimizu This project will examine melt inclusions in a variety of
olivines to confirm a hypothesis, based on previous work, that melting beneath
mid-ocean ridges can occur much deeper than previously believed. The authors
will also look for evidence of disequilibrium for various elements, and will
develop a detailed 3D interpretation of melt history in a single system, based
on a large number of available samples.
