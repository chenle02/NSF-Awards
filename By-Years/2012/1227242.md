San Jose State University proposes to support technical services on R/V Point
Sur, a 135? general purpose UNOLS research vessel operated by the Moss Landing
Marine Laboratories as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System research fleet. They request support for basic services and maintenance
of a towed, undulating vehicle as specialized services. They will provide one
technician on each seagoing research project of R/V Point Sur to support
seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified
users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. The budget
in this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing grant.

Broader Impacts The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion
two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its
shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research
projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research
program of NSF). The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
