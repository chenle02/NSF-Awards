9531720 Maki This is a renewed grant to a PI with more than thirty years of
distinguished accomplishments in superconductivity and other phenomena involving
symmetry breaking in condensed matter physics. The present grant will study the
d-wave superconductivity. A number of phenomena in the novel superconductors
e.g. High Tc cuprates, heavy fermions and even some of the organic
superconductors are currently believed to derive from Cooper pairs in a finite
angular momentum (mostly l=2) ground state. This grant also includes a study of
the vortex state of a d-wave superconductor, including a detailed examination of
the density of states of quasiparticles and the anisotropies that may be
observable. %%% Many of the new discoveries in superconductivity seem to
indicate a new type of superconductivity. In this new form, the superconductors
are anisotropic and sometimes have a trace amount of resistance (dissipation).
This grant is a program of research in the properties of the new form of
superconductivity with an attempt to identify the critical experiments that can
conclusively determine the role of the new form. ***
