This award provides funding for a workshop that will bring together key
education representatives from ocean sciences and related professional societies
to: 1) share society practices and K-12 programs with education representatives
of other professional societies, 2) increase opportunities for collaboration
among professional societies, and 3) develop recommendations for professional
society K-12 outreach. This workshop is designed as a community-building
collaboration focused on K-12 education and ocean sciences. To keep the needs of
diverse student populations (and teachers) front and center, participation of
?diversity focused? professional societies will be encouraged. The interactions,
dissemination of model programs, and collaborations developed during the
workshop will be used to guide the development of a set of recommendations for
how professional societies should focus their K-12 education efforts in ocean
sciences.
