This project intends to develop mathematical tools that are in common use in
classical analysis (e.g., notions of regularity, ideas from the theory of
partial differential equations) in the noncommutative context that arises in so-
called free probability theory. The underlying mathematics is extremely rich and
has many connections with quantum physics. Progress in development of these
tools is expected to have a significant impact on von Neumann algebra theory and
random matrix theory, as well as on subfactor theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
principal aim fo the project is to understand the structure of a class of
noncommutative states called "free Gibbs states." These objects appear in
Voiculescu's free probability theory as analogs of classical-probability Gibbs
distributions. Besides free probability, their properties turn out to be
important in von Neumann algebra theory, random matrix theory, and subfactor
theory. The main new tool useful for understanding these states is that of free
transport. Developed by A. Guoinnet and the principal investigator, this tool
has already been proved to be useful for answering questions such as isomorphism
of certain von Neumann algebras and computations of standard invariants of
certain subfactors. More development and understanding is needed. The project
will study and develop noncommutative techniques in partial differential
equations that would enable one to construct transport maps, as well as to study
critical phenomena. Along the way, the principal investigator will investigate
questions of regularity of noncommutative maps.
