This Growing Convergence Research project is seeking to explain the resilience
of genotype-phenotype maps through functional epistasis via a convergence of
three overlapping fields of investigation: molecular evolution, data science and
statistical physics. The project is motivated by an unanticipated amount of
variation in populations, gene families, and phylogenetic groups revealed by DNA
sequencing of genes, individuals, and species. These voluminous data on
variation are posing unexpected challenges to the (nearly) neutral theory of
molecular evolution that explains the fate of new mutations in a population
through random genetic drift and purifying selection. The research team will
employ mechanistic models of epistasis, co-evolutionary processes, and deep
learning. Deep integration across disciplines will be key for exploring the
pivotal role of epistasis and, ultimately, for interrogating the most
fundamental rules of life. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team proposes a
transdisciplinary project to set the foundations for a novel neutral-by-
epistasis theory of molecular evolution. This team hypothesizes that a vast
majority of population variation and species differences are due to random
genetic drift of mutations that are neutral by epistasis, even though each may
be individually detrimental. The new neutral-by-epistasis theory unites both
neutral and nearly-neutral theories of molecular evolution and has the potential
for a paradigm shift in which epistatic interactions between positions, rather
than any individual position are the primary unit of comparative
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
