This project continues the past research program in unconstrained and
constrained optimization. The project has three main parts. First, limited
memory methods will be developed for large bound constrained and nonlinearly
constrained optimization problems. A new algebraic representation of the limited
memory update developed earlier will greatly facilitate the use of the limited
memory approached for constrained optimization, and should help produce very
efficient methods for large constrained problems. Second, tensor methods will be
developed for large, sparse nonlinear problems, including nonlinear equations,
nonlinear least squares, and unconstrained optimization, and also for
nonlinearly constrained optimization problems. This approach shows great promise
of producing methods that are very robust and efficient on nonsingular and
singular problems and that, in the sparse case, can efficiently use any desired
direct or iterative solver. Third, new trust region methods will be developed
and analyzed for nonlinearly constrained optimization problems with inequality
and equality constraints. These methods are expected to have strong global
convergence properties even in the presence of linearly dependent constraint
gradients, and to perform robustly and efficiently in practice. In addition,
research will be carried out on a modified Cholesky factorization for large
sparse constrained optimization, and on efficient methods for implicit nonlinear
least squares problems.
