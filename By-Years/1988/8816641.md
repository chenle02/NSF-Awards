This study is an investigation of how the properties of antarctic snow grains
affect spectral and angular variations in the reflectance pattern of solar
radiation in the visible and near-infrared bands. The project will increase our
understanding of the optical properties of the antarctic ice sheet, and will
provide a quantitative data base for polar terrestrial and planetary remote
sensing applications. The goal of this research is to develop empirical and
quantitative methods which can be used to relate satellite-based and other
remotely sensed measurements to the microphysical of the snow surface. The
project has implications that extend to the climatology of Antarctica since
surface temperatures in the interior are determined to a great extent by the
optical properties of the snow. The antarctic snow surface is moreover much more
stable than mid-latitude alpine snow surfaces since there is little or no
diurnal variation in the elevation of the sun. The antarctic snow and ice sheet
is also less contaminated with soot and other deposited aerosols then non-polar
snow surfaces. The project is well-designed, builds upon the existing data base,
and is a necessary component in the development of interpretation algorithms for
aircraft and satellite observations.
