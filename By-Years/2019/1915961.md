This award provides support for US-based participants in the 2019 series of
Mathematical Sciences Workshops to be held at the Casa Matematica Oaxaca (CMO)
in Oaxaca, Mexico during the period April through December 2019. CMO activities
aim to contribute to advancing the frontiers of research in mathematical
sciences worldwide, to strengthen the research schools and groups in mathematics
and its interactions, in Mexico and eventually in Latin America, and to foster
the academic ties of these with top level mathematicians and research schools in
the world, particularly in North America. Participation in the CMO workshops
nurtures a globally-engaged US scientific workforce and provides US-based
participants unique opportunities for interaction and collaboration with leading
researchers from across the globe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The twenty-five 2019 CMO
Workshops include a broad range of research areas in the mathematical sciences
and their applications. Each workshop hosts up to 42 participants in an
intensive, 5-day event. Video recordings of workshop presentations are
published, as are workshop reports that summarize the state of the research and
directions for further work. More information on the 2019 CMO Workshops can be
found at the CMO web site https://www.birs.ca/cmo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
