&lt;br/&gt;EIA-0303785 Andrew D. Ellington University of Texas- Austin Detection
of Nucleic Acid Ligand Interactions on Microfabricated
Surfaces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By putting effector-activated nucleic acid
catalysts (aptazymes) on nanoscale mechanical and electronic devices, is
allowing for a new paradigm for the integration of the biological world with
electronic instrumentation. The aptazymes can sense a wide variety of analytes,
such as metabolites, proteins, and even cell surfaces, and transduce the
information directly to the mechanical or (ultimately) electronic devices. This
most basic circuit for the transmogrification of biological and chemical
information into electronic information should enable the construction of
extremely novel devices not only for sensing, but also for actuation.
Ultimately, these types of experiments will lead to a better integration of
organismal physiology with instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;
