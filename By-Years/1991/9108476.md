The study of normal topological spaces has long been an important topic in
classical set-theoretic topology and, more recently, the structure theory of
normal locally compact Hausdorff spaces has been of spacial interest. Several
well- known problems, mostly involving topological spaces in the classes of
normal or normal locally compact spaces, will be studied by the investigators.
It is expected that set-theoretic techniques such as forcing, infinite
combinatorics and large cardinals will be the principle tools used in the
eventual solution of these problems. Set theory lies at the foundations of
mathematics in that all of mathematics can in principle be built up from set
theory, albeit laboriously, by adding appropriate definitions, deriving
consequences from the chosen axioms, and then compressing their statements by
use of the definitions. Some topics lie closer to set theory, however, by virtue
of needing fewer added definitions in this process. Classical set-theoretic
topology is such a subject, really a very close neighbor, and so it shares some
of the philosophical importance of set theory itself.
