Through this project, the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry will form a
National Science and Technology Week (NSTW) Teacher Training and Materials
Dissemination Network. The Network will utilize a series of training and
orientation workshops for K-12 teachers throughout the nation to disseminate
information and materials on the NSF-sponsored NTSW program and to create a
cadre of NSTW ambassadors. The workshops, which are to be coordinated with NSF's
Teacher Enhancement Program, will serve almost 5000 teachers over the three year
period. 530,000 students, including a significant number from underrepresented
groups, will in turn be influenced by the project. Cost sharing from the
Corporate sponsors of NSTW in the amount of $150,000 is 86% of the NSF
contribution to this project.
