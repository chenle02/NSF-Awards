REU Sites are NSF funded projects that provide research experiences for
undergraduate students. The directors of the REU Sites that are funded primarily
out of astronomy will get together for a meeting to discuss best practices and
lessons learned for recruitment of students from smaller institutions and
broadening participation from a diverse population of students. This proposal
will support this meeting, to be held in Alexandria
Virginia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site directors meeting will be held in
conjunction with the Council on Undergraduate Research that will be held October
29, 2018. The meeting will address issues of common concern among astronomy REU
Site directors. Some of the main topics will include recruitment from lesser-
known universities and small colleges, enhancing the participation and
recruitment of female and under-represented minority students, and establishing
connections with local programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
