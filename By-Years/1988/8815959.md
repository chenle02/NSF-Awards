This investigation will examine the chemical ecology of many of the most
abundant and conspicuous benthic sponges in the shallow continental shelf waters
of Antarctica. This represents the first comprehensive analysis of toxicological
and feeding deterrent characteristics of marine sponges in any polar system. The
multi-bioassay approach will employ a variety of organisms including embryonic,
juvenile and adult marine invertebrates, and marine vertebrates, which co-occur
with sponges. Recent evidence suggests that toxicity is common in antarctic
sponges. Importantly, those sponges which reveal biological activity will be
chemically analyzed to isolate and elucidate their active metabolites. Moreover,
given the high potential for novel chemical compounds, extracts of antarctic
marine sponges will be tested for anti- viral and anti-tumor activity. The
proposed study will facilitate an understanding of latitudinal and taxonomic
patterns of toxicity in marine sponges and, ultimately, provide important
information on the role of chemical compounds in the ecology of antarctic
benthic communities.
