Activation of the sympathetic nervous system plays a pivotal role in the
response of an organism to stress. This activation and the resultant
cardiovascular adjustments in large part determine the organism's chances for
survival. Studies of sympathetic efferent discharge, plasma catacholamines, and
cardiovascular function have documented this increase in activity. Recently, a
potent system for modulation of sympathetic activity by endogenous opioid
peptides has been described. In the conscious, intact animal, this system is
apparently involved with limiting sympathetic activation during stress. Although
this system may function in a variety of stressful situations, the work of Dr.
James Schadt will focus on its role in hemorrhagichypotension. This work will be
performed on rabbits and will use neurochemical measures to determine blood
levels of essential peptides during stress and correlate these with sympathetic
nervous system activity. This work is important in understanding the biological
basis of stress.
