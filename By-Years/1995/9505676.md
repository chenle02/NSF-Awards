9505676 Drake This award provides one-half the funding required to purchase
components to upgrade the electron microprobe instrument housed and operated in
the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona. The University
is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition. The
upgrade consists of replacing the system's computer control hardware and
software, replacing a contaminated backscattered electron detector, and
acquiring a new vacuum evaporating unit for carbon coating of non-conductive
samples. The electron microprobe is a basic analytical tool for microanalysis of
solids used by a large group of researchers on the University of Arizona campus
from the Lunar and Planetary Lab, the Department of Geosciences, Materials
Sciences, and Engineering. This upgrade ensures access to a state-of-the-art
instrument at a minimal cost compared to a new instrument. ***
