This project will obtain the equipment necessary to assemble a scalar network
analysis system for use in an undergraduate antenna design laboratory. Using a
Hewlett Packard 8756A network analyzer as a basis, a system will be constructed
to allow students to investigate the transfer characteristics of transmission
lines, impedance transformation devices and the design of antennas.
