The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is treating
onychomycosis for the millions of people around the world who are suffering from
this painful and dangerous disease. Onychomycosis, or toenail fungus, has been
shown to cause significant psychosocial issues and lead to dangerous medical
complications. Currently, onychomycosis is treated topically, but these drugs
are unable to permeate the nail and therefore are unable to reach and treat the
fungus. Our technology has found success using ultrasound to increase the
delivery of the drug to the nailbed. The onychomycosis market is estimated to be
$3.1B with an 8.3% growth rate. Additionally, our technology may potentially
have applications in podiatry, the nail salon market and as well as direct-to-
customer markets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project utilizes
therapeutic ultrasound for improving treatment success of onychomycosis. Due to
poor nail permeation, the most commonly used topical drug has a cure rate of
only 36% after 6 months of daily application. The research group has performed
tests in both porcine and human nails and these tests found that ultrasound
increases nail permeation by up to 6 times. Safety modeling studies found that
the application of therapeutic ultrasound to the toe is safe. The laboratory
identified the likely mechanisms of ultrasound action of drug delivery through
the nail to be cavitation-induced pits production in the nail surface and
streaming which causes the movement of fluid within a localized
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
