This research is on numerical methods for digital logic synthesis based on
spectral information of the logic description. The approach is to use the BDD
description of the circuits to develop efficient methods for computing the
spectral coefficients. Because of the numerical nature of the algorithms, design
optimizations can be included in the synthesis process, rather than later.
Theoretical results are being derived and used to implement a new class of
synthesis algorithms that are suitable for incorporation into existing design
environments. The algorithms are being tested on industry benchmarks.
