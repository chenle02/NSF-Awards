Laser-driven collisions of electrons and atoms--so-called "recollisions"-- are a
key process in ultrastrong lasers. Understanding their role in various laser
field configurations is potentially very rewarding for tracking the motion of
giant molecules by taking their snapshots in real time. A mechanism which
accounts for the rich physics in these strong laser fields is urgently needed.
In particular, the impact of recolliding electrons "hitching rides" on special
orbits on their way to and from the atom will be researched using mechanical
models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanical treatments of atoms are the perfect
physics education and training tool because they allow many atomic properties to
be understood pictorially and with comparatively little effort. In addition to
graduate student training, undergraduate research projects on classical dynamics
will be a component of this research program, as will advising mathematics and
science teachers at high schools and technical colleges on pedagogical aspects
of atoms. This research is often viewed as a valuable source for applications by
mathematicians, and a source of new insights by chemists and therefore serves to
strengthen the research infrastructure.
