Abstract ATM-9714910 Gray, William M. Colorado State University Title: Climate
Analysis and Extreme Range Seasonal Prediction This research is for further
development and application of a range of extended climate forecasting schemes.
These schemes include 1) seasonal hurricane activity in the Atlantic and East
Pacific basins, extending to specific groupings of hurricanes by origin and
movement, 2) seasonal rainfall in West Africa, tropical areas of the Atlantic,
Americas and East Pacific and 3) ENSO variability. Along with the basic science
concerning underlying physical mechanisms, this work seeks greater forecast
accuracy at 9 to 14 month lead times. This research into long range climate
prediction, if successful, will have significant societal impacts in mitigating
the effects of seasonal and interannual climate variability.
