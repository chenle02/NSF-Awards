This symposium on the history of modern mathematics will bring together thirty
leading authorities from eight countries who will present papers on various
aspects of 19th and early 20th century mathematics. The symposium has been
organized with three underlying principles in mind: 1) that its program reflect
the diversity of approaches recently taken by scholars who have written about
various aspects of the era's mathematical culture; 2) that certain topics
characteristic of the period be emphasized so as to give the program thematic
unity; and 3) that particular emphasis be placed on issues pertaining to the
tension between pure and applied mathematics, and to matters that shed some
light on the relationships between mathematics and other scientific disciplines.
With these principles in mind, the symposium will address the following themes
in eight separate sessions: 1) Mathematical Institutions in France and Germany
and their Role in Promoting Applications; 2) Relationships between Mathematics
and Physics; 3) Foundations of Mathematics; 4) Complex Variable Theory; 5)
Geometry in the Spirit of Klein's Erlangen Program; 7) Algebra and Number
Theory; and 8) Formative Influences on Mathematics in the United States.
