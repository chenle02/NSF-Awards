This research is concerned with studying geometric objects with a computer. The
thrust of the proposal is to investigate the class of minimal surfaces based on
algebraic curves that are twice differentiable. Graphical representations of
these objects will be obtained with the aid of Mathematica, a symbolic
manipulator. The resulting computer models will be examined for patterns and
symmetries, with the goal of classifying the type of algebraic curves that
generate minimal surfaces without self-intersections.
