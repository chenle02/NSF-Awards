Nitrogen loss from corn farming in the Midwest is a major cause of water
pollution and greenhouse gas emission. Focusing on farms in Iowa, Illinois, and
Michigan, this project will address important gaps in our current understanding
of the links between the decisions of corn farmers and the quality of water and
air in the region. Researchers will refine previous work on nitrogen loss to
take variability within farm fields into account, identify the factors that
influence the decisions of farmers about fertilizer use, and develop an
integrated, quantitative model that couples the natural dynamics of nitrogen
cycling with the social and economic dynamics of farming.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this project will help farmers and policy
makers evaluate alternative ways to reduce water pollution and greenhouse gas
emissions from Midwestern row crops. A Nitrogen Roundtable will bring
researchers, managers, and stakeholders together, and the project will engage
K-12 educators to disseminate research results to the public. The model to be
produced is expected to provide a new decision-support tool for more sustainable
agriculture in the U.S.
