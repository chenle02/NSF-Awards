We propose to apply a molecular and genetic approach to identify the genes that
function in a signal transduction pathway that regulates a gene critical for
development. The transcriptional regulation of the cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterase in the early development of Dictyostelium discoideum will be
investigated through the analysis of existing and new regulatory mutations. The
following approaches will be pursued. 1) The defects in two pds A mutations that
specifically alter regulation of the phosphodiesterase will be identified. 2) We
will develop a suicide selection method that utilizes extrachromosomal shuttle
vectors to isolate new regulatory mutations that are specific for the
phosphodiesterase gene. 3) Genetic complementation analysis will be performed
with the new and existing mutations to elucidate the activities involved in the
developmental regulation of the phosphodiesterase gene. Our approach should
complement the work of others studying receptor-mediated events of signal
transduction to identify molecules that link the members of a signal
transduction chain into a pathway from the cell surface to the nucleus. //
