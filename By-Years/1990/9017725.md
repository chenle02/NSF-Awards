The way the magnetic field of the earth connects with the interplanetary
magnetic field is an interesting and important problem for understanding the
near-earth space environment. Field lines from the polar cap do not close at the
opposite pole of the earth when they emanate from higher magnetic latitudes than
a boundary called the separatrix, but rather connect with the interplanetary
field. Flow of mass and energy across this boundary gives mass and evergy flow
between open and closed field lines, and drives the majority of magnetospheric
processes. The energy involved comes almost entirely from the solar wind. This
projects seeks to initiate a large-scale study of an important related
phenomenon called the magetospheric reconnection rate under a variety of
geophysical conditions using ionospheric observations from the Sonderstrom
incoherent scatter radar. The investigators have developed a technique that
shows great promise of allowing the measurement of plasma flow across the
separatrix, and from this flow to determine the reconnection rate.
