When computer scientists think of Computer Programming in mathematical terms,
their thoughts are usually dominated by logic and the tools (Recursive
Functions, Complexity, Combinatorics, ...) inherited from mathematical logic. P
I plans to work with Sussman at the AI Lab of MIT in 1992- 93, to try to
propagate the ideas out into the computer science and mathematics community. The
P I has some interesting ideas involving what might be called "technology
transfer of mathematics." He will work on a computational approach to this
activity.
