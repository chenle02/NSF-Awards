The College of Oceanography at Oregon State University will acquire several
items of oceanographic instrument- ation to be placed in a pool of shared use
equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the
R/V WECOMA, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the University. A
substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1991 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ship and of the University to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -CTD sensors, pressure
gauges, and other enhancements for obtaining detailed profiles of seawater
conductivity and temperature as a function of depth, -an upgrade for an
autoanalyzer that measures a variety of chemical constituents in seawater, and
-a large volume pump and filtration system for making a variety of biological
and chemical measurements at sea. The instrumentation described above will
increase the capability of the University to support NSF-sponsored research and
engineering projects.
