9457604 Idriss This project is a NSF Young Investigator Award. The subject of
the research is concerned with the safety of bridges, in particular steel
bridges. The research activity includes modelling the safety of steel bridges
which have undergone various degrees of deterioration. The use of nondestructive
evaluations and monitoring determine the condition of the bridge, and full or
large scale testing to verify the mathematical models. ***
