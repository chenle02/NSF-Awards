IRI-9314969 This project intends to take advantage of the simplicity of the
classical statistical trigram model of language while augmenting it with the
syntactic and semantic aspects which constrain the use of the new grammatical
trigram model to advantage over the purely stochastic model. The concepts of
probabilistic link grammars are used in this research, incorporating trigrams
into a unified framework for modeling long-distance grammatical dependencies in
computationally efficient ways. The methods proposed are expected to have
greater predictive power over current methods from the point of view of entropy
measurements, and to integrate finite-state automata models and new statistical
estimation algorithms with modern powerful machines resulting in improved speech
recognition, translation, and understanding systems.
