9630426 Prechtl The mechanisms by which the cortex mediates the perception and
recognition of objects in the environment is an important, but little understood
aspect of brain function. Research funded by this grant exploits the technical
and behavioral advantages of studying the reptilian brain in order to learn
about fundamental cortical mechanisms of perception. In particular, optical
methods are used to analyze electrical brain activity in an entire cortical area
while the animal perceives a variety of behaviorally relevant visual stimuli.
The perceptual interpretation of each visual stimulus is indexed by
simultaneously monitoring the response of the animal to the stimulus. The aim is
to identify those features of large scale cortical activity that are related to
cognitive processes such as recognition and categorization. This research is
expect to lead to a deeper understanding of how large-scale electrical activity
in animal brains is related to cognitive function.
