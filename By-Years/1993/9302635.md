Monazite is a rare-earth element phosphate that occurs as an accessory mineral
in a variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks. It is of interest to
geochronologists because the mineral incorporates uranium into its crystal
structure and can thus be used in age-dating. This project will study the
temperature- dependent diffusion parameters for Pb in monazite, allowing
geoscientists to utilize this potential for dating geologic events.
