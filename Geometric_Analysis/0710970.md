The Bloomington Geometry Workshop brings together leading geometers to discuss
and disseminate recent advances in geometry and related fields. The workshop has
already established a tradition of excellence which we wish to further and
enhance in the coming years. This year's list of speakers includes Stephanie
Alexander, Robert Gulliver, Tadeusz Januszkiewicz, Ilya Kapovich, William
Minicozzi, Liviu Nicolaescu, Christina Sormani, Giuseppe Tinaglia, and Frederico
Xavier. These speakers will inform participants of current developments in the
areas of minimal surfaces, geometric group theory, geometric PDE's and other
areas of geometric analysis.

The purpose of the Workshop is to help foster cooperation and collaboration
among researchers in the Midwest region as well as help educate graduate
students and young researchers about the latest developments in geometry. Most
of the funding will be used to support the travel of graduate students and
recent PhD's. These young researchers will come away from the workshop better
prepared to take part in current research in geometry, a field of basic research
that is important to computer graphics, quantum physics, material science, and
many other scientific disciplines.
