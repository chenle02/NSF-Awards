9707729 Baneyx The purpose of this research is to minimize the improper folding
and aggregation of proteins produced in E. coli, hence reducing a very costly
part (refolding) of the downstream processing. This proposal follows previous
observations that a low-temperature, inducible cold-shock promoter drives the
proper folding of recombinant proteins. Unfortunately, after a short period the
promoter is repressed at the lower temperature and protein production drops. The
two major aims of the research are to eliminate the repressor gene segment
believed to lie on the 5' non- coding region of the cold-shock promoter gene and
to coexpress protein disulfide isomerases to promote the proper folding and
disulfide bonding of the proteins. ***
