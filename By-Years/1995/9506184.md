9220287 Chan This US-Bulgaria Joint Cooperative Research on Iterative Methods
for Large- Scale Discretization Problems is between Dr. Tony F.-C. Chan and Dr.
Barry F. Smith of the University of California Los Angeles, and Dr. Panayot
Vassilevski, Dr. Svetozar D. Margenov, and Dr. Oleg P. Iliev of the Center of
Informatics & Computer Technology. The research topics will include
computational study (performance and analysis) of efficient iterative methods,
based on domain decomposition, multilevel, and on ILU techniques for solving
discretized differential equations. Such a collaboration will benefit both sides
which have different experience on various aspects of multi-level, domain
decomposition and general preconditioning methods. The research will focus on
anisotropic, nonsymmetric, indefinite and/or almost indefinite problems obtained
when discretizing elliptic equations with strong anisotropy, convection-
diffusion type problems, elasticity equations including the incompressible
limit, and Navier-Stokes equations, for example in stream- function vorticity
formulation. Advances in deriving efficient solution methods for problems such
as Navier-Stokes equations should be applicable to a large class of important
processes in, say, ecology, weather prediction, oil and gas recovery, design of
new constructive elements and materials, and in fluid dynamics. This research in
mathematics fulfills the program objective of advancing science by enabling
leading experts in the United States and Bulgaria to combine complementary
talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence. ***
