This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports research
by Prof. J. K. Kochi, University of Houston, aimed at understanding the dynamics
of oxidation-reduction and single-electron-transfer processes in the activation
of organic and organometallic compounds. Though this work is directed at
elucidating the fundamental steps involved in bond activation, it also has
direct applicability to homogeneous catalysis of industrially important chemical
reactions and to understanding enzymatic catalysis of biological processes. This
project will focus on six studies designed to elucidate and utilize the charge-
transfer phenomenon in chemical dynamics, especially of transient ions and
radicals formed in solution from molecular electron donor-acceptor complexes.
This work has potential application to solar energy storage and to development
of molecular memories. Specifically, work will be carried out on: (1) charge-
transfer theory and the activated complex, using time-resolved spectroscopy; (2)
isolation and molecular structures of donor-acceptor complexes; (3) direct
examination of the dynamics of transient ion radicals and ion pairs; (4)
photochemical promotion of organic donor-acceptor interactions; (5)
organometallic compounds as electron donors in solution and in the solid state;
and (6) photoredox reactions of cations and anions. This work continues research
previously supported by Foundation grant, CHE-8401324.
