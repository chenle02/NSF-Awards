In the past decade, the New Guinea region has been found to be a mega
biodiversity hotspot for amphibians, containing one of the most ecologically
diverse groups of amphibians in the world, the asterphryine frogs. Asterophryine
diversity is likely influenced by New Guinea's unique geological history. These
accretion events are fairly well dated, allowing the investigators to calibrate
biological diversification to geological events and to determine the geological
context in which evolutionary novelties arose. This system is not only ideal for
studying how species multiply but also offers the unique opportunity to infer
the relative order in which important processes occurred. This project will
produce a comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the asterphryine frogs, assessing
the geological conditions required for species to multiply, and determining
whether natural selection preceded species diversification or vice versa. These
studies will identify the mechanistic basis for this adaptive radiation of
species, and will provide valuable insights for understanding the factors which
promote biodiversity in all living groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impacts of
this research are numerous. The project will: (1) provide the first detailed
evolutionary study on any portion of the remarkably diverse but poorly studied
New Guinea fauna; (2) include educational field trips for elementary-aged school
children, allowing them to learn about biodiversity, amphibians, functional
morphology, and conservation from working scientists; (3) train graduate and
undergraduate students in research, teaching, public outreach, and professional
skills; (4) recruit underrepresented minorities and women in the sciences; and
(5) strengthen scientific training in a traditionally disadvantaged region.
