This award will fund Undergraduate Design Projects to develop custom software
and/or devices for persons with either mental or physical disabilities. The
students will work with institutions providing care or training for the targeted
populations and will provide written reports on the projects completed each
year. This type of undertaking is important since not only will it provide
meaningful projects for engineering students to complete as part of their
education, but it will also benefit a population where customization is usually
required to increase the usefulness of the device and/or software.
