Ultraplankton provide 70-80% of the primary productivity of the open oceans.
There are three major groups of ultraplankton (1) prokaryotic organisms; (2)
green algae; and (3) golden algae. The PI proposes to survey the North Atlantic
and North Pacific oceans for ultraplankton members of the two protistan classes
of golden algae---Chrysophyta and Prymnesiophyta, to produce whole mounts and
sectioned materials, to culture the collected specimens, to study these
specimens and cultures---and cultures already in-hand --- using electron
microscopy. These taxa are seldom collected and even fewer are in culture.
Consequently, little is known about their biology, in spite of their
significance in world primary production. This study should begin to rectify
that lack of knowledge by cataloging the species and making them available for
in-depth studies.
