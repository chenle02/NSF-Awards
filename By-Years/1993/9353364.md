9353364 Odom This is a four-year project designed to present staggered 3-year
programs of mathematics content, pedagogy, and assessment for all the elementary
school teachers, K-6, and school administrators in the 122 buildings in
Montgomery County, Maryland. Teachers will be involved in up to 60 hours of
preparation in content modules, which include extensive attention to how
children learn that content. School administrators and teachers of special
subjects are involved with focused activities for improving student performance
in mathematics from their perspectives. The school building is the unit of
administration in this program. All faculty and administration in the building
will be involved in the project simultaneously. An additional 30 hours of
activities is planned to be used by the entire faculty at the school site based
on their needs assessment following the content component. The project materials
are based on a broad base of materials from the mathematics reform and the
research base being developed through another NSF-funded project: Project IMPACT
carried out in the district. Project staff and district leaders will be
available to teachers and administrators through the full 3-year cycle for each
school. These individuals are in the district, and they have assignments which
allow involvement in the activities and a availability for site support.
Additional support is being developed through area colleges and universities
which are planning to offer extended offerings for teachers and use the program
as a model for the preservice education. The district will be able to monitor
student performance on several measures used in the district including
standardized testing, state testing, and district assessment programs which are
being developed to include performance based activities. In addition, the
project will monitor teacher and administrator changes through participant
surveys and classroom observations.
