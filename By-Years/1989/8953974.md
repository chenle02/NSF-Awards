Faculty from a broad spectrum of institutions, including two-year colleges, are
learning ways to use Mathematics and exchanging ideas on how to use this
powerful tool in the teaching of calculus. The invited speakers at this
conference and the PIs have been using Mathematics and other integrated symbol
manipulation and graphics systems in their calculus courses and have seen
exciting possibilities for their use. The conference participants are learning
about these systems and are making suggestions about ways to use these tools.
