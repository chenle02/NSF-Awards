The objective of this project is to carry out fundamental research to develop a
sequential methodology for system design evaluation. This research combines the
robust design concepts of Taguchi's design dependent parameter models with a
system optimization process resulting in a novel and innovative approach to
system sensitivity analysis. The expected product is the development of an
efficient methodology to assist in the implementation of concurrent engineering
during the early system design stage. Integration of the methodology with
Computer Aided Engineering/Computer Aided Design tools will also be explored.
This research is expected to impact the development and design of complex
systems, both commercial and public sector, while also influencing some aspects
of strategic planning.
