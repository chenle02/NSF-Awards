The Building Engineering Team Skills Program proposes to determine industry best
&lt;br/&gt;practices by culling practitioners' experience and expertise and then
adapting those&lt;br/&gt;practices to build engineering team skills as part of
the University educational&lt;br/&gt;experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a
great need for research to determine what capabilities,
characteristics&lt;br/&gt;and dispositions of engineers working on teams are
most valued by industry. Similarly,&lt;br/&gt;there is a great need to
understand what practices best serve to create and nurture which&lt;br/&gt;team
skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best practices will be determined through multiple
research methodologies targeting&lt;br/&gt;multiple respondent sources and
utilizing a phased approach. Completion of each phase&lt;br/&gt;will provide
results specifically designed to inform the next research phase. There
will&lt;br/&gt;be three phases consisting of Manager Interviews, Manager Survey,
and Engineer&lt;br/&gt;Survey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the research phases
determining skill value and the best practices for creating
those&lt;br/&gt;skills have been completed, then course curricula, materials and
exercises will be planned.&lt;br/&gt;Activities will first occur at California
State University Hayward, then at University of &lt;br/&gt;California, Berkeley,
two institutions rich in the diversity of their underrepresented student
populations.&lt;br/&gt;
