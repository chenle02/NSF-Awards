This research project is directed at improved understanding and prediction of
atmospheric variability with time scales longer than a week. This 'low-frequency
variability' is generated by external forcing (as in the annual cycle),
dynamical processes internal to the atmosphere such as blocking, and by
interactions between the atmosphere and the underlying media (primarily the
oceanic mixed layer and the land-surface hydrology). The research involves the
diagnosis of observational data sets using statistical techniques such as
compositing, digital filtering, principal component analysis, singular value
decomposition, and cluster analysis. Results are interpreted in light of the
current theoretical understanding of weather and climate systems. The research
will address (1) detection and interpretation of interannual and interdecadal
climate variability in Northern Hemisphere temperature and pressure fields, (2)
nonlinear aspects of low-frequency variability including the question of whether
the Northern Hemisphere winter circulation exhibits distinct 'circulation
regimes' manifested in truly bimodal frequency distributions, (3) relationships
between patterns of sea-surface temperature anomalies observed in different
seasons and in different parts of the world ocean, (4) some poorly understood
aspects of the climatological mean annual cycle and (5) systematic errors in
extended-range numerical weather prediction. This research is important because
it seeks to improve our understanding of weather and climate processes and hence
has the potential for improving our ability to predict weather and climate.
