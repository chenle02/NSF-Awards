This project proposes to analyze glass inclusions in quartz phenocrysts from
three tin-mineralized rhyolites of western North America for volatiles and Li,
Be, Rb, Cs, Y, Nb, Ba, Sr, Th, Y, Mo, W, REE's and Sn by electron microprobe,
ion microprobe, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The data will be
integrated with existing information on the petrology, field relations, and
whole rock geochemistry to better understand the enrichment and depletion of
volatiles, as well as major, trace, and ore elements in evolved magmas. The
study will determine how highly-evolved magmas become differentiated, will
constrain accurate values for the maximum concentrations of magmatic volatile
constituents in such systems, and will relate true magmatic volatile abundances
to eruptive style.
