Beginning biology students served by this Community College System often lack
prior laboratory experience and suffer from "lab fear." To provide more
opportunity for hands-on laboratory training and coaching by a teacher a Video
Laboratory Enhancement System is being introduced into several courses thant
rely heavily on microscopic observation and dissection. The VLE system allows
instructors to demonstrate to many students simultaneously, the structure and
organisms of interest so that the students can devote more quality time on their
own to independent laboratory observations and work. The equipment will be
shared among the six colleges making up the community college system, and has
the potential to impact on several thousand students annually, many of whom are
from groups that are currently underrepresented in the sciences.
