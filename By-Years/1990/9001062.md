Long plans to examine several interrelated questions in the theory of low
dimensional manifolds, braid groups and representation varieties. The specific
aims concern surgeries on knot manifolds and residual properties of their
fundamental groups. This has interactions with mapping class and braid groups,
where the techniques to be used include the Thurston theory of mapping class
groups. Low dimensional geometric objects (manifolds) are a natural subject for
investigation by inhabitants of a 3-dimensional space.
