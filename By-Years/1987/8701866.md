This research will study sequential decision problems called the bandit
problems. At each stage of a sequence of trials the experimenter has a choice of
actions. The outcomes of the choices have a certain amount of randomness. The
experimenter has two conflicting aims; to achieve immediate success and to
acquire information useful for making future choices of actions. The research
will focus on experimental strategies that are good even when there is little
initial information concerning the merits of the various actions. This research
will also study probabilistic combinatorics. It will consider counting the
number of specific objects in some collection when the objects are chosen at
random on an equiprobable basis. For example, a ramdom listing of n numbers may
be chosen and the number of times a larger number immediately precedes a smaller
number may be studied. Behavior of such probability distributions for large
number of objects will be studied for a variety of combinatorial settings.
