Bloch 9423007 This award continues support of work on the structure of the Chow
group of algebraic cycles and related questions in arithmetic and in the theory
of motives. The recently constructed spectral sequence from higher Chow groups
to algebraic K-theory will be an important tool in developing an integral theory
of motives and their extensions. In turn, such an integral theory will provide
insight into the arithmetic, and most particularly some geometric understanding
of the Bloch-Kato conjecture concerning special values of L-functions, of
motives. The principal investigator will also study Arakelov theory for
varieties over non-archimedean fields. This should clarify the relation between
motives and L-functions when local factors of the L-function have zeroes at the
origin. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest
parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in
the past quarter-century. In its origins, it treated figures that could be
defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays,
the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and
topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in
theoretical computer science and robotics.
