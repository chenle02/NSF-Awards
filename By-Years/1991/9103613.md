This project will investigate global properties of solutions to nonlinear
hyperbolic equations arising in Mathematical Physics. In particular the PIs will
consider nonlinear gravitational waves at large distances, formation of black
holes, relation between gravitation and matter, stability of Minkowski space-
time, and nonlinear Schrodinger equations in the critical case. The problems to
be studied arise directly in Classical Field Theory, Continuum Mechanics, and
General Relativity; their solutions will directly impact our basic understanding
of matter and the universe.
