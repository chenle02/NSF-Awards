Photoperiod, defined as the cyclical change of sunlight, is one of the most
reliable external signals that individuals can perceive to predict environmental
changes. Bumble bees maintain a tight association of their life cycle (e.g.,
colony growth and development; behavior) with seasonal changes in light. The
main hypothesis of this project is that photoperiod is a cue that a bumble bee
colony uses to shift through consecutive steps during its life cycle. This
hypothesis will be evaluated from three different perspectives using the North
American native bumble bee Bombus impatiens. First, this study will determine
the effects of photoperiod on colony development through manipulations of the
Light/Dark cycle. Second, the effect of photoperiod on individual behavior will
be quantified using video recording analysis. Third, the study will characterize
differences in the molecular components of the circadian clock using gene
expression and clock protein localization in the bumble bee brain. It is
expected that treatments with increasing day length will produce larger colonies
and a synchronized production of new males and queens. At the molecular level is
it predicted that changes in photoperiod will correlate with changes in clock
gene expression profiles and will affect the localization of clock proteins in
the brain. This project will integrate behavioral research and molecular
analysis to yield a basic but complete overview of the effects of photoperiod on
the social organization and life cycle of B. impatiens. Bumblebees are important
pollinators of crops and other plants. In recent decades there has been a
worldwide reduction in the populations of bumble bees, and of pollinators in
general. Few studies have addressed how photoperiod can affect pollinators and
their movements into new environments due to climate change. The investigator is
actively involved in outreach activities and this project will involve training
of a graduate student, mentorship of undergraduates and public seminars.
