A Computational Physics Laboratory has been equipped with ten microcomputers
networked to a server with a variety of software for use by all physics majors
at Ohio University. The laboratory is a crucial part of our plan to integrate
the computer into the undergraduate physics curriculum at all levels. The goal
is to use computers (their power, flexibility, and graphics) as a tool to aid in
conceptualizing physics. The conceptual insight provided by computer simulations
and exercises stimulates the imagination of our physics majors, leading to
improved retention and better prepared graduates. We are using existing software
whenever possible, and are serving as a testing site for the (NSF funded) CUPS
program of software development for upper-level physics courses. Software based
on a common set of utilities provided by CUPS and MUPPET is also being
developed. We believe the correlated introduction of computers into physics
courses will have a profound effect on the quality of physics graduates and
future physics curricula.
