This is an award to provide support for purchase of engineering research
equipment to permit determination of organic carbon concentrations in samples of
aquifer solids, sediments, soil, microbial biomass, groundwater and suspended
water droplets in the atmosphere. The equipment to be purchased with this
support consists of a Dohrmann High Temperature Total Organic Carbon Analyzer
and accessories consisting of a Boat Sampler, an Autosampler, and a Hewlett
Packard Thinkjet Printer. The proposal leading to this award was submitted in
response to the Program Announcement and Guidelines NSF 90-146, Research
Equipment Grant Program. The equipment is expected to enhance the investigator's
ability to conduct research on soil-water partitioning, of significance in
groundwater contamination and engineering approaches to dealing with this
environmental problem. The equipment will also provide significant support for
other research projects being conducted by the co- investigators.
