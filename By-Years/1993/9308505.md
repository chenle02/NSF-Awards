9308505 Firebaugh This is a project to determine whether rising income in poor
countries has contributed to improved welfare for the ordinary population in
those countries. The research will assemble data on indicators of social
development (e.g., caloric consumption, infant survival, life expectancy) for a
sample of 60 poor countires over the last quarter century and test the welfare
consequences of both income growth and economic dependency. The research also
proposes changes in the way in which cross-national research on such questions
is typically conducted. This project will contribute to a growing effort to find
ways to measure the social consequences of economic growth and of economic
dependence on other countries. Previous efforts to study not simply economic
development but also social development have been hampered by the absence of
suitable data and faulty models. If this research is successful it will provide
a much firmer basis than past studies for understanding the impact on human
lives of the economic changes that are sweeping the world. ***
