This project will provide for data processing services and technical support
for statistical information obtained by the National Science Foundation (NSF)
from surveys of Federal Funds for Research and Development and the Federal
Support to Universi- ties, Colleges, and Selected Nonprofit Institutions. The
contract also contains an option for processing the Federal Scientists and
Engineers data obtained from the Office of Personnel Management. The contractor
will be responsible for creating and mailing the survey instruments; processing
and editing the data; and generating final data tabulations in the form of
camera-ready detailed statistical tables and 5 1/4 inch diskettes. The
contractor shall also provide additional technic- al support and respond to ad
hoc requests, as required by NSF. NSF exists under legislative and executive
mandate that require, among other things, the development of research and
development (R&D) funding and personnel data bases required to study the impact
of R&D, to evaluate the status and needs of the various activities, and to aid
Federal agencies in improving the methods of reporting R&D data. The
availability of timely statistics is dependent upon an effective data processing
system. Both Federal and non-Federal sectors use the data collected by this
program to address key questions on Federal R&D funding and personnel levels and
activities.
