Quantifying carbon stored in the wetlands of Finnish Lapland and the
hydroclimate patterns that control these carbon stocks will help to understand
the role of the Arctic in future global climate changes. This IRES project will
partner with the University of Oulu and Pallas Field Station to train U.S.
students in field-based geoscience methods to determine how shifting climate
patterns influence polar wetlands and their fate in the carbon cycle. This
project will use cutting edge field, laboratory, and modeling-based methods to
better understand rapidly changing environmental conditions in high northern
latitudes and to train the next generation of scientists on issues especially
relevant to Arctic stakeholders. Four students from Alaska (including Alaska
Natives and those from 2-year colleges) will be recruited each year and travel
to Finland to learn about science and experience the rapidly changing Arctic
beyond what is seen in Alaska (USA). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peatlands are
wetlands that accumulate and store carbon-rich organic matter. The fate of this
carbon under a warming climate, which is changing hydrological patterns, has
important consequences for global climate feedbacks. High northern latitude
peatlands store large stocks of carbon, possibly equivalent to around 25% (600
Gt) of the global soil carbon and likely twice that of Earthâ€™s forests. However,
current estimates of peatland carbon stocks vary by over 100% (~500-1,000GtC),
as estimates are largely based on methods used to assess carbon changes through
time, not space. These data likely do not reflect the actual volume of carbon in
a peatland due to differences in topography and peat composition. To address
this, we will investigate hydroclimate patterns and estimate peatland carbon
stocks across basins with a combination of ground penetrating radar (GPR),
sediment cores, and water isotope-based climate models. Through this approach,
we will test the following research questions: 1) How much carbon is stored in
the Pallas area peatlands? 2) What is the spatial and temporal variability of
various source water contributions to peatlands? 3) How do different water
residence times impact changes in peatland ecohydrology? 4) How does variable
shallow-surface hydrology impact the flux of carbon (CO2 or CH4) from these
systems? and 5) Does hydrology control peatland depth?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
