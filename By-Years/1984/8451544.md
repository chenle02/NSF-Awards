Vector quantization systems that adaptively design codebooks during operation
will be studied. A codebook is a set of stored prototype vectors. The idea to be
explored is that the prototype vectors arrange themselves in some configuration
that is optimal for the statistics of the input. It is expected that this
research will demonstrate the applicability of adaptive vector quantization to
speech and image processing as well as contribute to the general theory of
adaptive systems.
