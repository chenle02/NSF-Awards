The proposal focuses on infinite dimensional algebras and infinite residually
finite groups and their interactions. We plan to study the recently discovered
families of Lie algebras of infinite differential operators over fields of
positive characteristics which are both nil and of polynomial growth. We intend
to continue our work on asymptotic properties of Golod-Shafarevich groups and
the Lubotzky-Sarnak conjecture. These groups naturally arise in 3-dimensional
topology and number theory. This work is also related to the Wigderson's problem
of expanding subspaces in the theoretical computer science. We will further
develop the connections between the Specht Problem and linear representations of
Golod-Shafarevich groups.

We hope that the results of the work on the proposal will lead to solutions of
several long standing problems and will have implications for Theoretical
Computer Science (fast expanding systems).
