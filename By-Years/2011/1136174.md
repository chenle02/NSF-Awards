Cyber-physical systems regulating critical infrastructures, such as electrical
grids and water networks, are increasingly geographically distributed,
necessitating communication between remote sensors, actuators and controllers.
The combination of networked computational and physical subsystems leads to new
security vulnerabilities that adversaries can exploit with devastating
consequences. A synchronized attack on the interdependent network components and
physical plants can create complex and new security vulnerabilities that cannot
be addressed by securing the constituent systems
individually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project takes a holistic view by
utilizing the properties of physical systems to design new secure protocols and
architectures for cyber-physical systems (CPS) through a unified conceptual
framework, which uses models for the physical system and the
communication/computation network to define precise attack models and
vulnerabilities. These mathematical models are used to design algorithms and
protocols with provable operational security guarantees, thus enabling the
design of more trustworthy architectures and components. The algorithms,
protocols, and architectures are validated on CPS testbeds targeting building,
automobile, and smart-grid applications. Additionally, the research is being
integrated into the curriculum via the creation of novel coursework combining
the underlying control, information theory, cryptography, and embedded system
concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By improving the protection of critical cyber-
physical infrastructure against emerging threats, this research is expected to
provide direct socio-economic benefits, ranging from individual organizations to
a national scale. The inter-disciplinary team of this project will integrate
teaching and curriculum development with the research, contributing to the
training of a new generation of engineers well versed in the design of
trustworthy cyber-physical systems.
