Insufficient energy research and the shortage of people pursuing advanced STEM
degrees are topics of high importance to the nation. This renewal REU Site
program is a collaborative effort between Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) and
Stephen F. Austin State University (SFASU) that will engage diverse and talented
cohorts of undergraduates, from institutions with limited or no research
opportunities in hands-on research projects , with faculty and graduate student
mentors, related to energy and propulsion. This REU site will impact society in
two major ways: 1) through the involvement of undergraduate students in
scientific research, encouraging them to pursue advanced degrees in science and
engineering; and 2) the energy-related research will potentially benefit
thousands of people through alternative sources and improved, less-polluting
combustion devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site will also include a
10-week summer program as well as an academic year program. Specific research
topics include alternative fuels combustion, materials for energy conversion,
novel laser diagnostic development, reaction kinetics of crude oils, high-
efficiency low temperature combustion engines and Li-ion batteries among others.
In addition to the scientific research that will be performed, the students will
participate in a GRE Workshop, research and ethics seminars, and oral and poster
presentations of their projects. The discoveries made during these
collaborations will be communicated to the broader scientific community via
publications and presentations.
