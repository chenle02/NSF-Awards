The PI is proposing to utilize his twelve years of experience in fiber optics
laboratory education to perform two tasks: 1) develop a set of two laboratory
manuals. These manuals will be designed to fulfill the needs of educators to
teach fiber optics technology at the introductory or intermediate levels. 2)
expand our base knowledge of future needs in the technical skills standard in
photonics. This will enable us to include in our laboratory manuals experiments
with brief tutorials reflective of present and future expectation of technical
college graduates in programs such as fiber optics and telecommunications. The
first laboratory manual will assume no previous experience in fiber optics. The
intermediate manual will present some topics in photonics including optical
switching, optical amplifiers and current technology in fiber optics. The PI has
lined up for this task a distinguished panel of experts in this field from
industry and academia. These experts will serve as technical consultants and
will be monitored by other distinguished panel of experts from industry serving
as an advisory board. The first draft of these manuals will be reviewed by
selected professionals in academia in schools across the courtly. A final
version will be compiled and made available to all for the asking.
