Nuclear beta decay was important in motivating the Standard Model,
and&lt;br/&gt;it continues to be of importance in searches for physics beyond
the&lt;br/&gt;Standard Model. The simplest system for studying beta decay is
the&lt;br/&gt;neutron, where there is a long history of increasingly
accurate&lt;br/&gt;measurements of the parameters that characterize the decay.
By&lt;br/&gt;measuring the neutron's lifetime (from the Ft value) and the
neutron's&lt;br/&gt;beta asymmetry A, one has enough information to
independently determine&lt;br/&gt;the weak vector and axial-vector couplings, GV
and GA. Although recent&lt;br/&gt;accurate measurements of the neutron lifetime
are in good agreement&lt;br/&gt;with each other, the same cannot be said for
measurements of the&lt;br/&gt;neutron's beta asymmetry A. Since 1985, there have
been four accurate&lt;br/&gt;(combined statistical and systematic uncertainty of
about 1% each)&lt;br/&gt;measurements of A. Unfortunately, the agreement between
these four A&lt;br/&gt;measurements is poor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An approved
Los Alamos experiment will again measure the A coefficient,&lt;br/&gt;this time
utilizing Ultra-Cold Neutrons, dramatically reducing&lt;br/&gt;systematic errors
otherwise present due to beam-induced backgrounds and&lt;br/&gt;incomplete
polarization. The key features are 1) the ability to port&lt;br/&gt;the neutrons
to a significant distance away from their production site&lt;br/&gt;(using total
external reflection), 2) vetoing events when the beam&lt;br/&gt;pulse is on
target (capitalizing on the pulsed production method), and&lt;br/&gt;3) obtain
100% polarization using an axial magnetic field (where&lt;br/&gt;neutrons of the
wrong spin do not have enough kinetic energy to&lt;br/&gt;overcome the mu.B
potential).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our group at Virginia Tech has responsibility
for UCN transport for the&lt;br/&gt;Los Alamos experiment, the fast DAQ, and
experimental coordination.&lt;br/&gt;The critical component of this system
addressed by this proposal is the&lt;br/&gt;coating for transporting polarized
neutrons. We have shown&lt;br/&gt;pulsed-laser-deposition of diamond films is
suitable. At Virginia&lt;br/&gt;Tech, an existing excimer laser has been re-
commissioned to produce&lt;br/&gt;suitable films. A system for coating both the
guide tubes and central&lt;br/&gt;decay tube of the spectrometer has been
developed. The successful&lt;br/&gt;campaign to make suitably coated guides for
polarized UCNs has an&lt;br/&gt;impact, not just to this experiment, but to
planned future experiments&lt;br/&gt;as well.&lt;br/&gt;
