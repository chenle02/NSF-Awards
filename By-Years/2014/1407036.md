The Adler Planetarium, Johns Hopkins University, and Southern Illinois
University-Edwardsville are investigating the potential of online citizen
science projects to broaden the pool of volunteers who participate in analysis
and investigation of digital data and to deepen volunteers' engagement in
scientific inquiry. The Investigating Audience Engagement with Citizen Science
project is administering surveys and conducting case studies to identify factors
that lead volunteers to engage in the astronomy-focused Galaxy Zoo project and
its Zooniverse extensions. The project is (1) identifying volunteers'
motivations for joining and staying involved, (2) determining factors that
influence volunteers' movement from lower to higher levels of involvement, and
(3) designing features that influence volunteer involvement. The project's
research findings will help informal science educators and scientists refine
existing citizen science programs and develop new ones that maximize volunteer
engagement, improve the user experience, and build a more scientifically
literate public.
