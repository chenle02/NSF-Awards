A continuation and expansion of the successful research carried on by the
principal investigators is proposed. In particular, we propose to model some
classes of connectionist networks within the paradigm of inductive inference.
This will enable a precise characterization of the ultimate learning potential
of connectionist networks, compared to other techniques for machine learning,
i.e. learning by example and its derivatives. This award includes additional
support to supply infrastructure for the Latvian collaborators, in the form of
workstations.
