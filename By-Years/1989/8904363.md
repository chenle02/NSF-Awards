The vacuolar H+ -ATPase is ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells and plays a central
role in vacuolar solute accumulation in plants. Like FoF1-ATPases it is
insensitive to vanadate and does not have a phosphoenzyme catalytic
intermediate. We and other laboratories have shown that the vacuolar H+-ATPase
is a large, multimeric enzyme, 400-500 kDA, containing three major subunits an
up to five minor ones. The primary structures of the 70 kDa, 60 kDa, and 16 kDa
subunits are now known. The 70 and 60 kDa kDa subunits contain numerous highly
conserved regions thought to be involved in catalysis and regulation in the F1
beta and alpha subunits, respectively. The PI wishes to characterize the
functional domains of the 70 and 60 kDa subunits directly using a combination of
chemical probes and site-directed mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis studies
will be carried out both in E. coli and in carrot. He has already obtained
overexpression of the 70 kDa subunit in E. coli. He plans to generate vacuolar
H+-ATPase null mutants in carrot by transforming with antisense DNA to the
5'-untranslated region of 70 kDa cDNA. Site-directed mutagenesis will be carried
out by retransforming the null mutants. Phylogenetic comparisons will determine
whether or not the vacuolar H+ATPase is related to other archaebacterial
H+-ATPases besides that of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, its closest relative.
Finally, electron microscope studies aimed at characterizing the surface
features and quaternary structure of the V-ATPase are described.
