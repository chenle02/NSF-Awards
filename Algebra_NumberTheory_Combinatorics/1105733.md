A workshop "Noncongruence modular forms and Galois representations", organized
by Winnie Li and Ramin Takloo-Bighash, will take place April 29-May 1, 2011 at
the University of Illinois at Chicago. The focus will be on the interplay and
connections between non-congruence modular forms, p-adic Hodge theory, Galois
representations, and automorphic forms on higher dimensional reductive groups.
There will be six invited speakers all from American institutions: Matthew
Emerton (Northwestern), Toby Gee (Harvard and Northwestern), Kiran Kedlaya (MIT
and UC San Diego), Wen-ching Winnie Li (Penn State), Tong Liu (Purdue), and Ling
Long (Iowa State University). The lectures by invited speakers will happen on
April 29 and 30, and May 1 is reserved for talks by participating recent PhDs
and graduate students. This is part of the annual Oliver Atkin Memorial Lecture
and Workshop at UIC. Modular forms and their associated Galois representations
are of ubiquitous importance in modern Number theory. These objects, for
example, played a prominent role in Andrew Wiles? proof of Fermat?s Last
Theorem. Modular forms come in two basic flavors: the ones associated with a
congruence group, and those associated with noncongruence groups; the theory of
congruence modular forms is far better understood. This workshop concentrates on
the more mysterious and less understood noncongruence modular forms. Even though
all modular forms, congruence or not, are expected to encode deep arithmetic
information, this information is not easily accessible in the case of
noncongruence modular forms. Recent progress in the arithmetic theory of Galois
representations, however, has made it possible to understand noncongruence
modular forms in ways that was previously impossible.
