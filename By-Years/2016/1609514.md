This project is funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program of
the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation. Professor Hanbin
Mao of Kent State University is developing new biosensing strategies that have
high sensitivity to detect multiple chemical or biological targets
simultaneously. Broader impacts are addressed through the development of
integrated research-education projects to train high-school and college
students. Many parts of research plans are modularly designed in to accommodate
the tight schedules of high school and college students. This facilitates the
participation of these students into the STEM fields.

This project employs individual macromolecules, such as DNA, as platforms for
analyte sensing. Upon the binding of an analyte, the macromolecule changes its
conformation, which is accompanied by a variation in mechanical properties, such
as tension, due to the mechanochemical coupling. Using laser tweezers, the
change in the mechanical property is monitored in real time, accomplishing the
sensing without extra infrastructure used in a separate signal transduction
unit. Since single-molecule templates are used, detection of individual
molecules is the result. This represents the utmost sensitivity for biosensing.
Compared to other single-molecule detection schemes such as fluorescence, the
force signal employed in a mechanochemical sensor suffers little from
environmental noise. In addition, the measurement of force does not require
direct light excitation, which avoids photo-damage to the sensing template. All
these facts render strong reliability and high sensitivity for this new sensing
strategy.
