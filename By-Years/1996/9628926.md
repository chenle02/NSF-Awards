9628926 Dorsey This research will focus on the theory of vortex dynamics in
superconductors, an area of great scientific and technological relevance. The
first part of the grant involves projects aimed at understanding vortex dynamics
in thin films. In particular, it has recently been observed that when a thin
superconducting film is placed in a sufficiently strong magnetic field, the
field enters in the form of "magnetic dendrites." To understand this phenomenon
we will study the propagation and dynamic stability of interfaces between a
vortex liquid and the Meissner phase, in both the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau
theory and a hydrodynamic theory of superconducting vortices. The second part of
the grant is a study of the effect of order parameter symmetry on vortex
dynamics in the mixed state; this work is motivated by the possibility that the
order parameter in some of the high temperature superconductors may have a
d-wave character. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theories for d-wave
superconductors will be developed and used to study the longitudinal and Hall
conductivities, as well as the Nernst effect, in the mixed state. Since there
are some features of the transport properties which are beyond this description,
we will develop quasiclassical Green's function techniques for d-wave
superconductors. These methods will be used to calculate the Hall effect and the
Nernst effect in the mixed state, two quantities which have displayed anomalous
properties in the high temperature superconductors and which have eluded a
consistent theoretical description. %%% Theoretical research will be conducted
on a variety of problems related to the motion of magnetic vortices which form
in the high temperature superconductors. These vortices and their response to
magnetic fields are important in technological applications of superconductors.
They are also of great fundamental interest. ***
