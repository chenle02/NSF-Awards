9422696 Belyschko Health monitoring and assessment of steel bridges and other
steel facilities offers tremendous potential benefits if used to asses the
safety and reliability and to extend the remaining useful life by timely
repairs. This project involves the development of high performance computing
tools for identifying flaws in critical bridge components form the output of
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) sensing devices and assessing the impact of
these flaws on the useful life of the component. High performance computing
tools will be developed to provide a characterization of flaws from the output
of NDE sensors and asses the reliability of the component. The proposed research
addresses this objective in an integrated approach which will involve the
following tasks: 1. adapting ultrasonic QNDE methods to in situ health
monitoring of bridges; 2. the solution of the inverse problem of identifying and
characterizing the crack, which will be accomplished with the aid of neural
networks; 3. development of high fidelity forward solutions of the wave equation
for detailed models with one or more cracks, which are needed for the
identification process; because of the large size of these problems, parallel
computations will be used; 4. estimating the reliability of a component in terms
of the crack which is identified. Testing of the overall model will take place
on test prototypes and on actual bridges. Working groups form various states and
several interested companies will be set up to facilitate dissemination of the
research results to practice.
