This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Role of plant phenolics in the
rhizosphere degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls and polyaromatic
hydrocarbons ." The role of plant root flavonoids as substrates for bacteria and
fungi that degrade polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polyaromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the rhizosphere microbial community is being examined
using an RNA-based, stable isotope probing method. Microarrays are also being
employed to investigate degradative gene induction in a PCB-degrading bacterium
during growth on flavonoids and other plant phenolic compounds.
