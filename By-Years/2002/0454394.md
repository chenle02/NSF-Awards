RFID Ecosystem&lt;br/&gt;Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research
Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will explore
applications for RFID tags in homes and workplaces rather than previously
studied applications for product supply-chains. Applications relevant to the
workplace and home will be explored that will integrate RFID capabilities with
other ubiquitous computing technologies. Systems issues to be explored include:
innovative RFID tags with additional sensing, middleware and operating-system
support for sensing/actuation events, database organization based on distributed
data on servers and tags, mining of sensing/actuation events to infer users
activities, and ubiquitous computing applications for the workplace. These
technologies have deep privacy, legal, social, and policy implications. The
project will incorporate researchers in both technology and social aspects of
technology. Broader impacts of this project include potential applications, and
use in education and design projects at the University of Washington.&lt;br/&gt;
