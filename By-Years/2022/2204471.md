Dr. Allison Karp has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry
out research and education plans at Yale University and Brown University. Large-
bodied mammalian herbivores are under threat, but it is unclear how these
currently shifting communities may affect vegetation, fire and nutrient cycles.
While these dynamics can be tested by examining how herbivores impacted
ecosystem functions in the past, the tools available to reconstruct herbivore
community changes alongside other environmental variables are limited. This
research will fundamentally improve geochemical tools to analyze past herbivore
dynamics by investigating herbivore biomarkers using samples from a National
Park in South Africa with diverse wild herbivores. Dr. Karp will also develop
educational and outreach materials for two parts of Yaleâ€™s Pathways to Science,
which provides free scientific programing to middle and high-schoolers in New
Haven as well as the greater public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will
improve reconstructions of past herbivore dynamics from sediment cores with a
comprehensive study to constrain if information about herbivore densities and
community characteristics can be derived from fecal biomarkers produced from
wild herbivore communities. To this end, Dr. Karp will conduct an integrated
multi-scale calibration project in Kruger National Park (South Africa). The
focus on African savannas, one of the few systems with a community of diverse
megaherbivores, optimizes these calibrations to address questions related to
shifts in extinct Quaternary herbivore communities. This research will: 1) test
whether variation in fecal biomarker concentrations and distributions in dung is
related to variation in herbivore functional groups, 2) examine fecal biomarker
concentrations and microbial degradation in soils from decade-long herbivore
exclusion experiment plots, and 3) calibrate sedimentary fecal biomarker
characteristics to variation in the abundance and diversity of historical
herbivore communities through time. This project combines the perspectives of
modern and paleo-ecologists to produce paleoenvironmental insights grounded in
modern settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
