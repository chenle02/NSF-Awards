This award supports a College Faculty Research Opportunity Award (ROA). The
principal investigator, Dr. Nora Sabelli, senior research scientist at the
National center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) will be working with
Prof. Linda McDonald, Asst. Prof. Physics Dept., North Park College. Prof.
McDonald is completing her Ph.D thesis research at NCSA on the calculation of
potential energy curves for negative ion resonances using bound- state methods.
This collaboration with Dr. Sabelli and the use of the CRAY 2 supercomputer at
NCSA will allow Prof. McDonald to generate the basic sets, molecular orbitals
and configuration lists necessary to her research.
