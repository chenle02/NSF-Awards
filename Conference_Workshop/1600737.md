The 2016 "Houston Summer School on Dynamical Systems" will take place May 17-26,
2016 at the University of Houston. This event will introduce graduate students
to recent progress and novel techniques in probabilistic dynamics and ergodic
theory, as well as giving a bird's-eye view of fundamental areas of dynamics.
The school will also cover applications to other areas where these ideas are
useful, such as mathematical neuroscience, statistical mechanics, and
information theory.

The core of the school will consist of four lecture series covering topics in
uniform hyperbolicity; partial hyperbolicity; parabolic dynamics and
renormalization; and decay of correlations via spectral gap, coupling, and
cones. These lectures will be given by internationally recognized researchers in
dynamical systems: Boris Hasselblatt (Tufts University); Keith Burns
(Northwestern University); Jayadev Athreya (Washington); Vaughn Climenhaga
(Houston); Matt Nicol (Houston); Will Ott (Houston); Andrew Torok (Houston). The
school will also include: further lectures on advanced topics and applications;
informal review sessions; problem sessions; and project sessions, with
particular emphasis on maximizing interactions between students and lecturers.
