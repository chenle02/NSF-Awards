"Black Sun" is a full-length documentary film focusing on the life and research
of two African American solar astrophysicists: Dr. Hakeem Oluseyi of the Florida
Institute of Technology and Dr. Alphonse Sterling of the NASA Marshall Space
Flight Center. Black Sun depicts underrepresented minority scientists in ways
that challenge common preconceptions, and will inspire young people
(particularly minorities) to consider STEM fields as a viable and exciting
career option. In particular, the film shows the lives of the scientists, the
scientists taking scientific observations and doing analysis, and discussing
their results. Black Sun is centered on the two solar eclipses this year (2012):
The May 20 annular eclipse and the November 13-14 total eclipse. This NSF RAPID
grant funds the filming of the total solar eclipse in Cairns, Australia, where
Drs. Sterling and Oluseyi and their team of students will conduct measurements
focused on studying the extended solar atmospheric plasma.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary broader impacts goal is to increase minority
participation in STEM fields. Black Sun will be "advancing discovery and
understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning," by showing both
the science and the personal aspects of minority astrophysicists. Dissemination
will be done via screenings in academic settings (particularly minority-serving
institutes), entry into film festivals, and promotion to science TV programs. We
have already partnered with several HBCUs to screen "Black Sun".
