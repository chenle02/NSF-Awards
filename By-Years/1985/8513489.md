The Guerrero array consists of 29 strong motion accelerographs in Guerrero and
neighboring states, Mexico. Useful records of the ground motion were obtained
for the September 19 earthquake that devastated part of Mexico City. The array
is located in a mature seismic gap, and within the next few years it is likely
that records will be obtained from additional earthquakes with a magnitude near
8. The objective of this program is to continue array operations; catalog and
distribute widely any data obtained; begin interpretation of accelerograms
obtained; and use the best available methods to try to predict, in advance, the
nature of the strong motion from the anticipated large earthquakes.
