Abstract for DMS - 0104363

The investigators' research focuses on establishing sharp geometric inequalities
that are invariant under linear or affine transformations and using them to
obtain new analytic inequalities. Since an affine structure contains no notion
of distance or angle, one might think that there is little to say or do. In
fact, there is a rich and deep theory that already encompasses many of the most
important aspects of Euclidean geometry, including the sharp isoperimetric and
Sobolev inequalities. Most of the investigators' efforts will be devoted to
developing and understanding the Brunn-Minkowski theory and its generalizations.

The investigators' work involves some of the most fundamental objects in
mathematics: bodies in and functions of ordinary Euclidean space. These are used
to represent real objects and phenomena in science and engineering. Although it
is impossible to predict the future impact of this work, the investigators
believe that the concepts and techniques developed in this project could prove
to be useful in fields ranging from pure mathematical areas such as differential
geometry, partial differential equations, and Banach spaces to more applied
areas such as robot vision, information theory, and stereology.
