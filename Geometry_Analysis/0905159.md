Anderson and LeBrun plan to study a cluster of related geometric structures on
low-dimensional manifolds. Their research program focuses on the discovery and
development of fundamental connections between Riemannian geometry, differential
topology, and issues in theoretical physics. Anderson will investigate problems
concerning conformally compact Einstein metrics and the AdS/CFT correspondence,
the structure of Einstein metrics on bounded domains and mathematical aspects of
general relativity. Meanwhile, LeBrun will study the existence and moduli of
canonical metrics on 4-manifolds, with an emphasis on extremal Kahler metrics,
Seiberg-Witten theory, and the twistor geometry of holomorphic disks. This
research program aims both to explore fundamental issues in the mathematical
field of differential geometry, and simultaneously to discover new links between
mathematics and theoretical physics. Much of the planned research activity takes
its inspiration from current attempts to bridge the gulf separating Einstein's
theory of gravitation from the quantum field theories that describe the forces
of nature on a microscopic scale. Some of the research concerns the problem of
describing all possible geometries of 4-dimensional universes governed by
Einstein's gravitational field equations. Other aspects of the research program
are intimately linked to recent developments in string theory. By also training
a group of graduate students to pursue research in this area, the project will
additionally help foster interactions between mathematics and physics on an
immediate, human scale, through its long-term educational impact.
