Exposure to modern instrumentation and techniques are essential to the
development of today's physics major and tomorrow's physicist. The Physics
Department will introduce new, microcomputer-interactive experiments in laser
spectroscopy and atomic collision phenomena into the laboratory program.
Development of the proposed experiments will involve advanced students in
independent study and senior thesis projects. Ultimately the apparatus will be
used in the sophomore level Laboratory Physics course, which is required of all
physics majors.
