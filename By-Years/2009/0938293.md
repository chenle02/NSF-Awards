The main objective is to study the structure of the stably stratified boundary
layer based on results of field measurements and numerical simulations. For this
purpose, observations obtained during two recent atmospheric boundary layer
experiments will be analyzed. Turbulence data collected during these projects on
instrumented towers and by the Tethered Lifting System (TLS) will be examined.
Two numerical models: (i) a one-dimensional stochastic model, developed by Dr.
A. Kerstein, and (ii) the three-dimensional large-eddy simulation (LES) model,
developed by the principal investigator, will also be used. The first model will
be used to simulate the observed temporal transformation in the nocturnal
boundary layer during these projects. The LES model will be employed to evaluate
gradient-based similarity functions.

The specific aim of the proposed program is to systematically improve
understanding, description, and parameterization of the stably stratified
boundary layer. Investigations will be conducted of transitions from strong to
weak stable turbulence. Asymptotic laws for turbulent statistics in these
conditions will be defined. The classic similarity approach will be improved by
developing and testing new scaling systems and techniques, which will reduce
negative effects of diminishing scales and self-correlation.

The intellectual merit of the project is improved understanding of processes and
regimes in the nocturnal boundary layer, which currently are insufficiently
understood and are not well-represented in current numerical models of the
atmosphere.

The broader impact of the project is application of this improved conceptual
understanding of turbulence and diffusion in the stable boundary layer to
important problems. Results will be disseminated through publications and
presentations at scientific conferences. These results will be used to develop
boundary layer parameterizations, which are essential in numerical weather
predictions, climate simulations, and air pollution studies. The developed
methods could also be applied in studies of tropospheric turbulence
