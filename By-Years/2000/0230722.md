This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program of the
Office of Polar Programs, supports the development of a standardized diatom
biozonation for Antarctic marine near-shore environments. The project entails
diatom biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental analyses of recovered near-shore
sediment sequences from the margins of the Antarctic continent. At the heart of
the work is diatom taxonomic investigation using will be sequences recovered
from McMurdo Sound as part of the Cape Roberts Project (CRP), supplemented by
other relevant drill core material.&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Objectives and
Intellectual Merit of the Proposal Include:&lt;br/&gt;1. Taxonomic analysis and
refinement of Antarctic near-shore Cenozoic marine diatoms,&lt;br/&gt;2.
Biostratigraphic determination and application of these diatoms,&lt;br/&gt;3.
Establishment and publication of an integrated Antarctic near-shore diatom
biostratigraphic zonation, providing a framework for future Antarctic
continental shelf sampling (e.g., ANDRILL),&lt;br/&gt;4. Evaluation of the mode
and tempo of evolution of polar diatom lineages, and&lt;br/&gt;5. Evaluation of
the evolution of Antarctic paleoenvironments, especially the origin of
persistent sea ice and analysis of sea-ice fluctuations through
time.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact of the Project:&lt;br/&gt;This work will train a
graduate student in diatom biostratigraphy and paleoenvironmental studies. The
work will improve our understanding of Cenozoic climatic development of
Antarctica, and contribute valuable insights into glacial fluctuations and sea
ice history, which are important elements for climate model development. It will
support the infrastructure of scientific knowledge by providing a
biostratigraphic zonation directly applicable to future Antarctic drilling. As
such, this work will greatly improve and streamline initial core
characterization, thus increase the immediate scientific impact of ANDRILL and
other proposed future drilling efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
