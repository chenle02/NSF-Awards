This project adds insight, design techniques, and analysis tools to the area of
massively parallel VLSI computation for special-purpose search processor.
Analyses for the speedups offered by associative memories are carried through
appropriate modeling of the delays associated with instruction and data
broadcasting and the realization of global reduction operations on response
tags. Pipelined systolic associative memory organizations are developed so that
they are truly scalable (up to sizes required for realistic applications in the
foreseeable future) within the potentials and constraints of the VLSI technology
and to evaluate their cost- effectiveness. Tree-based, hypercube-based, and
mesh-based VLSI search processors having sublinear number of processors (with
respect to the number of keys or records) are examined and various design
alternatives, optimality issues, and realization tradeoffs are analyzed .
