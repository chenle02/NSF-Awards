The atmospheres of the terrestrial planets have evolved markedly over the past
4.5 billion years since the solar system formed out of a cloud of interstellar
dust and gas. Venus appears to have lost an ocean of water by thermal escape
from the planet, leaving behind traces of water highly enriched in Deuterium.
The influx of small comets is a source of water for Venus, EArth, and Mars, and
measurements of the present water content of the Martian atmosphere places
severe limits on the influx rate of such comets. This award is for studies of
evolution of the atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, including spectroscopic
observations of hydrogen escaping from the Earth and from cometary nuclei.
