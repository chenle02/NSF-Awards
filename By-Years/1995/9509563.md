9509563 Morris That ecologists have paid little attention to mutualisms relative
to other kinds of species interactions may reflect the attitude that mutualisms
are fragile constructs subject to invasion by "non-cooperators" that profit from
another species without providing compensating benefits. However, few studies
have explored the full range of possible benefits and detriments in mutualistic
systems, even those in which apparently non-cooperative behavior is common. The
proposed study will address the balance between benefit and detriment in the
mutualistic interaction between panicled bluebells and nectar-robbing bumble
bees. Contrary to preconceived notions, nectar-robbers, especially those that
also pay legitimate visits to flowers, may provide benefits to the plant that
equal or outweigh the negative effects they inflict while nectar-robbing. A full
exploration of the balance between positive and negative effects in the bluebell
and nectar-robber interaction requires three new approaches. First, it is
necessary to measure the impact of nectar-robbery on both the male and female
success of the plant. Second, the plant's reproductive success must be measured
at an appropriate scale. Third, it is necessary to determine if the production
of a reward that is obtained by a non-cooperative behavior is actually necessary
to assure that the plant receives a mutualistic benefit from facultative nectar-
robbers. The experiments in this study will be the first to assess the effects
of nectar-robbery on both male and female fitness measured at the scale of
entire clones. Additional experiments will manipulate the nectar-producing
flowers to elucidate the role of floral rewards in eliciting beneficial behavior
from nectar-robbing pollinators. These experiments will examine whether
mutualisms in general, and the archetypal mutualism between plants and their
pollinators in particular, contain elements of both benefit and detriment.
