With this new RUI award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
supports the work of Dr. Donald W. Slocum and Dr. Robert W. Holman in the
Department of Chemistry at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green,
Kentucky. The work involves detailed studies of directed ortho-metalation
reactions involving organolithium reagents in various hydrocarbon solvents with
added Lewis base ethers like THF and bis-chelating amines like TMEDA. The
reactions involve alkylation of aromatic substrates like anisole,
dimethylanaline, and dimethylbenzylamine, where coordination of the heteroatom
is believed to facilitate addition of the alkyl group at the ortho position. NMR
studies will be carried out using 13C and 7Li isotopes.

This award will support a growing effort in chemical research at Western
Kentucky University, and involve undergraduates in original research of interest
to chemists in both academia and industry seeking improved methods for the
synthesis of useful organic compounds. The PI has active collaborations with
area industries, and one of them is providing financial support. Many of the
students are expected to find work in local industries or go on to advanced
degrees.
