An unresolved question in animal behavior is how complexity and variation in
male signals is maintained within populations. Past attempts to identify
evolutionary forces that result in different male reproductive signals have
ignored the possibility that particular trait combinations may gain
effectiveness by the synergistic interaction of individual signal components. In
fact, these interactions may be a vital component of selection on complex male
displays. This study will focus on pheromones in a species of salamander. These
reproductive pheromones are chemical signals, created by a combination of
proteins, that a male delivers to a female during courtship. The combination of
individual pheromone components makes each male unique. Behavioral experiments
will measure the strength of female preferences for particular pheromone
combinations. Documenting these female preferences will reveal whether this
mechanism of female mate choice can account for the immense variation of male
pheromones. Additionally, mathematical models of the process by which pheromone
diversity is maintained will be constructed, and evaluated using the
experimental results.

This study will promote outreach programs at Oregon State University and at the
University of Louisville. These programs will link faculty and students
(graduate and undergraduate) with local teachers (K-12) and with students
traditionally under-represented in scientific research. The three primary goals
of this activity are to train graduate and undergraduate students in
experimental approaches and in new techniques, to put into practice new teaching
methods shown to promote learning and retention in large science courses, and to
let faculty and graduate students work with local school teachers to develop
short programs amenable to different grade levels.
