Vastly improved Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning
Systems (GPS) and low cost of Pentium processors are revolutionizing methods of
research and analysis of data that are geographically distributed. New GIS/GPS
technology and software products are ideally suited for the study of
environmental science and related disciplines, yet most two- and four-year
colleges are ill-prepared to adapt their current curriculum to use this valuable
tool. Holyoke Community College (HCC) believes that a strategic investment in
this keystone technology will have a long-term payoff in a broad range
applications in many disciplines and will result in better prepared transfer and
career graduates. This project has two major foci: 1) enhancement of the
Environmental Science curriculum through the use of GIS/GPS, including the
creation of a new major devoted solely to GIS/GPS; and 2) enrichment of teaching
and learning of science in area secondary schools through the use of HCC as a
GIS/GPS technology transfer station via collaborative relationships with Salem
State College. This project will create a 10 station Pentium GIS/GPS lab.
Classroom and laboratory learning at the college and area high schools will be
enhanced by hands-on, discovery-based learning, especially important for
nontraditional learners, particularly students for whom English is a second
language. A formative and summative evaluation process will be used over the
two-year life of the project. Modifications will be made based upon feedback
from pilot testing of new GIS/GPS classroom and lab modules and ongoing input
and evaluation from a project advisory committee comprised of local and national
experts from two- and four-year institutions and private industry. Final
products developed and experience gained will be shared with other educational
institutions through HCC's home page on Internet and published in appropriate
GIS journals.
