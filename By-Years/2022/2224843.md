Network embedding is to learn a low-dimensional representation to facilitate
network analytics applications including node classification and network
visualization. This project is to investigate a novel direction to explore how
human knowledge could enhance network embedding and how the results could be
better understood by human beings. Human knowledge represents any context
information or prior knowledge that could be correlated to the learned embedding
in this context. The successful outcome of this multidisciplinary research will
lead to advances in enabling domain experts to interactively and easily analyze
big network data with human knowledge, and thus positively impacting the overall
value of various information systems. The integrated data science education
program is to train students with crucial but highly unavailable data analytics
technologies, to attract members of underrepresented groups to careers in
engineering, and to retain members of those groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research goal of this project is to develop a human-centric framework for
modeling and incorporating human knowledge in network embedding, tackling data
challenges brought by big networks, as well as enabling interpretation and
interaction of network embedding results. This project develops a series of
network embedding models and algorithms, different from data-driven approaches,
to analyze network data from various aspects. Multi-view learning and deep
structured frameworks are investigated to integrate three types of human
knowledge from the node-, edge- and community-level into a unified framework.
Given the fact that real-world networks could contain heterogeneous, large-scale
and dynamic human knowledge, corresponding solutions are developed to handle the
problems. To facilitate human understanding of the research results, this
project develops global and local interpretation algorithms to explain network
embedding and interactive learning algorithms to integrate user
feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
