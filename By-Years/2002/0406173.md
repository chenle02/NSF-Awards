"Project Butterfly WINGS" is a three-year project targeting 4th-8th grade
participants in 13 Florida counties. This project includes the use of the 4-H
network as a partner to recruit participants. It builds on the development of
student-scientist partnerships to create an environment where information, data
and ideas can be exchanged. This project will focus on collecting data on
butterflies and the environments/habitats the butterflies choose to visit. This
project brings together several important elements to present an interactive,
authentic, research-based SSP activity supported through an established network
of ISE providers, educators and community-based organizations. Based on solid
research and knowledge about ISE approaches, the project has strong content
connections and a well-designed structure. An interactive web-site will provide
opportunities for participants to interact with each other and with
participating scientists, and to experience firsthand some of the most
interesting aspects of engaging in scientific inquiry. WINGS has the potential
to create a network of young people who will be more aware of issues related to
biodiversity and the environment. Through its model approach and participant
outcomes, "Project Butterfly WINGS" is positioned to make a difference in the
ISE field and in the lives of its participants
