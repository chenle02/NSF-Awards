Range arithmetic is a computer arithmetic more advanced than ordinary floating-
point arithmetic. It permits many numerical problems to be solved in such a way
that answers are obtained correct to a prescribed number of decimal places.
Range arithmetic is presently available as a set of code files that enable a
user to compose programs in the C++ language. This research is for continuing
the development and propagation of these files, and for investigating whether
certain problems requiring extensive computation , especially problems of
partial differential equations, can be solved precisely with range arithmetic.
Also, the possibility of providing range arithmetic in another form, more
suitable for such extensive problems, will be investigated.
