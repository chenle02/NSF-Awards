9411466 Sheaff This Americas Program award will support participation of U.S.
and Latin American physicists and students in a workshop on high energy physics,
to be held in Cusco, Peru, August 1-13, 1994. Organizers are Dr. Marleigh
Sheaff, University of Wisconsin, and Professor Juvenal Castromonte Salinas,
Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima. The program will include courses and
conferences on theoretical and experimental H.E.P., and an introduction to
selected basic experimental techniques on high energy particles detection. The
purpose of the meeting is to stimulate interest in physics in Peru and other
developing countries in Latin America, with the aim of encouraging future
international collaboration in the field. This meeting will assist young Latin
American scientists in their efforts to revive and revitalize their science
programs and build the research infrastructure. Robust science programs, and the
technological stimulation that results from them, will help to make the
developing countries in our hemisphere stronger partners in the future. ***
