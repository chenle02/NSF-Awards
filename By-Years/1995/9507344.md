9507344 Kao Viruses with genomes of (+)-stranded RNAs make up a diverse group
that include economically important pathogens of animals and plants. The
mechanism of replication of these RNA genomes is not understood well, and what
roles host proteins play are just beginning to be determined. The overall goal
of this research is to understand the mechanism by which the model (+)-strand
RNA virus, brome mosaic virus (BMV), replicates its genome. Experiments will
focus on two key areas, the identification and characterization of host factors
involved in viral RNA replication, and the interaction of viral proteins within
the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The anticipated results are important because
they will elucidate fundamental aspects of viral RNA replication, including the
role of host proteins and the interaction of viral proteins. Many, if not all,
of these mechanistic details should prove to be common among viral pathogens
with (+)-strand RNA genomes. Advances in our understanding of RNA replication
will provide the basis for the development of new strategies for the inhibition
of viral infection. %%% Viruses with genomes of (+)-stranded RNAs make up a
