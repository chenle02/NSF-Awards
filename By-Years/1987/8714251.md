This proposal requests funds to establish a center that will provide the
facilities for the simulation, analysis and display of macromolecular
structures. The equipment will provide the capability for high-resolution
simulation and display of protein and nucleic acid structures. The capability
will include the display of atoms of macromolecules and solvent molecules,
energy minimization with flexible geometry, manipulation of specific residues,
etc. with currently available software. Thus molecular biologists and chemists
will be able to display and minipulate complex molecules and simulate the
interactions. Additionally the center will mediate the interactions between
participants and facilitate the development of new software directed at solving
specific problems, many of which come under the heading of "computer-aided
protein engineering." In collaboration with A. Warshel, simulation approaches to
predicting the effects of site-directed alterations of protein structure will be
accessible for general use and refined or modified for specific applications.
Thus the center will facilitate collaboration between experimental groups and
experts in theoretical analysis as well as facilitate the development of
methodology that will have a major impact on the wider scientific community.
Support is recommended.
