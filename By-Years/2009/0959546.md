This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor Sarah L. Stoll and colleagues from the
Department of Chemistry at Georgetown University will acquire a powder X-ray
diffractometer for the characterization of materials and nanostructured
materials. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as:
1) study of lanthanide chalcogenides for use in magnetic conductors; 2) analysis
of clay minerals in soil samples; 3) coordination polymers and framework
materials; 4) template directed crystal growth; 5) shape and size controlled Pt
based bimetallic nanoparticles for fuel cell applications; 6) charge transfer
nanocrystals; and 7) self assembled fibrillar networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An
X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and
provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule
relative to neighboring molecules. A powder diffractometer allows diffraction
studies in powdered crystalline materials. The data provide information on
particle sizes, phase identification and purity analysis. The studies described
here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry and materials chemistry.
This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as
research.&lt;br/&gt;
