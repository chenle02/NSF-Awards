Some pictorial styles differ dramatically and can be distinguished without
scrutinizing the picture, for example, Pointillist vs. Renaissance; or a
photograph by a master vs. a casual snapshot. The investigators explore
pictorial style using quantitative measurements, leading to a parametric
characterization that captures coarse-grain pictorial style. The research has
several applications in computer graphics and image analysis, with broad
technological impact on society. It can be embedded in image classification and
retrieval tools. For digital photography, it can transfer the style of master
photographers to casual snapshots, leading to important quality enhancement. In
addition, it will lead to novel and intuitive image manipulation tools that act
directly on stylistic aspects. Finally, such statistical estimators might help
in the future to understand what makes images photorealistic and lead to filters
that increase realism. This research project is accompanied by an
interdisciplinary course on the "art and science of depiction," and by an inter-
disciplinary workshop on image statistics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
studies marginal and joint statistics of oriented multiscale decompositions such
as steerable pyramids. The investigators develop a new recursive pyramidal
decomposition that captures the spatial variations of "texturedness" over an
image. They also explore the statistics of edge features, and they devise new
non-linear edge-preserving decompositions to prevent haloing artifacts at strong
edges during style transfer. Finally, the research explores a new approach to
color style characterization based on the notion of naming color category. The
purity of a color is defined as its distance to a color prototype such as pure
blue, and statistics of this purity are leveraged to assess and enhance color
vividness. Success of the style characterization is evaluated by classification
tasks (supervised learning) and by style transfer: the relevant statistics of a
source image or set of images are enforced in a destination image. The visual
modification of the destination image permits the assessment of which stylistic
aspects are captured by the statistics, independently of content. The research
builds on the synergy between visual perception, image analysis and computer
graphics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
