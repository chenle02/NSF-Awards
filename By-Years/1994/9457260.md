9457260 Roberts This is an award to support research through a National Science
Foundation Young Investigator Award to be performed by the Principal
Investigator who was nominated and selected through procedures contained in NSF
93-148, Young Investigator Awards FY 1994 Program. This investigator's research
plan involves work on the interactions of trace metal ions with inorganic
ligands. These have important ramifications with respect to the manner by which
metals exert their toxic effects such as influencing the mechanisms that are
involved in formation of toxic methylated metal species by sulfate-reducing
bacteria. This work involves development of techniques for investigating the
mechanisms of electron transfer in reductive dehalogenation reactions of
polyhalogenated alkanes. The treatment of contaminated soils and aquifers by
stimulating abiotic or microbial reduction can result in byproducts that are
relatively persistent and toxic as well as others that are readily biodegraded.
Results of this research may be applied in engineering design of systems for
remediation of contaminated soil and aquifers to avoid the formation of
byproducts that are relatively persistent and toxic.
