This scholarship project provides funds for 30 computer science and information
system (CSIS) students at Kennesaw State University (KSU). The amount of each
award is $3000.00 annually. The support for the students in this program is
leveraged on the experiences gained from existing programs within the Department
of Mathematics and Computer Science, for example, a summer program for high
achieving underrepresented high school students from the local area of KSU. This
program is called the Cybertech 2k. There are two existing and significant
support and complementary programs to the CSEMS project at KSU: 1) Yamacrew
program which is a Georgia economic development initiative intended to make
Georgia a world leader in the design of broadband communications systems,
devices and chips; and 2) Mentor-Protege program which was established to
incorporate undergraduate research into the fabric of the College of Science and
Mathematics degree programs. These programs support the educational quality of
the course of instructions delivered to the students, and they aid in curbing
the high attrition rate of the CSIS majors.
