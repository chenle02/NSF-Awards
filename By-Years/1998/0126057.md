This award supports work on trapped gases in Antarctic and other ice cores for
paleoenvironmental and chronological purposes. The project will complete a ~
100,000 year, high-resolution record of atmospheric methane from the Siple Dome
ice core and use these data to construct a precise chronology for climate events
recorded by the Siple Dome record. In addition, the resolution of the GISP2
(Greenland) ice core record will be increased in some critical intervals to help
with the Siple Dome chronology and that of future ice cores. Finally, an upgrade
to the analytical capabilities of the laboratory, including increasing precision
and throughput and decreasing sample size needed for ice core methane
measurements will be an important goal of this work. The proposed work will
contribute to the understanding of the timing of rapid climate change in the
Northern and Southern hemispheres during the last glacial period, the evolution
of the global methane budget in the late Quaternary, and the late Quaternary
climate history of Antarctica. It will also improve our ability to generate
methane records for future ice coring projects, and inform and enrich the
educational and outreach activities of our laboratory.
