This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr Arthur Palmer's
postdoctoral research fellowship. Dr Palmer will apply NMR and fluorescence
spectroscopies to the determination of structural and dynamic aspects
ofmaromolecular chemistry. The systems to be studied fall into the categories of
cases of ligand binding on the dynamics of ribonucleases, dynamic aspects of
nucleic acid recognition by proteins, and structural aspects of membrane
receptor proteins. %%% This research will advance the knowledge of how large
molecules of biological interest move and how they interact with smaller
molecules. Advances in this area can lead to a much better understanding of
metabolism and metabolic disorders.
