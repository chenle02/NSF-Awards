0412618 Raskin Growth of microorganisms and formation of biofilms on pipe
surfaces is observed in drinking water distribution systems despite the presence
of disinfectant residuals. Because of the possible presence of pathogenic
species, this represents a public health concern. This project proposes to
investigate the mechanism of microorganism persistence in the presence of
disinfection residuals using genome-based DNA micro-arrays to examine gene
expression patterns. Specifically, the work will: (1) Develop a method for the
application of DNA micro-array technology for the study of specific microbial
genome responses in environmental microbial communities, (2) Investigate whole
genome transcription profiles of Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium avium in
pure culture, and in the complex communities of a simulated distribution system,
(3) Analyze these expression profiles to identify a pattern of responses
characteristic of disinfectant exposure, (4) Characterize the role of selected
genes in resistance to disinfectants and survival in drinking water distribution
systems.

The educational plan for this project is well documented. Three graduate
students and two undergraduates per year will be trained under this project. In
addition, workshops for middle and high school teachers will be developed.
