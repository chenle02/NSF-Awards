The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was designed to
increase the participation of minorities in scientific and engineering research.
The program provides support to strengthen the research environments and
capabilities of institutions that have substantial minority student enrollments.
Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or programs in
engineering. Investigators at Wayne State University will use RIMI support to
study soot emissions and the aromatic hydrocarbons associated with these
emissions. The study will focus on the characterization of the soot formation
process by examining properties such as size, shape, and the number density of
soot particulates. Laser diagnostics will be used to predict the radiation heat
transfer from root particulates by measuring their optical properties. These
studies will increase our knowledge about emission control mechanisms as they
apply to engines. This project on radiative properties and control techniques of
soot particles will encourage more minorities to choose careers in science and
engineering in an area where the automobile industry is a major contributor to
this Nation's economy. The principal investigator has published extensively on
the thermodynamics of engines and is well qualified to conduct the research.
