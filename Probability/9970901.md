The behavior of large discrete random processes can sometimes be studied in
terms of a limiting random continuous-space process. This ``weak convergence"
methodology is applied in several areas. Stochastic coalescence deals with the
merging of particles into larger and larger clusters according to some rate
kernel. The particular case of the additive rate kernel, which has a rich
structure relating to continuum random trees, is being investigated in detail. A
novel process combining coalescence with immigration and removal and which
appears to have an interesting phase transition is also being studied. In a
different direction, there is increasing interest in Markov chain Monte Carlo
methods for reconstructing phylogenetic trees (indicating relationships between
biological species). Some toy models for sampling from target distributions on
tree-space are studied via the weak convergence methodology.

The general area of research concerns large systems with random aspects to their
behavior. As such systems become larger, their behavior gets more difficult to
analyze, either via mathematical theory or via computer simulation. But in some
cases it is possible to overcome this difficulty by relating the behavior of
sufficiently large finite systems to that of some fixed infinite-size system.
This methodology is being applied in two areas. One area is refining analysis of
models of random clustering of mass, a topic of interest in many areas of
science (e.g. polymers in physical chemistry, condensation of raindrops in
clouds, and formation of galaxies in the early universe). The other area is the
analysis of performance of algorithms for reconstructing relationships between
biological species, specifically in how performance scales with number of
species.
