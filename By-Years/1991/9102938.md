This is research aims at the development of constraint imperative programming
languages for building interactive systems. A constraint language allows the
programmer to specify relations that are to be maintained by the underlying
system. The development of a constraint imperative programming (CIP) approach
has been developed to integrate the constraint and imperative paradigms. This
work will attempt to improve exiting speed by development of a compiler for
object-oriented CIP languages to produce efficient code. The research will
investigate how the sequence of actions to be taken for a given user input can
be represented in a constraint imperative environment. The work will include the
investigation of tools for writing, browsing and debugging constraint imperative
programs.
