Amphibians are undergoing a world-wide decline; certain species are becoming
extinct. It is known that die-offs of some species are associated with certain
viral pathogens, but it is not known why their immune systems are not protecting
them. If amphibian die-offs partially reflect natural or man-made environmental
changes that are immunosuppressive, awareness of these environmental factors are
necessary to re-establish ecological balance for the health of man and frogs,
alike. This project, uses the frog Xenopus as a laboratory model to investigate
the mechanisms of viral immunity and how these organisms mount up their
defenses. There are two aims: the first is to define the cellular components of
viral immunity in adult frogs; and the second is to determine if the tadpoles
are more susceptible due to a generalized immaturity of their immune system.
This project will contribute to a better understanding of the causes of
amphibian decline, which is of public interest. In addition, it will provide
opportunity for minority graduate and undergraduate students to study
fundamental immunology in the context of viral diseases, particularly in
amphibians.
