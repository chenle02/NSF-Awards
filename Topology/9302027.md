9302027 Cenkl A conference in algebraic topology will be held at Northeastern
University, Boston, Massachusetts, June 22-27, 1993. The main focus will be on
modern homotopy theory. The conference will be accessible to graduate students
and other young scientists in this field. Members of traditionally
underrepresented groups will be encouraged to attend. It will represent an
important opportunity for all to meet with the leaders in the subject. The main
topics will be two areas which have experienced spectacular growth over the past
few years: the chromatic perspective on stable homotopy theory (the telescope
conjecture, Picard groups, axiomatics of structured ring spectra), and unstable
homotopy theory (localizations, finite loop spaces, loop spaces of finite
complexes, algebraic homotopy theory). Topology concerns itself with aspects of
geometric spaces and structures which remain unchanged by continuous
transformations. Dimension, connectedness (being all in one piece), the
properties of being knotted or linked, and many more, all are subjects of
topological study, for they are preserved so long as cutting or tearing are not
permitted despite quite drastic alteration of shape and size. It is clear that
these are fundamental and significant properties but that their study requires
different tools from those of ordinary analytic geometry to make them manageable
and a subject for calculation. Algebraic topology is devoted to developing,
understanding, and applying these tools, and homotopy is one of the most
powerful and complex tools in the arsenal. ***
