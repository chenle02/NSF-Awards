Under the direction of faculty adviser Dr. Schilling, graduate student Mr.
Panero will conduct field work in several countries of Andean South America,
collecting samples of ca. 25 species of the sunflower group Helianthopsis. To
improve our ability to recognize species in this genus and to construct an
hypothesis about evolutionary relationships among the species and their closest
generic relatives, Mr. Panero will study traditional morphological characters
and will add new evidence derived from chromosome analysis, electron-microscopy
of floral features, and biochemical study of flavonoids. Mr. Panero has
conducted field work in the tropics in the past, and has planned an effective
program of sampling and analysis to complete a modern taxonomic revision of this
group of poorly known tropical plants. Dr. Schilling is an expert on the
taxonomy and evolution of the sunflower family of plants.
