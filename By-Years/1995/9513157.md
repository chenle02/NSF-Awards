&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potts&lt;br/&gt;9513157&lt;br/&gt;Actively growing cells
are particularly sensitive to air-drying and most die instantly upon exposure to
the atmosphere. In contrast, the members of a small, diverse group of
prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms have the capacity to withstand the most
acute of cell-water deficits. How they do so remains an intriguing problem in
biology. One cyanobacterium, Nostoc Commune, has a marked capacity for
desiccation tolerance and has been developed as a model for the anhydrobiotic
prokaryotic cell. In response to air-drying cells of N. commune synthesize water
stress polypeptides (Wsp) that constitute around 70% of the total soluble cell
protein and approximately 2% of the dry weight of a desiccated colony. Wsp
remain stable in cells stored for decades in the air-dried state. Wsp are
secreted and accumulate within a complex extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) that
completely envelops the cell filaments. Within the EPS the Wsp form multimeric
complexes, through strong ionic interactions, with a secreted, water-soluble
UV-A/B-absorbing pigment (UVP).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principle objectives of
this study are: 1) to isolate wsp from Nostoc, and to characterize the gene, its
flanking regions and its control elements; 2) to understand how wsp
transcription and Wsp synthesis are regulated by water stress; and 3) to
crystallize Wsp. The secretion of EPS and UVP by N. commune represent two
strategies that the cells use to achieve protection during long-term
desiccation. The evidence found by Dr. Potts suggests that Wsp play a role in
one or both of these strategies. The knowledge of how N. commune overcomes acute
cell-water deficit will provide an insight into the underlying mechanisms of
desiccation tolerance in all organisms.&lt;br/&gt;
