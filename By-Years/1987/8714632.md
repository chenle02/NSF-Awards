This analysis of the hydrographic structure of the Greenland Sea is a part of a
five-year international program of integrated oceanographic research in the
Norwegian and Greenland Seas whose objective is to quantify the environmental
effects that are active in the production of intermediate and deep water masses.
The data base for this project is a series of oceanographic cruises, the first
of which will take place in the summer of 1987 on board the West German research
vessel POLARSTERN. That cruise will focus on the western Greenland Sea, with
sufficient coverage on the eastern side to allow for overlapping of sections
that will be taken by other participants in the program. A second major thrust
of the project is to begin a shore-based analysis of both new and existing data
for the examination of the regional circulation and vertical structure, and to
prepare a volumetric census of water masses.
