Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction in the
U.S. and the world. Reinforced masonry construction use is increasing in
moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent features of economy,
fire safety, architectural flexibility, and ease of construction. The present
state of masonry structural analysis and design and materials and construction
technologies does not enable an accurate prediction of building behavior under
lateral loads such as seismic loads. This research project will develop the
analytical and mathematical models to support the experimental research in the
U.S.-Japan Coordinated Program for Masonry Building Research. The models will be
used as prediction models for experimental specimens, as correlation models for
experimental data, and as design models for masonry buildings. The results of
this research project will be used to establish rational limit state design
methodologies for reinforced masonry construction.
