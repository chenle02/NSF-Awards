Abstract ATM-9319156 Stahle, David W. Cleveland, Malcolm K. University of
Arkansas Title: Denchronology in East Africa Tree-ring chronologies are a proven
paleoclimatic proxy in the middle latitudes where winter temperatures include
the formation of unequivocally annual growth rings in many species of trees. The
absence of strong temperature seasonality has severely constrained the
application of denchronology to tropical forests. Nevertheless, there are a
number of climatic mechanisms in the tropics (seasonal precipitation) which can
induce seasonal growth rhythms in trees. This award supports an international
collaboration in East Africa to develop dendrochronologic techniques for
paleoclimatic reconstruction in tropical regions.
