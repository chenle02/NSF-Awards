The analysis and interpretation of a meridional hydrographic transect of the
Atlantic ocean from Iceland to Georgia Island will be completed. The study's
focusses are (1) mixing between Labrador Sea Water and Mediterranean Overflow
Water, (2) cross- equatorial deep water exchange in the western basin, (3) the
abyssal circulation of the Brazil and Argentine Basins, (4) a description of
eastward flow of Deep Water from the deep western boundary current eastward near
21 S, and (5) the circulation of Antarctic Intermediate Water in the
southwestern South Atlantic.
