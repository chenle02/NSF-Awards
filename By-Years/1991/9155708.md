This project seeks to identify aspects critical to the design of computer
simulations for teaching sophisticated physical concepts to students in
introductory physics classes. The progression from pedagogically simple systems
to complex systems that more closely model nature requires that students come to
believe that equations represent reality. Graphical representations show promise
in being the best way to connect physical systems and the equations that
describe them. Allowing students to build many of their own graphical
representations serves to validate simulations as models of nature, aid student
discussion, and alter student misconceptions. We will draw on representations
and analogies that scientists find particularly fruitful, but are not currently
included in introductory physics courses. We plan to investigate the potential
of new graphical tools such as three-dimensional displays and manipulations,
alternative input devices, and video storage devices for displaying physical
systems which students can model.
