This project involves the study of methyl bromide (CH3Br) and methyl chloride
(CH3Cl) from fungi in several environments including temperate forest, salt-
marsh, fresh-water wetland, and agricultural ecosystems. Several types of common
fungi will be isolated from soil and coarse woody debris, grown in the
laboratory and their ability to produce methyl halide investigated, and also re-
introduced into sterilized 'natural' soils to determine methyl halide production
rates in the natural environment. The effect of soil temperature and moisture
levels on the production rates will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methyl
bromide and methyl chloride are important atmospheric halides because they can
affect tropospheric and stratospheric ozone chemistry. Their atmospheric budgets
are not well understood.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
