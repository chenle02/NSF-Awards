Chemistry and Geology are two scientific fields that require sophisticated,
expensive instrumentation to obtain scientific facts. The x-ray powder
diffractometer is one such instrument. A modern instrument includes significant
data acquisition and data processing capability and is able to provide
measurements that could not be done satisfactorily with earlier generations of
these instruments. The modern instruments are more readily used in undergraduate
courses and provide the results in significantly less time. The grantee provides
funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
