This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). Large random structures are of central interest in
mathematics and are used as models of various phenomena in physics, computer
science, biology and many other branches of science. Some specific examples
include models for magnetism, gases, the spread of tumors, and noise in data
sets. The goal of this project is to advance the study of many of these
important models through new analytic techniques. In addition to studying the
specific models mentioned above, the project will build mathematical tools that
can be used to study large random structures in general. The project will
provide training opportunities that will involve undergraduate and graduate
students in research on some of the proposed projects.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project centers on analytic approaches to problems in
discrete probability. A central goal of the project is to create tools for
demonstrating limit theorems, anti-concentration, and correlation decay for
random variables based on analytic properties of generating and characteristic
functions. These methods contain immediate applications to models in
combinatorics and mathematical physics such as the Ising model, Gibbs point
processes, and the hard core model. The PI will use similar complex- and
Fourier-analytic techniques to study random algebraic structures such as random
matrices, random polynomials, random partitions, and random characters of the
symmetric group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
