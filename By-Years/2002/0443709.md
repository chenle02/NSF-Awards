Folates are vital cofactors for one-carbon transfer reactions in all organisms,
but are made only by plants and microorganisms. The folate that humans need
comes mainly from plant foods. Folate molecules have three parts - pteridine,
p-aminobenzoate (pABA), and glutamate - and usually also have a polyglutamate
tail. This research has three aims. (a) To raise folate levels in tomato fruit
by engineering them overproduce both pteridine and pABA (it being clear from
previous work that fruit overproducing pteridine alone are modestly enriched in
folate, but have run out of pABA) and to profile the expression of folate
synthesis genes in engineered fruit. (b) To combine genomics and biochemistry to
identify and characterize enzymes and genes involved in recycling folate
breakdown products, since this recycling appears to be crucial to maintaining
folate levels in plant tissues in the face of high rates of chemical or
photochemical breakdown. (c) To explore engineering lower gamma-glutamyl
hydrolase activity in tomato fruit, since this enzyme attacks polyglutamylated
folates and may in effect target them for destruction since deglutamylated
folates are more prone to breakdown in vivo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact: Deficiency of the vitamin folate is a global health problem that results
in a huge burden of preventable birth defects and anemia, and increased risks of
vascular disease and cancer. Metabolic engineering of folates in plants or other
food organisms (biofortification) is a viable way to correct dietary folate
deficiency and is in progress in several countries. This research will advance
this international research and development effort, and train PhD students and
postdoctorals in metabolic biochemistry and engineering. Furthermore, it will
incorporate an outreach to middle and high schools to heighten awareness of
folate nutrition and the potential for improving it by biofortification. This
outreach will incorporate presentations and simple lab exercises on measuring
folate in foods, which will show the importance of fruits and vegetables.
