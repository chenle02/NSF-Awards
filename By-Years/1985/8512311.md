The research program will investigate the safety and reliability of earthfill
and rockfill dams subjected to earthquake loading. The particular failure
mechanism considered is liquefaction and this will be studied by considering the
interaction that occurs between the fabric of the soil and the pore fluid
filling the void between the soil particles. Saturated cohesionless soils
subjected to long or sequential earthquake shaking will be examined. The
analytical and computational procedures developed will be evaluated by comparing
the predictions to the data recorded at particular earth dams during
earthquakes.
