The objective of the research is the detailed understanding of corrosion
processes in refractory metals, light alloys and high temperature alloys. Three
particular materials are proposed for investigation, typical of these three
important classes of materials. The approach taken is that of detailed
microstructural analysis of the chemistry and microstructure of the corrosion
products, and of the near surface region of the material, using sophisticated
methods of TEM (transmission electron microscopy) and AEM (analytical electron
microscopy), combined with methods which permit precise tracking of the rates of
corrosion in the metals. Both the research and the development of analytical
tools required for the research will be of significant benefit to both science
and technology, since corrosion of these materials is typically one of the
limiting factors in their lifetime in service, and in their range of
application. Corrosion processes tend to be complicated and path-dependent, and
post-hoc analysis typically gives little information about the details of the
corrosion process. The work would conversely make a significant contribution to
understanding the details of the corrosion process, and thereby lead to improved
materials.
