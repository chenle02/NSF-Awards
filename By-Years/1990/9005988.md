This research concerns several problems which lie at the interface of operator
theory and function theory. The first part of the project involves polynomial
approximation directed at understanding certain measures on the closed unit
disc. The other part of the project involves a study of the composition
operators on various spaces of analytic functions. This includes work on
identifying the spectrum of a composition operator, continuing work on the study
of composition operators on large weighted Bergman spaces, and the question of
identifying the components in the space of composition operators in the uniform
operator topology. This research is in the general area of modern analysis and,
as noted above, lies at the interface of operator theory and function theory.
The research involves the study of composition operators on spaces of analytic
functions in one or several complex variables and is a central topic in the
modern theory of complex analysis.
