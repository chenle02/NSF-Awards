The PI will apply (previously developed) coupled climate model analysis methods
to ensembles of historical period integrations of three new US models; the
Community Climate System Model (CCSM), the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory
(GFDL) model, and the Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) models. The
research is collaborative with DOE's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and
Intercomparison (PCMDI) scientists to perform climate change detection analysis
on five model monthly output fields, Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) Channel 2
temperature, MSU Channel 4 temperature, tropopause height, total columnar water
vapor and surface wind stress. The statistical significance of late twentieth
century trends in the model data will be judged against state of the art
observational data or their proxies. An additional analysis of the daily output
from the NCAR CCSM3 is planned to study the statistics of extreme events
produced by the model. Return value fields will be calculated for annual maximum
daily averaged surface air temperature and precipitation. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This work will yield new information
about whether and by how much our climate is changing. This is important
information for environmental management and environmental policy decisions.
