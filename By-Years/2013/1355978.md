The Advancing Scholarship Program Initiatives and Resources for Engineering and
Science (ASPIRES) program at Cañada College, a California community college, is
addressing challenges in the retention and success of undergraduate students in
STEM disciplines by providing S-STEM scholars both financial assistance and
academic enrichment activities. Through the ASPIRES program, 137 scholarships
are being awarded to students to facilitate their transfer to STEM programs in
four-year institutions. The ASPIRES program is also contributing to the national
imperative to broaden participation in STEM, as underrepresented students
comprise a significant proportion of the Cañada College student
population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical aspects of the ASPIRES project
include providing the S-STEM scholars with peer instruction, mentoring from
faculty members and industry professionals, summer research opportunities and
field trips to transfer institutions and industry sites. The project is
contributing to the body of knowledge of how strategic academic interventions
and enrichment opportunities promote the retention and success of STEM
undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups. Insights
gained from the ASPIRES project are shared with the broader community of
scholars at venues such as national meetings and conferences of professional
STEM societies, with no fewer than eight S-STEM scholars also participating in
these events annually. Outcomes being measured include the impact of the project
on student enrollment and retention in STEM majors, the level of student
preparation for success after transferring to a four-year institution and the
degree of student engagement with Cañada College faculty members, industry
professionals and STEM scholars at other academic institutions.
