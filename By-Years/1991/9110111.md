Software quality assessment, although acknowledged to be of the first
importance, is today an art rather than a science. Program testing is the best
defined and least subjective component of quality assurance, but even its
methods are poorly related to measurable quality. Program testing has two
purposes: (1) to expose software failures for repair, and (2) to establish
confidence that future failures are unlikely. The foundational theory must be
probabilistic, because any test is no more than a sample of program behavior.
For any program P and test method M, (1) What is the probability that M will
uncover a failure in P? (2) After M has been used without failure, what is the
probability that in fact P cannot fail? The purpose of this project is to
improve on previous theoretical answers to these questions. Prior theoretical
work can be characterized first as being imprecise, in that characteristics of M
and P do not enter the theory in a useful way; and second, as being overly
pessimistic, in that under the best of circumstances the probabilities are very
low. New theoretical work will be guided by experiments on existing and new test
methods, using novel support tools.
