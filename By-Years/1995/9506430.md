This proposal will partially support 17 scientists attending the 24th
International Cosmic Ray Conference in Rome, Italy. The conference will cover
topics ranging from particle astrophysics and elementary particles to high
energy astrophysics to geomagnetic and solar phenomena. The American Physical
Society's Division of Astrophysics will set up a committee to select individuals
for these travel funds based on a competitive basis of research quality,
financial need, and geographical and institutional distribution.***
