The Department of Mathematics at Mt. San Antonio College has begun revitalizing
its calculus courses by integrating, as the available technology permits, some
of the curricular modifications recommended in the recent NCTM standards.
Unfortunately, the Statistics and Business Calculus courses, which are required
for all Business Management students and is recommended for all other Management
Science students, have not been significantly altered from the traditional
lecture format. In conversations with Business faculty at neighboring 4-year
universities and with former students, it has become apparent that there is a
need for an overhaul of the present courses. As a means of addressing the
problem, this project seeks to establish a multimedia computer
classroom/laboratory and a multimedia presentation classroom, allowing for a
complete restructuring of Business Calculus and Statistics courses. This
restructuring includes multimedia presentation of course materials, continuous
curriculum development through student projects and presentations, and ongoing
student-generated development of an Internet-accessible Multimedia
Problems/Solutions Bank. This project is intended to make Business Calculus and
Statistics more "problem/solution" oriented with an emphasis placed on actual
data and problems derived from real business settings.
