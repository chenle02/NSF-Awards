This PYI award will support research on the near-surface damage introduced into
components during finishing operations and on methods to minimize such damage.
Analytical models for surface deformation and microfracturing due to mechanical
and thermal stresses in brittle materials will be developed and validated by
experimental studies. In addition, the stress state of fretting fatigue will be
evaluated in order to improve the characterization of this type of damage.
