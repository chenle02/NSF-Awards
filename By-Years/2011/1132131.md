This project will undertake the following: (i) establish the large-scale eastern
North Pacific tropical cyclone (TC) climatology and variability, including
investigating the near-coastal versus open ocean variability of TC activity and
the large-scale circulation patterns associated with the modes of variability;
(ii) extend of the current database of near-coastal TC remnants both in time as
well as to include 3-dimensional atmospheric information; and (iii) perform the
statistical analysis of characteristic circulation patterns associated with
particular rain swath patterns across the southwestern U.S. region. The research
will increase fundamental understanding of the climate variability of eastern
North Pacific tropical cyclones and how a changing climate will alter their
impacts on the sensitive southwestern U.S. and Mexico regions. Better
understanding of the large-scale circulation patterns that increase TC landfall
activity may lead to improved seasonal forecasts of these phenomena as well as
resource and management planning into the future.
