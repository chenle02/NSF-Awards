9406725 Ramamurthy Winter storms are among the most life threatening and
economically disruptive of meteorological phenomenon. In a continuation of
previous research, the Principal Investigators propose to study two areas, both
related to the organization and evolution of winter time phenomena associated
with mid-latitude cyclones. The first area of research concerns research on the
genesis, evolution and structure of mesoscale gravity waves and their associated
precipitation bands. The second research thrust is to study the occlusion
process of mid-latitude cyclones. Both studies will consist of a combination of
diagnostic and numerical modeling work. This research should lead to an increase
in understanding of the evolution of mid-continent winter cyclones and embedded
mesoscale processes which exert important controls over the production of winter
time precipitation. ***
