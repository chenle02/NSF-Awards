9985012&lt;br/&gt;Chesler&lt;br/&gt;Gene therapy is an exciting new modality for
treating and preventing vascular disease. Engineered gene therapy delivery
techniques could make this technology more affordable and thus broadly
accessible to the cardiovascular patient population. By applying quantitative
engineering analyses to a living, biological system, the PI hopes to further our
knowledge of human vascular transport mechanisms (aim 1), optimize adenoviral
gene therapy methods (aim 2), and assess the efficacy of optimized gene therapy
treatment strategies in human arteries and veins (aim 3). An ex vivo vascular
culture system will be used to pursue each of these goals. Ex vivo arterial and
venous organ culture is an ideal experimental paradigm for investigating
vascular transport phenomena under rigorous environmental and mechanical
control. Further, it allows living human tissue experimentation in a three-
dimensional, near-physiological environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first
educational goal of the proposed career plan is to teach engineering students
the fundamentals in the PI's area of specialization: the thermofluid sciences
(aim 1). The techniques of problem-based learning and interaction with local
industry will be used to achieve this goal. The second aim is to strengthen
teamwork and communication skills in both graduate and undergraduate engineers
(aim 2). Specifically, students will be given design projects in classes and
assigned to mixed-level and mixed-gender teams. They will be given instruction
in technical communication and practice by giving presentations to their peers
and a lay audience (local middle-school children). The third goal of the
educational program is to addresses the problem of diversity in the engineering
workforce (aim 3). University-level mentoring will be frequent and informal.
Through outreach and mentoring at the university, high school and middle school
levels, the PI hopes to increase the number of women in engineering and in the
pipeline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
