Reid 9711200 Support is provided to study the full water column circulation of
the Indian Ocean, to examine the exchanges with the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans,
and to compare the circulation and tracer patterns with those of the other
oceans. An attempt will be made to tie together the entire Atlantic-Indian-
Pacific circulation and the inter-ocean exchanges of waters that maintain the
broad differences in the characteristics between the three oceans. The existing
network of hydrographic sections, including the recent WOCE (World Ocean
Circulation Experiment) data, will be used.
