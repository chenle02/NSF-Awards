Most diffusion models have assumed an unstructured pattern to the spread of
information, disease, or elements in other substantive contexts. The population
dynamics of disease spread only by close personal contact is an important
example of a diffusion process for which the assumption that diffusion is
unstructured, that the population mixes randomly, is inappropriate. While
biological factors regulate the transmission and natural history of the
infectious agent, social factors, which have been typically neglected in the
field of epidemiological modeling, regulate the pattern of differential
association, or social mixing, and thus the structure within which transmission
is channelled. This research planning project seeks to develop a plan for
producing a general modeling framework that will enable analysis of selective
mixing in diffusion processes. Steps leading to this research include the
development of a solid collaborative working agenda with potential colleagues
overseas, a period of intensive collaboration in order to broaden the
sociological focus of the work, and analysis of extant data from several sources
on patterns of selective mixing and on patterns of diffusion in disease and
other empirical contexts. This project will enhance capability for modeling
diffusion processes by developing a plan to examine how the structure of social
networks affects the nature and velocity of diffusion. It will also facilitate
significant collaboration between the fields of sociology and biology.
