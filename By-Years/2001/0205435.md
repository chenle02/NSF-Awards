Today's global economy is characterized by changing market demands, short
product lifecycles, and fine-grained customization. This context demands a
capability to identify promising supply chain partners and adapt existing
relationships in response to dynamic conditions. One major impediment is the
multiplicity of considerations that bear on supply chain decisions. For example,
a material supply contract might specify price, quantity, delivery time and
mode, quality, warranty, and many other features. Most of today's auction
systems support one-dimensional negotiations where price and quantity are the
only features determined dynamically. This project aims to support negotiation
over many attributes in dynamic, multilevel supply chains. To this end, it will
develop flexible languages for expressing multiattribute offers, general two-
sided matching mechanisms supporting both iterative and one-shot negotiation,
and real-time decision support based on summarized assessments of production
states. The new techniques will be validated using an agent-based supply chain
simulation testbed, as well as analytical models. The resulting methods will
enable a future where companies routinely form and adapt supply chain
relationships for a broad range of productive activities. The systemic ability
to respond dynamically to changing conditions can ultimately lower costs, while
delivering greater value through increased customization and responsiveness to
novel opportunities.
