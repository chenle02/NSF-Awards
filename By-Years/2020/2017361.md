The rise of the use of “they” as a singular pronoun accompanies changes in some
laws, while research about the people for whom this usage is relevant is still
rare. The existence of such people is already challenging law and culture in the
United States, and in several states and countries, relevant legal categories
have changed. This project will help us better understand how people who use the
pronoun “they” understand their own gender, their perceptions of what
expectations accompany their identities, and the societal implications of them.
This research will provide insight into what kinds of social and organizational
policies are relevant to these recent developments. Findings will also provide
guidance for policymakers and businesses regarding how possible policy changes
may affect both these individuals and our society more generally.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project analyzes social
identity by interviewing people regarding how they conceptualize their place in
the gender structure. The project will recruit interviewees in three
metropolitan areas--Chicago, Dallas, and Seattle-- because past research
suggests that identities differ according to community. Interview respondents
will be recruited locally by targeted Facebook ads, postings on appropriate
online venues, and in face-to-face social groups. Interviews will focus on
respondents’ views of social identities to understand how relevant definitions
are shifting. Findings from the project will inform sociological theories
regarding how identity operates in several realms of social life, as well as
theories regarding social change in the definitions of social
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
