The Lexington Collaborative for Revitalizing and Improving Middle Mathematics
(LCRIMM) brings together Lexington Community College, the University of
Kentucky, and Fayette County Public Schools to increase the quantity and quality
of middle school mathematics teachers in the Lexington, Kentucky area. The
project is addressing a primary barrier to improving middle school students'
mathematics performance: teachers' limited knowledge of the mathematics needed
to teach standards-based mathematics curricula. The collaborative group is
addressing the knowledge base of middle school mathematics teachers by creating
two courses needed in their mathematics preparation: a geometry course and a
statistics course. The content of each is being aligned with state and national
mathematics standards for preservice education, and with the International
Technology Education Association (ITEA) standards for technological literacy.
The courses are activity-based and make appropriate use of technology,
collaborative activities, and real-world problems. Fayette County Public School
teachers are involved in the development and team-teaching of the pilot courses.
