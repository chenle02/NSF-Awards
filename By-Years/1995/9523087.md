9523087 Danai This research project deals with the development of innovative
approaches for robust fault diagnosis in machines such as automotive engines.
The approach involves feedback training and pattern classification. Pattern
classification is adopted from both residual transformation and fault signature
estimation. Fault signatures are estimated via the multi-valued influence matrix
(MVIM) method which also provides measures of uniqueness and repeatability of
fault signatures. In residual transformation, a time-delay connectionist net is
trained iteratively on a batch of measurement - fault data. The learning
algorithm adjusts the parameters of the time-delay net such that the next set of
transformed residuals will have better detection and diagnostic performance
within the range of training set. The residual generation method is
experimentally evaluated at the center for Automotive Research of the Ohio State
University. The experiments include sensor and actuator faults and are carried
out over a broad range of engine operating conditions.***
