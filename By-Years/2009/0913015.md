This proposal identifies a pathway to distributed pattern recognition through
parallelization of a particular contour identification algorithm and
decentralized data collection using formations of robots. Such a system
recognizes patterns in the data it collects autonomously. Anticipated
applications range from homeland security, to emergency response, scientific
exploration and environmental monitoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional
mobile sensor networks are based on an architecture in which some minimal signal
processing is performed on the sensing nodes, while the bulk of information is
directed to a network sink for processing and interpretation. The hypothesis
here is that the same communication infrastructure that enables motion
coordination in formation of robots can be exploited for distributed processing
of sensor data and autonomous pattern recognition without human intervention.
Thus, information is interpreted in a distributed fashion and without dependence
on the capabilities of specialized individual nodes. This method brings forward
a robust and autonomous system which can inherently tolerate node and network
failures and exhibits collective intelligence in the form of group associative
memory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical challenges to be overcome are the
development of decentralized and provably convergent cooperative motion control
designs which can enable targeted data collection, and the scalable
implementation of a pattern recognition algorithm based on Dirichle Laplacians
along with its integration with spatially distributed Hopfield neural networks.
The complete system will be demonstrated by an experimental test-bed with mobile
robots capable of recognizing noisy, variable shapes on the laboratory floor.
Outreach activities will include undergraduate research and summer programs for
secondary school teachers. &lt;br/&gt;
