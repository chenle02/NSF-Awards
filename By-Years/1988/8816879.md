This award provides one-half of the funds required to purchase equipment parts
for upgrading a used electron microprobe system. The upgraded instrument will be
operated in the Department of Geology at the Indiana-Purdue University at
Indianapolis. The University will provide the remaining 50% match for the
upgrade. The upgrade consists of replacing the high vacuum system, rebuilding
one of the x-ray wave length dispersive spectrometers, and rebuilding the sample
stage. The improved instrument is to be employed in microanalytical studies of
fossil shells.
