This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic geometry of Professor
Gerd Faltings of Princeton University. Dr. Faltings's research will be centered
on questions about p-adic analysis and Diophantine geometry. He has recently
discovered p- adic symmetric domains, and plans to study their cohomology and
construct their Satake compactifications. In Diophantine geometry, he plans to
use new methods, in particular the Product Theorem that he has recently proved,
to reformulate the classical theory of Diophantine approximations. This is
research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject that combines
the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original
formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number theory started with
the whole numbers and such questions as divisibility of one whole number by
another. These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced
each other from the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual
influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now
uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding
influence beyond its own borders.
