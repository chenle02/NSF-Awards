ABSTRACT P.I. Farish Jenkins/Laura MacLatchy SBR-9300671 For decades, the
functional properties of the hip joint in humans and other primates (including
their fossil remains) have been studied by anthropologists in an attempt to
understand the peculiarities and evolution of our singular pattern of locomotion
- erect bipedal walking. Walking evolved early in human evolution, certainly
prior to the great expansion in brain capacity and competence, and was a key to
leaving a life-style dependent on the forests. Yet the comparative studies of
hip function to date have been inadequate to resolve a number of disputes in
this area. This project will use some new 3-dimensional quantification
techniques to document differences among primate species more accurately than
has been attempted previously. These will provide a basis for functional
interpretation of behavioral differences in locomotion which in turn will make
for more accurate delineation of fossil primate patterns. The study should have
some clinical relevance, as well. The graduate student and P.I. are extremely
well qualified to carry out this research. *** P\anthro\jfried\9300671.abs &gt;R
