This award supports a three year project with Dr. E. Carpenter of SUNY Stony
Brook that applies biotechnology to problems in biological oceanography. The
investigators propose to examine the distribution and activity of nitrogen
fixers in the sea with enzymatic and immunological assays. The potential
importance of marine nitrogen fixers to nutrient cycling is unknown but
suspected to be significant. This work will apply new techniques to the study of
the distribution and activities of marine nitrogen fixation.
