9458247 Riley The focus of this research is the investigation of the molecular
mechanisms of the colicin toxin evolution is Escherichia coli. We intend to use
techniques of experimental evolution, computer simulation and surveys of
standing genetic variation to assess the importance of diversifying selection on
the evolution of colicin gene cluster.
