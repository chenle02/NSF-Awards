The project will develop a methodology to predict engineering properties in
injection molded parts. The methodology will incorporate the application of
connectionist learning systems, neural networks, to the processing of non-
newtonian viscoelastic polymeric materials. The desired engineering properties
in injection molded parts are strongly dependent upon the thermomechanical
history which, in turn, is greatly influenced by the processing parameters. The
relationships between part properties and thermomechanical history are complex
and highly non- linear, therefore the methodology to be developed will be based
on a back propagation algorithm that provides the means for training networks
with adaptive non-linear units. The networks will be trained with the
thermomechanical history of a simple plaque, from the results of injection
molding simulation programs, and the corresponding engineering properties. The
network relates thermomechanical history to the part properties through the
weighted connections developed during training. Thus, when thermomechanical
histories from simulation results are known for every location within any part,
the corresponding properties can be predicted. This methodology which is based
on neural network computation will provide part designers with the ability to
predict engineering properties in injection molded parts without molding and
testing actual components.
