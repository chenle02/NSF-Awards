A stopped-flow (SF) rapid mixing accessary is being used to introduce
undergraduate chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology students to an
important method for studying fast reactions. The SF accessory is primarily used
with a UV/Visible absorption spectrometer (UV/VIS), computerized and modified
for rapid data collection. Reactions with half-lives on the order of 20-50
milliseconds are studied with the system. Many biological enzyme-catalyzed
reactions are studied with the SF/UV/VIS system. The SF/UV/VIS instrument is
used by junior majors in a combined analytical, inorganic and physical chemistry
laboratory. Senior thesis research students use the SF/UV/VIS instrument to
study the oxygenation of cobalt-substituted hemocyanin, The hands-on experience
with a technique used to study rapid reaction has enhanced the students'
understanding of concepts of biochemical and chemical kinetics. The institution
has contributed to this project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
