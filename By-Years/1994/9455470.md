9455470 Thomas Precision Teaching of an Introductory Physics E & M Course for
Engineers The program focusses on techniques for improving student performance
in an introductory (Physics) Electricity and Magnetism course undertaken as a
requirement by pre-Engineering majors. A computer based interactive program
allows students to simulate their own homework problems and thereby be led
through an effective routine for problem solving. Emphasis is on abstract
concepts such as fields and potentials where the student has no basis of
practical experience. The simulations are to be integrated into an existing
Precision Teaching routine which is successful in improving student performance
(and halving student attrition). Emphasis throughout is on quantitative
assessment of outcomes and elimination of co-lateral variables. Development of
the simulation is under-way. Support is sought for completion of the
development, for integration into the Precision Teaching routine and for the
assessment of performance change. The assessment program includes comparisons
between test and control groups, implementation in courses covering 2,000
students per year and transfer to another institution. Faculty response will be
monitored through surveys, student response assessed also through surveys and
student performance measured through the standard techniques of tests and
quizzes. The program will monitor performance of almost 6,000 students and track
some of these through the full three years. Correlations will be sought with
gender, minority status, performance before entering the class and with
performance through the major courses.
