This project constructs a series of "showcase" experiments for the undergraduate
chemical engineering laboratories at Ohio University. The emphasis of these
experiments is their visual nature, allowing for a vivid demonstration of
underlying engineering principles. Traditional experiments in undergraduate
laboratories can be greatly enhanced through the use of clear tubing, color
change reactions and real-time data display. Experiments are planned in
multiphase mixing, reaction kinetics, fluid flow, heat transfer, process control
and materials analysis. The experiments serve many purposes: they are used as
experiments in the undergraduate laboratory courses, as demonstration projects
in the appropriate undergraduate lecture courses, and as demonstration
experiments for a "Taster" course in chemical engineering being implemented by
the department. This course is an intensive two-day experience for high school
students designed as an introduction to chemical engineering. The ability to let
the participants conduct visually dynamic experiments is critically important to
excite these students to pursue a career in chemical engineering.
