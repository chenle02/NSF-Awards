Theoretical and experimental techniques will be developed to calculate and
measure conditions at line and point contacts between sliding surfaces which are
lubricated by either Newtonian or non- Newtonian liquids. Both smooth and rough
surfaces will be studied. THe conditions in questions are temperature and
pressure distributions and induced mechanical and thermal stresses. //
