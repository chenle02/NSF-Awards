This project examines wireless communication networks whose nodes have batteries
that recharge by harvesting energy from the environment. Energy harvesting can
yield a network that lasts as long as the network's hardware and intended
purpose remain viable; this may be arbitrarily longer than the lifetime of any
suitable single-charge battery. While average-power minimization is adequate to
describe the lifetime of a device with a single-charge battery, a complete
characterization of a network of rechargeable devices will depend on how the
batteries are replenished. Given the broad variety of energy recharging systems,
including solar cells, vibration absorption devices, wind and water mills, and
thermoelectric generators, battery recharging is modeled as an environmental
stochastic process. This project applies analytical models for battery
recharging to evaluate fundamental multiple access, broadcast and relay network
models composed of rechargeable nodes. The project objective is an enhanced
understanding of the analytic fundamentals of rechargeable networks in order to
contribute to the development and ultimate deployment of ecologically-friendly
rechargeable networks.
