Objective: The objective of the Advanced Research Workshop on Future Trends in
Microelectronics, which is to be held in Corsica, France during June 25-29,
2012, is to discuss the future of the rapidly evolving microelectronics
technology, in a small group, with leaders in the field.

Intellectual merit: The Workshop will provide a forum for an exchange of views
among leading research professionals in industry, academia, and government. The
intent is to arrive at a far-reaching overview of the evolution of
microelectronics in the coming decade or more, as perceived by leading
practitioners in the field. The major goal of the workshop is to assess the
current status, define future research directions in microelectronics and to
establish collaborations between researchers. This will be achieved through
presentations and open discussions of the key technical issues.

Broader impact: It is expected that this Workshop will be instrumental in
defining the research required by the growing demands of microelectronics in the
coming decade. This workshop will also contribute to the training of
participating students and the topics will be disseminated through the
Conference Technical Digest.
