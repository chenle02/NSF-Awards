In exploring the sources of political democracy in developing nations, this
project examines how religion indirectly promoted democracy in former British
colonies. Because religious groups gained more independence from state control
in British (and American) colonies, they had more power to fight for their
interests in dealing with governments in the colonizing nations. For example,
despite the opposition of most colonial governments, religious groups in British
colonies advocated mass education in order to foster conversion. This led to
high literacy rates and successful democracies in the colonized countries. To
test these arguments, the project gathers data on education from missionary
records, and merges the data with digitalized maps of British colonies. It also
collects and codes reports from missionary committees. The findings help
identify the mechanisms behind diverse colonial outcomes and contribute to
literature on world systems and cultural imperialism.
