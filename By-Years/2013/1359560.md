The team proposes commercializing a sensing platform comprised of three parts: a
low-power wireless sensor mote, embedded communication and damage detection
algorithms, and cloud-based GUI for data visualization and sensor network
management. This project represents a step-change for the industry in several
ways: it provides a continuous, real-time stream of data, enables remote
monitoring, and validates engineering models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
work would create a dataset that currently does not exist, and could be used not
only by our customers, but also by insurers, risk analysts, financial investors,
researchers, and consumers - creating value in complementary industries. The
proposed technology will be able to impact customers in construction monitoring
starting from early 2014, and with good traction, would be able to reach
customers in the transportation, energy, mining, and other sectors within five
years.
