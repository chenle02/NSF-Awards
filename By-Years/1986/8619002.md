Professor Warga is a prominent senior investigator who has made many
contributions to the theory of optimization. In this project he proposes to
develop higher order conditions for optimality by applying a new result called
"Nonsmooth Open Mapping Principle". The higher order necessary conditions of
optimality are used to verify solutions obtained from the first order necessary
conditions. Sometimes the problem is mathematically degenerate and the first
order conditions provide no information on the nature of the optimal solutions.
In both cases, the second order conditions are useful. Nonetheless, the
development of general second order conditions is a difficult mathematical
problem. Professor Warga succeeded recently in developing such results and
intends to pursue this line of development. The novelty and difficulty of his
approach is in the use of a nonconvex set of admissible variations. This is the
first time anyone has succeeded in doing this. Several other directions of work
are described in this project: optimal control problems with constraints imposed
on the system's state, differential games with nonadditively coupled controls,
problems with delays, and computer implementation of theoretical results.
