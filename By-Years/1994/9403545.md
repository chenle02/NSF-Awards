Professor Clifford Dykstra is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research on the analysis of
dynamical features of weakly bound complexes. Ab initio electronic structure
calculations are used for evaluating the intrinsic electrical response
properties of molecules. The results of these calculations are incorporated into
a molecular mechanics model for clusters, MMC, which can then be used to predict
molecular structure and dynamical properties of a larger clusters of molecular
species. The primary goal of the work is a detailed, fundamental understanding
of weak interactions, including transferable potentials, electronic structure
changes, and dynamical manifestations. Weak molecular interactions are important
in problems ranging from molecular clustering, certain surface phenomena,
nonlinear optical response of aggregations, aspects of protein structure, and
drug design. Dykstra's work is aimed at achieving reliable predictive capability
for structures and energetics of weak clusters, and for the changes in
properties of systems which experience weak inter- and intramolecular
interaction.
