This award will provide partial support for engineering development of a
secondary ion resonant ionization mass spectrometer system at the Lamont-Doherty
Geological Observatory of Columbia University. The system being developed
includes a pulsed-laser excited, two-photon, ionization step which should
provide a significantly superior source of ions for mass spectrometry of rare
elements like osmium. Improved sensitivity in the analysis of osmium isotopes in
geological samples would be a significant advance because of the potential of
the rhenium-187 to osmium-187 decay system (half-life of 42 billion years) to
unravel problems of the chemical evolution of the crust and mantle and for
dating cosmochemical events.
