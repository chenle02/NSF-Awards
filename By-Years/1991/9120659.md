The U. S. Patent and Trademark Office will provide data to extend and expand
data series concerning patenting in the United States. Data will include numbers
of patents granted year by year to Americans and to citizens of other specified
countries, patents owned by individuals as opposed to private corporate
entities, governments, and patents assigned to universities and colleges. Counts
of granted patents will be classified by both the Patent Office Classification
system and the Standard Industrial Classification system. These data are used in
the National Science Board's series of Science and Engineering Indicators
reports as indicators of levels of technical invention in the various countries,
sectors, and fields.
