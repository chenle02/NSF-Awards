The goal of this project is to develop practical non-malleable codes, which are
encoding schemes that have the property that modifying an encoded message
results in either decoding the original message or a totally unrelated message.
This will improve upon previous constructions and create practical methods to
secure against memory attacks for both computers and portable devices. The
practical designs developed in this project would immediately improve the
performance in applications that use non-malleable codes. The project introduces
new research-integrated courses regarding cryptographic coding and physical
attacks, and defines appropriate research activities for training undergraduate
and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project conducts a
comprehensive study of a new cryptographic primitive called l-more extractable
hash. The investigators explore methods to derive practical coding schemes using
this primitive, and instantiate this primitive efficiently under various
computational assumptions. This research is expected to significantly advance
the understanding on practical designs of non-malleable codes and their
generalizations, and the new developments could potentially lead to many further
practical designs against even broader classes of physical attacks.
