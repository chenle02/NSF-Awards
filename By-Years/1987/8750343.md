The equipment provided through this award is improving the undergraduate
laboratory for students enrolled in the intermediate-level Genetics course. One
set of experiments is based on recombinant DNA technology (especially as it is
applied to the sequencing of DNA), while a second set emphasizes gene product
isolation and the genetic control of development. The work on recombinant DNA
technology includes a number of steps which can be carried out conveniently in
the structured laboratory setting. The essential simplicity of the experiments
provides an experience which clarifies the section of the lecture program which
emphasizes molecular genetics. These steps also introduce the students to
several widely used physical methods (e.g., agarose and acrylamide gel
electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation) and incorporate such standard biological
techniques as transformation and replica plating in relevant ways. Gene product
isolation from Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans introduces
students to the biology of these widely studied organisms and to the
characterization of proteins. The additional equipment secured through this
award (electrophoresis units, high voltage power supply, microcentrifuge,
sonicator, shaker bath, gel slab dryers, ultracentrifuge and rotor) permits
students to perform these experiments in their logical order (rather than having
the order imposed by equipment availability), in this way gaining an
understanding of the many applications of molecular techniques to solving basic
questions in Genetics.
