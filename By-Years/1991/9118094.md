Our proposal is concerned with the mechanical properties of the staminal
filaments of thistles, and the role of stimulus transduction and transmission in
thigonastic movements. Earlier studies have shown that these filaments are
highly elastic compared to other plant parts but specific data are still
lacking. The unique combination of mechanical properties of cuticle and cells as
a means of biological function positions our research activities in a multi-
disciplinary area. The multi-disciplinary approach is evident in that not only
biologists (KH Hasenstein, T. Pesacreta, V. Sullivan) but also a materials
scientist (e. MArtin) are involved in the project. Because both living cells and
biopolymers of the cuticle and other portions of the cell wall are involved in
the function of the staminal filaments, our research will interface three
divisions: materials research, cellular biosciences and molecular biosciences
and molecular biosciences. Since we propose to share existing laboratory
facilities rather than purchasing new equipment, and additional criterium of the
program description is met.
