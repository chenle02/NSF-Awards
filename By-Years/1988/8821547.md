8821547 Sibuya This project will continue work focusing on the properties of
solutions of ordinary differential equations defined in the real and complex
domain. There are four main areas under consideration. The first consists of
studies on the asymptotic behavior of solutions of a first-order system of
linear differential equations as the real independent variable increases
indefinitely. This work extends results in the textbook of Coddington and
Levinson. A second line of investigation will consider order linear differential
equations of higher order in which the coefficients of the derivatives are given
by holomorphic functions. The object of this investigation will be to give a new
interpretation in terms of the algebraic formalism of D-modules to the question
whether the inhomogeneous equation can be solved in a sector of the complex
plane. General results on differential equations are to be derived as elementary
consequences of the theory of injective modules. Related work will also be done
studying asymptotic solutions of mildly nonlinear systsms of equations of Gevrey
type. The difference in this effort will be the introduction of singular
perturbations. Solutions are expected to reflect the same growth properties as
those from the unperturbed equations for small values of the parameter. The
final theme will treat the classical Stokes multipliers of Riemann's theory of
hypergeometric equations. The multipliers give invariants of equations. In this
context, parameters will be introduced into the equations and the properties of
the multipliers will be studied as functions of the parameters. Some results of
this type can be derived from the principal investigator's 1975 book.
