Relationships between dated plutons and tectonic deforma- tion have been widely
used to constrain timing of regional deformation. The validity of this procedure
relies on the ability to determine emplacement-related structures in the plutons
from super-imposed tectonic structures. Existing guide- lines are not diagnostic
and therefore criteria for distinguish- ing pre-, syn-, and post- tectonic
plutons are controversial. This project will carry out a detailed examination of
the Merrimac pluton in the Northern Sierra Nevada, California to estimate the
strain fields in and around the granitoid. Additionally, computer modeling that
simulates pre-, syn-, and post- tectonic pluton emplacement under coaxial and
non-coaxial deformation will be performed. By comparing planar sections through
the computer generated strain fields with the strain fields obtained from the
field data, it is expected that more rigorous criteria will result for
recognizing pre-, syn-, and post- tectonic plutons, and therefore, provide more
reliable constraints for determining the age of structures in orogenic belts.
