This project will assess the viability of a distinctive approach to stimulate
the uptake of Open Access (OA) in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics) and HSS (humanities and social sciences) journals. Goals include
flipping two journals currently being published using a subscription model at
another publisher and migrate that journal to a sustainable diamond OA model.
The proposal addresses the urgency and risk in the need for new sustainability
models,and will analyze a novel financial framework and the strategic viability
of a new potentially high-impact publishing model for advancing and sustaining
the outputs of scientific and scholarly research on a fully unencumbered open
access basis. The hypothesis is that a robust diamond publishing program will
help to accelerate STEM and HSS research (although not necessarily at the same
rate), and by so doing, incentivize the creation and advancement of knowledge.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
