This research involves the study of random processes on trees. In particular,
for random walks on random trees, problems to be studied include the speed of
the walks and the Hausdorff dimension of their harmonic measure. These questions
are analogous to current investigations in differential geometry. Another
problem is to approximate negatively curved manifolds by trees in order to study
some random processes on manifolds. This research involves the study of random
processes on trees. Trees are structures that are often more realistic than
Euclidean spaces as models for movement of random processes. This research will
contribute to a better understanding of random processes.
