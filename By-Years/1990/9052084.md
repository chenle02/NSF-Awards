A new diode-array ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometer and its computer,
computer peripherals, and application software has been purchased. This
instrument is substantially upgrading the quality and variety of undergraduate
laboratory experiences, and is giving students, for the first time, practise
with a computer-controlled instrument and its application software. The
instrument is being used in a number of undergraduate courses, including General
Biology, Ecology, Anatomy and Physiology, Cell Biology, Biochemistry, and
independent research. A varied spectrum of increasingly more sophisticated
exercises are being incorporated into the students' "hands-on" laboratory
experiences. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
