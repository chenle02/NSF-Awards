The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program is supporting professor
Scuseria at Rice University. During the next three years he will continue his
work on Linear scaling in Electronic structure methods. The research contains
both computational development, as well as applications. The computational work
is focused in at five distinct areas. These include (1) Improvements to the Fast
Multipole method, (2) Improvements to the exchange-correlation quadratures, (3)
diagonalization bottlenecks (4) O(N) Hartree-Fock algorithms, and finally (5)
improving DFT capabilities. Specific chemical problems to be addressed in the
next funding period will emphasize Fullerene growth, graphite sheets and carbon
nanotubes. First principles electronic structure calculations of molecules
remain limited to systems of modest size because of the steep computational
cost. The objective of this research is to develop fast, high accuracy methods
for the prediction of properties of large systems such as biomolecules and
nonostructures. The quest here is to develop full linear scaling methods. Work
will continue in this area with specific emphasis on removing the existing
computational bottlenecks.
