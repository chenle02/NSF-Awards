Microporous solids will be made by polymerizing one phase of bicontinuous
microemulsions. Preliminary experiments show these solids can have surface areas
over 1000 m2/g and can selectively adsorb heavy metals like copper. These high
surface areas are to be obtained routinely with more crosslinking, polymerizable
detergents, and altered detergent concentrations.
