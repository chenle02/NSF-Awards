Dr. Fiona Marshall and her colleagues will conduct research among the Okiek
people of Kenya. The Okiek, who live in small local groups scattered throughout
the highlands of Kenya, are of great anthropological interest because they have
retained a traditional lifestyle which relies heavily on hunting and the
gathering of wild plant foods. They are also important because they occupy high
montane forest and little is known about adaptation to such environments. The
team will provide a case study of hunter- gatherer faunal use. They will live
with the Okiek, accompany hunting parties, and study faunal acquisition, bone
modification, and discard. Because the project will extend over twelve months
and the Okiek move frequently, it will be possible to study faunal use at a
variety of sites, in a variety of habitats, and through a variety of seasons.
Data will be collected on Okiek hunting strategies, details of carcass
processing, and the relationship between human actions and the location and
character of cuts and bone breakage. Records will be kept on bone transport and
discard. Discarded bone will be mapped, collected, and studied, and post-discard
bone modification processes will be examined at selected sites. This research
will accomplish several anthropologically important goals. It will document a
unique, and fast disappearing way of life. It will also provide insight into
hunting and traditional subsistence practices and yield data which will help
archaeologists to understand the past. Finally, through examination of the
relationship between subsistence and the faunal byproducts of this process, it
will provide a set of tools which will aid in the interpretation of
archaeological remains. Until approximately 10,000 years ago all humans lived by
hunting and gathering and many pan-human traits such as the family and language
developed in this context. We can better understand ourselves today when we view
ourselves in this broader context. Dr. Marshall's research will contribute to
this goal.
