This U.S.-Brazil Workshop proposal will support U.S. graduate students in
establishing and expanding research collaborations with Brazilian counterparts.
The U.S. researchers will work under the leadership of PI R.P.H. Chang of
Northwestern University and the Brazilian team will work with Dr. Guillermo
Solorzano from the Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio).
The proposed workshop, scheduled for September 2009, offers a unique model for
preparing the next generation of US researchers to take part in global research
initiatives. The purpose of the workshop is to: (a) match U.S. students with
Brazilian students that have complementary research interests and capabilities
to plan potential collaborative research projects; (b) visit facilities at
Brazilian universities, research institutes and industry labs; (c) attend a
series of relevant lectures, industry exhibits and poster sessions; and (d)
present their project plans for review by senior researchers and agency
representatives.
