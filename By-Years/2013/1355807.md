The Department of Oceanography in the College of Geosciences at Texas A&amp;M
University (TAMU) is recruiting academically talented graduate students with
demonstrated financial need to become Oceanography Scholars. Scholarships will
be awarded to a total of 22 new students admitted in three cohorts; the first
two will be composed of five M.S. and four Ph.D. students each, while the third
will contain five M.S. students. Oceanography Scholars receive additional
support from faculty research mentors and formal training in teaching pedagogies
through courses and workshops offered by the university's Center for Teaching
Excellence, Graduate Teaching Academy and the Department of Oceanography.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program is designed to educate scientists with
interdisciplinary expertise in oceanographic processes to solve environmental,
social and economically important challenges facing the nation by conducting
research in their field. Doctoral graduates will enter the workforce directly
from the program while M.S. graduates may either enter the workforce or
matriculate into Ph.D. programs where they will build new knowledge to address
scientific challenges that are relevant to both human and environmental
sustainability. Through targeted recruiting efforts, academically talented
students with financial need will matriculate at TAMU, conduct research, and
graduate prepared to address areas of high national need.
