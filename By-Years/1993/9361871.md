9361871 Van Hove The principal investigator proposes to fabricate (A1GaInAsSb)
quantum well laser structures for 2-5 um IR application. This material system
has desired properties and will be compatible with III-V device processing
technology. The laser diodes will be grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy method. We
shall use in-situ monitoring techniques for tight material parameter control,
and use dopants which may lead to improved performance. The work will be based
on our extensive experience in these materials. Materials will be thoroughly
characterized and the growth condition optimized. Device modeling will lead to
improved understanding and advanced structures for enhanced performance. ***
