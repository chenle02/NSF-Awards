Jakob, Elizabeth IBN-9507417 Abstract In order to understand how social behavior
evolves, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the relative costs and
benefits of group and solitary living for each individual. Dr. Jakob will
conduct a quantitative study of a species that is at an early stage in social
evolution and that exhibits both group and solitary living. This will permit her
to examine factors that influence decision-making with regard to patterns of
social interaction. Based on the results of these studies, Dr. Jakob will
develop a dynamic model that will predict optimal social behavior. Mathematical
models are valuable because they generate rigorous, testable predictions with
explicitly stated assumptions. A dynamic model is an excellent tool for modeling
individual choices in this system because dynamic models incorporate variables
which describe a condition, such as energy level or current location, that can
change over time and that influences the optimal decision. Importantly, the
predictions of this model can then be tested in the field. Dr. Jakob has also
integrated the participation of students in her research plan.
