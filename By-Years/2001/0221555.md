The Glenn H. Brown Prizes were established in 1986 to advance and diffuse
knowledge of liquid crystal states of matter by encouraging effective written
and oral presentations of doctoral research results. At the International Liquid
Crystal Conference to be held June 30-July 5, 2002 in Edinburgh, Scotland, the
International Liquid Crystal Society will award prizes for outstanding thesis
completed between January 2000 and December 2001. Tesis on theoretical,
experimental and/or applied work on thermotropic, polymeric and/or lyotropic
liquid crystal systems will be considered.

The liquid crystal community continues to have direct impact on education and
the development of new materials for technological advances of high significance
to society. The latter include the development of novel electro optic devices of
high commercial interest. Since these technical areas are of very high priority
to industry, students educated and trained in these multidisciplinary areas
involving liquid crystal science and engineering compete very well in the job
market and go on to contribute in many significant ways to the global economy.
