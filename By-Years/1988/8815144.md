The Organic Synthesis Program will provide support to Dr. Gary E. Keck of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah. This research will develop
new synthetic methodology based on free radical reactions. The synthesis of the
increasingly complex compounds used in modern agriculture and medicine will be
aided by this work. The main focus of the work will center on the development of
new conjunctive reagents for the preparation of cyclic compounds (particularly
five- and six-membered rings) via radical chain processes, explorations of the
free radical chemistry of vinyl oxiranes, investigations of the possibilities
posed by nitrogen centered radicals, and the concept of radical mediated
reorganizations of simple hydrocarbon frameworks into more complex and less
readily accessible isomeric structures. The following areas will be
investigated: a) Cyclopropylcarbinyl radicals in synthesis; b) Vinyl oxiranes,
alkoxy radical trapping; c) Serial radical reactions--vinyl oxiranes as radical
traps; d) Serial radical reactions--radical catalysis of hydrogen skeletal
reorganizations; e) Nitrogen centered radicals; f) A "second generation" route
to pseudomonic acid C; g) An allylstannane based route to coriolin; and h) Free
radical alternatives to "conjugate addition-enolate trapping".
