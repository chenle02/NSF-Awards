The investigator studies estimation, testing and construction of simultaneous
confidence regions for time-varying parameters in models with non-stationary and
dependent errors. The simultaneous confidence regions can be used to test
patterns of associations between covariates and responses. The investigator also
develops new tools for asymptotic analysis of non-stationary time series.

During the last decade, models with time-varying data generating mechanisms have
gained substantial attention in various fields including economics, finance,
engineering, sociology, medical science, environmental science among others.
Results from the proposal are useful for understanding the dynamic association
between explanatory variables and responses for temporally observed data in
which the underlying physical mechanism change with respect to time.
