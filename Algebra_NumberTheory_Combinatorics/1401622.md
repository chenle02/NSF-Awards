As was realized by Descartes, the solution of algebraic equations can be
realized geometrically. This observation was the start of a rich interaction
between algebra and geometry. This project will study two topics in number
theory. The first concerns the shape of arithmetic manifolds -- i.e., certain
geometries defined by their number theoretic symmetries. The PI has conjectured
the existence of new structures that govern their shape (mathematically speaking
their topology), which he will investigate in more detail. The second topic
relates to lattices of high dimension. These are a topic of interest in modern
cryptography; on the other hand, a satisfactory mathematical theory of them is
not yet available, and this project aims to develop such a theory. More
specifically, the PI has formulated a conjecture that specifies the values of
"periods" of arithmetic locally symmetric spaces -- i.e., the numbers obtained
by pairing homology classes with normalized differential forms. This conjecture
is interesting because it suggests a relationship between these homology groups,
and certain motivic cohomology groups. The PI will study this conjecture and
attempt to give evidence for it. Concerning lattices, the PI will study in
particular the following questions: What is the diameter of the space of
n-dimensional lattices, how do the short vectors in a typical n-dimensional
lattice behave, and why does the LLL lattice reduction algorithm behave so well?
A basic tool will be the analysis of automorphic forms on GL(n) for large n, and
the PI will also study related questions about automorphic forms in the high-
dimensional limit.
