Dr. David A. Vanden Bout has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Vanden Bout received his doctoral degree from the
University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of Professor Mark Berg. Dr.
Vanden Bout will continue research at the University of Minnesota under the
sponsorship of Professor Paul Barbara. His postdoctoral research will target the
study of energy transport in dye aggregates using near-field scanning optical
microspectroscopy (NSOM). Experiments will combine nanometer spatial resolution
with femtosecond time resolution. New techniques to be developed for the NSOM
apparatus include spatial/spectral holeburning, time-resolved lifetime
measurements, spatially resolved pump-probe spectroscopies, and temperature
dependant studies. Such forefront spectroscopic techniques advance our
understanding of the electronic and optical properties of novel materials. The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
