This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) award supports collection of
qualitative and quantitative data for recently displaced Afghan and Ukrainian
refugees relocated to host communities in the United States. Through a rarely
used pathway known as humanitarian parole, the US is responding to urgent needs
of displaced Afghan and Ukrainian refugees by providing an expedited means for
secure, legal migration through non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
community partners. As such, this pathway provides an ephemeral window of
opportunity for obtaining refugee and community preference and outcomes data,
which previously was nonexistent or was collected in a nonsystematic, ad hoc
manner. These new data will serve to inform future research such as the
investigation of matching systems that use refugee preferences and host
community priorities to effectively guide decision making and derive better
outcomes with limited resources. This project benefits the national interests of
prosperity and health by empowering future matching systems to incorporate
refugee and community preferences and outcome data to support the social
connections and eventual community integration of refugees
served.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project advances the state of knowledge of
both pre- and post-arrival refugee data, informing critical understanding of
refugee preferences and outcomes to improve matching decision-making involving
three key actors with complementary interests and capacities: refugees, host
communities, and nonprofit stakeholders. Robust qualitative and quantitative
data will be collected through a series of focus groups, semi-structured
interviews, and content analysis of existing artifacts. This research provides a
foundation for future systems, such as dynamic interfaces for data collection
shared between resettlement staff and community stakeholders (like neighborhood
support teams), as well as matching recommendation systems to improve what are
presently fragmented and disconnected processes. The results of this study
promise more informed and data-driven decision making, more fitting matching
recommendations, and increased belonging and thriving for refugees and
communities. Future research will seek to design matching systems that are
anticipative of refugee needs and preferences in a manner that aligns with the
resources of communities, so as to alleviate the trauma and uncertainty that
such immigrants face due to a lack of awareness of needs and
resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
