Near the equator, in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, a complex patterns of
eastward and westward currents alternate with latitude and in the vertical. This
complex pattern of currents has not been well-described by theory or numerical
models in the past. In this proposal, existing observations will be reanalyzed
to test new theoretical ideas and to compare with high resolution general
circulation models. The ultimate goals of this project are to understand the
dynamics of this circulation, to understand its role in the global ocean
circulation and to model the circulation and its variability.
