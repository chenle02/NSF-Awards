Multiscale problems are ubiquitous in engineering and physics. This kind of
problem involves phenomena that occur across a variety of time and length
scales, which may vary in orders of magnitude. To prevent inaccurate solutions,
traditional approximation methods need extremely refined meshes to resolve all
the scales, which places huge demands on memory and computation time and thus
limits the applications. In this project, we construct new multiscale methods to
efficiently and accurately solve two model equations that are broadly used in
studies of detonation, combustion and turbulence involving reactions, and
nanoscale semiconductor devices. The proposed research will develop new
multiscale methods to meet with the increasing demand for computational
resources in multiscale problems. Reliable and efficient multiscale methods will
further help predict physical phenomena in realistic applications.

Specifically, this project focuses on multiscale methods for reactive flow
equations and the Schrodinger equation. In high-speed reacting flows with
multispecies and multireactions, incorrect propagation of discontinuities may
occur in underresolved mesh regions. Our approach is to combine a high order
shock-capturing scheme such as WENO for the convection part with Harten's
subcell resolution for the reaction part. The subcell treatment utilizes the
flow information and is able to control the dissipation of shock-capturing
schemes to avoid the spurious solutions due to the underresolved mesh. The goal
is to capture the correct locations of shocks and discontinuities in high-speed
reacting flows with coarse meshes in both time and space. In simulations of
electron transport modeled by the Schrodinger-Poisson system, the computational
cost is huge due to the high frequency oscillations of the solution. The idea is
to incorporate some known structures of the solution into the base functions of
Discontinuous Galerkin methods. This can be accomplished by building local
solution spaces based on the semiclassical approximation WKB asymptotic, which
has certain multiscale structures of the solution. We aim to construct an
inexpensive and reliable solver for Schrodinger-Poisson system to simulate
quantum transport of electrons in nanoscale semiconductors.
