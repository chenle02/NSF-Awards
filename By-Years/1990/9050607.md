The college is developing a course in molecular biology to provide women
students with a modern, rigorous, and integrated biology curriculum.
Laboratories are designed to develop critical thinking and data analysis skills
which directly involve students in state-of-the- art molecular methods. The
department is purchasing an ultracentrifuge, high speed centrifuge and rotors,
microfuges, DNA sequencing equipment, gel blotting units, slab gel dryer, and
hybridization apparatus. This makes possible the isolation and characterization
of macromolecules, cloning and sequencing of DNA fragments, and nucleic acid and
protein blotting. These techniques are being incorporated into project- oriented
laboratories in the new Molecular Biology course. Fundamental knowledge and
skills on protein and nucleic acid analysis which students have acquired in
their core courses are being applied and enhanced through molecular biology
projects which emphasize isolation and characterization of functional domains of
DNA and proteins. The college is contributing 104% of the award for this
project.
