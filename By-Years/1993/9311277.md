9311277 Elgamal The objective of this research is to fabricate a hydraulically
consolidation unit to permit consolidation of centrifuge models. Transducers and
electronics for monitoring and controlling the consolidation process will be
acquired. A special vacuum-slurry mixer and high capacity vacuum pump will be
purchased for mixing clay slurry under vacuum. A new strongbox will be
fabricated for modeling of phenomena in deep soil layers. A sand rainer for
accurate and repeatable deposition of granular media will be acquired, and a
high capacity dust collector will be purchased. ***
