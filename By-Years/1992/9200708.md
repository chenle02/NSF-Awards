This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the field
of chemistry. For a three-year period beginning in 1992, eight undergraduate
students will spend ten weeks each summer engaged in basic research under the
direction of the faculty members in the Chemistry Department. A comprehensive
program of academic research and social experiences has been planned. The
participants will work closely with a specific faculty mentor and research group
in a chemical subdiscipline of their choice. They will participate in a seminar
series given by academic and industrial speakers and designed specifically for
them. They will present their results in informal group and divisional meetings,
and in a Program-ending Departmental Poster Session.
