The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is improved safety of lithium (Li) ion
batteries (LIBs) for power intensive applications ranging from lawnmowers to
aircraft. The nature of chemicals used in LIB construction, combined with the
large amount of stored energy, makes the batteries vulnerable to various failure
modes including thermal runaway and fire. LIB fires have captured the headlines
several times in recent years including ~25,000 fire incidents in more than 400
consumer products between 2012 and 2017. Current battery safety mechanisms
contribute to 5 â€“ 10% of the overall battery cost but are ineffective as
evidenced by the continued occurrence of LIB fires. Improved safety with the
proposed technology may save lives and property and help the industry migrate
towards less expensive and more energy dense batteries.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop and
demonstrate a cell- and chemistry-agnostic device to prevent thermal runaway in
Li ion cells and batteries. By preventing thermal runaway, this technology may
improve the safety of LIBs, protecting nearby lives and property. The Phase I
research has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed
innovation in individual cylindrical cells of various sizes and chemistries
subjected to a specific type of abuse. The Phase II technical effort shall
expand the research to cover additional cell chemistries, sizes, formats, and
abuses, integrating the proposed technology into a commercial battery pack and
performing tests to demonstrate that this safety technology helps battery
systems meet regulatory standards (such as UL 9540A for BESS battery
systems).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
