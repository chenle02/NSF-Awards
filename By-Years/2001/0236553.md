0236553&lt;br/&gt;Wannamaker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continued support for the
infrastructure, management and operations of the Electromagnetic Studies of the
Continents (EMSOC) national instrument facility will be provided though this
grant. This facility provides a pool of magnetotelluric (MT) instruments to
support NSF-funded research. The MT measurements provide estimates of the
electrical conductivity of the Earth, a property that is sensitive to the
presence and interconnectedness of geothermal fluids, molten rock, metallic ore
minerals, and graphite. &lt;br/&gt;MT data offers a unique an important
additional basis for understanding continental history, magma genesis and rock
failure. Currently, the Universities of Washington, Utah, California at
Riverside and San Diego, Wisconsin at Madison, the Colorado School of Mines, San
Diego State University, Arizona State University, and Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution are members of the EMSOC Consortium. Membership is open to U.S.
institutions, and the instruments are available to all academic and government
users. See vortex.ucr.edu/emsoc/index.html for more
details.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
