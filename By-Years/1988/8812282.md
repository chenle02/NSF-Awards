Title: Spectroscopy and Collision Dynamics of Highly Vibrationally Excited
Polyatomic Molecules This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) planning grant
to examine a new technique to probe the collision dynamics of highly
vibrationally excited polyatomic molecules. This will be done by combining
vibrational excitation knowledge with time resolved spectroscopic methods. The
study of other reactions between radiation and matter may result. The planning
period will allow the identification of appropriate experimental techniques and
instrumentation needs that will enable the proposer to establish a spectroscopy
laboratory. This grant will provide support for a well-trained minority chemist
to prepare a competitive proposal for submittal to the MRI research initiation
component.
