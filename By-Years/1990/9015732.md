A research program will be conducted to investigate the chemical mechanism for
NO removal in combustion products by cyanuric acid. Information about the
kinetic parameters and products of several critical gas-phase reactions, viz NCO
+ NO, O2 and O, will be obtained in a series of shock tube experiments using
laser-based diagnostics. The kinetic data in the temperature range of 2000 to
3000 K will be incorporated into a detailed chemical model which can be used to
investigate ways to improve process performance. The injection of crystalline
cyanuric acid particles into hot combustion products to initiate a reaction
sequence which can remove in excess of 80% of the NO in the exhaust is currently
under development for application to stationary combustion sources. It appears
to be an economically attractive alternative to current exhaust gas treatment
methods such as selective catalytic reduction, thermal de-NOx, and urea
injection.
