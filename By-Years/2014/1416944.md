The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the introduction of
new generation energy storage devices that are mechanically strong, highly
flexible, and high energy density. The proposed novel flexible cathode electrode
technology holds the key to commercialize high performance flexible batteries.
If successful, the proposed research program will generate critical knowledge
for fabricating a high-energy and high-power cathode for flexible energy storage
device. It is anticipated that the proposed cathode electrode materials may
improve the energy density of current state-of-the-art flexible battery at least
by a factor of 5. The significant enhancement in energy density and power
density makes the proposed technology attractive to new markets where flexible
batteries hav not been widely used. Additionally, the proposed technique and
concept may be used for manufacturing other multifunctional materials for a wide
range of different applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research Phase I project aims at the development of novel flexible
cathode materials for flexible electronics. Mechanical strength of flexible
electrodes is the most critical property. Traditional approach to achieve
mechanically strong electrodes is to deposit active materials on a flexible
carbon-based substrate, while the performance of resulting electrodes strongly
are affected by the active material/substrate interface, which is often hard to
fabricate and control. The key innovation of the proposed research is a core-
shell nano-architecture, in which a thin carbon layer is uniformly coated on the
cathode nanofibers through an in-situ formation process. The core-shell nano-
architecture design allows us to achieve enhanced mechanical strength,
structural integrity, and electronic conductivity simultaneously. In the
meantime, the employment of high voltage, high capacity cathode nanofibers as
the core will ensure the high power and energy densities of resulting cathode
electrodes.
