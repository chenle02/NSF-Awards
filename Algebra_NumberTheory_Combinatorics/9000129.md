This project is concerned with the relationship between the torsion product and
various classes of abelian p-groups. Let C be a class of abelian groups such as
the class of all totally projective abelian p-groups and let A,B be abelian
groups in C. The principal investigator will describe Tor(A,B); determine if
Tor(A,B) is in C; and characterize C using the torsion product. This project is
in the general area of abelian group theory. Finite abelian groups have been
completely classified but the classification of infinite abelian groups remains
elusive. This research will contribute to the knowlege of infinite abelian
groups by studying the interplay between set theory and abelian groups.
