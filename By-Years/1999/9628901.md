This fellowship supports research and training in the area of developmental
biology. Zebra fish will be used as a model system to study early development of
the vertebrate heart. A mutant zebra fish which develops two hearts will be
studied to determine how many genes are involved and if they regulate cell
migration and/or adhesion. Using a variety of techniques of molecular biology,
attempts will be made to identify the genes involved in heart organogenesis.
