This research will focus on uncharged particles by means of their aerodynamic
interaction with a moving suspending gas in flow through a subsonic nozzle. Some
analytical progress has been made and experiments are proposed to measure the
size of the focal region in order to assess the validity of the theory. If
successful, the process will permit writing submicron features directly on
electronic circuits. Also, the ability to concentrate particles of a given size
by over four orders of magnitude could lead to a new generation of aerosol
analytical instruments.
