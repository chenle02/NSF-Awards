Professor Daniel Higgins of Kansas State University is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Solid State Chemistry Program
to develop amphiphilic, ionic, surface-active di-imides to be used along with
common polyelectrolytes in the preparation of composite photoactive thin films.
The experiments involve near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) for
resolution of the typically 50-100 nm aggregates. Multiphoton-excited
fluorescence anisotropy measurements (MPEFM) are used to study chromophore
organization. Dynamical versions of these two experiments provide information
about the rates of charge carrier generation and migration. Film morphology and
other data about the bulk materials are studied using small-angle X-ray
scattering and atomic force microscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The films may
ultimately be useful in organic photoconductors and photovoltaics. Further
development of this class of materials promises to make available display and
energy technologies, for example solar cells, that are flexible, moldable and
self-healing.&lt;br/&gt;
