Dr. Kosso is concerned in this project with the structure of archaeological
knowledge. He is focusing specifically on the role of observation in archaeology
and on the status of observation as objective evidence for claims made about the
past. The demonstration by philosophers of science that observations are theory-
dependent is as relevant to archaeological observations as it is to the natural
sciences, and understanding the empirical basis of any science requires
addressing the problem of theory-influenced observation. Dr. Kosso's most recent
work has shown that we can concede to a certain amount of theory-dependence in
observation without sacrificing the objectivity of the observational evidence if
we insist that the theories which influence an observation are independent from
the theory for which the observation is evidence. This concept of independence
as a standard of empirical evidence has been successfully applied to examples in
the natural sciences. Dr. Kosso is now applying the same methodological
apparatus to analyze observational evidence in archaeology. This analysis is
potentially of significance to archaeologists with a concern for empirical
foundations of their science as well as to philosophers interested in the
structure of scientific knowledge.
