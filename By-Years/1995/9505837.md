9505837 WYSS This research is to measure the direction of polarization of the
S-waves from local earthquakes recorded by most of the 12 three- component
seismograph station in the Alaska network. Emphasis will be placed on those
stations where preferred mineral orientation is not likely to be responsible for
the anisotropy. The derived stress directions will be compared to those
estimated in previously funded NSF work based on inversion of fault-plane
solutions. It is important to estimate stress directions from S-polarizations,
where this can be done, because there is not enough information available
concerning stress directions to understand the seismic hazard in central and
southern Alaska. All stress direction estimates (from fault-plane solutions,
volcanic dikes, hydrofracture and anisotropy) will be integrated to construct a
seismotectonic model for central and southern Alaska. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
