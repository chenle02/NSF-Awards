The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide the basis for advancing magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) hardware solutions for ultra-fast image acquisition. The
proposed effort will target clinical MRI scanners where there is limited MRI
access by a large patient population. Long scan times reduce the efficiency of
radiology department processes and increase the overall cost to clinics and
patients. A successful solution which decreases scan times by half will provide
improved patient access and care, especially with regard to measuring metabolic
activities, brain activity, and cognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop high resolution MRI
as a powerful tool for understanding metabolic activity in humans and animals.
High dielectric constant (HDC) materials provide a low impedance pathway between
the patient and magnetic coil of the MRI. The goal of this project is to
increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the MRI by over 50%, thereby cutting the
scan time by half. The HDC materials will have an immediate impact on animal and
human behavior studies where neuroscientists are using MRI techniques to monitor
brain activity and cognition. An integrated development approach includes
electromagnetic simulation, ceramic processing, and phantom testing. A working
prototype will be tested in clinical MRI scanners thus creating an innovative
ecosystem comprised of original equipment manufacturers, hospitals, and
researchers with clinical experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
