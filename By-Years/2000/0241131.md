Berloff&lt;br/&gt;0241131&lt;br/&gt;Transport and mixing in the ocean will be
studied using a sequence of models. Initially, a quasi-geostrophic model will be
used to produce 'true' velocity fields. The resultant turbulent velocities will
be used to transport Lagrangian particles throughout the domain. The results
will be compared to modeled dispersion using a sequence of Markov models (orders
0, 1, 2, and 3). These allow for diffusive, ballistic, sub and super diffusive
behavior. These studies will also be used to understand the phenomenological
behavior of the models. Results of the stochastic models will be compared with
observed float characteristics from different regions of the ocean. More
realistic, primitive equation models will also be investigated. Effects of low-
frequency variability in flow structure, wind-forcing variability, eddy-induced
flows, three-dimensional flows, and sources will be investigated. Two other
questions of interest are the impact of rough topography and the impact of non-
Gaussian forcing in the Markovian models. Incorporation of stochastic terms in
the Eulerian partial differential equations, to simulate the role of the Markov
models, is contemplated towards the end of the project.&lt;br/&gt;
