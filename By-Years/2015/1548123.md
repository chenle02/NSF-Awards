This project engages research teams in the US, Spain, Germany and France to
develop tools for the design of microorganisms to perform valuable functions
including cost-effective synthesis of important chemicals or capabilities for
the decontamination of toxic waste. The investigators will develop a predictive
mathematical model of a bacterial cell that will guide the design and genetic
manipulation that will allow the development of a minimal organism that is
optimized to perform specific functions or behaviors. This project will provide
interdisciplinary research training for postdoctoral scholars, support a summer
course that will provide twenty-five graduate students training in computational
systems biology, and includes activities that will disseminate the most advanced
computational and experimental bioengineering methods.

This project addresses key challenges for synthetic biology, such as the limited
capabilities to design, synthesize, and fully understand whole genomes. Bacteria
with minimal uncharacterized components, such as Mycoplasma pneumonia, are ideal
for this purpose. Data derived from detailed experimental characterization of
the organism will be used to create predictive models that will guide the design
and development of a streamlined version of the progenitor strain. This
collaborative project combines expertise in genomic profiling, whole-cell
modeling, and genome engineering to rationally construct an optimized cellular
chassis to specification.

This project is the US collaborative component of a project funded through the
ERASynBIO EU-US transnational funding mechanism.
