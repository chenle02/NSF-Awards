Eremenko DMS-9500636 Eremenko will continue his study of distribution of values
of meromorphic functions and meromorphic curves, using the new methods of
potential theory, developed in his previous work. He will concentrate on the
following topics: Picard theorems for differential polynomials, extremal cases
in the defect relations, and the value distribution for holomorphic curves of
finite order. Classical function theory has introduced geometric techniques
which have proved to have far wider applicability than first imagined. The
subject exploits the interplay between geometric interpretation with powerful
analytic techniques to yield some of the most complete mathematical results in
the field of analysis.
