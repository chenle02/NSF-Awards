This Engineering Research Equipment Grant is for the procurement of a Particle
Size Distribution Analyzer. It will be utilized in, and enhance the capability
of, a research program on the transport of fine sediments. The device will be
used immediately in ongoing studies of turbidity currents and reservoir
sedimentation. Later use will be made in the measurements of suspended sediments
in rivers. and another possible use is in cavitation studies through the study
of cavitation nuceii.
