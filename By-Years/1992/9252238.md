An integrated three-course sequence of introductory college mathematics is
being developed. Areas of mathematics encompassed include: algebra,
trigonometry, differential and integral calculus, sequences and recurrence
relations, probability and statistics, and logic. A laboratory including
personal computers equipped with advanced mathematical software with graphics
(including animation), symbolic manipulation, word processing, and user-friendly
programming capabilities is being developed.Changes in delivery include
cooperative learning in small groups and an emphasis on student exploration,
including open-ended assignments frequently involving applications. Writing is
being stressed, and evaluation of it will be part of feedback through regular
collection and review of homework.
