Wesleyan University will continue a five-week, multidisciplinary, residential
Young Scholars project in Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Earth Science,
Mathematics and Computer Science for 60 students entering grades 9,10. The
program stresses "hands-on" science and mathematics experiences, group learning
and research, and career exploration and academic guidance. Students study with
Wesleyan University senior faculty, master high school teachers, and role model
university undergraduates. The program continues to enjoy the support of the
state's department of education, the Connecticut Pre-Engineering Program (CPEP),
and the private sector.
