9353093 Friedlander Dr. Friedlander's recent research involves the study of
certain problems related to the equation of hydrodynamics (the Euler equations
and the Navier-Strokes equations) and to the extended system of the equations of
magnetohydrodynamics. The mathematics employed includes techniques from partial
differential equations, asymptotic methods and dynamical systems. The problems
studied are motivated by questions that arise in geophysical and astrophysical
fluid dynamics. This research project will involve joint work with M.M. Vishik.
Dr. Friedlander will continue her investigation of several facets of these
problems. The research is described under four headings: (I) The "fast" dynamo
problem; (II) Instability criteria for the Euler equations; (III) The existence
of a complete system of Floquet root vectors in time periodic of fluid dynamics;
(IV) Magnetohydrodynamic stability. Interactive activities at the host
institution include: (1) teaching a graduate course on mathematical topics in
fluid dynamics; (2) mentoring and counseling women students and postdocs in the
mathematical sciences; and (3) organizing a two-day workshop of colloquium style
lectures given by distinguished women mathematicians. This project furthers VPW
program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance
their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF
and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by
providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in
industry, government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the
participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's
future significantly. ***
