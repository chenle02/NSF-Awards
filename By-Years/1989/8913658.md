The researchers aim to investigate a large class of single- server multiple-
queueing system. By introducing a very general Markovian structure for the
behavior of the single server, a queue length/server activity marked point
process that is a Markov renewal process is obtained. The researchers intend to
exploit the nice properties of this process to generalize known results for
single-server multiple-queue systems to variants of systems such as those with
finite-capacity queues, non-Poisson arrival processes, customer routing, and
non-cyclic server routing.
