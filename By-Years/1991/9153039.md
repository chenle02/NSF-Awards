The Digital Systems Design Laboratory is a project oriented course that
introduces combinational, synchronous sequential and asynchronous sequential
circuit design to majors in the Electronics and Computer Engineering Technology
programs at the University of Arkansas Little Rock. In these projects, the
students are required to minimize boolean functions and verify their design by
hard-wiring the circuit. This project upgrades the present laboratory facility
to design circuits using programmable logic devices and also allow programming
of these devices. This approach will augment the existing traditional gate and
small scale device realization of logic functions. These programmed devices are
used to test the larger design problems. Ten computer workstations with
programmable logic device software and hardware peripherals are used by the
students in the laboratory.
