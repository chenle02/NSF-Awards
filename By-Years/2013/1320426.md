In current operating systems, writes to pages that are not in core memory
require the process to block until the page can be fetched from the backing
store. This project investigates buffering the write to a temporary page in core
memory, so as to unblock the process to continue computation, and applying the
write asynchronously. Research tasks include study and experimentation with
implementation techniques for deferring out-of-core page writes, analysis of how
scheduling and other aspects of the operating system may need to be modified in
order to realize the full benefits of write deferral, and empirical studies to
assess the performance impact of write deferral on a variety of applications.

By incorporating non-blocking writes within the operating system, applications
can transparently benefit from a performance improvement, without any
modification to the application. The potential performance benefits apply to a
broad spectrum of computer systems and applications. The project promotes
transition of the technology to practice through open source distribution of
Linux operating system code implementing the innovations. Educational activities
include involvement of undergraduate students and incorporation of project
research into courses taught by the PI. Outreach includes recruitment of under-
represented minority students for participation in the project.
