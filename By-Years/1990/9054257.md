This two-week workshops is designed for engineering facultywishing to update
their mechanics programs and integrate computers into them. Week One recognizes
the centrality of mechanics to engineering by creating opportunities for
participants to receive lectures on pedagogy and new developments in engineering
science related to mechanics. It also provides attendees with up-to-date
instruction on computer programming and emphasizes the integration of computing
as a computational support tool to mechanics based courses. Lectures will be
complemented with computer application and problem-solving sessions. During Week
Two, perspectives on graduate level mechanics are introduced along with reports
on current research being conducted in mechanics-related areas. Contact will be
maintained with participants for a period after the workshops to distribute
interesting mechanics and mechanics- related computer applications and
problems.//
