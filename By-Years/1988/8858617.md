This research investigates the regulation of plant gene expression. It focuses
on two regulatory genes of maize, c1 and p1, which control the synthesis of
anthocyanin pigments in the seed and in the plant, respectively. Genetic and
recently obtained molecular data indicate that these genes are functionally
duplicate with distinct tissue specificity. Analysis of these two genes afford
the opportunity to study two very basic features of plant gene expression: 1)
How do regulatory genes coordinately govern the expression of several
biosynthetic genes in a given pathway? and 2) What is the basis for tissue-
specific expression of functionally duplicate loci?%%% The answers to these
questions will not only contribute to the specific aim of understanding the
regulation of anthocyanin synthesis, but should also apply to the long-term goal
of solving problems of potential agronomic importance. Likewise, the results of
experiments to understand specific regulatory interactions between the genes
involved in anthocyanin synthesis are likely to provide an excellent basis for
eventually unravelling the complex genetic interactions that govern quantitative
traits of plants such as the components of yield.
