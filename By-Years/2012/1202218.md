This research, generally, seeks to provide a more integrative understanding of
the spatiotemporal variability of trans-North Pacific climate through the use of
new and existing data sets of tree rings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the
researchers seek to answer the following scientific questions: 1) How has the
North Pacific atmosphere-ocean circulation varied over the past several
centuries to millennium during such events as the Medieval Climate Anomaly and
the Little Ice Age; 2) Can different paleoreconstructions of Pacific Decadal
Variability (PDV) be reconciled? 3) Is the PDV during the recent era (e.g.
1976-77 Pacific warming, regime shift) unique relative to past centuries? 4) Do
robust and preferred decadal to multidecadal oscillatory modes of PDV exist? 5)
Is the PDV basin-wide with robust linkages between the tropics and higher
northern latitudes on both sides of the North Pacific? and 6) How have internal
and external forcings impacted past North Pacific climate on multiple
timescales?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential broader impacts include
supporting an early investigator and strong and substantive scientific
collaboration with Russian colleagues including foreign exchange of students
between the U.S. and Russia.
