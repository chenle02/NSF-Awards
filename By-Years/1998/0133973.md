This research project will address the problem of information overload by
creating new document organization and presentation techniques. The approach
will generate intelligent interfaces to the scientific literature. Existing
knowledge bases will be used for the automatic generation of these interfaces.
Categorizations and analyses of the search results will be used as the basis of
an interactive interface to manage and share documents. The career development
plan will include the use of real-world problems in biomedicine to motivate
learning about information technology. It will also develop courses that promote
interdisciplinary learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
