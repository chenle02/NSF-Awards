This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
distributed traffic-management algorithms applied to overlay networks of
Semantic Routers constituting a high-speed Semantic Web. Semandex Networks is
pioneering new categories of information routers based on eXtensible Markup
Language (XML). These routers automatically know where content is and to where
to deliver it, dramatically reducing information breaks. A hierarchy of edge and
core application-layer routers interconnect for scalable, accurate, and timely
information delivery, in a manner that could not otherwise be economically or
technically realized. Traffic management in this real-time heterogeneous system
presents new challenges that cannot be solved by traditional link-based point-
to-point approaches. Specifically, the bandwidths of the underlying links are
shared with other layer-3 traffic of unknown characteristics, and outputs from
individual virtual ports are aggregated over the outgoing link or links from an
individual layer-7 router.

Commercial application for this project is that flow and management issues
needed to enhance next generations Internet structures will be tractable
therefore reducing downtimes and increasing net performance.
