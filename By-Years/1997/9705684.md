ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS 9705684 Principle Investigator: Lichter This is a
grant to support participation of invited speakers at the G. I. Taylor Symposium
to be held at Northwestern University this summer. This symposium will honor
George Batchelor who has been a central figure in fluid mechanics for the last
thirty years. Bachelor's contribution to the field as Editor in Chief of the
Journal of Fluid Mechanics is legendary. This award will provide partial support
for the travel costs of invited speakers. Among the invited speakers are five
associate editors of the Journal of Fluid Mechanics. A variety of disciplines
will be addressed including Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering,
Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics. It is hoped that interdisciplinary
collaborations will be fostered.
