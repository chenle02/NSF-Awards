DMS-9988644 ABSTRACT

Slaman proposes to study computability and mathematical definability. Slaman's
long term goal is to provide a complete understanding of the degree theoretic
structures associated with relative definability, such as the global structures
of the Turing degrees (D) and the enumeration degrees, as well as the local
ones, such as the Turing degrees of the recursively enumerable sets (R), the
degrees below 0', and the degrees represented within an arbitrary Scott set.
Fixing D as a paradigm example, Slaman proposes to investigate the scope of
first order definability within D, the automorphism group of D, and the
similarities and dissimilarities between D and proper subideals.

Slaman proposes to study computability and mathematical definability. With
quantitative mathematical analysis of these phenomena, one can answer questions
of the form ``Is there an algorithm to solve all problems of a this type?'',
``Is there a simple example with specific properties'', or ``Is there a concrete
classification of all structures with these properties?''. One can even address
questions of the sort ``Are these techniques adequate to resolve this
question?''. One must develop a theory of algorithms to show that there is no
algorithm of a certain type. Similarly, one must develop a theory of
definability to show that there is no simple example or concrete classification.
In this proposal, Slaman focuses on the Turing degrees: where one set A is above
another B if and only if there is an algorithm to compute B when given
information about A. The Turing degrees are an abstract representation of the
structure of relative computability. Slaman proposes to study this structure,
and to pay close attention to the extent that the degrees of the definable sets
play a special role within it.
