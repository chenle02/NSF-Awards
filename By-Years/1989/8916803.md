This research will make a major contribution to understanding lifetime
reproductive success in birds (LRS). An understanding of LRS is essential for
understanding how natural selection alters the nature of birds over evolutionary
time. In order to do this work it is essential to establish the precise
parentage of offspring. This will be accomplished with a technique that is also
used in human parentage determination -- DNA fingerprinting. The proposed work
will assess parentage among members of a focal population and integrate these
findings with existing calculations of LRS. This work is also of importance to
the conservation of shorebirds -- many of which are endangered or threatened.
Shorebirds are of increasing concern to conservationists for two reasons: (1)
many share common breeding habitat with waterfowl, a group for which there is
intense single-purpose management, and (2) shorebird populations are highly
vulnerable as the birds migrate to and winter in areas of the world where
shoreline habitats are undergoing explosive development. Knowledge of population
dynamics and reproductive output, therefore, is essential for the making of wise
conservation decisions.
