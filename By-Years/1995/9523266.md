9523266 Lebowitz This grant is supported by the Materials Theory Program in the
Division of Materials Research, the Mathematical Physics Activity in the Physics
Division and the Applied Mathematics Program in the Division of Mathematical
Sciences. Research will be conducted on a variety of problems in statistical
mechanics with the overall objective of contributing to the understanding of
macroscopic matter from a microscopic basis. Problems to be considered include:
properties of macroscopic systems carrying steady state currents; kinetics of
phase segregation in alloys and fluids including elastic and hydrodynamical
effects, respectively; equilibrium statistical mechanics of low temperature
phases in quantum systems; structure of energy levels in typical integrable and
chaotic systems; spatial structure of diffusion dominated reacting systems;
phase diagrams of classical multicomponent models with vacancies and elastic
effects; and, fundamental problems in the quantum description of the time
evolution of macroscopic systems. %%% This grant is supported by the Materials
Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research, the Mathematical Physics
Activity in the Physics Division and the Applied Mathematics Program in the
Division of Mathematical Sciences. Research will be done on a number of problems
in statistical mechanics which will lead to a better understanding of the
relationship between the large-scale behavior of matter, e.g., fluids, and its
underlying particulate nature, e.g., molecules. This research is fundamental,
although its outcomes should contribute to a better understanding of many
problems of practical interest. ***
