Electromagnetics has been a cornerstone for analysis and understanding of high-
speed, high-frequency switching transmission and communications for nearly a
century. The recent advances in microelectronics characterized by guided wave
connections including fiber optics combined with decreasing feature size have
introduced new electromagnetic behavior that defines new research opportunities.
At the same time new computation aids provide low cost methods of addressing
problems involved in new design support. Support is provided for planning and
conducting a workshop to facilitate a comprehensive discussion by key
researchers, both academic and industrial, in this field.
