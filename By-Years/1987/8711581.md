This research will apply the properties of the valuation module of the lattice
of finite unions of convex polytopes to the study of combinatorial problems
concerning convex sets. A vehicle for this attack will be the lattices generated
from finite subsets X of Euclidean space by taking unions and intersections of
the convex hulls of subsets of X. A wealth of such combinatorial problems
exists. Those closely related to Tverberg's theorem will be singled out, for
example a conjecture of John Reay, as being particularly suited to the methods
of our attack. This research will consider lattices of finite unions of convex
polytopes. A polytope in space is a region with flat sides. It is convex if the
segment joining any two points in the region lies in the region. Starting with a
finite set of points and joining them together and taking unions of the
resulting regions forms such a lattice and makes for an important combinatorial
and geometrical object of study. This proposal will bring to bear novel
techniques for obtaining properties of these lattices. It should bear
interesting fruit.
