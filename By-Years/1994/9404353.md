investigators who have worked on hazard mitigation projects funded by the
National Science Foundation. The principal investigators will make presentations
about their research work in progress. This workshop will provide an opportunity
to the PIs to discuss their research approach with other PIs, learn about other
on-going research projects and exchange valuable scientific information well
before its publication in Scientific literature. ***
