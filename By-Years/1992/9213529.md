This project involves the dissertation research in Africa of an anthropology
graduate student from the University of Pennsylvania. The project will study the
relation of social structure to craft organization in two pottery cooperatives
in the Ivory Coast. Using a combination of ethnographic methods including
participant observation and structured life-history interviews, the student will
examine the relationships among economic and social factors such as inheritance
and labor processes as well as the tradeoffs between subsistence and cash
activities. This research is important because cooperatives, especially craft
cooperatives, have long been promoted as a means of African development and have
been a highly visible failure. This careful case study will reveal the reasons
for differential success and failure and will serve as a resource for planners
and scholars studying the role of craft production in development.
