The compilation of an accurate and wide-ranging data base of polymer solution
properties is a critical aspect of polymer property prediction and modeling. The
equipment provided in this project will provide for the measurement of polymer-
solvent interactions over the entire range of polymer compositions. The
laboratory will include a piezoelectric crystal sorption apparatus, an inverse
gas chromatograph apparatus, and a vapor-liquid equilibrium apparatus using size
exclusion chromatography for analysis. These latter two pieces of equipment will
both be under the control of the same automated data collection and analysis
system. The establishment of an experimental laboratory in this area will have
far-reaching benefits to the industrial and scientific communities. Data from
studies of industrially-important polymers and solvents, while important in
their own right, will be used to even greater advantage in this laboratory as
the basis for property prediction and equation of state research. The
Pennsylvania State University provides significant cost sharing in the purchase
of the equipment.
