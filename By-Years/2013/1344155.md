This proposal will enable efficient access to geoscience data, developing tools
for effective use of geoscience data, providing community leadership on
geoscience cyberinfrastructure issues, and building and supporting a diverse
geoscience community. This proposal will extend the work Unidata has done,
addressing emerging issues related to ever-growing data volumes, complexity of
data-centric scientific workflows, and IT resource constraints at universities.
The Unidata Program Center will leverage the advantages of the robust cloud-
based computing environments that have emerged. It will evolve and augment
existing Unidata technologies with the goal of : Reducing the amount of data
that must be transferred over computer networks; Reducing the complexity of the
hardware and software environments university members must maintain; and
increase the flexibility of scientific investigators to conduct science and
extract knowledge from the deluge of geoscience data.
