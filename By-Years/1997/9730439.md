Webster Funding is providedto continue the operation of the Data Information
Unit (DIU) to serve the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) through it
final phase, called AIMS (Analysis, Interpretation, Modeling, and Synthesis),
until 2002. The proposed operations maintain existing procedures (on-line web-
based catalog of all available WOCE data sets, search capabilities to allow
users to find and obtain these data sets, guide to the status of data sets still
in preparation) while adding new developments and activities to meet the need of
the AIMS phase (tracking of the status and availability of new AIMS products).
The DIU serves the needs of scientists from over 30 nations.
