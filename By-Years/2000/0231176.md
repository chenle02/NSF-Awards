The problem addressed by this proposal is the disinterest in computer science
exhibited by large groups of students, especially non CS majors and women. This
is a particular problem at institutions like Georgia Tech where an introductory
computing course is required. A prototype course in Introduction to Media
Computation aimed at non CS majors will be utilized. The argument is that these
audiences are most interested in computing to manipulate data of interest to
them. A data first approach where computing in terms of creation, manipulation,
and transformation of data of interest to students is implemented in this
course. At GIT, non CS majors are often manipulating multimedia in English and
other communications classes. Literature on gender issues in computing suggests
that women seek an applications oriented focus to computer science and
assignments that lend themselves to creativity. The media computation approach
addresses these needs. The base premises for the course are: all media are
moving to a digital format; digital media are manipulated using software; and
learning to control computation, including programming, then becomes a
communications skill. The products of this project will include: A course
structure, lecture slides, and course notes in support of such a class;
technology to support such a course, including a student development
environment, media manipulation tools, and a cross-platform multimedia API
appropriate for novice programmers; and evaluation results, focusing on
retention, motivation, and learning.
