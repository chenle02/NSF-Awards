The support from this project will allow the development of a new program in
engineering education at the Ph.D. level, called the Managerial, Environmental,
International (MEI) doctoral option. The targeted Graduate Research Traineeship
area is Education and Human Resources: Innovation in Teaching and Learning. The
program will produce a new level of awareness in highly competent, technical
engineering graduates in three areas currently ignored in doctoral engineering
programs. This program will educate individuals who, in addition to having
standard levels of technical competency, also possess competency in the
management of technology, environmental responsibility, and the problems
associated with international competitiveness. This option will initially be
open to students who wish to complete the Ph.D. degree in the areas of Chemical,
Civil, Environmental, Materials, Manufacturing, and Mechanical Engineering.
Innovative structural components include: o Appropriate cross-disciplinary
course and project work in managerial and environmental areas, culminating in a
competency examination and a publication addressing an issue of managerial or
environmental importance related to the candidate's area of study in the
appropriate journals or proceedings. o A six-month industrial internship with a
participating company involving the international aspects of industrial
competition. o Co-advisement of undergraduate student projects with WPI faculty
in appropriate areas.
