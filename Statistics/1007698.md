With rapid advances of computing power and other modern technology, high-
throughput data of unprecedented size and complexity are becoming a commonplace
in diverse fields. Examples include data from genetic, microarrays, proteomics,
fMRI, cancer clinical trials and high frequency financial data. These high
dimensional data characterize many important contemporary problems in statistics
and feature selection play pivotal roles in these problems. This research
project aims to develop cutting-edge statistical theory and methods for high
dimensional variable selections. In particular, the PI proposes the following
interrelated research topics for investigation: (1) grouped-variables screening
with sparse linear models; (2) nonparametric components screening with sparse
additive models; (3) parametric components screening with sparse semiparametric
models and(4) their further extensions. The proposed methods will be studied
theoretically for their sure screening behavior and compared with some of the
existing methods empirically in terms of computational expediency, statistical
accuracy and algorithmic stability.

The outlined research project on variable selection in high dimensions tries to
tackle fundamental problems in statistical learning and will stimulate interests
from a large group of scientists and researchers in diverse fields of sciences,
engineering and humanities ranging from genomics and health sciences to
economics and finance. Another key aspect of this project is the integration of
research and education, which will be achieved by developing two new courses on
statistical learning and non-, semi-parametric inference and proposing specific
projects for students during the teaching of classes. It will enable the
participation of all citizens from various disciplines, including
underrepresented groups of students.
