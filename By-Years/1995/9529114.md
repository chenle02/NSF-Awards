9529114 Wu The objective of this project is to organize a two-day workshop in
the area of manufacturing logistics to bring together practitioners and
researchers from industry, universities, and software development firms. The
focus of the workshop is to develop a joint industry-university research agenda
in manufacturing logistics so as to bridge the gap between theory and practice
in areas such as production planning, scheduling, information and material
management, and shop floor monitoring and control. The workshop will foster
debate and discussion of pressing issues in industry, and cultivate a wide
spectrum of interactions and future collaboration between researchers,
practitioners, and software developers. The results of the workshop will be
disseminated through several published channels. A gap currently exists between
the researcher and practice of manufacturing logistics. one main reason for the
gap is the lack of communication between these three groups. A workshop which
brings people from the application, development, and research domain will foster
communication between these groups. Improved communication and the exchange of
ideas will enhance research and application of manufacturing logistics.
Reduction of the gap between theory and application will obviously be of benefit
to manufacturing in America. Both students and faculty alike will benefit from
such collaboration by building models that more truly reflect logistics problems
as experienced by industry.
