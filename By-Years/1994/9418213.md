9418213 Schwartz This award provides one-half the funding required for the
acquisition of equipment to upgrade the computing capabilities in the Institute
of Tectonics at the University of California-Santa Cruz. The institution is
committed to providing the remaining funds needed to acquire the equipment. The
equipment upgrade will be used primarily by the earthquake seismology research
group of the Institute of Tectonics, currently consisting of three professors,
three research scientists, five postdoctoral fellows, and nine graduate
students. The research program in seismology at UC-Santa Cruz encompasses both
studies in Earth structure and studies of earthquakes and other sources of
seismic waves such as underground nuclear explosions. The research of the group
includes processing of very large data sets and executing computer codes with
large memory requirements. ***
