Abstract OIA-0226068

The objectives of the workshop are to: brief G-8 representatives on the roles,
methodologies, and impacts of research assessment activities in the United
States; compare and contrast U.S. and other G-8 approaches to research
assessment; develop best-practices in research assessment; identify major
unresolved research and implementation issues; and contribute to the development
of collaborative policy and research networks in research assessment activities
among G-8 members.

Assuming these objectives are realized, all US agencies that conduct or support
research will benefit from the development and dissemination of best practices
in research assessment and the identification of major unresolved issues. The
research community will also benefit from the dissemination of information on
comparative methodologies for research assessment.
