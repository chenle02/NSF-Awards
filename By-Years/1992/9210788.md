There are two primary goals of the research proposed in this planning grant: 1)
to investigate the reliability of the sister group relationship between the
bumble bees and stingless bees (two tribes of the family Apidae) inferred from a
recent parsimony analysis of mitochondrial rRNA sequences; and 2) to provide the
phylogenetic foundation for developing a long term research program focusing on
the evolution of social traits within the primitively eusocial apid tribe
Bombini (bumble bees) by constructing a phylogeny of the species within the
behaviorally diverse bumble bee subgenus Fervidobombus. The results of this
nested phylogenetic investigation will provide knowledge of the appropriate
outgroup to the bumble bees, a necessity for understanding relationships within
the bumble bees. Resolution of the relationships within Fervidobombus will
provide the foundation for understanding many of the behavioral transitions from
relatively simple to more complex social behavior that have occurred within the
subgenus. Ultimately, this interdisciplinary approach, which integrates
systematics and animal behavior by using phylogenies to test hypotheses of
behavioral transformation, will increase understanding and collaboration between
these two important disciplines of evolutionary biology. The study will also
increase understanding of the biology of an important group of insect
pollinators of wild and crop plants. //
