The Chedd-Angier Production Company requests a planning grant to develop a
popular new television series together with integrated outreach and online
components. The series, "Science Out There" (working title), will feature the
work of field scientists as it happens and where it happens, anywhere in the
world. The target audience for the series is the young, adventure-seeking adult.
The work of the development phase of the project includes refining the creative
approaches to the series; producing a ten-minute demonstration tape; developing
a list of suitable research projects for the series; developing a business
strategy and conducting formative evaluation of the pilot. An advisory group and
Connecticut Public Television will support the planning work. Multimedia
Research will conduct the evaluation.
