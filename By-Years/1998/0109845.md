This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
micromachined fluid handling components as part of a new technology platform for
high throughput protein crystallization and the collection of single crystal
x-ray diffraction data. As increasing effort is directed toward proteomics and
high throughput protein structure determination, the data derived from the
determination of 3-D protein structures will have enormous impact in such areas
as protein engineering, recombinant DNA technology and gene therapy. This
project proffers a simple design for an inexpensive device, a Microfluidic
Protein Crystallization Chip (MPCC), that possesses a high-density array of
vessels, each with fluid inlets and vents, and a design for simple on-chip two-
way valves. Methods are proposed to rapidly prototype new designs with design
modifications made on the order of a day. The MPCC will be able to dose
solutions appropriate to run commercial screening matrices. Since the device
will be on the order of 1 mm thick, x-ray data will be collected by simply
placing the crystal-containing MPCC device directly into the x-ray beam, thereby
abrogating the expensive labor and equipment intensive exercise of isolating
several micron sized crystals from 20-100 nL of mother liquid.

The commercial applications of this project will be in the Structural Genomics
market.
