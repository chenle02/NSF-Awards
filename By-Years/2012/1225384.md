This project will improve the scalability of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods
to better exploit modern cyberinfrastructure (CI) in finding very accurate
energies of chemical and material systems. The research will include a
collaborative effort across multiple disciplines to develop a linear scaling QMC
algorithm suitable for parallelization at the petascale. This new QMC method
will allow complex materials systems to be characterized theoretically with a
high degree of accuracy. Presently, density functional theory (DFT) is used for
large scale material modeling despite problems caused by electron self-energy
interactions and the failure to describe long-range dispersion; however, modern
CI has recently made QMC calculations of real materials tractable. The proposed
research will exploit the use of localized basis functions and orbitals in order
to reduce the computational cost of QMC calculations and to apply QMC to larger
molecular and materials systems.

The project will also integrate education, career development, and research.
Through a combination of curriculum development and outreach, the integration of
computational chemistry into chemistry curricula will be promoted. The outreach
program partners with the PSC in order to promote the participation of
underrepresented groups in the computational sciences. The plan develops a broad
educational infrastructure in computational science that is suited to students
ranging from K-12 through advanced undergraduates. By extending the
applicability of QMC, computational scientists will be able to use CI in order
to design new solar cells and other alternative energy materials, model the
behavior of molecules adsorbing at interfaces, and study highly-correlated
semiconductors. The algorithms will be included in a freely available QMC code,
CASINO, in order to promote their usage.
