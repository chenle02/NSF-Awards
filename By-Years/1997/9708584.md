This joint award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities under the Grant
Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) activity supports
research in the laboratory of Professor Holden Thorp at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. The work is to develop a new bioanalytical method of
detecting base flipping by proteins that bind DNA and RNA. Initial studies will
be done with proteins known to turn bases out of the nucleic acid, which leaves
their complementary base `orphaned` and so extruded from the nucleic acid
thereby exposing it to oxidation by photochemically excited (Pt2(pop)4)4- or by
(Ru(bpy)3)3+, which is generated electrochemically. The method is specific to
guanine (G) residues, which upon oxidation yields 8-O-G. In the presence of
piperidine, the 8-O-G site is cleaved, so that nucleic acid sequencing reveals
the site of base (cytosine) flipping. M.HhaI is now under study, which turns C
into the protein for methylation. The GOALI collaboration involves New England
Biolabs (NEB) in Cambridge MA, which is a primary supplier for restriction
enzymes for molecular biology. One or more students from UNC would be hosted at
NEB to clone and overexpress enzymes of interest and to transfer this expertise
back to UNC. Gel assay results would be transferred to NEB. If successful, the
GOALI interaction could provide an important new reagent for the study of
proteins that process nucleic acids through base flipping. This research funded
under the GOALI activity explores the use of two new DNA cleaving agents as
indicators of base flipping by several important DNA binding proteins.
