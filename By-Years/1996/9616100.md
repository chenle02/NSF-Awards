Bradley 9616100 Recent theories suggest that development of the control of
movement emerges from the interactions of multiple developing systems under
genetic control with environment- based experiences. This project uses
synchronized video recording of movements and electromyographic recording of
muscle activity to measure body movements at four different ages of embryonic
development, and investigates the transformations that occur over this period of
development. The studies also investigate whether mechanically imposed changes
in the embryo's environment affect the development of the nervous system's
control of movement. These studies are important in that the findings provide
quantitative information as to whether movement experiences during embryonic
development contribute to the developmental refinement of normal motor behavior.
The results provide the basis for investigating whether movement experiences
during embryonic development play a significant role in the acquisition of
complex, adaptive skills and whether atypical movement experiences during
embryonic development lead to persistent atypical motor behaviors.
