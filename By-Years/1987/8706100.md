Calculations of the photoionization cross section and photoelectron angular
distributions for excited states of atoms and ions will be performed over a
broad range of photon energy, quantum numbers n and l, nuclear charge Z, and
stages of ionization based on Hartree-Slater wave functions. The study will
focus on understanding the systematics of the variation of the cross section and
angular distribution over the periodic system with particular emphasis on the
multiple zeros and cases amenable to laboratory investigation. As dictated by
the results of the survey, as well as the interests of experimenters, certain
cases will be selected for more accurate Hartree-Fock calculations.
