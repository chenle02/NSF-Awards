It is proposed to study the dynamical processes in atomic transitions dominated
by strong multi-electron interactions. The intent is to develop physically
realistic and computationally manageable theoretical procedures which can be
applied to studies of more complex atomic transitions. Emphasis will be given to
processes dominated by doubly excited states, both below and above the
ionization threshold of quasi-two-electron atoms (two actively interacting
electrons outside an easily pularizable cone). Applications will be made to
single and multi-step transitions in alkaline earth and other quasi-two-electron
atoms.
