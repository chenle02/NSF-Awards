This work is directed at reducing the cost of biological production of
perdeuterated chemical feedstock to increase the availability of deuterated
lubricants (hydrogen is replaced by deuterium) for commercial use. Preliminary
studies have confirmed the technological feasibility of using a biotechnological
strategy that involves the growth of oil producing algae in deuterium oxide
(heavy water), thereby, utilizing the biochemical pathways of the organism to
synthesize the perdeuterated oils. Perdeuterated lubricants exhibit an increased
stability over the equivalent hydrocarbons under high temperature and oxidizing
conditions due to the increased carbon-deuterium bond strength. This results in
a five to ten fold increase in performance lifetime. Upon completion of Phase II
(yield improvement), it is hoped to have a photobioreactor operating
continuously with minimal D20 losses, and production data which will allow
assessment of the commercial potential of the biodeuteration approach.
