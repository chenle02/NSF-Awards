Stacey 96-00053 The International Symposium on Molecular Plant-Microbe
Interactions will convene for the eighth time in 1996. The meeting will be held
in Knoxville, Tennessee from July 14-19, 1996. The Symposium is being held under
the auspices of the International Society if Molecular Plant-Microbe
Interactions (ISMPMI). The faculty of the Center for Legume Research at the
University of Tennessee is serving as the local organizing committee. A program
is being developed in conjunction with the officers and board of the ISMPMI, as
well as a distinguished International Advisory Board. This symposium held on a
biennial basis is generally considered the premier meeting in which to present
research results pertaining to the molecular biology of plant-microbe
interactions. Funds are requested to offset speaker costs and to provide
fellowship money for graduate students, scientists from developing countries,
and faculty and students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
