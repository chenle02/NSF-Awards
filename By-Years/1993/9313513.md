Zakin This award will help support the renovation of about 3000 square feet of
laboratory space in the Chemical Engineering building at Ohio State University.
This laboratory space is used for research and research training in the areas of
biochemical/bioprocess engineering. The labs were originally build 34 years ago
for classical wet chemistry and process research and teaching purposes. None of
this space is now suitable for current needs required for modern
biotechnological and bioprocessing research. Research that will be pursued in
the renovated lab spaces will include: 1) production of value-added products
from agricultural wastes or byproducts; 2) novel bioreactors for microbial
fermentations and cell cultures; 3) ultra filtration of protein and
polysaccharides; 4) biodegradation and bioremediation; and 5) magnetically
facilitated cell separation of cells of biotechnological interest. This
renovation project will greatly enhance the biotechnological research being done
on this campus and make possible better training of the students that are being
attracted into these important areas of research.
