The tepuis of South America are unique flat-topped mountains rising 3000m above
the Guiana Shield. Many researchers believe the enormous species endemism found
in tepuis is a result of millions of years of isolation atop summits. However,
it is likely that the story is much more complex, involving recent dispersals
and responses to climatic shifts. This project will investigate the role of
isolated tepuis on diversification using two main approaches: (A) estimations of
when species within a highland-restricted frog group diverged, to determine if
they have been isolated atop summits since tepui formation (about 70 mya) or
dispersed more recently; (B) estimation of population connectivity among three
tepui summits, to determine the effect of tepui landscape on genetic parameters
of two summit endemic species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because tepuis are some of
the most drastic landscape features on earth, this study is a significant
contribution to understanding the effects that drastic landscapes such as sky
islands have on population connectivity, and thus on impacting levels of
biodiversity. Additionally, this research will build partnerships with
international scientists and train students in phylogenetics, population
genetics, and biodiversity research.
