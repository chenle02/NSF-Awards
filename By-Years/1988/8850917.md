The purpose of Hillsborough County's Teacher Enhancement Project is to prepare
one teacher in each of the system's elementary schools to become a lead teacher
for elementary science instruction. These lead teachers will receive
approximately two hundred hours of instruction in science, science teaching
methodology, cognitive psychology as it pertains to elementary science,
cooperative learning, peer coaching, and leadership strategies. They will then
become responsible for the support of the system's nationally recognized hands-
on inquiry based elementary science program. One teacher per grade level will
also receive some instruction in science content and methodology so that they
can be part of network support for improved science teaching. It is hoped that
the success of this model will result in the dispersal of new knowledge and
teaching techniques throughout the entire Hillsborough County School System. In
addition, the Lead Teacher at each school will become the recognized resource
person for science and will continue to act in this capacity long after the NSF
project period has ended. The cost sharing for the project will be eighty-nine
percent of the National Science Foundation portion.
