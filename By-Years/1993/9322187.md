Proposal #: 93-22187 The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the R/V ENDEAVOR, a 177 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated
by the University. Instrumentation requested includes water sampling bottles, a
fluorometer, a rosette system, a thermosalinograph, and a digital bathymetry
system. The instrumentation is required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard
the ENDEAVOR during 1994 and will enhance the scientific capability of the
vessel in the future.
