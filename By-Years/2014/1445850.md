The Antarctic &amp; Arctic Data Consortium (a2dc) was established in spring 2013
as a grass-roots initiative to help improve the visibility of data resources for
the polar geoscience community through a modest joint marketing effort at
national meetings and on the web. Out of this self-organizing effort came the
recognition that while each data facility serves a different segment of the
polar community, improved coordination and better integration of our data
resources would significantly benefit the broad and multi-disciplinary community
engaged in polar science. Up to date, there has been little interaction or
coordination between polar data facilities, yet much is to be gained by sharing
experiences, technological approaches and leveraging existing solutions. The
project aims at formalizing and enhancing the coordination of a2dc members
through the coordination of a network that will bring the data facilities
together on an annual basis. This will support new coordinated outreach to the
science community to help researchers identify and use the services that are
available to them and for the centers to ensure they are more effectively
serving the widest possible audience, including international stakeholders.
