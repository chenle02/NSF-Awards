This project incorporates PowerMac computers as instruments of active teaching
and learning into Calculus I, II, and III; Multivariable Calculus; and Numerical
Analysis I and II, using the software Mathematica. These courses take advantage
of the graphics and programming capabilities of Mathematica, allowing students
to gain insight into the core of the subject matter. Mathematica supports the
development of "notebooks;" a writer can present paragraphs of text, embedded
equations, tables, and graphs. The student can read the text, manipulate the
equations, generate new graphs, and experiment with parameter values. Students
can use the material in more active and creative ways. In Calculus courses,
fundamental concepts, such as function and limit, continuity and
differentiability, and instantaneous rates of change, are greatly illuminated by
graphical and numerical treatments. When Mathematica is used as a tool, students
of Multivariable Calculus can easily visualize three-dimensional problems using
3D plot and rotation. In the Numerical Analysis course, it is now possible to
take on more relevant problems that otherwise would not be covered because of
their extreme complexity. Mathematica can easily deal with complex, repetitive
computations that are inherent to the course, allowing students to concentrate
on more difficult concepts; thus, students, engineers, and mathematicians are
better equipped for research.
