Drennan Under the direction of Dr. Robert Drennan, Ms. Ruth Fauman- Fichman will
collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct laboratory work
both in Mexico and in Albany NY to analyze archaeological materials collected
from sites in Morelos, Mexico. These sites, occupied between 1150-1519 AD
document the span of time during which local groups were incorporated into the
Aztec empire. Ms. Fauman-Fichman will focus on materials related to the spinning
industry and the production of cotton thread. She will analyze architectural
information from excavated houses in both urban and rural contexts; associated
ceramics; artifacts associated with women's activities such as mazie grinding
equipment, cooking pots, griddles and objects related to spinning, weaving and
embroidering. The will incorporate this information with the architectural data
to reconstruct activity patterns and how these changed over time. The project
also has an experimental component and the function of spindles and related
artifacts will be determined. Although this project focusses on one specific
industry, the goal of the work is to understand how production changes in
varying political conditions. With incorporation of Morelos into the Aztec
empire, the political situation in the region underwent major alteration and
local groups were forced to work to provide tribute. Cotton constituted an
important prehistoric good and demands were met in this form. In technologically
simple societies, much production takes place on the household level and Ms.
Fauman-Fichman wishes to understand how these basic societal units were impacted
by and responded to these changes. This research is important for several
reasons. It will provide new insight into a period of great interest to
archaeologists. It will shed new light on how, over time, basic units of society
adapt and will assist in training a promising young scientist.
