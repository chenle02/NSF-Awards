Moist deep convection organized on planetary to synoptic scales in the tropical
atmosphere evolves together with extratropical Rossby waves that extend from the
tropics and across high latitudes as well as from the extratropics into the
tropics. This convection is organized in part into the 30-60 day eastward-moving
Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and higher frequency convectively coupled
atmospheric equatorial waves. Both the MJO and these convectively coupled waves
interact with extratropical waves. This project endeavors to explain how these
convectively coupled equatorial waves and extratropical waves might interact
with each other and the wave breaking process in a manner that causes some of
the major attributes of the MJO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MJO profoundly
influences extended range (4+ days) prediction of extreme weather events around
the globe ranging from tropical cyclones to excessive heat, cold, floods, and
droughts. The study will provide insights into the mechanisms whereby the MJO
interacts with extratropical waves that are associated with such extreme events.
Thus the work has substantial broader impacts.
