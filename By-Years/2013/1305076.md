Intellectual Merit. The Wind River Conference on Procaryotic Biology will be
held June 5-9, 2013 (and the first week of June in 2014 and 2015)in Estes Park,
Colorado. The meeting will explore a variety of topics in procaryotic bioogy,
including gene regulation, molecular biology, physiology, ecology, and
evolution. The diversity of systems and topics characteristic of this meeting
will provide a fertile environment for new ideas, and for applying well-
established concepts to newly emerging systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts. The meeting organizers are committed to inclusion of a diverse group of
participants, and historically, a significant feature of these meetings has been
their accessibility to graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and even some
very talented undergraduate researchers. Efforts are made to keep the costs
affordable,and travel grants will be offered as Muriel Rogers and Arnold Ravin
Scholarships in recognition of two founding conference members who contributed
significantly to the genetic scientific discipline and who were active
supporters of this conference in its early years.
