9634801 Capo This grant provides $275,000 as partial support of the costs of
acquiring a thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) equipped with multiple
Faraday collectors, ion counting and negative ion capabilities and peripheral
devices for use as the analytical centerpiece of the radiogenic isotope
geochemistry program to be started at the University of Pittsburgh. The PI's,
Capo and Stewart were recently hired by Pittsburgh and this award includes
significant cost sharing from the University both for the instrument acquisition
itself and in the form of laboratory startup costs. Acquisition of a new TIMS at
Pittsburgh will provide the analytical capabilities necessary to conduct a range
of interesting and recently funded Quaternary pedogenic and biogeochemical
process studies. Specific studies will include the use of Sr isotopes to
determine the relative contribution of atmospheric and silicate weathering
sources of Ca2+ in volcanic and desert soils, further refinement of the Sr
isotope stratigraphy of Cenozoic marine carbonates and the use of Rb/Sr and
Sm/Nd isotope systematics as tracers of igneous petrogenesis and ore-bearing
fluid migration. ***
