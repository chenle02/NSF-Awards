Julie A. Jones&lt;br/&gt;Oregon State
University&lt;br/&gt;OISE-0917697&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S. - Chile award
will support Dr. Julia Jones and a graduate student from Oregon State University
on a planning visit to Argentina and Chile. The visit will take place in March
2009. The primary goal of the visit is to initiate a long-term collaboration
between researchers at Oregon State University, Drs. Antonio Lara and Rocio
Urruti from University Austral in Chile, and Dr. Ricardo Villalba from the
Argentinean Institute for Snow, Ice and Environmental Research to study climate
change effects on streamflow from mid-latitude conifer forests. Specifically,
the proposed research will examine and contrast effects of climate change on
water availability (and ultimately on stream ecosystems) in mid-latitude conifer
forests in marine west coast climates in the Northern and Southern hemisphere.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the visit, the researchers will familiarize
themselves with the proposed forest watershed study sites, plan experiments, and
develop a strategy for future collaboration between the institutions. The visit
has the potential to lead to future studies regarding (1) forest hydrology and
paired-watershed experiments with cross-site comparisons, and (2) cross-site
comparisons of tree-ring chronologies and climate/hydrology reconstructions, in
Oregon and Chile. Reconstruction of past forest histories and tree growth
sensitivities to climate will permit us to develop comparable projections of
future climate effects on streamflow.
