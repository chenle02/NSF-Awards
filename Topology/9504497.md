9504497 Bousfield Bousfield will continue his research in homotopy theory, using
localization methods to expose and analyze unstable periodic phenomena. During
the 1980's, remarkable progress was made toward a global understanding of stable
homotopy theory, showing that some major features arise chromatically from an
interplay of periodic phenomena arranged in a hierarchy. This project is part of
an effort to develop a similar understanding in unstable homotopy theory. In
recent work, Bousfield introduced a hierarchy of localizations, called the vn-
periodizations for positive integers n, which serve to resolve a given space
into a chromatic tower with monochromatic fibres. He will work to understand
these vn-periodizations of spaces as well as the closely related homological
localizations. He has already established strong links between v1-periodizations
and K-homology localizations of spaces, leading to solutions of old problems
concerning the K-theory of iterated loop spaces. Geometric objects or spaces
play a central role in mathematics, arising for instance from the solution sets
of systems of equations. Beyond their usual measurements, such spaces have
deeper properties which persist even after drastic deformations. These
properties begin almost trivially with the number of separate components and the
number of holes but become tremendously rich and informative in higher
dimensions. The field of homotopy theory is devoted to their study using
powerful algebraic and geometric techniques. Various periodic phenomena in
homotopy theory have been discovered since the 1950's, and an exciting
"chromatic" approach to the subject was developed in the 1980's, allowing
resolutions of confusingly complicated phenomena into much simpler periodic
parts. This approach was originally restricted to certain simpler phenomena
known as stable phenomena, but it is now being extended to a full, fascinating,
important range of unstable homotopy theoretic phenome na. ***
