This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Chemistry Program. It is
a continuation of research in the same area. Dr. Hoffman has developed the
chemistry of a group of compounds that permits the highly flexible synthesis of
number of important classes of structures such as amino acids and heterocycles.
These reactions have the potential to simplify the synthesis of otherwise
difficultly obtainable substances. The use of 2-sulfonyloxy carbonyl compounds
in synthesis has received considerable attention in recent years. 2-Sulfonyloxy
carbonyl compounds (ketones and esters) can be prepared readily from enol
derivatives of carbonyl compounds, and the sulfonyloxy group introduces distinct
reactivity to the product. Of greatest interest is that 2-sulfonyloxy carbonyl
compounds undergo very clean nucleophilic substitution. This propensity has been
exploited in simple 2-sulfonyloxy ketones and esters as a means to synthesize
2-substituted ketones and unusual amino acid esters. The planned work involves
the synthesis of selected, new 2-sulfonyloxy carbonyl compounds, and exploits
their special reactivity for the preparation of densely functionalized products.
Three specific objectives are set: a) to develop methodology for the synthesis
of chiral 3-hydroxy-2-nosyloxy esters and their elaboration into chiral
1,2,3-trifunctionalized compounds, b) to develop the use of unsaturated nosyloxy
esters for the synthesis of unsaturated ester derivatives, and c) to continue
studies on the electrophilic addition to enamine and enol derivatives of
2-ketoesters.
