This award supports Professor Balasubramanian Ramesh and a U.S. graduate student
from the Naval Postgraduate School to collaborate in manufacturing engineering
research with Professor Matthias Jarke and his research group of the Technical
University of Aachen, Germany. They are studying the technical and empirical
foundations for requirements traceability, which is widely used as a measure of
the quality of the systems development process, ultimately related to modern
methods for product development. Their collaboration is built on the integration
of complementary empirical research by Professor Ramesh and theoretical
techniques developed by Professor Jarke and his group. Aachen is a world leader
in design and manufacturing engineering, and is currently participating in a
regional European effort in the area of traceability requirements. Current
practices as well as the usefulness of traceability vary considerably across
systems development efforts. Weaknesses include the lack of comprehensive
guidelines on what kinds of information must be captured, and when, and how it
should be used to support various stakeholder needs. Professors Ramesh and Jarke
will integrate their independently developed traceability models, incorporate
them into a prototype implementation scheme and conduct empirical evaluations of
the research results in large scale system development projects. The results of
their cooperative research are likely to influence the design of the next
generation of Computer Aided System Engineering (CASE) environments, to the
benefit of the concurrent design process in many industries.
