Traub and Wozniakowski The goal of information-based complexity is to create a
theory of computational complexity and optimal algorithms for problems with
partial, contaminated, and priced information, and to apply the results to
solving specific problems in varied disciplines. For brevity, information-based
complexity will be called IBC. The theory is developed over abstract spaces,
typically Hilbert and Banach spaces, while the applications are to multivariate
problems. Because the information is partial and contaminated, only approximate
solutions can be obtained. IBC studies computational complexity and optimal
algorithms for computing e-approximations in various settings. Because the worst
case setting often leads to negative results such as unsolvability and
intractability, settings with a weaker assurance such as average, probabilistic,
and randomized settings are also studied. A fairly new area of IBC research is
quantum computing. The best known algorithms discovered to date, Shor and
Grover, are for discrete problems. But many problems occurring in science and
engineering are continuous. Examples include high-dimensional and path
integration, high-dimensional approximation, and partial differential equations.
To understand the power of quantum computation for continuous problems one must
know the computational complexity of these problems on a classical computer in
various settings. This is exactly what has been studied in IBC. Questions to be
answered include: For what problems is quantum computation (exponentially,
polynomially) faster than classical computation? For what problems is there
provably no speed-up of quantum over classical computation? For some 40 years,
computing has been driven by Moore's law, which is the empirical observation
that computing power doubles about every 18 months. This has made it possible
for people to have computers in their homes as powerful as computers owned by
corporations just 20 years ago. It has made the internet possible. Finally,
powerful computers are indispensable to our national security. Computer chips
and wires are getting so small that there is a consensus among technologists
that Moore's law will end in 10 to 15 years using current silicon technology.
Because it is critical for our country to maintain the Moore's law trajectory,
new ways to compute are being considered. One of the most promising ideas is to
use the principles of quantum mechanics to do quantum computing. The
investigators and their colleagues are studying the following question: If
physicists and chemists succeed in building quantum computers, for which
problems are there big payoffs? That is, what are the killer applications?
