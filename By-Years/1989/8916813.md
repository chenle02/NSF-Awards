This research is a continuation of the work of the investigators that deduces
the state and direction of stress in the earth's crust from the orientation of
the slip vectors of earthquakes. The formalism of the solution has been extended
and the present work includes a universal (pseudo) friction coefficient so that
some idea of the frictional resistance of the crust to faulting can be deduced.
This technique will be applied to data sets from a variety of tectonic
environments, including both plate boundary and intraplate settings, and
spanning a range of source depths. This research has direct application to the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
