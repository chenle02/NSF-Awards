The Center for Mathematics at the University of Notre Dame will run a 2023
program on Hyperbolicity and Rationality and a 2024 program on Commutative
Algebra and its Interaction with Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Combinatorics.
The 2023 program will take place June 12-30, 2023. The first week of will be an
undergraduate summer school on topics relating to hyperbolicity and rationality,
the second week will be a graduate/postdoc summer school to give new researchers
an introduction to this field, and the third week will be an international
research conference. The 2024 program will be an international research
conference that will take place August 12-19, 2024. The goal of both programs is
to allow mathematicians at different levels to engage with these exciting and
fast-developing fields. The purpose of the summer schools is to introduce
students at various levels to important ideas in algebraic geometry, and more
specifically birational geometry, at a deeper level than is usual in their
undergraduate or graduate studies. Both conferences will provide ample
opportunities for students and researchers at all levels to develop productive
professional relationships.

In more detail regarding the summer 2023 conference on Hyperbolicity and
Rationality, one fundamental motivating question in birational geometry is to
understand how positivity or negativity of the canonical bundle impacts the
geometry, arithmetic and analysis of varieties. Varieties with very negative
canonical bundle are expected to "look like" projective space and varieties with
very positive canonical bundle are expected to look very different from
projective space. The conference will bring together experts who study both
sides of the question: researchers who study how Fano varieties look like (and
unlike) projective space, and researchers who study ways that varieties of
general type look very different from projective space. More information about

conference will be available from the Center for Mathematics at Notre Dame
