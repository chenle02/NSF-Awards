The objective of this research is the measurement of the relative contribution
of upwind sources to those observed at a single location using a new
micrometeorological facility (ASTER) available from the National Center for
Atmospheric Research. The upwind sources will comprise a 400 m line source of an
inert gas and eddy correlation measurements will be made at four separate
downwind locations. The observations will be interpreted with the aid of an
existing stochastic model of turbulent exchange.
