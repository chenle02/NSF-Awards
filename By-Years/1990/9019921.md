Receptors are proteins which act as signal transducers in living organisms. A
variety of neurotransmitters and hormones can regulate the activity of a wide
range of functions such as maintaining blood pressure and heart rate, learning
and memory or vision. A desired response depends on a specific receptor type.
Therefore, knowledge of the three dimensional structure of receptor molecules
will lead to an understanding of what determines specificity and how the
neurotransmitter or hormone is translated by a cell to produce a desired
response. Adrenergic receptors translate messages from a group of
neurotransmitter and hormones called catecholamines. It has been demonstrated
that, by using techniques of genetic engineering, one can make small changes in
the receptor protein. This new "engineered" receptor can now response to the
slightly different catecholester rather than the catecholamine. In this way one
can learn what are the critical "recognition sites" on the receptor and,
eventually, what distinguishes the adrenergic receptor from other receptors.
This research takes advantage of the fact that the beta- adrenergic receptor
(b-AR) is similar in structure to rhodopsin which is the light-sensitive protein
in the eye. Again, by using genetic engineering, one can alter the b-AR to
respond in a way similar to the light-sensitive receptor. Therefore, light
sensitive probes can be used to analyze the structure of the b- AR. This is a
simpler and more effective method of studying the structure of receptors. These
techniques will provide a better means of studying fundamental biological
processes and the molecular basis of disease.
