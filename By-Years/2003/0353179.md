The award from the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site at Miami University, Oxford Campus for the summers of
2004-2006. Benjamin W. Gung is the site director and PI. Nine students will
participate for ten weeks. Faculty members from the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry will provide research projects in various sub fields, including
analytical, biological, inorganic, organic and physical. The program targets
under represented groups, women and minorities. The targeted institutions are
undergraduate institutions where students do not have the opportunity for hands-
on research. Interaction of faculty mentors and students from multiple
disciplines in weekly meetings will expose students to different aspects of
chemistry and biochemistry. Discussion topics will also include professional
options in chemistry, graduate school, ethics, manuscript writing and
preparation of oral presentations. The program will conclude with students
presenting their work in a symposium. The program is evaluated using several
criteria including analysis of student surveys, their professional development
and career goals, and research productivity.
