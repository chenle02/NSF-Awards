The 1-year UMEB renewal will support four current students for their second year
of research. The students are currently engaged in active research programs in
laboratories with an emphasis on environmental biology, including molecular
systematics of endangered species, community ecology, environmental physiology,
and insect behavior. We will continue active monitoring of their progress and
mentoring experiences. In addition to their research activities, the students
will participate in a seminar series that will expose them to career
opportunities and ethical issues in environmental science, and will participate
in short field trips. During their final semester, they will complete their
projects, analyse data, and write up their results for publication and
presentation at a scientific meeting. Assessment tools will be used to determine
the extent of their understanding of the scientific method, critical thinking,
and development of self confidence. The students will then have the opportunity
to move on to other research opportunities within the University.
