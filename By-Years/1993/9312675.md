S. L. Soo Abstract measurements of particle velocities, mixture density and
particle size distribution in wavy horizontal and turbulent vertical gas-solid
mixture pipe flow will be performed with laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) and
phase Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA). means, fluctuations, and cross-
correlations of the velocity and density fluctuations will be obtained. The
results will be interpreted in the context of time averaging equations of two-
phase flow and particle-fluid interaction models. Particle of 0.05, 0.2 and 0.45
mm will be used in experiments, at solids to gas mass flow ratios up to 12. The
proposed work is essential for the development of basic understanding and
modeling in gas-solids two-phase turbulent flow, with application in processing,
minerals and food industry. The measurements are possible by recent developments
in two-phase flow instrumentation. ***
