This research stems from and continues work done under previous NSF grants. The
main theme is development of semistate design theories for non-linear
microelectronic circuits with special reference to applications, such as neural-
type microsystems, and Kemp echo simulators for non-invasive determination of
ear parameters. In this research the use of semistate equations for automated
design with application to the above types of systems is being explored.
