This project will study both the collective effects of solar magnetic activity
and those of its individual components, including sunspots and faculae. The
investigator wishes to determine aspects of solar activity responsible for
irradiance and luminosity changes and apply this knowledge to modelling of
irradiance changes by ground-based observations. Secondly, he wishes to gain
understanding of the physical processes by which magnetic activity modifies the
flow of energy from the solar interior to produce changes in luminosity and
irradiance at the Earth. Finally, this project will contribute to science
education by (1) involving graduate students in obtaining/analyzing data and
writing a Master's thesis, and (2) having graduate and undergraduate students
help new lab students in related assignments.***
