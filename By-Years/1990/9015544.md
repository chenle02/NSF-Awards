Interface states at grain boundaries in wide band gap materials such as zinc
oxide are being studied by means of deep level transient spectroscopy and a new
transient photocapacitance technique being developed as part of the project. The
goals are to identify the origins of deep states greater than 1eV below the
conduction band, and to uncover the physical origins of emission of trapped
carriers from the deep levels.
