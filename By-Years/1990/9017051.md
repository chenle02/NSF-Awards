This award will provide partial support for the conference Computations in
Natural and Artificial Parallel Systems. This conference is interdisciplinary in
nature, bringing together researchers from several different fields to focus on
parallel computation systems, comparing the parallel circuit in the brain with
that of parallel computer systems. The conference with be held September 27-30
at the Beckman Institute in Urbana-Champaign, Illinois.
