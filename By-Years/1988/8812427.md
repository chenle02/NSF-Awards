Using the structural literature as a predictive database for the design of solid
state reactions, a series of reactive metal carboxylates containing pendant
acetylene groups was generated. These materials react thermally, or under UV- or
y-irradiation, to form metal complexes of substituted polyacetylenes. The
success of this effort suggested the synthesis of an analogous series of metal
carboxylates containing pendant vinyl groups. Theses complexes react
stereospecifically to form crystalline metal salts of di-and tricarboxylic
acids. Structural information has defined the factors governing the reactivity
of the metal-acetylene complexes. However, the lack of sufficient structural
information on the vinyl compounds has prevented the development of structure-
reactivity relationships for these phases. For both series an extensive set of
synthetic, mechanistic, and x-ray structural experiments are proposed in order
to gain a greater understanding of the chemical and structural factors which
lead to various types of addition reactions. A proposed study of isomorphous
phases promises to deepen our understanding of the role of the central metal
atom in these solid state reactions. In addition to their use in synthesis, the
crystalline reactants have potential applications as indicators and dosimeters.
