The National Center for Supply Chain Technology Education is a consortium of
five strategically located community colleges across the nation with robust
programs preparing technicians for careers in private and public sector supply
chain technology. The institutions are: Norco College, CA, Sinclair Community
College, OH, Oakton Community College, IL, Jefferson Community and Technical
College, KY, and Tacoma Community College, WA. The supply chain technician
workforce is over 11 million workers and is expected to grow during the next ten
years. The Center engages strategic partners nationally across the private and
public supply chain continuum: manufacturing, distribution, warehousing and
information technology, A 2+2+2 model supply chain career pathway is developed
with educational partners at all three levels to provide education for positions
beyond the entry level. Professional development is provided for faculty at all
three educational levels. Successful practices are disseminated through face-to-
face and electronic means. Evaluative activities measure the progress of the
Center toward its goals.
