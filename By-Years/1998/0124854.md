0124854&lt;br/&gt;Dunn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a three-year
collaborative research project between Professor Robert Dunn of Hendrix College
and Professor Geoffrey Stedman of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand.
The project will enable an international effort to use the extreme sensitivity
and wide dynamic range of large ring lasers as geophysical research tools.
Specifically, proposed work includes upgrades to the ring laser facility in New
Zealand, and subsequent measurements of such phenomena as earth tides, the
rotational components of seismic waves, and length of day variations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaboration brings together the efforts of
international laboratories that have complementary expertise and research
facilities. The project will enhance the international research competence of
the several undergraduate students from Hendrix College who will participate in
the research in New Zealand. &lt;br/&gt;
