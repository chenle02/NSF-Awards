9724728&lt;br/&gt;Meyerovich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award will
support collaborative research between Alexander Meyerovich of the University of
Rhode Island and Professors Giorgio Frossati and Reijer Jochemsen at Rijks
University in Leiden, The Netherlands. The proposed research on spin-polarized
quantum systems requires close cooperation between experimental and theoretical
groups and will deal with thermodynamic and transport properties of macroscopic
quantum systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US PI brings to the collaboration
extensive experience in the theory of spin-polarized quantum systems, while the
Dutch counterparts represent one of the world's leading experimental groups in
this field. The collaboration is expected to help fill the gap in the theory of
spin-polarized Fermi systems, contribute to the theory of anamalous spin
dynamics near the instability points, and develop a new theory of transport to
understand boundary slip and slip effects in classical systems with large free
paths. &lt;br/&gt;
