Kansas City Kansas Community College (KCKCC) and the Kansas City Kansas 500
Public School District form the Advancing Teaching Opportunities of Math and
Science (ATOMS) partnership. The partnership is increasing the efficacy of
science and math teaching by gaining an increased understanding of the needs of
high school teachers through the creation of new needs-assessment tools for
teacher professional development. Ten faculty members from KCKCC's Division of
Engineering, Mathematics, and Sciences, representing the fields of biology,
chemistry, engineering, environmental science, mathematics and the physical
sciences, are serving as mentors to high school teachers. Community College
faculty and teachers are working to increase teacher content knowledge, build
knowledge of effective technology use in the curriculum and build skills for
teachers to become more engaging to students in the areas of math and science.
This structured Higher education - K12 institutionalized partnership is
providing insight into the professional development concerns of math and science
high school teachers in urban schools that increase student achievement in the
areas of math and science. The ATOMS partnership is joined by other local
educational entities and community groups interested in STEM education.
