This proposal is concerned with developing of 3-D scanning methods to be applied
to the imaging of cuneiform tablets. This process can make the tablets more
readable by "deepening" the marks in tablets badly worn over centuries, thus
sharpening the images. The panel gave this proposal a Highly Competitive rating,
noting that it was an excellent proposal with innovative work in information
technology and the humanities and social sciences. For IT, the impact is the
development of a portable, very high resolution surface scanner and the multi-
resolution algorithms. For the humanities, the project represents significant
work with a potentially very wide application to other other objects with the
result of opening up new fields of study to a larger group of scholars. The
technology and techniques developed can be imported to other areas of study of
ancient cultures and languages.
