The proposed project is to study the functional aspects of pistil S-proteins
and regulation of S-gene expression in gametophytic self-incompatibility. Using
Nicotiana alata and Petunia inflata, Dr. Kao will 1) establish direct evidence
that S-proteins are responsible for the self-incompatibility reaction by testing
the effect on self-incompatibility behavior of introducing either a new S-gene
into plants homozygous for a different S-allele, or an antisense S-gene into
plants homozygous for the same S-allele; 2) identify the s-allele specificity
domain of the S-protein by using chimeric S-proteins expressed in transgenic
plants; 3) test the effect of mutating the conserved cysteine residues of S-
proteins on their function; 4) determine the sequences controlling tissue
specific and developmentally regulated expression of S-genes by fusing their 5'
upstream sequences to a reporter gene, GUS, and then using sequential deletion
to test the effect on expression of GUS in transgenic plants; 5) identify a
protein associated with the style activity part of the S-locus using a unique
self-compatible style-part mutant of N. alata. The result of these experiment
will yield important information on the molecular basis of self-incompatibility.
%%% Many higher plants have a mechanism, termed self-incompatibility, with
prevents the pollen from a given plant from self fertilizing the female tissue
(pistil) of the same plant. Genes controlling this self- incompatibility have
been identified but the mechanism whereby the incompatibility occurs is unknown.
In addition to its inherent interest to plant biologists, there are clear
applications to agriculture to an understanding of this process.
