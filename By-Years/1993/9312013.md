9312013 Calvert Auroral electron precipitation is hypothesized to result from
electron pitch-angle scattering by the cyclotron maser instability during the
generation of auroral kilometric radiation (AKR). The AKR consists of intense,
primarily extraordinary-mode waves originating on auroral magnetic field lines
at geocentric altitudes of 1.3 to 3.3 earth radii. Comprising up to one percent
of the total power of the aurora the AKR is now widely believed to be generated
by the cyclotron maser instability which results from the doppler-shifted,
cyclotron-resonant, pitch-angle scattering of energetic electrons into the loss
cone. Critical to this new theory of the aurora is explaining the observed
triggering of the AKR by radio waves from the sun, since that phenomenon clearly
confirms the new theory. The proposed work is to study this triggering, believed
to be caused by enhanced local precipitation in ambient density minima and the
consequent creation of density depletions in which radio lasing can occur. Such
radio lasing consists of closed-loop wave feedback oscillations caused by wave
reflections at the source, exactly analogous to those of conventional optical
lasers and likewise producing nearly-perfect discrete, coherent, and
monochromatic emissions. ***
