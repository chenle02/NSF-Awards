This proposal requests funds in partial support of a symposium entitled: "The
Genetic Analysis of Development." The symposium is the third in an annual series
organized by the Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology at Indiana
University . It will occur on the dates October 29 - November 1, 1987 at
Bloomington, Indiana. The purpose is to provide an up-to-date account of the
current status of this fast moving research area. The use of recombinant
technology has made it possible to directly address the question of genetic
control of the development of an organism from embryo to adult. The insights
gained within the last ten years have far exceeded those in all preceeding
years. This conference will bring together those scientists working different
systems such as Drosophila melangoster, Caenorhabditis elegans, plants and
humans. The setting is appropriate for maximum interaction among the established
scientists as well as the younger students of biology.
