The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the
research of Professor Sunhee Choi of Middlebury College to examine oxidation of
guanine and guanine-containing nucleotides facilitated by platinum(IV) and
ruthenium(III) complexation. The platinum and ruthenium binding to nucleobases
and the reduction of Pt(IV) and Ru(III) have potential relevance to medicinal
chemistry because they form the bases of a number of classes of anticancer
drugs. The scientific implications of this research impact our understanding of
biological and inorganic reaction mechanisms, especially as related to cell
mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, aging and death. Undergraduate students are trained
in the intricacies of modern research methods including experimental design and
the interpretation of data.
