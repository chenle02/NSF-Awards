The California State University Fresno group participates in the ATLAS
experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The research program focuses on
jet physics, electroweak physics, Event Data Models and the development of
Physics Analysis Tools. The group is also active in the R&amp;D program for the
upgrade of ATLAS, including muon detectors, and provides leadership for US
Collaborators on ATLAS in the domain of Tier 3 computing. The Cal State Fresno
program also provides an unusual opportunity for broadening participation
through a consortium of thirteen CSU campuses. Through this structure, the CSU
Fresno group offers masters-level graduate students and undergraduate students
the opportunity to work at CERN with CSU and international ATLAS researchers in
a broad spectrum of research projects at the energy frontier of physics.
