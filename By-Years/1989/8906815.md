This award will support a special year in approximation theory to be held
during the 1989-90 academic year at the University of South Florida under the
direction of Professors Edward Saff and Mourad Ismail. It is anticipated that
collaborative research interactions will take place among USF faculty and
visitors from the U.S. and abroad. The first half of the year will focus on
theory (nonlinear approximants, orthogonal expansions, and special functions)
and the second half will emphasize applications (numerical methods, image
processing, and computer-aided geometric design). A special feature of the year
will be a joint US-USSR Conference on Approximation Theory to be held in the
spring of 1990.
