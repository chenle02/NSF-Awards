Alan Cowley, Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at Austin, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
for his exploration of new Group 13 compounds. The particular focus is on
boranediyls and their metal complexes, synthesis, characterization and further
reactions with organic and organometallic molecules. Boranediyls are electron-
poor compounds with a formal B(I) oxidation state. Cowley uses sterically
encumbering ligands to stabilize these reactive molecules. In addition to the
fundamental interest in boranediyl electronic structure, these molecules may
provide useful routes into metal boride nanoparticles and boron-containing
polymers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boron has a rich chemistry that can be exploited
in catalysis and materials synthesis. Chemical vapor deposition may provide a
route into new metal boride nanoparticles. Polymers containing boron often have
useful optical and electronic properties. Students will be trained in demanding
synthetic techniques as well as state-of-the-art characterization tools for
molecules, polymers and solid state materials.&lt;br/&gt;
