This award is for the acquisition of infrastructure to support computational
science and engineering at the University of Michigan. The infrastructure to be
acquired consists of two parallel computers and a loosely coupled high speed
network of high performance workstations. The areas of research supported by
this infrastructure include automotive design, computational fluid dynamics,
space plasma physics, computational particle transport, parallel CAD tools,
parallel algorithms and architectures, and a parallel computing environment.
These high performance computers will support both computational science and
engineering (CS&amp;E) and studies into more effective use of parallelism.
CS&amp;E is a third research paradigm complementing experimentation and theory.
The acquisition of this computational facility will allow users to explore the
interactions between CS&amp;E and both experiments and theoretical predictions.
The use of computation in conjunction with experimentation allows much more
rapid prototyping that in turn results in more useful endproducts, be they
science or manufactured products.
