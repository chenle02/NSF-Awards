Projects DIGS (Developing Individual Growth in Science) is designed to enhance
the interest of 30 high ability/high potential secondary school students in
science disciplines as possible career choices. This project targets 8th, 9th,
and 10th grade students from a 7 county area surrounding Wright State
University. Students interest in science careers will be developed through an
intensive 3-week summer institute, followed by 9 months of academic year
continuation activities. The workshop will place students in an experimental
research environment, using archaeology as an entry mode for rich
interdisciplinary learning. Students will have a hands-on experience in the
process of scientific inquiry through participation in a simulated
archaeological dig and through observation of, and interaction with, practicing
local archaeologists and paleontologists currently conducting a dip. Topics in
related sciences will be introduced as a natural outflow from concepts and
phenomena encountered by the students during their research (e.g., earth science
and chemistry applications in the archaeological field). Career information will
be integrated with content knowledge throughout the curriculum. Multimodal
teaching/learning activities and strategies will be used, with most classroom
activities being structured as small group cooperative projects.
