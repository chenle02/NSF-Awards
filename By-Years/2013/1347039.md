This award will provide funds for conference support for approximately 39
undergraduate students (out of a total of 125) attending the fall meeting of the
Division of Nuclear Physics of the American Physical Society, in Newport News,
VA (October 23-26, 2013). It is the 16th annual Conference Experience for
Undergraduates (CEU). The CEU is a natural venue for students who have had an
undergraduate research experience to present the results of their work and
interact with other students as well as faculty and senior researchers. CEU has
been immensely successful in fostering this interaction, which helps students to
have a broad introduction and exposure to research across nuclear physics, and
to enable senior researchers to get to know some of the junior future leaders.
