For several decades, social science research has explored various sources of
biases in judicial institutions. Nevertheless, many concepts utilized in
empirical studies remain underdeveloped. This workshop brings together judges,
theorists, and social scientists from multiple disciplines to discuss issues in
research on judicial institutions. Participants include judges from both trial
and appellate levels of state and federal courts and legal scholars whose
research interests reflect on a variety of disciplines: anthropology, economics,
history, philosophy, political science, psychology, and sociology. Participants'
discussion will focus on developing social science research agendas on judicial
institutions that have not been adequately explored. In addition to generating
new lines of inquiry in basic research on courts, the workshop will contribute
to research that informs judges and policymakers on approaches designed to
evaluate the performance of judicial institutions
