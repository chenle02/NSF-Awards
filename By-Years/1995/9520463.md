ABSTRACT AST-9520463 Salzberg, S. L. Astronomical image processing methods have
been developed in the past several decades to a point of great sophistication,
including facilities for image reconstruction and restoration (both for radio
interferometry and the aberrated Hubble Space Telescope), image filtering, and
object detection and classification. This project is aimed at determining the
feasibility of applying astronomical image processing techniques to low contrast
digital images from other fields. Digitized mammograms are similar in many ways
to images of diffuse astronomical objects. The challenge in analyzing mammograms
is to identify clusters of faint, point-like objects called microcalcifications;
the astronomical analog would be faint stars, or perhaps cosmic ray hits on a
CCD detector, in a region of extended nebulosity. Some initial experiments on
mammograms are encouraging and this project will conduct a more systematic
feasibility study. ***
