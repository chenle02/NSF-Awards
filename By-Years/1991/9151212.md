The Department of Chemistry is purchasing an FT-IR for use in sophomore and
upper division laboratory courses. Students in these courses are investigating
the rotational-vibrational spectra of various hydrogen and alkyl halides,
conducting basicity studies and quantitatively analyzing reaction mixtures.
Undergraduates are working closely with the faculty to develop new experiments
for use at other institutions.
