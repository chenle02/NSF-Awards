An expert musician, when playing with other musicians, is able to listen to
simultaneous inputs and synthesize that information in order to decide on the
correct position in the musical score. The research objective of this project is
to investigate algorithms that would allow an artificial system to simulate this
real-time tracking ability. A working computer performer, capable of playing
intractively with live musicians, and implemented on multiprocessor, will be the
vehicle for testing and developing the tracking algorithm. Since the computer
performer will need to examine complex patterns of notes from several sources
and also to inspect simultaneously several possible locations in the musical
score, parallel processing and pattern matching considerations will be
important. This research will provide insight into methods of parallel
processing and pattern matching; will give musicians a new, practical
interactive tool for performance; and will be an innovative application of
multiprocessors.
