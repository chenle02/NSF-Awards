Every year natural, technological, and human-induced hazards impact millions of
people worldwide, resulting in thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of
damage. Attracting new scholars to the fields of hazards, risk, and disasters is
vital for advancing knowledge that can lead to disaster loss reduction and
overall improvement in the management of emergencies and disasters. The
"Enabling the Next Generation of Hazards and Disasters Researchers" program
[hereafter the Enabling Program] will support junior faculty at universities in
developing research and teaching efforts that inform disaster loss reduction and
improve the ways in which hazards and disasters are addressed. The aims of the
Enabling Program are to: (1) foster the development of scholars with a career-
long commitment to research on hazards, risk, and disasters; (2) contribute to
the nation's future research capacity and infrastructure for reducing disaster
loss; and (3) add important original scientific knowledge to the areas of
hazards, risk, and disasters to reduce societal vulnerability. Vulnerability and
risk reduction require systematic interdisciplinary efforts for improving all
phases of disaster management and to the development of resiliency on a broad
scale. In addition to incorporating a wide variety of disciplines that inform
the challenge of risk reduction, the Enabling Program is also committed to
recruiting and mentoring women and members of underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Enabling Program is crucial to the advancement
of knowledge in the interdisciplinary hazards field, which relies on scholars
committed both to their own disciplines and to theoretical and applied aspects
of the hazards and disasters field. This is a unique combination, and through
the mentoring process, the Enabling Program encourages a distinctive type of
scholarly development and builds commitment to the hazards and disasters field.
As such, the program offers significant research contributions. First, it
continues to help build a cohort of researchers who can understand and address
the complex interactions between the social, built, and natural environment
associated with hazards. The Enabling Program will build on the success of
previous rounds that resulted in an impressive level of scholarly output.
Additionally, by continuing a model of explicit encouragement of
interdisciplinary education and training around hazards and disasters, the
program will assist younger researchers in enhanced research quality and
quantity, which benefits every region across the U.S.
