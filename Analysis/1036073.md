This is an award for the 18th West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar (WCOAS), to be
held at the Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Hidalgo, Pachuca, Mexico, 24
September 2010. It will support travel for USA based speakers, graduate
students, postdocs, and other USA based participants. Approximately 20 USA based
participants are expected, including about 10 graduate students and postdocs, to
attend the three day seminar.

The WCOAS is a 20 year tradition among the operator algebraists in western North
America. Its intellectual merits include: providing an opportunity for
researchers to disseminate their own results; furnishing an opportunity for
researchers to learn about recent research of others and to stay abreast of
current work; fostering collaborative research by giving researchers the
opportunity to meet and discuss their work with one another. Among the broader
impacts of WCOAS are the encouragement and nurturing of graduate students and
postdocs by giving them the opportunity to present their own work, learn about
recent work, and meet established researchers in operator algebras; creation and
maintenance of a cohesive regional community of operator algebraists; and the
fostering of connections between the faculty and students at research
universities and those at primarily undergraduate institutions. Moreover, this
WCOAS will help develop ties between mathematicians in Mexico and the rest of
North America.
