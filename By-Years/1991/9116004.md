The P.I. will determine the prevalence of chitan and other chitins in primary
production. Major phytoplankton taxa will be screened for chitan production.
Chitin-positive phytoplankton in addition to the known chitan producers,
Thalassiosira and Cyclotella, will be studied in depth to determine the
physiological conditions relevant for chitin or chitan production. Seasonal
trends in the seasonal significance of this new biogeochemical polymer, chitan,
will be monitored at a mid- Chesapeake Bay site. Diel variance will be evaluated
twice annually at this site and once in the second year at the Bermuda Times
Series Station. A new biochemical fractionation step will be developed in course
of this work, which will permit resolution of the interference that chitan has
in the conventional trichloroacetic acid protein precipitation step used in
previous studies. Efficacy of the new extraction procedures will be dtermined by
specific HPLC-linked enzyme hydrolyses and HPLC and planar (TLC) analyses of
amino acids, amino sugars, reducing sugars. Radiocarbon budgets with
discrimination of individual sugars, amino sugars and amino acids will be
accomplished with the aid of an imaging proportional counter designed for
automatically and quantitatively mapping radioisotopes on TLC plates.
