ABSTRACT 96-15941 Bever Competition and coexistence: The role of soil community
feedback This study will examine how feedback through the soil community changes
the outcome of competition between plants. The identity of plant species is
known to change the composition of their associated soil community. These
changes may then influence the plant's performance-either positively or
negatively. Such feedback could exert strong effects on the growth of plants,
but the role of such feedbacks in natural communities has rarely been
investigated. This project focuses on two well-studied plant species,
Anthoxanthum odoratum and Panicum sphaerocarpon. The investigators have
repeatedly observed negative feedbacks between these two species resulting from
changes in the soil communities. This project will using parallel greenhouse and
field experiments to test whether this feedback influences the outcome and
intensity of competition between these species. These results will be used to
parameterize population dynamic models with which the investigators will
evaluate the soil community's contribution to the maintenance of plant
biodiversity.
