This project focuses on exploiting various aspects of mobile system and wireless
network dynamics to improve the efficiency of mobile cloud computing.
Exploitation of these dynamics has substantial impacts on practical integration
of mobile devices into the cloud, by alleviating the local computation burden of
mobile devices and allowing adaptation to the heterogeneous system and
environmental contexts. The research results are likely to inspire novel
theoretical and systematic studies that open up new areas of research in highly
interactive mobile computing systems. The project plans to engage female and
under-represented minority students in the research activities and disseminate
the research results broadly to the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mobile cloud
computing bridges the gap between the limited capabilities of mobile devices and
the increasing complexity of mobile applications, by offloading the
computational workloads from local devices to the remote cloud. However, the
effectiveness of mobile cloud computing could be impaired by the dynamic nature
of system and network contexts, which lead to heterogeneous mobile application
behaviors and seriously reduce the appropriateness of workload offloading
decisions. The goal of this research is to exploit these critical dynamics in
mobile clouds that are indispensable to efficient, prompt, and reliable workload
offloading. More specifically, the project addresses three closely intertwined
research issues in mobile cloud computing. The first part investigates how to
analytically formulate the stochastic characteristics of run-time application
executions, based on which the workload offloading decisions are
probabilistically made and systematic techniques are developed to practically
enforce such decisions. The second part incorporates the contexts and
performance requirements of mobile cloud applications into the design of
wireless networks, so as to adaptively balance between the wireless energy cost
and application performance in mobile clouds through fundamental redesign of
wireless transmission scheduling algorithms. The third part focuses on testbed
development to automatically investigate the run-time system and network
dynamics of mobile cloud applications in practice. This testbed consists of off-
the-shelf smartphones and wearable devices, and enables in-field experiments for
evaluating the performance of the proposed techniques and system designs.
