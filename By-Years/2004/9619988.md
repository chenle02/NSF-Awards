Fully plastic fracture mechanics criteria for metal structures under quasi-
static and dynamic loads are developed. The difficulties associated with
extensive irreversible material response in determining fracture criteria for
predicting crack initiation and growth in a fully plastic structure are
addressed. Analytical models are correlated to experimental results of impact
loaded mild steel and aluminum beams.
