The proposed research is primarily concerned with distributed algorithms,
particularly as they relate to the performance and reliability of distributed
systems. It is involved with the development of distributed algorithms that are
based on the optimistic paradigm. Optimistic algorithms have been developed that
particularly address the issues of rollback and concurrency in the system. The
proposed algorithms for replicated data significantly reduce the latency
incurred by transactions due to replica and concurrency control. It is proposed
to analyze and evaluate the performance of these algorithms and to build a
testbed in which these algorithms can be implemented. The goal is to develop a
general framework that can be used to synthesize optimistic protocols from their
centralized counterparts.
