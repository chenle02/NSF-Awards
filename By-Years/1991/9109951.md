The goal of the proposed research is the elucidation of the mechanism of the
enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase at the molecular level. This is to be
achieved through the x-ray crystallographic determination of the structures of
the native enzyme, of mutant enzymes and of enzyme-inhibitor complexes.
