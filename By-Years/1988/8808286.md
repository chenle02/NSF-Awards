The study concerns the representation of syntactic and semantic/conceptual
knowledge of natural language with a particular focus on the structure of
information which must be represented in the lexicon. The principal investigator
will adopt a modular theory of language in which linguistic information (e.g.
syntax) and nonlinguistic information (e.g. concepts) are encoded in distinct
fashions, each with their own characteristic primitives and principles of
combination. Previous work by the principal investigator supports the general
idea that linguistic information itself must be factored into autonomous
representations, each regulated by its own principles.
