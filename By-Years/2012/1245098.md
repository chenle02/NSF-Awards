The project is redesigning the way in which future machinists, technologists,
and engineers are educated at community colleges by using concurrent engineering
principles. Three entry level core courses at Monroe Community College are being
designed for students from all three disciplines (machining, engineering
technology, and engineering science) to take them together. These courses enable
the student to gain a basic understanding of how to design and build engineering
systems. The nine modules in the three courses include both online learning and
traditional class and lab instruction. An interdisciplinary capstone design
course is being created for small, interdisciplinary teams of students in their
final semester from all three majors. Additional project activities include a
student competition and collaborative research with a local company. The project
is also creating and testing low priced, commercially available student kits,
including the hardware and course materials required.

Project evaluation includes an assessment of the impact of the interdisciplinary
approach on student retention as well as the effectiveness of the learning
modules and the quality of the web-based content. Course curriculum is
distributed through the SUNY Faculty Council of Community Colleges and chief
academic officers at each applicable campus. Course hardware and web links are
publicly accessible on-line and the student kits are made commercially
available. Further dissemination includes presentations at national engineering
education conferences and journal article submissions. The project will enhance
our understanding of the interdisciplinary approach on student retention.
