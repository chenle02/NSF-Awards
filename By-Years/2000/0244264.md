This project will investigate apparent rapid changes in global temperature in
the early Danian. The study will use isotopic analyses of planktic and benthic
foraminifers and carbonate content measurements in several high-accumulation
rate deep sea cores to determine the geographic extent and magnitude of a rapid
cooling event in the early Danian that appears to be related to the Chicxulub
impact event and a following warm event termed the Dan C-2 event that is
associated with a large change in carbon isotope values. The study will focus on
records from DSDP 465A and ODP 1049.
