9600876 Hasson Caveolae, or "little caves," are flask-shaped invaginations of
the plasma membrane that have been observed by electron microscopy in many
mammalian cell types. They have been postulated to mediate several cellular
processes, including transport across cells (transcytosis), uptake of small
molecules (potocytosis), and most recently, transmembrane signal transduction.
The caveola is now viewed increasingly as an organelle that plays a critical
role in the organization of communication within cells. The long-term goal of
this project is the elucidation of the structure and function of caveolae
through crystallographic and genetic studies of one of its protein components,
caveolin. During the preliminary stage of the project, to be funded by this
Research Planning Grant, efforts will be concentrated on obtaining diffraction-
quality crystals of a soluble domain of caveolin that mediates oligomerization
and interaction with G. %%% In order for a complex organism (such as a human
being) to exist, the cells that make it up must be able to communicate with each
other. Each cell must be capable of receiving instructions from its environment.
A cell receives many kinds of messages and must choose between many possible
complex responses. We are trying to understand how a normal cell responds
quickly and correctly to each message it receives. It seems that many of the
messages transmitted from outside to inside a cell are organized by caveolae,
"little caves" on the surface of cells. Caveolae seem to act like telephone
switchboards, ensuring that each message is received immediately by the correct
protein target inside the cell. Using the technique of X-ray crystallography, we
are attempting to determine the structure of the protein caveolin, one of the
main components of caveolae, in order to better understand how these
switchboards operate. ***
