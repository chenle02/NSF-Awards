This proposal develops single and double-resonance laser- induced grating
spectroscopy (LIGS) for the study of the structure and decay dynamics of the
excited states of simple molecules. The focus of the work will be to study the
efficacy and the range of applicability of the technique; to make quantitative
interpretations of observed transition intensities in the context of nonlinear
optical physics; and to apply that knowledge to novel studies of small molecules
and ions. As part of the career program, this work contains a special outreach
to enhance the involvement of women and nontraditional students in this joint
research/educational activity.
