ABSTRACT: EIA 0323215, Georgia Tech, H. Mitchell, PI

This project provides support for thirty current and future educators including
faculty from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), minority
serving institutions, public universities that supply teachers and in-service
educators from minority school districts to attend and participate in the
National Educational Computing Conference (NECC) in Seattle, Washington in June,
2003. Extensive dissemination plans are incorporated in the project to insure
that the knowledge gained at the conference will be extended both to others at
the institutions that are participating and to others at other institutions. The
project also includes a substantial evaluation plan. The overall project is
expected to be successful in its goals of increasing awareness and knowledge of
uses of new technology in education to a broad audience.
