9617860 Schrag Previous work by the PI has shown that vertical profiles of the
oxygen isotope ratio in sediment porewaters reflect past changes in ocean bottom
water and can be used to separated the effects of water composition and
temperature upon isotopic signatures in marine carbonates. Preliminary results
suggest that bottom waters and tropical sea surface temperatures during the last
glacial period were significantly colder than at present. The project will
analyze oxygen and hydrogen isotopes and C1 in sediment porewaters from a global
array sites to confirm the preliminary findings and test for regional
differences. Porewater diffusion models will be developed further, and some
initial attempts will be made at applying the results to ocean circulation
models.
