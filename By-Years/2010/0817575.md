With National Science Foundation support Drs James Enloe and Francoise Audouze
will conduct archaeological excavations at the site of Verberie which is located
in France. It is attributed to the Magdalenian culture which was widespread in
Western Europe near the end of the last Ice Age. Magdalenian people at Verberie
and at many other similar sites relied heavily on reindeer for subsistence and
produced art which is world recognized for its quality. Verberie has been the
focus of extended study because of the excellent preservation of faunal remains
and for the fact that artifacts have been moved minimally, if at all, from the
position in which site occupants left them. For open air sites this is extremely
rare. In 2006 a ground penetrating radar survey was conducted and the work is
important not only for what it revealed about the site itself but also for
broader methodological reasons. While this technique has been widely employed in
archaeology, it has been used primarily to search for large and well defined
features such as house remains. At sites such as Verberie which were occupied by
hunters and gathers, such large scale imprints are lacking and the fact that the
remote survey revealed areas of interest is important. With NSF funding provided
by this award, the investigators will be able to ground truth through
archaeological excavation the indications provided by radar. The results, if
positive, will both guide and encourage similar applications at other sites.
They will also provide insight into the social organization and subsistence
adaptations which allowed such groups to florish is a harsh
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes both French and American
researchers and will foster archaeological collaboration between these two
countries. Funding is also provided to permit US students to participate in the
research and thus further their training.
