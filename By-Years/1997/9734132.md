Configurable computing systems combine programmable hardware with programmable
processors to produce an adaptive high-performance system. High-performance
customized digital circuits execute on the programmable hardware, while flexible
software executes on the processor. This project is developing a partial
evaluation approach, in which some parameters of specific computations are
programmed into the hardware. For some problems, such as combinatorial
optimization or factoring, this approach may accelerate performance. Research in
this project concentrates on use of a small number of parameterized macros for
each type of problem. The UCLA Electrical Engineering Department is introducing
a Computer Engineering option into the undergraduate degree. The PSIC effort
will be integrated into the capstone design class for this option. This will
combine all aspects of computer system design in a focused environment. Students
will be attracted to the course material because of its integration into an
advanced research program.
