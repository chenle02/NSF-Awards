This project concerns problems in Atiyah-Singer index theory and several
problems in geometry that are related to Dirac operators and/or singular spaces.
Atiyah-Singer index theory is one of the landmark results of mathematics that
unifies several important developments and results in mathematics and has found
many remarkable applications in mathematics and physics. The problems include
the study of geometric invariants for singular spaces, the use of Dirac
operators in the study of stability problems for Einstein metrics, and the study
of the heat kernel and the Bergman kernel as well as their relation with the
"best" metrics. Part of the project involves graduate students.

Analytic torsion has found many interesting connections and significant
applications, in Seiberg-Witten theory, hyperbolic geometry, and mirror
symmetry. The Cheeger-Muller theorem has played an important role in all of
these. The PI, along with his collaborator and graduate students, would like to
prove the Ray-Singer conjecture/Cheeger-Muller theorem for manifolds with
conical singularities which should help us understand more complicated
singularities. One of the most important and extensively studied areas of
geometry is the study of canonical metrics and it is important to understand the
stability issue associated with variational problems. The PI and his student
will seek better understanding of the stability of Einstein metrics with
positive scalar curvature by exploring the connection with cones and conical
singularity. Bergman kernels and conical singularity have been essential
ingredients in the recent spectacular solutions of the Yau-Tian-Donaldson
conjecture. This proposal aims for the solution of the Ray-Singer conjecture for
manifolds with conical singularity, better understanding of the variational
structure of the total scalar curvature functional, the Bergman kernel, and the
Ricci flow on noncompact manifolds. It also explores the connection with
positive mass theorems.
