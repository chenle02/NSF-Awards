The objective of the Workshop is to explore how recent advances in the natural
sciences and engineering for evaluating the vulnerability of constructed
facilities to seismic hazards and the design of remedial actions may be
exploited to develop an effective preservation methodology for irreplaceable
historic construction. The product of the Workshop will be a research plan for
formulating procedural, analytical, and decision making strategy for
preservation of important historic construction subjected to seismic hazards, to
include a pilot study to serve as a model for future preservation projects.
