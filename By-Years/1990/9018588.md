Although granitic magmas are often invoked as sources of hydrothermal ore
solutions, very little direct evidence exists for a genetic link between a
specific mineral deposit and a specific magmatic body. This link may be provided
by studying the Capitan Pluton and its associated quartz-allanite
mineralization. The evolution and composition of the magmatic fluid phase can be
modeled using the constraints provided by the existing detailed geochemistry of
the Capitan pluton. This will be compared with the composition of the actual
magmatic fluids which were responsible for mineralization. Vein minerals
(quartz, allanite and titanite) and their trapped fluid inclusions will be
analyzed for stable isotope, elemental and gas compositions. Comparison of the
measured fluid composition and the computer-modeled composition should provide
insight into the processes involved in magmatic aqueous fluid evolution.
