Cellular signals in the nervous system create a large demand for new proteins at
synapses far from the cell body. Neurons interpret these signals and increase
protein synthesis (translation) near the synapses in axons and dendrites. This
translation localized to axons and dendrites supports proper nervous system
development and repair as well as basic brain functions including learning,
memory. Importantly, the specific proteins that are synthesized locally in
dendrites and axons is specified by mRNA sequences that specify trafficking to
these distinct locations. Despite this key relationship of mRNA trafficking to
brain function, many fundamental principles of how mRNA trafficking occurs and
is regulated are unknown. Studies of mRNA trafficking within the cytoplasm pose
unique challenges and require single cell, even single molecule analysis in real
time in living cells. This project develops an accessible single molecule assay
with a well-documented mRNA as a paradigm that can be applied to training of
graduate, undergraduate and high school students. Using these assays the
investigators will correlate changes in mRNA movement that occur after
interference with cis-acting sequences or trans-acting factors that affect the
trafficking of this mRNA in growing neurons. These results will uncover the
basis for how mRNA traffics to sites of translation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
integration of the research with the training of the next generation of
scientists is important to the broader impact of this proposal. This project
will fundamentally advance our understanding of neuronal cell biology while at
the same time train the highest quality scientist/educators for this area of
research that is so important to the future scientific efforts of the country.
