This project involves analytical and experimental investigations of
piezoelectric ceramics of chosen three-dimensional geometries leading to
synthesis of three-dimensional piezoceramic microactuators. Preliminary
analytical models based on finite element methods will be developed to predict
the behavior of three-dimensional piezoceramic materials of arbitrary geometries
under a variety of static loading conditions. The goals of the research are: .
To enhance the scope of the finite element based analytical modeling to reliably
predict the behavior of three-dimensional piezoceramic geometries. . To conduct
experimental studies on three-dimensional piezoceramic geometries to investigate
the level of performance of the analytical models, and . To initiate conceptual
designs of three-dimensional piezoceramic microactuators. The long term goal is
to design a practical three-dimensional piezoceramic micropositioning device
capable of executing highly precise translations and rotations, while capable of
exerting large surface forces simultaneously. Such a device would be expected to
significantly advance the state of the art in industrial automation involving
micro-assembly as well as in surgical applications in medicine. ***
