The long term goal of this research is to investigate whether there is
compelling or conclusive evidence of computation in stomatal physiology. Stomata
are tiny pores on the surfaces of leaves that control CO2 and H2O fluxes between
the leaf and the atmosphere. Because stomata have the potential to interact
collectively to process physiological information for the whole leaf, the first
step in this research is to establish that stomata do indeed behave like a
connected network. We will quantify spatial and temporal variation in stomatal
conductance in Xanthium strumarium L. (cocklebur) using chlorophyll fluorescence
imaging and mathematical analysis techniques such as power spectral analysis,
mutual information, and approximate entropy. Sequences of images will be
analyzed for evidence of various long-range spatial and temporal correlations
that have been predicted by computer simulations to characterize collective
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emergence of complexity from simple networks
is one of the most intensely investigated areas in contemporary science. Yet,
there is no 'real' system in which the details of how this emergence occurs have
been established. This research has the potential to do so and to provide
insight into how information is processed in the biological world. Undergraduate
and graduate students will be trained in the interdisciplinary fields of
experimental biology, dynamical systems, and computational science.&lt;br/&gt;
