This SBIR Phase II project will deploy an innovative technology used in academia
into a cost-effective solution for better precision and efficiency in
agricultural practices. The envisioned product is a tool for ordinary farmers to
increase their production and reduce unnecessary and unpredictable costs,
reducing negative impacts on the environment and leading to higher quality food
on the table. By converting once complicated, slow, inaccurate practices of
insect identification to automated and highly accurate and in real time, this
technology will be a part of the automation and data driven industrialization
wave transforming the agricultural sector. The quick reaction to pest
infestation will allow farmers to better target their response, ultimately
making farming more efficient and sustainable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective
pest control in agriculture is imperative for growers to prevent major crop
loss. Certain insect pests are responsible for such significant crop damage
which provokes growers to invest in expensive and time-consuming measures to
minimize pest effects. The reaction of the grower to the pest is time-sensitive;
the timing of the treatment application will directly determine its
effectiveness. The proposed technology is an innovative ground-based sensor
system that detects plurality of airborne pests in real-time along with their
geolocation information. It has capabilities for differentiation and
identification of different insect species detected in flight. The instantaneous
knowledge of the location of the pest allows for a targeted spray rather than
spraying an entire field. Targeted sprays reduce unnecessary spraying and
promote more sustainable pest treatment practices. The low-cost sensor that is
adequately accurate finally places growers a few steps ahead of the problem,
leading them to make wiser treatment decisions such as choosing the time of day
to avoid harming beneficial pests and for mitigating drift. The sensor replaces
and completely automates the current methods for monitoring insect activity in
the crop field, with much better efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
