This program will provide observing time to the astronomical community using the
Georgia State University Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA),
as well as open access to archival CHARA data. Broader impacts of the work
involve training of undergraduate and graduate students in instrumentation
development, including a focused research opportunity for Georgia State
undergraduates to participate in CHARA research. This proposal will also help
fund upgrades to the CHARA Exhibit Hall on Mt. Wilson, which illustrates
interferometry to the general public via displays of historical equipment and
explanations of how the current system works. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHARA
operates an optical/near infrared (OIR) interferometric array on Mount Wilson,
CA. The CHARA Array has six 1-m aperture telescopes in a Y configuration
providing 15 baselines from 33 to 331 meters and ten independent closure phase
triangles. With the number and size of its telescopes, its imaging capabilities,
the length of its baselines, the range of wavelength regimes and spectral
resolutions covered by its beam combiners, the CHARA Array is a uniquely
powerful facility for milliarcsecond imaging. This proposal defines a path to
move optical interferometry from a rather small and experimental group to a
broader user community.
