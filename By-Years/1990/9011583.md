Bacteria able to grow at temperatures at or above 100 degrees C, i.e.,
hyperthermophilic archaebacteria, have only recently been isolated from a
variety of geothermal locations. The work proposed here addresses physiological,
genetic, biochemical and engineering issues for proteolytic enzymes produced by
Pyrococcus furiosus, which has an optimal growth at 100 degrees C. Initial
studies will focus on the use of hyperthermophilic proteases as alternatives to
those currently used in biochemical processing. In addition, issues related to
the extreme thermostability of thermal stable proteases will be investigated to
attempt to determine the structural basis for function at elevated temperatures.
