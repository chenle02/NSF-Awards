Six high need school districts in Southeastern North Carolina, an educational
business and the University of North Carolina at Wilmington (UNCW) form the STAR
(Scholarship Team in Action to Recruit) Program for the purpose of producing
more highly qualified STEM teachers for those school districts. The STAR team
from UNCW consists of six STEM faculty, six education faculty, and one faculty
member on a joint appointment between Marine Science and the School of
Education. In an effort to accommodate the busy and demanding lifestyle of their
student population, both in class and online instruction is included in the
teacher training programs. The goal is to recruit, retain, and induct at least
25 STEM majors and 40 "career changers" into the teaching profession.
