The interactions between scales of motion in the atmosphere is an area of high
research priority. Better understanding of these processes is believed necessary
for improved fundamental understanding and better forecasting of extreme weather
events such as locally heavy rains, severe icing conditions, heavy fogs, etc.
The Principal Investigators will use two advanced numerical models and
diagnostic studies to investigate the important physical factors controlling the
weather within a cyclonic storm system and how small spatial scale disturbances
within the cyclonic system are affected by the larger scale motions and how the
smaller scale systems impact the larger scale cyclone.
