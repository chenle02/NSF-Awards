The objective of this research is to create a miniature surface plasmon sensor
for bioanalyte detection. This will be attempted using microfabrication
techniques, similar to those used in the manufacture of integrated circuits, and
those advanced in the field of microelectromechanical engineering. The research
includes the development of a miniature optical system, consisting of an
electrostatically controlled mirror and a photodiode array. If successful, this
device will eliminate the need for a large, expensive optical bench, which is
usually associated with the detection of surface plasmon resonance. The sensor
also has the potential of very low cost. This project integrates micromechanical
devices with optics, electronics, and chemistry, and requires a multi-
disciplinary team. It is an early potential application of active mechanical
elements in a micro-sensor.
