9416222 Seeber This project combines expertise in three areas to apply
simultaneously earthquake and geologic constraints in the construction of a
three-dimensional deformation model for the Northridge area. A state-of-the-art
visualization and modelling algorithm will be used which allows the shape and
kinematics of structures to vary in all directions and applies deformation
constraints in three dimensions. Surface and near-surface data from the oil
industry will be combined with Northridge aftershock data and data from prior
seismicity. These data will be incorporated into the cross-sections constructed
by collaborators to permit calculation of the convergence rates across the
Transverse Ranges-Los Angeles Basin, and the amount of slip and slip rates of
hidden thrusts. The results of this study will greatly assist understanding of
the subsurface structures of the Los Angeles and San Fernando Valleys, and will
provide much-needed geometrical and kinematic constraints for seismic hazard
interpretations.
