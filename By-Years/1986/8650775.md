The Computer Science Department at Siena will purchase a microVAX II computer,
456 Megabyte disk, Ethernet interface, eight terminals, and ULTRIX software in
order to provide a dedicated laboratory computer for upper-level majors. The
microVAX will be networked to an existing VAX- 11/780 for access to other
printers, disks, and additional software. The microVAX will be used in several
areas. In the Operating Systems course it will give the students a chance to
explore the adjustment of operating system parameters and run benchmark
programs. In a new Systems Programming course it will allow direct access to and
modification of the operating system. Finally, it will be used for student
independent study projects and simulations. The computer will greatly enhance
the opportunity for the study of advanced topics in computer science.
