The project introduces students to modern Radio Frequency (RF) and microwave
measurement techniques via Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and laboratory
experiments. An additional feature of the program is an emphasis on
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)
training. Laboratory experiments include component and system measurements, EMC
and RFI testing, test procedure design, and Automated Test Equipment (ATE)
operation. A Hewlett Packard spectrum analyzer, network analyzer and other test
equipment are being be acquired; all are computer controlled from a Macintosh
via IEEE-488 interface. The equipment is also available to individuals or groups
of students pursuing a RF/microwave senior design project.
