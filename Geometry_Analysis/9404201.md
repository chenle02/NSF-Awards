9404201 Barrett The projects cover problems in the general area of several
complex variables concerning estimates for the Cauchy-Riemann equations on
Riemann surfaces, Poincare series and holomorphic foliations on complex
projective spaces. Some problems related to random walks and queueing theory
will also be pursued. The research has potential applications to other areas of
mathematics such as algebraic geometry and stochastic analysis. ***
