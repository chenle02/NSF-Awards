Indonesia exhibits great linguistic diversity, yet even the most widely spoken
of the Indonesian languages remain poorly studied. Particularly lacking are
systematic phonological studies and instrumental phonetic investigations. The
goal of this project is a detailed phonetic and phonological analysis of several
related Indonesian languages of the Western Austronesian language family
(including Indonesian, Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, and Batak). It will
involve basic description and documentation of these languages, while including
several specific research projects focusing on the phonotactics and prosodic
systems of these languages. Building on these basic descriptions, an
investigation of the influence of regional languages (Javanese and Batak) on the
structure of Indonesian will also be carried out. This work will be carried out
through study of previous sources on these languages, consultations with native
speaker consultants, and acoustic analysis of recordings of multiple speakers.
The end result of the project will include a bibliography on recent work on the
structure of Indonesian languages, a systematic acoustic database analyzing the
phonetic properties of the consonants and vowels of each of these languages,
articles on topics such as stress and the prosodic structure of Indonesian, the
phonetics and phonology of glides, the structure of geminate-singleton
contrasts, and influences on Indonesian of regional languages, and a monograph
on the phonetics and phonology of the languages under investigation. The project
will have the dual purpose of providing a comprehensive understanding of several
languages meriting fuller study, while at the same time providing a new source
of data for the testing of linguistic theories, thereby broadening our
understanding of the nature of human language.
