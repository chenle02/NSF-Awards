This project focuses on the design of approximation algorithms for NP-hard
problems arising in two important application areas: (1) design of networks and
(2) computational molecular biology. The work involves the development of
general techniques to solve classes of problems in both areas, applying and
extending tools from the area of approximation algorithms, such as the primal-
dual schema, bicriteria formulations and approximations, and using graph-
theoretic arguments in the proof of performance guarantee. In particular, the
issues addressed in the area of network design include improved algorithm for
minimum-cost survivable network design by extending the primal-dual method, and
a generalization of the Steiner tree problem with covering requirements. In the
area of computational molecular biology, the areas of investigation include the
application of bicriteria approximation methods to the physical map assembly
problem, and fundamental questions in multiple sequence alignments -- local,
global and tree based. The Integrated Educational Plan of this CAREER Grant
includes (a) participating as Resident Scientist in the DIMACS High School
Teacher Education Program in Computational Biology, (b) developing a``more
modern'' undergraduate cross-disciplinary computational biology at CMU, (c)
establishing and running a graduate research seminar for doctoral students in
the Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization Doctoral Program at CMU, and (d)
developing new graduate courses in network design and approximation
algorithms.***
