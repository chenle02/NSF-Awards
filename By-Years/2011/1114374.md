Gravitational wave astrophysics is entering a new era of discovery and
exploration, with first detections expected within the next few years with
Advanced LIGO. One of the key missions of the LIGO project is to test Einstein's
theory of General Relativity where it has never been tested before: where the
gravitational forces are enormous compared to those found in the solar system.
Such a task is achievable because gravitational waves encode information about
the strong gravitational forces present when black holes and neutron stars
collide to produce gravitational waves. This award supports a research program
to develop and implement a generic and model-independent framework to test
Einstein's theory of General Relativity and to search for anomalous deviations
from it in gravitational wave data. The necessary tools to achieve this
objective will be developed and implemented, so that they can be readily
deployed in LIGO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will enable exploitation of
the full discovery potential of gravitational wave detection. This type of
research is also timely and relevant, in view of upcoming, advanced detectors
and the dawn of gravitational wave astrophysics. While the detection of a
departure from Einstein's predictions could signal transformative new physics,
the absence of such departures could provide strong confirmation for general
relativity in an as yet untested regime.
