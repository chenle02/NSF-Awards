This award is a renewal of financial support by the NSF for U.S. participation
in the International Geological Correlation Program (IGCP). It is submitted by
the American Geological Institute on behalf of the U.S. National Committee
(USNC) for IGCP. This proposal encompasses 17 projects at an average cost of
$5,000 each. The budget of each project has been reviewed by the USNC for IGCP.
IGCP is a multidisciplinary scientific program established in its present form
in 1973, sponsored jointly by the International Union of Geological Sciences
(IUGS) and by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization. The principal goal of IGCP is to promote international cooperation
in research on global geologic problems, with emphasis on the nature and
sequence of major geologic events, geologic hazards and energy and mineral
resources. Program work is carried out through 52 individual research projects,
17 of which have U.S. working groups.
