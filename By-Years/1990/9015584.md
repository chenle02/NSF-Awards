southeastern United States. It will provide operations management and
information services and it will give Northeast Louisiana University a 56
thousand bits per second connection the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million
bits per second) National Backbone network. The University needs greater

unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational resources.
