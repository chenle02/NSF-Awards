This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at
developing a general platform for conducting combinatorial auctions. It is
proposed to develop a bidding language and user interface, along with a system
architecture for an integrated combinatorial auction platform that can be used
to facilitate combinatorial auctions. The system will provide a wide degree of
flexibility in terms of the number of rounds, stopping rules, and bidder and/or
object-specific constraints that can be implemented. If successful, this project
will lead to a development of a combinatorial auction system that will become a
standard part of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and will greatly
enhance electronic procurement in business-to-business environments.

Some examples of industries that can benefit from combinatorial auctions
include: airport time slots for flights; shipping and transportation companies,
as well as the retailers and manufacturers who use these shippers; computer
hardware manufacturers, as well as auto manufacturers who can use combinatorial
auctions for material procurement; and television networks who can use
combinatorial auctions to sell advertising space in TV shows.
