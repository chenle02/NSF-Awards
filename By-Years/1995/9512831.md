9512831 Zelevinsky The proposed research is aimed at clarification of key
problems in collective phenomena and quantum chaos. Quantum chaotic dynamics is
a common phenomenon in many branches of physics. The knowledge accumulated in
the model studies has to be applied to realistic quantum systems. The first
steps are already carried out in physics of atoms, molecules and disordered
solids. Nuclear structure and reactions give a generic example of a quantum
many-body system with strong interaction where we can make progress both in
understanding quantum chaos and in specific problems of nuclear physics. The
applications include onset of chaos in nuclei; common features and differences
between "one-body" and "many- body" chaos; coexistence and complex interplay of
regular and chaotic dynamics; damping of collective motion; phase transitions,
thermalization and decoherence in a closed mesoscopic system with no external
heat bath; chaotic dynamics and collectively in an open system with finite
lifetime and in loosely bound nuclei; enhancement of weak interactions in
compound states. Application to other systems including random meson fields and
the structure of physical vacuum also should be explored.
