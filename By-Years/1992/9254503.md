The AAAS's Project on Science Technology and Disability has developed and
published four concise brochures as a series to serve as comprehensive
accessibility guides for research directors, meeting conveners, department
heads, and professors so that all aspects of their programs will be accessible
to scientists, engineers, and students with disabilities. The series includes
the following: Barrier-Free: Workshops and Conferences for Scientists and
Engineers, Barrier-Free: Laboratories and Classrooms in Science and Engineering,
Barrier-Free: Access to Science Literacy, and Barrier-Free: Access in Word and
Deed. The existence of the series has been widely publicized and requests have
exceeded expectations. The original plan was to have the series available at
AAAS and other scientific meetings but the AAAS has received requests for the
series by mail daily. They are no longer able to honor the requests without some
financial support. This project will provide funds for postage and secretarial
assistance. The passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act has made the
dissemination of the Barrier-Free series timely. This project will aid in
efforts to remove barriers which have, in the past, prevented scientists and
students with disabilities to fully participate in scientific research and
studies.
