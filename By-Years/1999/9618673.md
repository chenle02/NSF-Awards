9618673 Housen This project will identify the degree of diagenesis of magnetic
minerals in sediments from he Barbados, Cascadia and Nankai prisms. Magnetic
anisotropy can reveal deformation, but only if diagenesis can be accounted for.
The PI will compare magnetic, sedimentologic and chemical properties of samples
taken from the prisms with those of equivalent age from cores seaward of the
prisms.
