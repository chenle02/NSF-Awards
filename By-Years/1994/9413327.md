Abstract ATM-9413327 Hughes, Malcolm University of Arizona Title: A
Multimillennial Temperature Reconstruction from Far Northeastern Eurasia There
is a real possibility that a multimillennial tree-ring chronology extending over
most or all of the Holocene could be built in far north-eastern Siberia. This
SGER award supports exploratory field work and dendrochronological analysis of
subfossil material from Arctic - Siberia. Experience with larch trees elsewhere
in Siberia strongly suggests that a valuable reconstruction of summer
temperatures could be derived from this material. This would form a key part of
a network of high-latitude temperature records, including tree-ring based
constructions from Scandinavia, the Polar Urals and Alaska, and ice-cores from
Greenland and other locations. Such a chronology could also be used to date
subfossil wood from many locations within the region, and hence to contribute to
the study of northern treeline dynamics through the Holocene.
