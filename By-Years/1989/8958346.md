The primary research objective is to implement a program in which the nonlinear
and unsteady fluid-body interaction problems that constitutes a free surface are
solved accurately and efficiently. Such problems are, for instance, the
determination of exciting forces and responses of ships and platforms which are
either partially restrained or freely floating, and of submerged bodies, like
fixed and catenary pipelines in the coastal areas, Because of the computational
difficulties in solving the exact governing equation of an Eulerian fluid
subject to exact free-surface and solid-boundary conditions, most of the present
research in this area is either concentrated on the solution of linear problems
or on empirical methods. The computational hydrodynamics research program
proposed here will start with the determination of the relative efficiency and
accuracy of several major numerical methods, such as the boundary-element,
finite-difference, marker- cell and finite-element methods in solving the exact
equations of potential theory for simple boundary geometries. Because of the
rather simple body geometries chosen initially, we will be also able to
theoretically analyze the same problems by higher-order perturbation methods and
compare the results with the numerical predictions.
