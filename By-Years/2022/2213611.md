This award supports the organization of a National Science Foundation
Directorate for Engineering 2022 Faculty Early Career Development Program
(CAREER) Proposal Writing Workshop. The workshop will be held virtually in the
Spring of 2022, and it is expected that there will be about 600 attendees. The
workshop will take place over three days and will include interactive sessions
on good proposal writing practices, reflections by previous CAREER awardees, and
a mock CAREER proposal panel review. The attendees will also have an opportunity
to interact with current NSF Program Directors both in one-on-one and in mock
panel sessions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will help to prepare CAREER
program eligible faculty for careers in education and research by giving them
tools and skills of good proposal writing for submissions to the CAREER program
as well as core NSF programs. The objectives of the workshop include training
for junior faculty with an emphasis on women and underrepresented minorities in
engineering. A special additional emphasis will be placed on encouraging CAREER
program eligible faculty from non-"Research-1" institutions to apply for
participation. The workshop will serve as an introduction to NSF for many new
researchers. The workshop will help participants to clarify their research and
education career plans and to understand the need to clearly articulate these
plans to external reviewers. In addition, the workshop includes mock panel
sessions to give participants the experience of simulated panel evaluation
discussions. All of the content and experiences will help attendees enrich their
skills for writing successful research proposals on impactful research that
benefits societal needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
