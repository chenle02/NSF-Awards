Rodl 9704114 This award provides funds for an investigation into some research
topics in three areas of discrete mathematics - Extremal Combinatorics, Ramsey
Theory and Probabilistic Methods. Extremal combinatorics is an important part of
combinatorial mathematics. For example a typical problem in graph theory is as
follows: given a graph F determine the maximum number ex (n,F) of edges in a
graph of order n not containing F. Ramsey theory investigates structures that
are preserved under restricted partitions. Naturally, the classical example is
the theorem of Ramsey that, in its simplest form, tells us that arbitrarily
large 2-edge-colored complete graphs must contain arbitrarily large
monochromatic complete subgraphs. Here the partition is given by the coloring
and the structures that are preserved under this partition are the complete
graphs. Probabilistic Methods have proved to be a powerful technique in
combinatorics, and the theory of random graphs is a branch of graph theory that
has emerged from these methods. Over the last three years, the proposer's
research was mainly concentrated within these areas. The work in this project
will include some problems in Ramsey theory, problems involved with possible
extensions of the regularity lemma, extremal properties of random graphs,
problems on delta systems and others. This research is in the area of
combinatorics. One of the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods of
studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of
discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example,
the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and
the design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects,
and this makes use of combinatorial research.
