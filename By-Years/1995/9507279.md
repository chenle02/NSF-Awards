This project, to be conducted under the guidance of the US National Committee
for the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) of the
International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), will consist of an
interdisciplinary study of international access to scientific and technical
(S&amp;T) data. The primary focus of the study will be on d ata in electronic
form, a topic of increasing complexity and importance in scientific research and
international collaboration. It will begin by outlining the needs for data in
the major research areas of current scientific interest in the astronomical,
biological, geological and physical sciences. It will then characterize the
legal, economic, policy, and technical factors and trends that have an influence
on access to data by the scientific community. It will also identify and analyze
the barriers to international access to S&amp;T data. The study will recommend
approaches that might help overcome barriers to access in the international
context. NSF is sharing support for this project w ith several other Government
agencies, including DoE, NASA, NIH, NIST and NOAA.
