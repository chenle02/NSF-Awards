As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments,
the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative resources
for use in a variety of settings. This project aims to enhance the National
Parks System in the U.S. by engaging the system as a resource for science
education. The advantage of using national parks for science education is that
they are natural settings with dynamic changes and offering countless avenues
for citizen inquiry. The project will build collaborations between park-based
scientists whose work happens out of the public eye and interpreters who are
visible to millions of annual visitors. Based on pilot studies done at Carlsbad
Caverns National Park, the researchers will extend this work in six national
parks with different characteristics. Partners in this endeavor include Winston-
Salem State University, and TERC, Inc.

This project's goal is to establish a model for how national parks can be
resources for science education and learning. The project will concentrate on
the that is being done in six national parks, by scientists who are generally
from academic institutions. The scientists have selected each park for research
because of its unique features, for example, Carlsbad Caverns' unique feature is
its bat population. The main methodology of this proposed effort is to translate
these research endeavors and results from the scientists to the park visitors in
such ways as to make the process enjoyable, informative, and thought-provoking.
Evaluation elements will be included every step in this process in order to not
only determine if learning has occurred but also how effectively the science has
been translated.
