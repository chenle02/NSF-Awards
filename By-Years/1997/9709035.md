9709035 Rigsby Because it is Lake Titicaca's only distributary, the Rio
Desaguadero plays a key role in our understanding of paleoclimate on the
Bolivian Altiplano. This SGER research project is designed to delineate the
changes in fluvial conditions that occurred in the Rio Desaguader valley during
the latest Pleistocene and Holocene and to correlate those changes to changes in
the level of Lake Titicaca. As such, this study will establish the relationship
between the history of river sedimentation and the history of Lake Titicaca and
the lakes and salars of the Southern Altiplano. These relationships will be
determined through detailed stratigraphic and sedimentologic analysis of the
strata preserved in the flood plain deposits of the modern Desagadero.
