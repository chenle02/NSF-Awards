The focus of this research is on the design and manufacture of electronic
circuits at the submicron range for logic, analog, and mixed-signal
applications. This new approach to robust design uses an interval bound
description rather than statistical description of variable parameters
associated with the manufacturing process. Evaluation of performance utilizes
advanced mixed-mode circuit simulators in which carrier dymanics within
semiconductor devices and interconnects are modeled at the application level.
The focus is on the design of algorithms with the long term goal of developing
tools to aid in the analysis and design of complex VLSI circuits . Initial
examples being considered are a CMOS differential amplifier and a CMOS inverter.
