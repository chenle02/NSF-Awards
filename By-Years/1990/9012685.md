Because of recent scientific developments, philosophers of science have become
increasingly interested in the ideas of probabilistic causation and explanation.
This contrasts with deterministic causation, in which causes are conceived as
necessitating their effects, and with theories of explanation in which
explanatory data are required logically to imply that the relevant phenomenon
occurs. Under a previous NSF grant, Dr. Eells wrote a book, Probabilistic
Causality, where he distinguished type level causation (about causal relations
in general between factors or properties) from token level causation (about
causal relations between actual, concrete events), and he developed a new
probabilistic theory for the token level. The primary aim of this new project is
to apply the token level theory of Probabilistic Causality to the proper
understanding of explanation of particular events. The idea of causation is
integral to the theory of explanation, but the extension of a theory of
causation to a theory of explanation is intricate. Because of analogies between
Dr. Eells' token level theory of causation and Professor Salmon's theory of
causal process presented in 1984, it seems that Dr. Eells theories developed in
his book can be extended in ways that can improve upon Salmon's ideas involving
causation in the theory of explanation. Under this grant, Dr. Eells is carrying
out the work of making this extension from the theory of causation to a
probabilistic theory of explanation.
