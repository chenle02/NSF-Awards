This project investigates the evolutionary relationships among three groups of
free-living flatworms. A highly conserved gene of the mitochondrial DNA will be
amplified using a new technique called the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR.
Once amplified, the gene will be sequenced. The amplified products will also be
used to clone larger pieces of the mitochondrial DNA with which the order of
other mitochondrial genes can be determined. Mitochondrial DNA gene order will
be used to determine evolutionary relationships among the three groups of
flatworms. This information will be a beginning for a long-term study on
mitochondrial gene order and gene sequences of nuclear DNA of representatives of
an entire family of flatworms. Many flatworms hold a key position in theories on
the origin of multicellular animals. Therefore, a better understanding of
relationships among flatworms will also have implications for a better
understanding of the evolution of multicellular animals.
