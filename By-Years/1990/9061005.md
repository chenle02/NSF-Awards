There is a stated need for low-temperature processes for the deposition of
semiconductor devices on top of insulators. In particular, nonlinear devices are
needed in the liquid crystal display industry in active matrix liquid crystal
displays. The maximum size of displays is limited in part by the difficulty in
producing small, nonlinear devices over large area glass substrates. This
proposal addresses a possible solution to this problem: the fabrication of
semiconductor devices through the use of a spin- coatable semiconducting polymer
coating. Previously, the insolubility of semiconducting polymer coating which is
sufficiently soluble in organic solvents to produce spin-coated films of
thicknesses from 0.1 micron to 4 microns with a resistivity ranging from 10 to
300 ohm cm. The polymer is a substituted version of polyaniline. We propose to
determine the feasibility of using Brewer Science's spin-coatable semiconducting
polymer to make nonlinear electrical devices, such as diodes and thin film
transistors, of the type that would be used in active matrix liquid crystal
displays. These devices could be used in other general applications as well.
