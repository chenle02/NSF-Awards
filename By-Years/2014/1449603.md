A low cost and accurate motion capture system is a fundamental improvement in
the technology that is available to physician, physical therapists, and other
medical professionals to diagnosis, treat, and monitor patients with movement
disorders in the lower-extremity. Currently motion analysis systems cost tens of
thousands dollars; require dedicated space and special training for operations.
Therefore the cost to perform motion analysis is up to one thousand dollars per
session and only available in large hospitals. The availability of low-cost
depth cameras brings the possibility to perform motion analysis with a fraction
of the current cost. In this proposal, the team has developed a clinically
viable 3D markerless motion capture system that meets the strident needs of the
medical community for a high accuracy and precision as well as convenience and
affordability.

The team proposes to use a commercially available depth and color camera to
accurately and precisely define movement mechanics of injured populations. The
team has developed an effective system for human pose tracking that achieves
comparative accuracy to marker-based systems. Moreover, the team has developed
novel algorithms for complex human pose tracking in general scenes that achieves
state-of-the-art results. The proposed system will build upon the current
pipeline of novel algorithms to achieve higher accuracy and robustness for the
relatively better controlled motions commonly used in clinics.
