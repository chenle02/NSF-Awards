The investigator proposes to study diagenetic modifications in transgressive-
regressive depositional sequences. This systematic study will include three
major components: a) detailed geochemical and petrographic characterization of
transgressive-regressive Tertiary sequences of Northern Puerto Rico; b)
geochemical modelling of transgressive-regressive diagenetic settings using the
empirical data to constrain models; and c) detailed geochemical and petrographic
study of a Paleozoic sequence in the central North American midcontinent to test
applicability of such models and usefulness of Tertiary analogues for the
Paleozoic. Petrographic characterization will include conventional petrographic
examination of polished slabs and thin sections under binocular microscopes and
polarizing microscopes, examination of polished thin slabs and thin sections
using cathodoluminescence and fluorescence microscopy, and examination by
scanning electron microscopy. The geochemical characterization of selected
componenets will include minor, trace and ultra-trace element determinations,
carbon and oxygen stable isotope compositions and 87Sr/86Sr determinations.
Modelling will include geochemical modelling of fluid chemistry and mineral
stability of the systems to assess the thermodynamic limitations of the system,
and diagenesis-sea level oscillation models to evaluate a broad range of
scenarios that could be present in the gologic record.
