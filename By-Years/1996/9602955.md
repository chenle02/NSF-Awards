This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in molecular
biochemistry between Arthur Pardi of the University of Colorado and Dominique
Marion of the Structural Biology Institute at the French National Center for
Scientific Research. The project also provides travel support for a postdoctoral
researcher and graduate student. The objective of the research is to probe the
dynamics of proteins in solutions by applying NMR relaxation techniques
developed by the French laboratory. This project takes advantage of French
expertise and will advance understanding of the role of dynamics in site-
specific cleavage of RNA substrates by ribozymes.
