9724353 Camper The Center for Biofilm Engineering, an Engineering Directorate
supported research center, is a world recognized leader in biofilm science and
engineering. One of the most valuable tools used in the study of films and
coatings is a confocal scanning laser microscope (cslm) which provides the
ability to study films at various depths and "ages". The Center purchased a cslm
shortly after the programs initiation in 1990, and it has been used extensively
since then. It has been key to over 100 papers during that span, and has been a
part of over 50 theses. An outreach training laboratory centered around the cslm
is being developed. The new unit will replace the original unit which is deemed
obsolete. New features include the ability to use new probes, 3-dimensional
visualization of the data, optical cross-sectioning and increased resolution and
image clarity. The instrument will be used for programs on bioremediation,
biocide efficiency, microbial-induced corrosion, oral health care, etc. ***
