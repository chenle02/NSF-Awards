The proposed research is a mathematical investigation into two broad areas of
evolutionary theory: molecular evolution and the evolution of quantitative
traits. The primary goal of the work on molecular evolution is to understand why
there is so much variation in the genetic material, DNA, between species and
between individuals within a species. One theory regards most of this variation
as meaningless, having no functional consequences whatsoever. The theory that we
are investigating argues that most of this variation does have biological
consequences. Our approach to the problem involves a comparison of the
predictions of each theory to the patterns observed in actual DNA sequences.
This work is of potential value for our understanding of genetic variation
susceptibility be viewed as due to many small mutations in DNA or to a few large
ones? Our work is relevant to the former possibility. The primary goal of the
work on quantitative genetics is to understand the genetic basis of variation in
measurable traits, such as size or weight, both within and between species. The
great conceptual problem in this work is to formalize the combined effects of
many genes to interact with one another (through dominance and epistasis) in a
way that adds biological relevance that was missing from previous models. Once
the theory is in place, it will be used to investigate several problems of
evolutionary interest. This work will be very important for agriculture, where
practitioners require better theories of the genetic basis of traits, such as
milk yield in cattle, that are of economic importance.
