The chemistry of N-aminoaziridines as chiral auxiliaries in hydrazone
alkylations and other reactions will be thoroughly explored. The chemistry
should allow the preparation of 1,3-skipped polymethylated carbon chains in a
highly convergent and enantioselective manner. Extensions to Shapiro-type
elimination reactions promise to result in efficient new methods of chiral
alkene construction. The methodology will be applied to the synthesis of the
macrolactone antibiotic venturicin. %%% With this award, the Organic Synthesis
Program will support the research of Dr. A. Richard Chamberlin at the Unversity
of California-Irvine. The research explores the development of chiral
methodologies for synthesis of the important polyol and polypropionate
structures found in important antibiotic families. This should benefit research
in biochemistry and medicine, as well as in the chemical industry.
