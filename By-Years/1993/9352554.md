The project will purchase computer and software equipment to develop molecular
modeling curricula to meet two instructional goals: to introduce undergraduates
to molecular modeling methodology, and to use molecular modeling to enhance
student's understanding of molecular structure and energetics. The practice will
be integrated vertically into the undergraduate chemistry laboratories, from the
introductory level through senior-level. Students will investigate the structure
of molecules, the effect of structural changes on the energy of molecules, and
the effect of orbital electron spin density on the formation of chemical
reaction products. In upper-level laboratories, modeling will be implemented on
a SGI Indigo computer workstation. Students will investigate potential energy
surfaces of chemical reactions, molecular dynamics of proteins, and
electrostatic interactions between ligands and chelators.
