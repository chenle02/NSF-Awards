Drs. Curtiss and Lange will collaborate to develop visible and near infrared
(VNIR) reflectance spectroscopy as a non- destructive technique for the
determination of the mineralogical composition of jade and related stone
artifacts. The technique will be refined by the detailed study of the
reflectance spectra of a well characterized set of archaeological and geological
samples. The mineral and chemical compositions of these samples will be defined
using the techniques of X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, electron
microprobe analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and petrographic thin section
analysis. Working with samples of known provenience, the investigators will
determine the extent to which sample homogeneity exists within a single source
area and the extent to which different source areas vary from each other. If
successful, the technique can provide a non- destructive way to match jade
archaeological objects to source areas. Through much of Middle America and the
American Southwest, jade functioned as a prestige item and is often recovered in
archaeological contexts. It is likely that this valued item was traded over long
distances, and therefore, if an accurate non- destructive sourcing method were
developed, archaeologists could reconstruct trade routes. A number of important
questions could then be answered. It has been argued, for example, that the
complex societies which emerged in the Southwest U.S.A. are the result of
contact with even more highly developed Mexican groups. One argument used to
support this contention is the presence of jade objects. However, the sources of
this jade is unknown and until it is proven (or disproved) that the source lies
to the South, the issue is still in doubt. Secondly, many archaeologists believe
that the emergence of large scale societies is directly related to the
development and control of trade networks. Thus, techniques which can match
objects in archeological sites to raw material sources can help to answer this
question. This research is important because it may provide a valuable new tool
for archaeologists. Since it is non-destructive, it can be applied to museum
specimens and significantly increase the knowledge which may be gained from
them.
