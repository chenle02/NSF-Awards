This grant supports a program of workshops, conferences and seminars organized
under the auspices of the Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social
Sciences (IMSSS) at Stanford University for the summer of 1987. One of the major
objectives of this program is to reshape modern economic theory to better
capture such realistic features of a market economy as the failure of markets to
clear instantly, coalition formation, imperfect and differential information,
power, price linkages, and taxation. The large number of jointly authored papers
resulting from past IMSSS summer programs, often with some of the authors moving
into new fields, is evidence of the interaction of the participants in the
workshops. Professor Kurz is a distinguished economic theorist and the organizer
of many successful IMSSS conferences in the past. He is well-qualified to
continue to organize this conference.
