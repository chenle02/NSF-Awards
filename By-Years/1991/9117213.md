This award provides 50 per cent funding for the purchase of equipment to be
installed and operated in the Paleomagnetics Laboratory of the Department of
Geosciences at the University of Arizona. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary to acquire the equipment. The equipment
consists of a computer workstation, a pulse magnetizer, a magnetic
susceptibility and anisotropy meter system, and parts for rebuilding a thermal
demagnetizer system. The Paleomagnetics Laboratory is engaged in a variety of
research projects currently focussed on understanding the apparent polar
wandering paths extending back through the geologic past as reconstructed from
rock paleomagnetic measurements. A better understanding of these measurements
has important implications for piecing together the history of the formation of
continental masses.
