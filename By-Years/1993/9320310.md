9320310 Kingsland Charles Darwin offered his theory of evolution based on
natural selection in 1859. Yet it was not widely accepted in the United States
until the 1930's and 40's until the "evolutionary biology synthesis" when
Darwinian natural selection was shown to be compatible with population genetics
(which had replaced Mendelian genetics). Dr. Kingsland is investigating the rise
of experimental biology in the United States. It was this experimental biology
that set the framework for the reconciliation of Darwinian theory with genetics.
Dr, Kingsland is combining a history of scientific ideas and practice with a
study of the institutional, social, and cultural context of science. She is
using this study of experimental evolution to address larger themes about the
character of American science in the formative years of the 20th century.
Specifically, she is addressing: 1. The American response to German work in
evolutionary biology, especially the response to August Weismann; 2. The
American response to mutation theory: a case study used to examine the economic,
cultural, and institutional factors that encouraged an experimental approach to
evolution; 3. The rise and fall of Lamarckian theories of evolution in the
American context; and 4. The problem of sex determination as a case study of the
role of gender in the American context. She is also examining the social
processes of cooperation and competition that influence the growth of scientific
knowledge. ***
