9703966 Eliel This award will support various activities of the U.S.Mexico
Foundation for Science, a bilateral, non-governmental organization established
in 1991 to bring about closer ties in science and technology between the United
States and Mexico. An initial commitment of $2 million from each country and
funds from the private sector have allowed the Foundation to support two rounds
of collaborative research, underwrite summer grants for young Mexican faculty to
spend time with senior U.S. investigators, and provide fellowships for graduate
students to complete their thesis work at U.S. laboratories. In addition, the
Foundation has supported the travel of outstanding scientists and engineers to
Mexico for lectures and scientific interactions. The Foundation intends to use
these funds to support visits by distinguished U.S. experts to Mexico, summer
visits by young Mexican faculty to the U.S., academic year fellowships for
Mexican graduate students to U.S. universities, and a workshop to deal with
environmental issues on the U.S.Mexico border. This United States contribution
includes funds provided by the National Science Foundation and the Environmental
Protection Agency. ***
