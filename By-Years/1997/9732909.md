This project supports measurements of halogen oxides (ClO and BrO) in the lower
stratosphere from balloon platforms. Four balloons per year will be launched
near Laramie, WY. A new lightweight instrument will be deployed together with
light scattering instruments (built by Prof. Deshler, U. Wyoming) that measure
particle size distributions and number densities of atmospheric aerosols. Ozone
will be also measured using electrochemical cells. Once per year, measurements
of carbon dioxide and particle mass and composition will be added. &lt;br/&gt;
The objectives of this work are to characterize the seasonal variability of the
halogen oxides, species that respond to changes in solar illumination,
temperature, trace gas distributions, and aerosol concentrations, and address
the following outstanding issues: (1) How variable, seasonally and
interannually, are abundances of ClO and BrO in the lower stratosphere today?
(2) How much of this variability can be attributed to heterogeneous chemistry
and to changes in aerosol surface area? (3) What are the relative contributions
of particle size, surface area, and temperature to heterogeneous chemistry and
halogen activation? (5) Do cirrus clouds activate chlorine in the lower
stratosphere and upper troposphere?&lt;br/&gt;
