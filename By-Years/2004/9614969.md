9614969 Friedman This award is for support for a one year study to further test
the use of bacteria preserved in permafrost, as indicators of paleoclimate at
the time the sediments were deposited and frozen. Changes in climate, especially
major ones, are thought to be recognizable in the bacterial fingerprints of the
sediment layers. A one year pilot project was conducted in which drilling was
performed and cores were collected at a number of sites in the McMurdo Dry
Valleys region of Antarctica. Viable bacteria and bacterial products (methane
and enzymes) were found in the cores. The ice content of all samples was
unexpectedly high (at least 25% and up to over 50%). These results provide
strong support to the idea that Martian permafrost may contain ground ice and
that ancient permafrost on Mars may contain samples-possibly viable-of life
forms from an earlier, wetter period. Continued analyses of the existing core
samples will be undertaken in this project
