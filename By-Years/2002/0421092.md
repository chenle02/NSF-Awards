This proposal, supporting emerging directions in mixed-signal electronic systems
and in (re-)configurable computing, aims at acquiring a collection of hardware
equipment to enable hardware-related research in several areas including analog
and mixed signal design, CAD for reconfigurable computing projects, and several
reconfigurable computing system projects. This research and training facility
centers on electronic simulation, rapid prototyping, and testing. Projects
specifically address, among others, distributed simulation, MEMS built-in self-
test, FPGA CAD environments, reconfigurable computing analysis and adaptation,
power-aware FPGA design mapping. The major pieces of the infrastructure include
a printed circuit board station, electronic test instruments, reconfigurable
computing boards, and optical test equipment. The facility enables realistic
hardware experimentation, analysis, and demonstration of the research ideas
previously verified largely by simulations in mixed-signal electronic systems
and in configurable computing.

Broader Impact: Impacts future research directions, graduate students and
collaborators; impacts courses, and further extends educational opportunities to
minority students. 20 universities will share the equipment. The project also
encourages more industrial collaboration.
