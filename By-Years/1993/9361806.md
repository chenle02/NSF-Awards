9361806 LEONARD All of the marine invertebrates of current interest in bio-
active products research are sessile benthic suspension feeders. Past research
on similar species leads one to surmise that fluid motion is likely to have
profound influence over virtually all aspects of their life histories. However,
the flow biology of many invertebrates of biochemical interest is completely
unknown. This research is to develop a system that is capable of detecting
sensitivity and dependency on flow in benthic marine invertebrates currently in
aquacultural development. This technology will be used in commercial aquaculture
development as a tool for bringing new benthic invertebrate species into
culture, and for defining flow conditions of optimal biomass and natural product
yield in aquaculture.
