This project has two strands: algebraic versus geometric invariants of groups,
and exploring non-positively curved groups. Both fall within the orbit of
Gromov's study of infinite discrete groups through large-scale geometry, heavily
driven by parallels with Riemannian geometry. The first focuses on filling
invariants, which concern the geometric features of discs spanning loops ("soap
film geometry") in spaces associated with groups. The second concerns how
notions of non-positive curvature in group theory interrelate and the wildness
present in non?positively curved groups, particularly in their conjugacy
problems and subgroups.

The work falls within the subject of Geometric Group Theory, which concerns
infinite groups and the spaces on which they act. Its roots lie in the early
20th century, particularly in low-dimensional and algebraic topology. It has
taken off since the late 1980s when it became clear that geometric features of
the spaces involved have profound repercussions for the algebraic structure of
the groups. Rich interactions have ensued with, for example, Riemannian
geometry, probability, Lie groups, dynamical systems, ergodic theory,
combinatorics, computer science and logic. In addition to the research work, a
course in Geometry and Topology will be deigned for undergraduates whose studies
who are not primarily concentrated in mathematics.
