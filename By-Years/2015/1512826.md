Abstract

Optogenetic control of neuronal activity has become a driving force in
neuroscience research but its clinical application has been limited due to the
fact that delivery of physical light into the brain poses a technical burden.
This proposal aims to develop novel optogenetic probes that can report neuronal
activity in a non-invasive manner and provide neuromodulation throughout the
brain.

This project will develop layers of spatiotemporal control over optogenetic
activation by a diffusible chemical (drug) in combination with activity-
dependent expression and activation. Neuromodulation will be delivered to
neurons autonomously only when and where it is needed. These new reagents will
offer two new versatile methods of probing neural circuitry in a noninvasive
manner: optically reporting neural activity via bioluminescence and perturbing
neural circuitry in a closed-loop fashion. This will be particularly important
for conducting long term invivo studies and future clinical translation.
