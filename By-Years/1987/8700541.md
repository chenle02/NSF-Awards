Acquisition of the secondary ion mass spectrometer will allow faculty and
students to accomplish a more sophisticated and detailed study of advanced
devices and processing techniques and also enable the school to establish a
higher level of engineering research effort in semiconductor devices and thin
film structure. The research effort should help to generate improvements in
productivity and the foreign competitive position for a variety of firms
involved in semiconductor technology. The equipment will allow the school to
provide undergraduates the critical skills required in solid state device
technology along with preparing them for further work at the graduate level.
