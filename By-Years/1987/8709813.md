Members of the palm family (Arecaceae), like most other monocotyledons, have a
unique organ, the haustorium, which functions during germination and seedling
establishment. It is the distal portion of the cotyledon which remains within
the seed and grows in conjunction with endosperm degradation. This project (with
a structural emphasis) employing a multidisciplinary approach is proposed to
elucidate the function of the haustorium and the interaction between the
haustorium and endosperm tissue. Structural and functional aspects of the
interaction of the haustorium and endosperm tissue in the palm family will be
conducted by 1) studying seed structure and developmental changes accompanying
germination in the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera), 2) observing phosphate uptake
and development of haustorial phosphate granules and their structural
characteristics using chemical and physical fixation conditions and 3) using
enzyme assays and techniques of localization on sections to determine the
location and controls of hydrolase production. The plants Dr. De Mason is
working with are economically and scientifically important and little
understood. These studies will lead to a better basic understanding of the
processes that occur during germination of palm seeds and the role of the
haustorium in germination.
