In the past few years there has been a growing number of connections between
enumerative algebraic geometry, in particularly Gromov-Witten theory, and the
algebraic combinatorics, in particular Young tableaux identities. The proposer
intend to pursue the study of combinatorial bijections related to these
identities. In particular, he intends to investigate multi-weighted analogues of
certain classical combinatorial identities which also arise naturally from the
representation theory of the symmetric group. He also intends to pursue both
enumerative, algebraic and probabilistic applications of the discrete random
processes for generation of weighted Young tableaux.

Young tableaux are basic combinatorial structure which were introduced over a
hundred years ago in connection with studies of a large class of spaces with
symmetries. Over the years, Young tableaux have been further studied in
connection with other fields of studies, such as statistical physics, discrete
probability, and more recently, algebraic geometry and field theory. The
reviewer intends to pursue the combinatorial aspects of the latter connections,
with the intension of developing new tools, which in turn will lead to new
results in both fields.
