The focus of this three-year research effort is the design, analysis and
software implementation of a class of parallel nonlinear iterative methods for
the numerical solution of some highly nonlinear partial differential equations
(PDEs) arising from important applications in computational fluid dynamics and
computational biology. &lt;br/&gt;The nonlinear PDEs to be considered in the
project are usually not strongly elliptic, and they often contain non-elliptic
components causing the solution to be nonsmooth and have local singularities,
such as boundary layers or sharp fronts. For smooth nonlinear problems,
traditional nonlinear methods, such as Newton's methods, are capable of reducing
the global nonlinearities at a nearly quadratic convergence rate but become very
slow once the local singularities appear somewhere in the computational domain,
even if this happens to only a few components of a largenonlinear system.
&lt;br/&gt;The proposed algorithm is motivated by the class of nonlinear
preconditioning algorithms introduced by Cai and Keyes in 2001 for solving
algebraic nonlinear equations that have unbalanced nonlinearities.&lt;br/&gt;In
nonlinear preconditioning, the global problem is partitioned into subproblems,
and subspace nonlinear eliminations are performed on all subproblems.
&lt;br/&gt;The subproblem are then 'glued' together by a Schwarz type domain
decomposition method. Due to the subspace nonlinear elimination, the local
singularities are removed, and the global system therefore has more uniform
nonlinearity. A family of such algorithms will be studied using a combination of
multilevel/multigrid, domain decomposition, nonlinear preconditioning, and
nonlinear elimination methods. Roughly speaking, in these algorithms, domain
decomposition provides the parallelism, multilevel provides the scalability with
respect to the problem size and to the number of processors on parallel
computers, and nonlinear elimination removes the sensitivity to the local
singularities.&lt;br/&gt;Several important application problems will be
considered, including the steady state incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
with high Reynolds number and the optimization of a steady state biofluid
problem. To study the parallel performance of the algorithms on high performance
computers, such as a cluster of workstations and supercomputers, a library will
be developed as a plug-in package that is fully interoperable with PETSc of
Argonne National Laboratory. The proposed algorithm and software development
&lt;br/&gt;will have a great impact on the application areas, and will also have
substantial influence on other areas of computational sciences where large
nonlinear equations need to be solved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
