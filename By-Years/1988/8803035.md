This grant supports operation of the Notre Dame tandem accelerator laboratory,
as well as a program of nuclear physics research at the facility. Activities
include the study of thermal equilibration and the space/time extent of the
composite nuclei formed by heavy ions, the temperature dependence of nuclear
level density and nuclear structure properties, the enhancement of fusion yields
at sub-barrier energies, and lifetimes of nuclear levels using methods of recoil
distance and studies of conversion electrons. The breakup of polarized deuterons
will be measured and the results of three-body calculations will be compared
with these data. Reaction rates and energy levels of importance in the synthesis
of heavy elements in stellar environments will be determined. A new program to
produce beams of radioactive nuclei suitable for the study of secondary nuclear
reactions will be pursued. This accelerator facility is also used extensively
for nuclear physics research by visiting scientists and their students from
nearby colleges and universities and from other countries. In addition, the
facility hosts research in atomic physics and radiation chemistry.
