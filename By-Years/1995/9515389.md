9515389 Manchester This award supports a joint US-China workshop on
paleobotanical research. The workshop will be held in July 1996 in conjunction
with the International Organization of Paleobotany Conference. An important
objective of the international conference is to encourage scientific and
professional interaction among paleobotanists from different parts of the world
studying a range of geologic times and systematic groups. The US-China workshop
will expand on the conference objectives by providing a dedicated forum for
initiation of collaborative research between US and Chinese scientists. Workshop
organizers have been careful to structure the program to provide improved
opportunities for the participation of junior scientists from both countries.
Collaboration between the US and China will allow US researchers to probe
striking similarities between the fossil floras of Europe and North America, and
those of China. By combining efforts with Chinese paleobotanists, US
paleobotanists will be able to gain a better understanding of the systematic
affinities, stratigraphic ranges, and biogeographic distribution of extinct
plants. ***
