9411664 Fan With recent dramatic increase in available computing power,
numerical optimization has become an attractive tool for analysis and design of
complex systems. There are a large number of problems in science and engineering
which can be formulated as convex optimization problems involving linear matrix
inequality. This problem is inherently difficult to solve as the nonsmoothness
usually occurs at the solution. Further, as systems are becoming more complex,
the resulting optimization problems tend to have a large number of decision
variables as well as constraints. Therefore, several basic computation
components such as inversion of a matrix, eigenvalue and eigenvector
calculation, or evaluation of the Hessian matrix, that needed for most methods
become either prohibited or very costly to perform. It is then necessary to use
approximations and yet have the fast rate of convergence preserved. ***
