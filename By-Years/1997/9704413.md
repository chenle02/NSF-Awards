9704413 McLaughlin This project concerns applications of characteristic classes
to problems in algebraic geometry, conformal field theory, and the geometric
Langlands correspondence. An emphasis is to be placed on finding explicit
formulae for non-commutative symbols which generalize to the n-dimensional
general linear group a formula of Kubota for the two-dimensional case. The idea
behind this generalization is that Kubota's formula can be derived geometrically
from the second Chern class. Characteristic classes are 'invariant' algebraic
objects often used to classify spaces and manifolds or indicate certain
'topological' obstructions. The idea is to encode essential information
possessed by a space in algebraic objects that are unchanged under reasonable
transformations of the space. They then provide a useful computational tool
since algebraic objects often are discrete and/or finite whereas the space under
consideration is almost always infinite.
