Research is underway to investigate the effect of mechanical stress on the
growth and metabolism of microorganisms. Mechanical stress here is due to the
physical crowding of cells against each other in an entrapped environment.
Specific objectives of the research are: to characterize microbial growth as a
function of mechanical stress; to characterize the morphology of mechanically
stressed microbial cells; and to test a water stress hypothesis. By contributing
to an improved understanding of entrapped cell physiology, this study intends to
facilitate the design and analysis of immobilized cell technology.
