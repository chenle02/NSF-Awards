Iterated monodromy groups were introduced in 2001 as groups naturally associated
with (partial) self-coverings of topological spaces, for instance arising from
the action of complex rational functions on a punctured Riemann sphere. These
groups are used as algebraic encoding of combinatorial information about the
dynamical system. If the covering is expanding, then all the essential
information (for instance the Julia set) can be recovered from the iterated
monodromy groups. The project is devoted to the study of iterated monodromy
groups and their application to topology, dynamics and group theory. Iterated
monodromy groups are naturally defined for more general structures than partial
self-covering. This generalized definition can be used to construct simplicial
approximations of Julia sets of multi-dimensional dynamical systems. There are
very few examples of rational functions of several variables for which there is
a satisfactory understanding of the topology of their Julia set. The project
will provide a general method of constructing approximations of such Julia sets
and will lead to new homological invariants of dynamical systems.

The aim of the project is to study new connections between algebra and geometric
group theory on one side and dynamical systems and the associated fractal Julia
sets on the other. The iterated monodromy groups provide a bridge between these
two branches of mathematics. Geometric group theory studies large-scale
properties of groups of symmetries. Dynamical systems study chaotic dynamics of
iterations of maps, which are models of chaotic systems in Science. Iterated
monodromy groups encode in a computationally effective way combinatorial
information about the dynamical systems. In particular, they give a method to
construct approximations by polyhedra of complicated fractals associated with
the dynamical systems. This approach can be used in the study of multi-
dimensional dynamical systems, where usual computer visualization can not be
applied. Iterated monodromy groups are also very interesting and exotic examples
of groups. This way dynamical systems can be used to reach better understanding
of group theory.

This project is jointly funded by the Topology Program and the Analysis Program.
