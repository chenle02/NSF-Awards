IBN: 9724064 PI: JELLIES Dr. Jellies will employ a system of stereotyped motor
neurons, interneurons and muscles to investigate the roles of cell-cell
interactions and retrograde as well as retrospective influences in the
generation of a functional neural circuit. The model system he will use is the
one that produces the heartbeat rhythm in the leech. In all animals, neural
circuits are generated during development and modified throughout life by
dynamic processes driven by molecular and cellular mechanisms such as
differential adhesion, selective fasciculation, cytoskeletal modifications and
trophic support. In many cases the underlying mechanisms used by single cells to
generate particular phenotypes appear to be intrinsic to the individual cell.
Yet, because a neural circuit used in even a simple behavior requires the
coordinated differentiation of many cells to generate particular patterns of
connections, it is necessary to understand how these single cells are
coordinated. For example, a behavioral defect or variation may reflect a change
in the timing or spatial placement of a signaling event between two or more
neurons rather than any particular deficiency or genetic change intrinsic to a
neuron. The studies by Dr. Jellies will examine the hypothesis that interactions
between developing neurons and potential targets are one of the major sets of
factors that coordinate circuit formation, and furthermore, that particular
interactions are required for instructing the subsequent formation of one
pattern of connections rather than an alternative pattern. These studies will
also begin to characterize the signals that are generated in one set of cells to
influence the subsequent differentiation of another. Results from the project
are expected to yield significant insights into the way that cues derived from
one set of developing cells exert a long-lasting influence over the functionally
important development of others, and perhaps make it possible to predict the
development of comp lex neural circuits.
