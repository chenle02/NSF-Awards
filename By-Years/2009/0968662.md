University; Valencia Joyner&lt;br/&gt;0968662 University of California-
Riverside; Zhengyuan Xu&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Center for Optical Wireless
Applications (COWA) will focus on developing new devices using White Light
Emitting Devices (WLEDs). Pennsylvania State University (PSU), Tufts University
(TU) and the University of California-Riverside (UCR) are collaborating to
establish the proposed center, with PSU as the lead institution.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goals of this planning project are to initiate
formal partnership with various industry partners and national laboratories that
have an interest in optical wireless applications designs, and to discuss
fundamental issues and topics for research. The main objective of the envisioned
research projects at the proposed Center is to develop a new generation of
environment-friendly extremely wideband optical wireless technology
applications. The PIs' effort will involve work in relevant device designs, in
optical wireless communication systems (physical layer), in networking, sensing,
and in imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center has the potential to
improve the profitability of US manufacturing by developing new optical wireless
devices that will improve communication systems, reduce energy consumption and
pollution. The proposed Center will offer a series of short courses to update
the knowledge of the current workforce and will help universities to tailor new
course offerings and to modify existing course offerings to better provide
instruction for related areas and industry needs. The Center plans to promote
diversity, building on all three universities' high ranking in education of
minorities. In addition, the Center will work with existing university resources
to recruit and build strong relationships with minority and women-owned
companies and provide a collaborative community, within which these companies
can contribute expertise, expand their networks and become more globally
competitive.
