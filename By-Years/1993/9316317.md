9316317 Byrne Whether or not porphyroblasts rotate during deformation is a
currently debated issue the outcome of which is important because quite
different conclusions of the tectonic/kinematic history result from each model.
This project utilize staurolite porphyroblasts to test the rotation/non-rotation
models, taking advantage of the different shapes and initial orientations of
each staurolite, and the predicted final orientations of each model. Results, if
successful, will help resolve the debate on the behavior of porphyroblasts and
clarify the correct use of porphyroblasts in kinematic studies.
