This award provides funds to establish a multiuser Microchemical Instrument Core
Facility within the Department of Chemistry at San Diego State University. The
facility will service the needs of molecular life science researchers within the
19 campus California State University system as a component of the Program for
Education and Research in Biotechnology. It will also be available to
researchers in allied academic and research units such as Agricultural
Biotechnology, Environmental and Natural Resources, Bioengineering and
Bioprocessing, and the Molecular Ecology Institute. The facility will support
research on structural studies of Mg-ATPase from muscle transverse tubule; DNA
elements and protein factors involved in expression of genes encoding small
nuclear RNAs, protein fatty acylation and deacylation in yeast; isolation,
characterization, assay and cloning of transcuprein; extracellular proteins of
sea urchin embryo; metal homeostasis in developing artemia salina; biochemical
mechanisms of neurotranmission; etc. The primary investigators are productive
and well funded. Support of this proposal will have a major impact on research
and teaching in the California State University System.
