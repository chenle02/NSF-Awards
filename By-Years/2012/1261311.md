Mid-latitude storm tracks form an important part of the global circulation.
Cyclones passing along the storm tracks dominate the day-to-day weather
variability, and changes in storm track activity or location strongly impact
regional climate variations. Baroclinic waves that make up the storm tracks are
also responsible for transporting much of the heat, moisture, and momentum
poleward in the midlatitudes. Thus, the understanding of storm track dynamics
and variability, as well as how they may change in the future, is of great
importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diagnostic analyses of the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), simulations by multiple state-of-the-art
climate models, prepared for the Fifth Assessment Report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5) will be undertaken. Two
aspects of storm tracks--storm energy and cyclone frequency and strength--will
be examined to provide comprehensive new perspectives of storm track dynamics,
variability and change. Storm tracks simulated by state-of-the-art climate
models will be compared to those derived from reanalysis data to document model
biases, and differences in storm track variability and change among the
different climate models. Making use of the unprecedented quality and diversity
of model simulations, the relationship between cyclone frequency and strength
and mean flow variability will be examined. Results of these studies will
provide insights on the physical processes that lurk behind model biases and
differences, and furnish new ideas regarding how these biases and differences
might impact model projections.
