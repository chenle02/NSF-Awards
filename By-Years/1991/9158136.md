The major objective of this effort is to pursue basic and applied research in
the area of ergonomics. Specific objectives include (1) advancing theory for
developing instruments and analytical methods for measuring and assessing
exposure to physical stress in repetitive manual work, (2) investigating
performance deficits associated with exposure to these stresses, and (3)
enhancing performance and preventing injuries by establishing exposure and job
design guidelines based on these measurements. Physical stress in the workplace
has been recognized as an underlying cause of decreased productivity, reduced
work quality, operator discomfort, worker dissatisfaction, and increased
incidence of injuries. Disabilities resulting from excessive exposure to these
stresses incur significant costs to industry in the form of medical bills,
worker's compensation, reduced productivity, lost time, and human suffering. The
ultimate goal of this research is the development of effective quantitative
guidelines for enhancing manual performance and protecting workers from harmful
exposure to physical stress.
