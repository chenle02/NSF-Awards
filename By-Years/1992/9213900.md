Research to understand the basic dynamics of high energy positron collisions
with hydrogen-like ions is undertaken in response to recent experimental
measurements which reveal that even this simple three-body Coulomb system is not
understood. The methods to be employed are centered about the impulse
approximation, already used in ion-atom collisions, and a new time-dependent
approach based on the Schwinger variational principle.
