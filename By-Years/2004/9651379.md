A system-wide confocal microscope core facility is being established to serve
students and faculty throughout the state. The facility can be involved through
several avenues, including on-site visitation and remote operation using high-
speed networking protocols such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode and Integrated
Services Digital Networks. The computer-controlled confocal microscope is
maintained in a shared resource center and is being incorporated into
undergraduate curricula to teach dynamic cellular processes in biological
applications. The basis of confocal microscope theory meshes the disciplines of
physics, optics, light, computer science, chemistry, and biology into useful and
aesthetically pleasing images. Faculty and staff expertise can be shared among
campuses, thus benefiting the many undergraduates enrolled in the university
system. Accomplishments generated from the core facility can be disseminated
through various methods, including workshops in confocal microscopy, student and
faculty presentations and publications, and the development of image databases
and curricular material available through the World Wide Web. The resource
material is available throughout the university system, as well as to the K
through 14 schools and the scientific community at large.
