The University of Cincinnati has several researchers who would benefit from
access to supercomputers and access to other researchers connected to the
NSFNET. These scientists constitute a growing number of faculty and graduate
students who require advanced computing facilities in order to carry out their
research. The campus requests a portion of the funds needed for equipment for
connection to the NSFNET through the State of Ohio communication network
centered at Ohio State University. Consistent with the NSFNET Program policy
regarding connection to existing mid-level networks, this grant is an award of
$20,000 for routing equipment at the campus, which will be used as a gateway to
networks external to the campus. Connections to the Ohio State University hub
will be provided by the University of Cincinnati. Ohio State University is
connected to the NSFNET Backbone network as member of the the CICNET regional
(multicampus) network and as such has computer communication capability with all
institutions currently connected to the nation research network, NSFNET.
