This award supports travel for U.S. participants to attend the forthcoming
Tenth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-87) which
will be held in Milan, Italy on August 23-28, l987. These conferences provide
the main forum for the presentation of the latest developments in research and
applications of artificial intelligence. (AI). Funding is needed because of
travel budget limitations, especially for younger faculty members and graduate
students, particularly those who are presenting papers or otherwise
participating in the technical program of the conference. The importance of this
award is that while a substantial amount of research in AI continues to be done
in the U.S., the activities in other countries are steadily increasing and it is
critical for U.S. specialists to be well informed about that work. Scientific
progress in the field requires exchanges of ideas among groups in different
countries. However, it is not sufficient just to read proceedings. Personal and
informal interactions are essential, particularly where work in progress
involves different viewpoints and styles of research.
