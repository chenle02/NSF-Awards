Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Agricultural and Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology

0934153 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Brian Cunningham 0934103
Purdue University; Richard Linton The Center for Agricultural and Pharmaceutical
Nanotechnology (CAPN) will focus on developing technology platforms that can be
applied to three substantially important topics requiring strong
industry/academic partnerships: Nanotechnology, Agriculture, and Pharmaceutical
Research. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and Purdue
University (PU) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with UIUC as
the lead institution.

CAPN aims to focus at the confluence of nanotechnology, agricultural sciences
and pharmaceutical research, and assemble a group of researchers and industrial
partners with diverse backgrounds and expertise to address several "grand
challenge" types of problems in food production, agriculturally-derived
materials, and health care. UIUC and PU plan to use the NSF planning grant fund
to hold a meeting with prospective industrial partners to establish the proposed
Center's organizational framework, and to establish research projects of
greatest relevance.

The combination of three vastly different research fields provides a highly
complementary environment that can seed new partnerships to address intractable
problems. Nanotechnology, Agriculture, and Pharmaceuticals share many linkages
that can be exploited to find solutions to these problems. CAPN would provide a
rich interdisciplinary research environment, working in concert with industry to
solve industry challenges, that supports projects with broad impact on health
care and agriculture. CAPN plans to solicit support from both large and small
companies, and to form partnerships with industry consortiums such as the
Illinois Soybean Association, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, and others. UIUC and PU also plan to attract highly qualified, domestic
students form constituencies under-represented in engineering and biology:
women, minorities, and students with disabilities.
