9971282 Bartoszynski In this project the investigators continue their research
on various set theoretic notions of smallness in low levels of the cumulative
hierarchy, particularly those that involve measure-theoretic, topological,
Ramsey- theoretic, game-theoretic, or other combinatorial notions. Once
``infinite'' vs. ``finite'' was the mathematical dividing line between ``large''
and ``small.'' In 1878 Cantor showed that the situation is far more complex, and
the development of topology or analysis complicated it even further. Today there
are many different ways to express that a set of real numbers is small. Using
the technique first developed by P.J. Cohen, one sees that many questions
involving these smallness properties cannot be resolved in the framework of
elementary mathematics. At the same time the study of these properties
illuminated several problems from other areas of mathematics, which gave this
subject a life of its own. ***
