The use of adhesive joints in the ccnstruction of various products is an
attractive alternative to mechanical fasteners. The greatest problem in
structural bonding is the inability to quantify the strength of the bonded
assembly for design, quality control or maintenance. Current nondestructive
evaluation methods have not been successful in solving this problem. This
proposal is directed toward the evaluation of the feasibilty of utilizing
multiple-variable NDE methods to provide fast, cost-effective, reliable
determination of the strength of adhesive bonds through the use of the IMPACT
SONIC WAVE SPECTRAL ANALYSIS method. The potential for applying this method is
evidenced by its previous successful application to evaluation of wood and wood
products. Variations in material type, bonded area, quality, aging, stress
history, density and curing will be evaluated by SONIC WAVE NDE methods,
combined with destructive testing. A model will be developed and verified which
can predict bond strength within a target of + 15 percent. The Principal
Investigator is well qualified to conduct the research. It is anticipated that
the results will prove the validity of the proposed NDE approach to predict the
strength and stiffness of an individual adhesive joint with a high level of
reliability. Such results will indicate the direction to be taken with
additional combinations of materials, adhesives and NDE equipment development.
The results should provide the basis for a new design method for adhesives. An
award is recommended for phase I.
