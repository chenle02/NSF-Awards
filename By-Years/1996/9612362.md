9612362 Gorlov The objective of the project is to conduct fundamental
engineering research on the ocean environment using mathematical and physical
models as well as the demonstration floating power farm for harnessing energy
from ocean streams. The key component of the ocean power project that makes if
feasible is the recently invented helical turbine that is a breakthrough
technological innovation to use hydro energy of the oceans. Technical
development of the helical turbine has been sponsored by the U.S. DOE, New
England Power Company and Allied Signal, Inc. in 1995-1996. The Allied Signal
acquired the exclusive worldwide license on the turbine and committed to build a
demonstration project. The research includes the following major tasks: 1.
Development of theoretical and physical models of oceanic power farms. 2.
Fundamental research on engineering aspects related to harnessing oceanic energy
by means of such power farms constructed under ocean surface. 3. Mathematical
and experimental modeling and analysis of the influence of the projected power
farms on the global ocean and atmospheric circulation and the water ecology. ***
