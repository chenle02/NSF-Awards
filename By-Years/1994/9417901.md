9417901 Reynolds This project is an interdisciplinary study of the Cenozoic
evolution of the crust and lithosphere across the Colorado, Plateau-Basin and
Range boundary. Lateral changes in crustal and lithospheric thickness across
this major tectonic boundary, and their relationship to the extension of
continental crust, will be assessed. Two transects will be studied by: geologic
mapping and structural geology; sedimentological, stratigraphic and fission
track analysis; and volcanic, petrologic and geochemical analyses. The results
will provide insight into continental extensional processes and will have direct
relevance to many other extensional tectonic regimes elsewhere.
