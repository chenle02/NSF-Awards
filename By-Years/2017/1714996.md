The pathways by which plant cells recycle their constituents are critical for
growth and environmental stress tolerance, yet our knowledge of these pathways
is very limited. This project will address these limitations by identifying the
mechanisms by which cellular components are recycled once they are damaged or no
longer needed. A better understanding of these pathways will allow the
development of crops and other plants with an optimized balance between growth
and adaptation to stress conditions such as nutrient deficiencies and drought. A
number of graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in research during
this project, and each year a high school teacher will be involved in the
research through an ongoing Research Experiences for Teachers program,
potentially impacting large numbers of high school students. Enhancements will
be made to an educational computer learning tool on cell biology and it will be
introduced into Freshman Biology laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ribosomes
are essential and highly abundant components of cells, yet their degradation and
recycling pathways are unclear. The goal of this project is to decipher these
pathways by analyzing the transport and degradation of ribosomes and ribosomal
components within plant vacuoles. A newly discovered pathway for transport of
ribosomal RNA will be characterized, using a fluorescent RNA transport assay
together with analysis of mutants that are defective in factors required for
this pathway. The way in which ribosomes are recognized and selected for
degradation, for example by accumulating damage, will be determined
biochemically. Metabolome analysis by mass spectrometry will allow the effect of
loss of ribosome degradation pathways on cell metabolism and homeostasis to be
assessed.
