9403215 Rhines The water in the deep Caribbean is supplied by a pair of overflow
plumes which carry Upper North Atlantic Deep Water through Grappler Pass and
nearby Jungfern Pass at about 1800 m depth. This project is to investigate the
entrainment/detrainment of the Atlantic water plume into the Caribbean basin.
The main components of the proposed study are: additional analysis of detailed
sections and year long current meter records obtained during the Carib Vent; the
application of existing models to study the Caribbean inflow and the detachment
of overflow water into the interior. ***
