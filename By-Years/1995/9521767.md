9521767 Minschwaner This project will be a continuation of the 18-year hydroxyl
radical (OH) observation record at Fritz Peak, Colorado. Ground-based
measurements of the resonant absorption of sunlight at 308 nm are performed to
yield atmospheric OH column amounts. OH is one of the most chemically active
constituents in the atmosphere. The photochemistry of OH is intimately connected
to the budget of stratospheric ozone and is a major factor in the efficiency of
ozone destruction by nitrogen and chlorine compounds. Measurements of OH are
crucial to understanding natural and anthropogenic change in the Earth's
atmosphere. In addition to the continued measurements at Fritz Peak, a second,
similar instrument will be refurbished at New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology and intercompared with the Fritz Peak as well as other instruments.
Modeling and analysis will be carried out on the new data as well as the
existing record in order to better understand the seasonal and long-term
behavior of OH and its interrelationship with other changes in composition of
the atmosphere.
