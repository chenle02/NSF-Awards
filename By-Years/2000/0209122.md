Composing Data-Rich Embedded Systems the Easy Way&lt;br/&gt;--------------------
-----------------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arvind Krishnamurthy and
Henrik Nilsson&lt;br/&gt;Department of Computer Science, Yale
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Embedded computing increasingly takes
place in a sensor rich environment where&lt;br/&gt;the acquisition of raw
information is much easier than its interpretation. In&lt;br/&gt;addition to
building components to process this data, embedded systems&lt;br/&gt;programmers
must also arrange the communication among potentially hundreds
of&lt;br/&gt;components, distributing computation to the processing elements so
as to&lt;br/&gt;minimize communication costs and maximize responsiveness, and
scheduling of&lt;br/&gt;the processing elements to adapt to changing priorities
and communication&lt;br/&gt;patterns. These challenges must be addressed at the
system level rather than&lt;br/&gt;the processor
level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a framework for composing
distributed, data-rich&lt;br/&gt;embedded systems that automates many of the
low-level process allocation and&lt;br/&gt;scheduling tasks. It takes place
against a backdrop of a "next generation"&lt;br/&gt;humanoid robot currently
being developed at Yale. The robot contains a&lt;br/&gt;significant number of
processors connected in a heterogeneous fashion. The&lt;br/&gt;project addresses
two fundamental research issues. The first is the use of&lt;br/&gt;modern
programming language techniques to address critical embedded
system&lt;br/&gt;concerns such as composability and dynamic configuration
change. The second is&lt;br/&gt;improving overall system performance by
exploiting high level system knowledge&lt;br/&gt;in the run-time system. The end
result will be a design methodology that will&lt;br/&gt;enable rapid and
reliable construction of complex data-rich
interactive&lt;br/&gt;systems.&lt;br/&gt;
