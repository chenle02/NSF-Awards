ABSTRACT OPP-9214970 SEDINGER This project seeks to develop a dynamic model to
describe the potential impact of climate variation on the tropic structure of a
coastal Alaskan ecosystem by assessing the degree to which climate change
influences habitat structure and availability with the population dynamics of a
colonially nesting bird, the Pacific brant. The area of study, the Yukon-
Kuskokwim Delta, has been traditionally exploited by Yup'ik people and geese are
a seasonally important resource. A parallel study of native oral history will be
conducted in order to access traditional knowledge of the ecology of this
region.
