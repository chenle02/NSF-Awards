9521332 Popp This project will culture Antarctic diatoms under controlled
conditions to examine: the relationships of whole-cell 13-C to that in matrices;
the relationship between growth rate, CO2 concentration, and 13-C in whole cells
and biomarkers, and the relationship of 18-O frustules versus water. The results
will serve to ground-truth the use of stable isotopes in diatomaceous sediments
as tracers of paleo surface water temperature and primary production.
