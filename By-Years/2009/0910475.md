In this GOALI project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Charles Winter of Wayne State
University and Dr. Marek Boleslawski of Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemicals (SAFC
Hitech) Corporation will develop and test chemical precursors for atomic layer
deposition (ALD) film growth techniques. A primary target film composition will
be the Cu/Mn alloy, because these films have been shown to form 2-8 nm MnSixOy
diffusion barriers between the silica/silicon and copper layers. Such Cu
diffusion barriers are critical for the microelectronics industry in their quest
for fabricating smaller feature sizes on silicon chips. Presently, only
sputtering methods are capable of forming requisite Cu/Mn alloy films, and they
provide poor coverage when applied to substrates with very small feature sizes.
A central feature of the collaborative project will be sending Wayne State
University students to SAFC Hitech for 3 to 6 month internships to gain an
industrial perspective on the electronic chemical field. Students from Wayne
State University will also travel to the laboratories of Professor Lauri Niinist
at the Helsinki University of Technology for 6-8 week visits to participate in
film growth and characterization experiments.
