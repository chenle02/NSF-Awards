The research entails studying problems concerned with the optimal density of
sphere packings in Euclidean spaces and the geometry of spherical simplexes and
volumes. Further investigations will me made into the nature of classes of
minimal submanifolds in Riemannian symmetric spaces. Besides having applications
to other branches of mathematics, the techniques involved may have applications
to processes in manufacturing and in materials theory.
