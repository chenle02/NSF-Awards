The aim of this project is to investigate the basic hydrodynamics and
magnetohydrodynamics of black hole systems. The research approach is numerical;
the black hole physics is modeled using large-scale, multidimensional finite-
differencing. A three-dimensional, general relativistic code will be used to
investigate the nonlinear behavior of nonaxisymmetric disk instabilities in
pressure-supported accretion tori. This research will be extended to studies of
three-dimensional accretion flows, to the transport of angular momentum through
disks by nonaxisymmetric hydrodynamic waves, and to effects due to frame
dragging by Kerr holes. Black hole accretion systems also produce outflows in
the form of highly collimated jets. Magnetohydrodynamic jet collimation
processes will be studied with a two-dimensional Newtonian code. The jet systems
SS433 and Sc0 X-1 will be modeled with this code to determine whether magnetic
forces can account for the observed jet focusing. In addition, work will
continue on a fully-relativistic computer program, which will be applied to
increasingly complex problems involving jet collimation, focusing, and
generation, as well as to the extraction of energy from rotating black holes.
