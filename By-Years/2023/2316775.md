This project aims to understand disparities in emotional resilience and mental
health among mothers and their children who face a high burden of psychological,
social, and cultural stress. The research employs biocultural and developmental
frameworks to advance fundamental knowledge about how various stress and
resilience factors in mothers can shape the stress biology profile of their
children, through study of hormonal and molecular changes measured in childrenâ€™s
saliva. The results of the project can contribute to efforts to improve
prevention and interventions to reduce disparities in psychological well-being.
The project broadens participation of under-represented groups in STEM through
mentoring and training of graduate and undergraduate students and community
members. Results are shared in both academic and community outlets, supporting
public science education and engagement.

This study explores various biological pathways through which maternal
sociocultural and emotional protective factors and stressors can alter the
developing stress biology of a child. The project leverages existing data from a
previously NSF-funded birth cohort of children to examine stress and resilience
factors in relation to cortisol reactivity to stress tasks and changes in DNA
methylation at stress-related genes at two points in childhood (6 months and 3-5
years). Results address the relative importance of early prenatal versus later
postnatal exposures, the earliest timing at which stress biology may first be
altered in humans, and whether altered stress reactivity signifies a trade-off
that ultimately places children at higher risk for emotional or behavioral
problems or impaired cognition.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
