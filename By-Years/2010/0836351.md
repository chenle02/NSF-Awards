This is a SGER proposal for the field testing of a promising formative
assessment-based mathematics intervention in the civilian sector. The original
intervention, from which the civilian intervention will be co-developed, focuses
on building mathematics knowledge and reasoning skills in Navy recruits - these
are basic skills necessary to meet Navy technical and job demand requirements.
This SGER supports the co-development of the civilian sector intervention. The
skills the Navy needs in basic mathematics are the same skills necessary to meet
basic technical job requirements in the civilian sector - essentially pre-
algebra and algebra skills. The project will use CRESST's POWERSOURCE middle
school mathematics intervention for this study. The majority of Navy recruits
deficient in mathematics are from under represented communities - these are the
same communities that are a disadvantage in the civilian workforce because of
their lack of basic mathematics skills. The project will produce materials
appropriate for use in vocational schools, 2 year colleges, and for remedial
mathematics in 4 year institutions.
