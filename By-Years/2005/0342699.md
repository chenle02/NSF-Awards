This proposal calls for the third in a series of congresses on geometry to be
held in Salamanca (Spain) June 11-15, 2004. The themes of the conference will be
Riemann surfaces (related in important ways to automorphic forms, theta
functions, etc), Teichmuller theory, complex dynamics and modular forms. The
previous conferences have seen evidence of important collaborations between the
US and the Hispanic world (these were held in Mexico and Chile). As an example
of the impact of these conferences, we note that six of 19 and six of 22 papers
in the two volumes of proceedings from the first two conferences involve such
collaborations. The funding will cover expenses for five junior and five senior
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among speakers who will be attending (at this
stage, 5/04) are Ava Basmajian, Dick Canary, John Hubbard, Sebastian Casalaina-
Martin, Edward Frenkel, Gavril Farkas and Samuel Grushovsky.
