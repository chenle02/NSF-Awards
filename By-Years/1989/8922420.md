Professor Turgay Uzer is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his studies of energy transfer
processes in isolated molecules and on surfaces. This research is important in
helping chemists to understand the physical processes involved in laser
photodissociation, and laser photodesorption from surfaces. Uzer's theoretical
and computational work concerns the fundamentals of intramolecular energy flow,
the dynamics and quantization of nonseparable oscillator systems, modeling of
intramolecular dynamics and unimolecular reactions, and microscopic dynamics at
the surface-adsorbate interface. Uzer has developed a novel "asymmetric top
mapping" procedure which he will use to investigate the mechanism of
localization and to infer the structure and systematics of quantum states near
intramolecular bottlenecks. He will apply this type of analysis to the study of
the photodissociation of hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides. The
dynamics and feasibility of molecule specific photodesorption will be
investigated for hydrogen on aluminum oxide. Finally, he will also investigate
the microscopic mechanisms by which coverage influences adsorbate relaxation on
surfaces.
