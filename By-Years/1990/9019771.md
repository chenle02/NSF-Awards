Organisms face the common problems of avoiding death, harvesting and allocating
finite resources to maintenance, reproduction, growth and storage. It is the
communalty of these problems that provides the unifying basis for life history
theories. Many organisms begin life, reach maturity, reproduce once and die in
the same year. In contrast, humans and some female turtles postpone sexual
maturity for over 15 years, exhibit repeated reproduction over many years, and
have maximum life expectancies that approach 100 years. Because of the
logistical problems and the duration of study necessary, actuarial and complete
life history data are almost completely lacking for most long lived organisms
other than man. The primary objective of the proposed research is to complete
the documentation of life history traits of turtles on the University of
Michigan's, E. S. George Reserve in southeastern Michigan by examining the
relationships among age, body size, stored energy, growth rates, clutch size
(number of eggs) and clutch frequency of individuals reproducing for the first
time in their lives. In conjunction with the previous studies of three species
of turtles on the E. S. George Reserve during 26 of the past 36 years, data
collected during the tenure of the proposed research will allow tests of current
theories of the evolution of delayed sexual maturity, and provide a basis for
understanding age specific aspects of the biology of long-lived organisms that
is critical for the conservation and management of such species.
