Dr. Sheldon Tan of the University of California, Riverside and Dr. Jiarong Tan
of Fudan University proposed a U.S.-China Workshop on advanced simulation and
design techniques. There will be two workshops, the 2009 workshop will be in
Beijing, China, and the 2010 workshop will be in Shanghai, China. The topic for
this workshop is not only important for NSF, but also for U.S. industry. This
will provide the U.S. students much needed international experience in VLSI chip
design and enable the academic and industrial experts to make contacts in China
necessary for further cooperation. &lt;br/&gt;This workshop will be supported
jointly by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the U.S.
National Science Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;
