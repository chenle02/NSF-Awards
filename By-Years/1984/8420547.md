In this research effort, the density, enthalpy, virial coefficients and dew
points are measured in a Burnett-isochoric density (or P- -T) apparatus from
25-225 degrees C with pressures from 5 mm. of Hg to 2500 psia (0.67 KPa to 17.24
MPa). Densities precise to 1/10,000 and considered accurate to 3/10,000 are
secured for the pure components and mixtures of 25%, 10%, 5% and 2% H2O (2) in
CO2 (1). The calculated enthalpies are precise to 3/10,000, the pure and
interaction second virial coefficients to +- 1 cm3/g-mol, and the dew-point
pressures to 2 psi (13.8 kPa). Other important measurements include the vapor
pressure and vapor density of water at saturation, the third virial coefficients
C111, C222, and direct determination of the enthalpies of steam by a flow
calimeter. The binary interaction constant, k12 +- 0.01, is calculated as a
function of temperature from precise B12 measurements. Also, the dew-point
prediction method of Heidemann and Prausnitz is tested for CO2/H2O. Finally,
measurements and data reduction methods from two simpler experiments are tested
and augmented at the weak points.
