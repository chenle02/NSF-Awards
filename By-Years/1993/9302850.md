The use of second harmonic generation will be developed by Professor Corn to
investigate the structure and dynamics of several important interfacial systems
in this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program. Studies of liquid-liquid interfaces will combine the SHG method with
standard surface tension and electrochemical measurements to determine molecular
adsorption and structure at the interface. Self assembled zirconium alkyl
phosphonate layers will also be examined using SHG and vibrational spectroscopic
methods, to determine molecular orientation within the interfacial layer. The
molecular structural information obtained in these studies will be used to
design and control the macroscopic properties of the interface. %%% This
research project will combine state of the art non-linear optical methods such
as second harmonic generation to probe the detailed molecular structure of
several technologically important interfacial systems. Liquid-liquid interfaces,
self-assembled zirconium alkly phosphonate monolayers, and electrochemical
surfaces will be examined. The results of this research will provide the
understanding essential to the rational design of interfacial systems.
