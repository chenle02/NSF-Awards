The Department of Psychology is improving its core course offerings for
undergraduate students. The department has a large number of psychology majors
(750), composing a large percentage (8 percent) of the total student population.
The primary focus of this project is to strengthen the three-course research
sequence_introductory statistics, introductory experimental, and advanced
experimental classes_that all majors are required to complete. Initial analysis
has indicated that undergraduate students have limited statistical skills and
virtually no systematic exposure to computerized stimulus generation, design
implementation, or data analysis. Until recently, the department has had no lab
facilities for classroom use. The department is now purchasing 27 IBM-compatible
workstations networked to a 80586 server and five printers. The statistical and
experimental software supports students' understanding of the crucial principles
of the experimental process, including the generation of stimuli, collection of
data, and analysis of data. Further, the equipment helps the faculty prepare
undergraduate students for graduate school.
