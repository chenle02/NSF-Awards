Global mass-balance considerations, vertical nutrient profiles, seasonal
nutrient cycles and preliminary silica flux data all indicate the large
subtropical mid-ocean gyres may account for the majority of the global oceanic
production of biogenic silica. Diatoms are reported to bloom episodically in
summer in response to mixing events. However, the available evidence suggests
that most of the annual silica production occurs during extended periods of low
primary productivity and low diatom abundance in summer and autumn. While
virtually all of this silica is redissolved within the water column, the most
conservative estimates of the export of silica out of the upper 150m indicate
that it is considerable in global terms. This project represents a seasonal
study of the production, redissolution and vertical transport of biogenic silica
in the Sargasso Sea in conjunction with the U.S. JGOFS time-series observations
southeast of Bermuda. The study will address two major objectives: (1) to
evaluate the role of the oligotrophic mid-ocean gyres in the global oceanic
silica cycle, and (2) to assess the importance of the siliceous phytoplankton in
new production and the vertical export of organic matter in these areas. This
study will obtain year-round data for three years on the vertical flux of
particulate silica at the JGOFS time-series site and will measure silica
production and dissolution rates in the upper ocean at key times of year. These
measurements will be joined with the planned JGOFS time-series core measurements
of dissolved silicic acid and particulate silica to achieve the first full
seasonal study of the cycling of silica in the ocean.
