Professor John Wright of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study coherent two-dimensional
vibrational spectroscopy. Doubly vibrationally enhanced (DOVE) four wave mixing
(FWM) methods pioneered by this group will be complemented by new doubly
degenerate FWM methods, such as the use of two tunable infrared lasers to drive
three infrared transitions and a fourth output beam. These methods will be used
in a variety of ways to explore the utility of coherent two dimensional methods
for analytical measurements. Certain advantages such as line-narrowing and
selective component enhancement in complex mixtures can be achieved, relieving
current problems in vibrational spectroscopy such as spectral congestion.
Hydrogen bonded liquids will be studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infrared
spectroscopy is commonly used to study and monitor industrial processes
analytically. New laser-based spectroscopic methods can potentially make more
tractable the IR spectroscopy of proteins, for example, which will be of use in
basic and applied biochemical and biotechnological research.&lt;br/&gt;
