To understand the importance of various species of phytoplankton in the marine
food web, it is vital to have a good method to estimate species-specific growth
rates. In his previous award, Carpenter developed a method to do this, based on
the diel cycle of DNA synthesis. This award marks the first step in applying
this method to the field and examines simple ecological questions such as
whether organisms in the deep chlorophyll maximum can achieve a division rate
comparable to that of near-surface phytoplankton by adapting to a low-light,
nutrient-rich environment. Laboratory research in this projects stresses
improving the existing method by estimating the magnitude of the errors under
situations violating original assumptions used.
