Although great advances are being made to build more efficient and environment-
friendly solar machines for green energy production, it still remains a
challenge to design solar cells that are both efficient and inexpensive. This is
the main reason to study naturally-occurring photosynthetic complexes found in
plants and bacteria: these organisms contain evolutionarily optimized
architecture capable of yielding near 100% efficiency in converting sunlight to
potentially viable energy. Since many of the key photosynthetic processes occur
extremely fast, limited information can be obtained experimentally. This makes
computational studies especially useful and motivates our development of
accurate and reliable mathematical models based on quantum and classical physics
to simulate the sub-nanometer and femtosecond chemistry. In collaboration with
Dr. Young Min Rhee at Pohang University of Science and Technology in Korea, this
research will combine two computational methodologies to develop an accurate
representation of how sunlight is converted to chemical energy in naturally
occurring photosynthetic complexes.

The reaction center is a subunit of the Photosystem II pigment-protein complex
where exciton to charge-transition manifold quantum transition occurs. Several
groups have studied this complex and yet, it still remains unclear why some
charge-transfer states are created while others are not. This study will focus
on developing a unifying model for the reaction center. The protein environment
can be treated as classical point charges for the exciton manifold. However, for
the charge-separated manifold, the charged chromophores will significantly
polarize the local environment and a static charge description will not be
sufficient. Thus, this study will build a polarizable representation of the
protein for the QM/MM and MD calculations. The overall energy landscape will be
implemented into quantum dynamics algorithm to simulate energy transfer and
conversion. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National
Research Foundation of Korea.
