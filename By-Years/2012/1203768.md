In order to preserve and explore the history, languages and cultures of the
Arctic, it is essential that citizens understand the nature and extent of the
public archival record and contribute to its digitization, for preservation and
access. While many communities want to address this challenge, they are often
inhibited by uncertainty on best practices and standards, on comparative
experiences, and on the range of available tools ? in particular, open source
options. Most discourse on digital archive solutions is centered on the needs of
large research libraries and national institutions. This project seeks to make a
unique contribution to the development and maintenance of open source tools and
systems for digital archival content in small communities.

The project begins by gathering a diverse set of local, state, federal, academic
and non-governmental stakeholders from the US, Norway and Canada for a workshop
at Monticello to share insights on tools and case studies for archive
digitization, and to jointly develop the still unmet requirements for open
source tools for Arctic archive digitization. As Arctic archives come on line,
the research team hopes their work will empower and directly engage the pan-
Arctic communities in better understanding how they came to be and how they
interrelate with one another in confronting the challenges of the present.
