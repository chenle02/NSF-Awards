Atmospheric blocks are quasi-stationary large-scale anti-cyclonic circulation
patterns in the upper troposphere that interrupt the westerly jet steam
circulating in mid-latitudes. Due to their relatively long lifetimes of up to
several weeks, blocking flows are capable of making weather systems that migrate
along the westerly jet become stagnant over the same regions, sometimes causing
extreme events such as heat waves, droughts, and floods. This project, building
on the PI's Ph.D. dissertation research, investigates the connection of
extratropical blocks to the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), a prominent intra-
seasonal (30-60 days) form of variability in the tropical atmosphere. A linear
inverse modelling (LIM) approach is used to identify tropical diabatic heating
anomalies associated with MJO that can evolve into blocking flows in the
extratropics.

The research could be beneficial to regional decision makers by demonstrating
how blocking events in a given region can be traced back to MJO events in the
tropics, thus enabling advanced warning of blocking events and their impacts. In
addition, the project supports a postdoctoral researcher who is at the beginning
of her scientific career, thereby providing for the future scientific workforce
in this area.
