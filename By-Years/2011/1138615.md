This Proposal # 1138615 titles " Workshop on Navigating and Leading Change" is a
continuation of the development of a community within the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers that supports and mentors researchers from underrepresented
groups. The previous workshop conducted through ASME focused on networking and
teaching negotiation skills, in addition to facilitating the formation of
networks during the workshop itself. &lt;br/&gt;The workshop is designed to
provide graduate students, post-doc and faculty members with professional
development activities and to give them the opportunity to make connections with
an international network of supportive researchers in their field. This
conference attracts up to 1100 attendees from all over the world. The proportion
of majority-to-minority and male-to-female attendees at the conference reflects
the overall low representation of women and minorities in the mechanical
engineering profession. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will continue the
efforts of the Broadening Participation committee of the ASME to provide
professional development opportunities to members from underrepresented groups.
The goal of the Broadening Participation committee is to develop, implement and
oversee new and existing activities aimed at broadening the participation of
women and underrepresented minorities in the activities of Design Engineering
Division of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The workshop will
introduce the Lifecycle model of understanding self and change. The participants
will leave with an appreciation of this systems' approach to understanding and
affecting change, and applying what they learn in different situations of their
career.
