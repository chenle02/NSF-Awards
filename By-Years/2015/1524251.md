This project explores fundamental questions in communication complexity, data
structures and circuit complexity. Despite much effort, only a few methods have
been developed for proving lower bounds on the efficiency of computational
models. In this project, the PI will study a family of techniques applicable to
understanding lower bounds in communication complexity, data structures, and
boolean circuit complexity. The PI will study both longstanding open problems
regarding these computational models, and topics that have not yet been widely
considered.

A common theme is the use of methods from information theory to measure how the
information flows in the computational systems of interest. Methods from
information theory have been used to great advantage in this arena recently, and
this project seeks to further explore how analyzing the flow of information can
help understand the limits of computational processes. The PI plans to organize
a workshop on information theory methods in computer science.
