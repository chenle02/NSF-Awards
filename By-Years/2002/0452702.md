This project is a research experiences for undergraduates (REU) site in
Economics at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State
University that offers 10 undergraduate students a summer research experience.
Intellectual Merits- Students intern with an economics faculty member working in
one of the five policy research centers or programs in the AYSPS including
public economics, resource/environmental economics, urban/regional economics,
labor economics, and international economics. Interns work closely with a
faculty mentor on a research project that the faculty member originally chooses,
but that evolves during the project so that students become active partners.
Interns receive formal and systematic training in a weekly seminar that provides
basic research skills and that culminates in a presentation and a paper related
to the research experience. Broader Impacts- The program's main short-term
objective is to provide undergraduate students the opportunity to participate
actively in policy research; the program is also intended to achieve the longer-
term objective of attracting qualified, interested students to quality Ph.D.
programs in economics, public policy, and other social sciences.
