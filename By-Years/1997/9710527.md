This study will bring to the fore essential questions concerning the center and
periphery of science by focusing on the collaboration between the British
savants and the British Admiralty in the early Victorian era. William Whewell
and Sir Francis Beaufort were central in placing the empirical investigation of
oceanic tides on a firm foundation. The present study will add an important and
still unstudied dimension to William Whewell's achievements by analyzing his
twenty-five year research project on the tides. It also will unveil Sir Francis
Beaufort's role as the principal link between scientists and the British
Admiralty in the early Victorian era. Support will be used to carry out research
on the following unpublished manuscript sources: 1) the Whewell Papers at
Trinity College, Cambridge; 2) the Francis Beaufort collection at the National
Maritime Museum, and the Hydrographic Office; 3) John Lubbock's papers at the
Royal Society; 4) Records of the Admiralty at the Public Records Office, London,
and the National Maritime Museum; and 5) local records where a Royal Naval
Dockyard operated: Bristol, Plymouth, Portsmouth, and Liverpool.
