The objective of this proposal is to investigate and implement a new paradigm
for optical design based on artificial materials determined by design. The
approach is to generate infinitely refraction-linear artificial materials (IRAM)
that maintain a linear relationship between incident and refracted angles over a
large field of view. As a result, they are attractive to enhance performance,
simplify design, and reduce form factor in highly non-paraxial and three-
dimensional optics. IRAM are also attractive for creating new functionalities in
integrated photonics. Intellectual merit - Classical optical imaging systems
consist of a series of refracting surfaces interfacing among homogeneous
isotropic materials. Traditional optical design aims at correcting aberrations
via multiple surface and material systems that meet a set of performance
requirements. Modern lens design can also take advantage of aspheric, graded
index, diffractive or holographic lenses to reduce aberrations and overall
complexity and size. However, designs are still based on ray tracing
optimizations over hundreds of dimensions that typically result in tradeoffs in
terms of performance, size, weight, and form factor. The paradigm proposed here
provides new degrees of freedom at the material level that enable simpler
designs and dramatically simplifies the design process. Broader Impacts - IRAM
open up the possibility of exploring novel applications in integrated and free
space photonics with vast economic potential. For instance, the approach is
attractive for application in light/compact infrared imagers that outperform
classical multi-element designs. The project integrates education and outreach,
for instance by providing training opportunities for a diverse cadre of young
students.
