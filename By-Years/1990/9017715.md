This research is to tomographically map the 3-D seismic velocities around major
subduction zones in the Circum-Pacific with corrected ISC data. A major effort
will be made to clean up ISC readings by selective waveform checking, reviewing
the signal/noise sate at seismographic stations, and culling incoherent rays
from bins of similar source and receiver. This method will be applied to two
formally studied regions in the NW Pacific and the South Pacific. New areas to
be studied will be: the Java, Solomon and Philippine region; the Mexico, Peru
and Chile region; and the Aleutian region. The results will be applied to the
fate of deep subducted slabs, an important question in mantle convection.
