9401115 Karabel This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral
Dissertation Research Program. It is a study of policy experts, political
intellectuals, and political change in the United States, 1935-1950, assessing
the roles that experts and intellectuals played in mediating different policy
outcomes. This will be accomplished through four case studies: 1) Social
Security, 2) labor law reform, 3) national health policy, and 4) employment
policy. Analysis will compare the context of policy debates and political
culture in each of these domains, assessing the extent to which expert reformers
and their allies among political intellectuals dominated debates in policy
arenas. %%% This research will contribute to political sociology, evaluating the
relative success of theories based on state- centered institutional approaches
compared with those based on class-centered approaches. In addition to the
scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially
assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.
dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
