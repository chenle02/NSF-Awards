Investigating the role of genetics, spatial landscaping, and social networks on
insect migration

The recent resurgence of bed bugs has fostered renewed scientific interest in
these long-forgotten pests. Bed bug infestations are on a steady increase
nationwide. However, too little is known about the behavior, biology, and
migration and dispersal patterns of the common bed bug to allow much to be done
to combat these pests. Lack of knowledge of bed bug migration leads to rapid
outbreaks and heavy infestations. Therefore, bed bug populations provide an
excellent opportunity to study the migration patterns of arthropods in an urban
setting. This research will develop an interdisciplinary study, integrating
methods from the social sciences, spatial statistics, and landscape genetics to
study how bed bug populations move through an urban environment. Specifically,
the dispersal patterns will be analyzed by the combined use of microsatellite
markers and social network analysis.

The proposed research project will inform the scientific community.
Participation, particularly that of college students from underrepresented
backgrounds, will be increased in the biological sciences, through the teaching
component of the award. Knowledge about important biological problems will be
imparted. The award will also provide educational programs on the basic behavior
and biology of bed bugs, and proper maintenance and/or eradication of bed bug
infestations for underserved and marginalized members of the Raleigh and
Greensboro, North Carolina communities. In particular, residents of the Raleigh
Housing Authority will benefit from bed bug education programming developed by
the investigator.
