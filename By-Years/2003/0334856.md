April 21, 2003 is the closing date for NSF's High Performance Network
Connections (03-529) solicitation. HPNC proposals are complex documents that
include many nuances and requirements. This workshop will take the participants
through the proposal preparation process and assist investigators in developing
their proposals. This workshop will cover the technical, administrative and
research justifications that are required, and the workshop will address budget,
format and narrative requirements.

This workshop, while open to representatives of both minority and non-minority
serving institutions, is targeted specifically to minority serving institutions,
capitalizing on previous work done to assist this community by Ms. McLean and
her associates. The workshop will be one and one-half days in length and will be
facilitated by several experienced individuals.
