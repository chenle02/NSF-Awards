This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a novel
photonic material with exceptional molecular recognition capabilities. Current
molecular sensors are complex, expensive and suffer from limited reproducibility
and scalability. These facts have hampered the adoption of molecular sensors
despite immense industrial and scientific interest from the fields of forensics,
toxicology, and biomedicine. Highly scalable and inexpensive, SERF (Sensitive
Erasable Reproducible Flow-through) sensors will lead to an era of ubiquitous
molecular identification devices for diverse applications such as biometric and
health screening, trace hazard detection (biohazards, toxins, drugs, and
explosive residues), and chemical quality control. In addition to affordable
manufacturing, the SERF technology has a 7 fold higher sensitivity and greater
uniformity than the leading commercial substrate (Klarite(TM); Renishaw Inc.).
The SERF sensor also has first-of-a-kind capabilities in flow-through detection
and surface cleaning for reuse. The project will identify the most commercially
viable molecular target for the SERF sensor and optimize the material and a
prototype for the detection of this molecule. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
addresses several technology gaps as it translates a laboratory discovery into a
commercial application. First, composed of a high density of optically
responsive nanopores rather than the low-density micropatterned features, the
SERF sensor improves both the sensitivity and uniformity of detection compared
to the leading photonic-based sensors. Second, as a porous structure the SERF
technology allows sample flow through the sensor, overcoming diffusion limited
response times that are impractical (days) for trace molecules with existing
sensors. Finally, the SERF sensor can be reused or cleaned with the application
of a small current through its contiguous metallic surface. This feature can be
used to reset sensors and to overcome performance loss due to fouling.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project brings together a world-leading nanomembrane
manufacturer (Roussie Co-PI; SiMPore Inc.) with a leading nanomembrane research
laboratory (McGrath PI; University of Rochester) and world-class experts in
photonics (Webb Co-PI; Nottingham University) to translate a novel laboratory
discovery toward commercial impact in industries that improve human welfare. A
University of Rochester graduate student and co-inventor of the SERF technology
will receive hands on entrepreneurship training by working with PIs and Co-PIs
in customer discovery interviews and in the development of a business model
canvas.
