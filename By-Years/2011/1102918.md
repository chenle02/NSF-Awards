This research supports the examination of the coupling and synchronization of
polar climate oscillations. The researcher postulates that each polar region
behaves as a self-sustained relaxation oscillator with its own natural frequency
and nonlinear feedbacks influencing each other through dissipative coupling
proportional to the temperature and heat storage gradients between North and
South Atlantic Ocean and atmosphere. The researcher will examine polar
synchronization and the possible connection to Heinrich events.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research include the support of
a doctoral student and the participation of undergraduate students in the
research project
