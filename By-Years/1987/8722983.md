Peaks in biogenic silica concentration in cores from high sedimentation areas
in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario provide two potential time horizons that will be
used to tests the limits of stratigraphic correlation in depositional basins.
The first peak has been associated with European settlement and forest clearance
in the late 1980's and the second peak has been attributed to a rapid increase
after 1950 in sewered population. The causal mechanism hypothesized for both
peaks is increased inputs of phosphorus and resulting increased production of
diatoms until silica becomes limiting. The basic objectives of the proposed
research are to determine how the biogenic silica stratigraphy changes in
relation to sedimentation rate and whether nutrient accumulation (different
forms of phosphorus and biogenic silica) varies with sedimentation rate. This
research has important ecological implication because siliceous microfossil
population structure will be analyzed to determine if time-dependent signals are
present across depositional basins. In addition, the research will address
questions about the relationship between phosphorous loading and diatom
production which may be different than reported previously in the literature.
Thus, research on biogenic silica and siliceous microfossils offers promise for
developing independent time biomarkers in the sediment record and in
understanding the causal mechanisms responsible for their presence.
