9306580 Nau This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award. A
primary goal of the proposed work is to define, analyze, and explicate features
of the design of HTN planning systems. The proposed work will have the following
benefits: It will correctly characterize HTN planning and provide a framework
which accounts for many features used in existing planning systems, but not yet
completely formalized (including reduction, critics, commitment choices and
filter conditions). It will provide a clear understanding of the efficiency and
expressivity of HTN planning, and how these compare with the efficiency and
expressivity of other approaches to planning (such as planning with STRIPS-style
operators). It will provide ways to determine whether a given set of methods and
critics correctly describe the planning problem they were meant to solve. It
will describe the characteristics of planning domains in which HTN planners can
operate efficiently, and develop efficient planning systems for those domains.
