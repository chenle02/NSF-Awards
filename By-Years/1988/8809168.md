The objective of this project is to characterize diverse iterative design
processes qualitatively by means of a simple graphical construction. This
construction, sometimes referred to as the "basins of attraction," is a
graphical summary of how the design process proceeds from many different
starting points, or initial designs. Results of this research will provide a
global view of iterative design processes - a window through which a wide range
of behavior may be observed qualitatively. It will reveal the existence of
extreme sensitivity to initial conditions that can plague certain iterative
processes. It may prove to be a convenient graphical characterization of
specific design phenomenon, such as fully- stressed vs. non-fully-stressed
design, or Hardy Cross' hybrid action in design iteration. Perhaps more
importantly, it will provide a common denominator with which to compare and
contrast very dissimilar design processes, revealing similarities between
methods that are not normally considered to be closely related, or conversely,
revealing substantial differences between similar processes, such as Newton and
quasi-Newton methods.
