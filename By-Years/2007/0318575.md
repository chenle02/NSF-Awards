This research is exploring the use of stochastic processes to develop new
techniques that can serve as a theoretical and computational basis for
information retrieval systems, pattern matching systems, and generally any
application that requires revealing hidden connections in an indexed but
otherwise unorganized collection of information. The methodology is predicated
on the idea of constructing a Markovian model of the underlying information and
utilizing mean first passage times as an asymmetric aspatial metric to gauge
degrees of contiguity in the information. The following topics are being
studied:

- Establishing the theoretical extent to which mean first passage times reveal
hidden connectivity in different bodies of information of varying type and
varying size.

- Developing and implementing fast algorithms for computing mean first passage
times. This includes determining the computational feasibility of using the mean
first passage time metric on different kinds of large-scale data sets.

- Use of a Markov model to capture hidden connections that the Google PageRank
approach fails to identify, and assess the inherent tradeoffs between increased
computational effort over simple PageRank computations.

- Given that mean first passage times can be demonstrated to be theoretically
and computationally feasible, the problems associated updating and downdating
the underlying information will be investigated. Additions, deletions, or
changes to information almost always create, destroy, or change connections
(direct as well as latent), and dealing with these effects in large-scale
systems running in (or near) real time is a significant hurdle to overcome.
Efficient updating techniques for stationary probabilities as well as mean first
passage times that are superior to current methods are being evaluated.
