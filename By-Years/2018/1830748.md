This project is investigating emissions from biomass combustion and the
implications of these emissions on air quality and climate. Laboratory studies
will be conducted to quantify the emissions of furan compounds (i.e., those
containing a 4-carbon, 1-oxygen aromatic ring) from biomass burning and to
determine the fate of these compounds in the atmosphere. The results of this
project can be incorporated into the modeling of the impacts of biomass burning
chemistry on local, regional, and global scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
specific objectives of this project are to:n(1) Identify the organic compounds
produced by the OH and NO3 oxidation of furan compounds and quantify their
contribution to the SOA yield; (2) Determine how this oxidation chemistry, and
the O3 and SOA produced, varies with NMOC/NOx ratio, temperature, and RH; (3)
Use the above results to develop a detailed mechanism for the oxidation of these
furan compounds in biomass burning plumes; and (4) Quantify how this new
mechanism alters the predicted impacts of biomass burning on atmospheric O3 and
PM2.5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
