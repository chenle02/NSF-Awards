This project is concerned with incorporating additional information about the
human visual system into the process of synthesizing color for computer graphic
images. The traditional camera model employed in realistic image synthesis will
be modified so as to produce an initial representation which is perceptual in
nature. From this higher level representation of the scene a final image is to
be created for whatever display device is being used. The particular perceptual
effects to be investigated during the term of the grant are adaptation and color
spatial acuity. This work will make it possible to handle scenes with high
contrast and/or a large dynamic range, will improve the efficiency with which
color calculations are performed in a distributed ray tracer, and will make it
possible to reproduce color in a more device independent manner.
