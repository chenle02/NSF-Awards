This project aims to provide a firm foundation for phonetic theory by
determining a possible set of articulatory-acoustic relations for a wide range
of sounds. The project goal is to consider the complete range of phonetic
phenomena in the languages of the world. The data are to be described in terms
that make evident what a phonological theory must encompass, and also in terms
of computer programs that explicitly model the articulatory movements and the
corresponding acoustic structures. The products of this research will also
include a valuable body of illustrative instrumental data, and a recording
illustrating as many as possible of the diverse range of sounds.
