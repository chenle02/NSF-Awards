This EArly Grant for Exploratory Research aims to advance the text
simplification technology that automatically rewrites complex English texts into
simpler English texts. Research into this topic has many potential practical
applications. It can provide reading aids for people with disabilities, low-
literacy, non-native backgrounds or non-expert knowledge. It can also help with
many other computer technologies that need to process difficult words and
complicated sentences. This one-year exploratory project focuses on
simplification for children with different reading levels. If this technology is
successful, it could help make knowledge accessible to all children and
gradually help to improve their reading skills.

Simplification can be thought of as a monolingual translation task, where the
output is equivalent in meaning to the input, but its surface form is
constrained by a readability or grade-level requirement. Prior work has drawn
the connection between machine translation and text simplification, but has
treated the SMT technology as a black box. Going beyond previous work, this
study provides an extensive exploration of adapting key parts of the statistical
machine translation pipeline to simplify text. It aims to tailor simplification
to different readability levels. The three research activities being undertaken
in this study are: (1) constructing a "parallel corpus" consisting of complex
sentence paired with several different levels of simplification, (2) developing
automatic metrics for targeted simplification, and (3) designing features for
targeted simplification.
