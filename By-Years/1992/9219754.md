This award provides funds for the acquisition of an unlimited cpu license to
the source code of the GEOTOOLS computer program which integrates state of the
art software for interpreting magnetotelluric (MT) data, a relational data base
in standard, internationally accepted format, and utilities for converting MT
data to standard format. The GEOTOOLS program has been adopted as standard by
the geophysics research community working in the MT area and is already
accessible to workers in Canada and Mexico. The PI will obtain the license at a
very substantial educational discount and will provide it to all interested
educational organizations in the U.S. The MT community uses natural
electromagnetic energy to image internal Earth structure in terms of properties
such as electrical conductivity. Analysis of MT data is very computer intensive
and progress in the field has been inhibited by diverse data formats that
complicate data sharing, by difficulties of visualizing the 3-D data, and by the
problem of interfacing data with incompatible analysis software programs
developed by different groups. Access to the GEOTOOLS program will result in a
uniform, flexible MT data analysis environment for all of North America.
