A new spectroscopic approach using the positron annihilation lifetime technique
will be used to determine the free-volume hole-size distributions in polymeric
materials. The research activities involve: 1) positron lifetime measurements as
a function of temperature and pressure in epoxy, poly(vinyl acetate), PMMA and
PEEK polymers, and 2) a renaissance of positron lifetime spectroscopy by
significantly improving nuclear counting efficiency and instrument resolution,
and by employing numerical Laplace inversion techniques to analyze the positron
lifetime data. The free-volume hole-size distributions in these selected
polymers are to be determined experimentally for the first time as a part of the
research.
