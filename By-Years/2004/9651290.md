This department is expanding its efforts to introduce undergraduates to
parallel processing concepts in a gradual and nonthreatening manner. Parallel
processing is discussed for the first time in the first-year Data Structures
class, in which lectures and several group activities are devoted to parallel
sorting and a lab assignment involving sorting in parallel is given. Appropriate
parallel computing topics are also discussed within the Computer Organization
Principles of Language Design II, Operating Systems, and Analysis of Algorithms
classes. This plan culminates with the Parallel Computing class that is devoted
to parallel computing topics. The extended introduction to parallel processing
enhances the earlier courses and provides a strong foundation for the Parallel
Computing course. Four Sun workstations and 16 PCs are being installed along
with software multiprocessor simulators for Unix-based workstation and PC
environments. When combined with the Computer Science Department's existing
multiprocessor file server and 16 transputers, actual or simulated versions of
most of the important multiprocessor parallel architectures are available to
students.
