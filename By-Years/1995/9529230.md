AST 95-29230 PI: Omer Blaes Optical/Ultraviolet Emission from active Galactic
Nuclei The origin of the optical/UV spectrum in Active Galactic Nuclei is not
currently understood. X-ray observations suggest that the standard thin
accretion disk paradigm be altered in such a way that a substantial fraction of
the gravitational energy be transferred and released outside the optically thick
portion of the disk, but it is not clear that such a model can explain all the
optical/UV observations. The PI will investigate the consequences of two-phase
models (disk and overlying hot corona) for the optical and ultraviolet
observations, concentrating in particular on the spectrum and polarization that
a non-LTE, self-consistent, atmosphere code would produce. The model, which
assumes that the disk and corona are locally coupled at each radius, will
explore the parameter space defined by the fraction of accretion power
dissipated in the corona and the coronal optical depth. The UV/optical response
to X-ray variability will also be studied.
