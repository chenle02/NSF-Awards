The general area within which this research is performed is known
as&lt;br/&gt;computational learning theory. The starting point for research in
this&lt;br/&gt;area is typically the definition of mathematical models of what
the term&lt;br/&gt;``learning'' may mean in a variety of settings. The concept
of learning&lt;br/&gt;captured by these models is then formally analyzed,
frequently leading&lt;br/&gt;to algorithms for solving learning problems within
the models as well as&lt;br/&gt;to proofs that certain problems cannot be
solved. These&lt;br/&gt;learning-theoretic models and results lend support to
more applied work&lt;br/&gt;in machine learning, which in turn has demonstrated
utility in&lt;br/&gt;applications ranging from e-commerce to advanced research
on vehicles&lt;br/&gt;that drive themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
adds to the existing body of learning-theoretic knowledge&lt;br/&gt;in a number
of ways, including analysis of a relatively new model called&lt;br/&gt;Probably
Exactly Correct learning, development of an algorithm that&lt;br/&gt;learns
arguably the broadest class of functions yet shown to be&lt;br/&gt;learnable
(majority of AC0 functions), and work toward extending&lt;br/&gt;hardness
results for learnability of a fundamental class, the class of&lt;br/&gt;parity
functions. The key tool used in these and other project tasks
is&lt;br/&gt;Fourier analysis of classes of functions. While the primary purpose
of&lt;br/&gt;the Fourier analysis is to support research into learning
questions, a&lt;br/&gt;side benefit is the enhancement of our understanding of
several&lt;br/&gt;interesting classes of functions, such as majority of AC0.
Furthermore,&lt;br/&gt;this project provides a stimulating research experience
to undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;and master's students at a university that, from an
NSF perspective, is&lt;br/&gt;largely an undergraduate institution.&lt;br/&gt;
