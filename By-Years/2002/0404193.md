Diameter specific Separations of Carbon Nanotubes for
3D&lt;br/&gt;Nanoassembling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop new methods of assembling,
processing and manipulating nanoscale materials. By examining the mechanical
bonds between rigid molecules and carbon nanotubes, this research will result in
a highly purified solution of these nano-materials, thereby enabling three-
dimensional nanostructuring of nanotube assemblies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will impact students at several levels. Master's and undergraduate
students will be involved in much of this research, which can impact their
philosophies of science and their directions as teachers and researchers.
Molecular models, developed in this research, will be used to assemble a
"visualization toolbox" that can be brought into the high schools through the
Internet. These activities can have nation-wide impact on the science and
technology education of high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
