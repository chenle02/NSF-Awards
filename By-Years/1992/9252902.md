This project will produce assessment materials for mathematics instruction K-12
that have broad national applicability -- and that serve not only as a means of
measuring student attainment, but also as a positive force for curriculum
change. The project will have several kinds of product: o assessment packages
for each of three grade ranges that exemplify national goals and related state
guidelines - high quality, practicality, and balance in terms of nationally
agreed curriculum objectives for mathematics (e.g. those in the two volumes of
NCTM Standards); o explicit curriculum support, including both classroom
materials and professional development resources, to facilitate the transition,
enabling typical teachers to prepare their students to tackle effectively what
are initially new kinds of task before they take on comprehensive new curricula;
o active collaborative links between the assessment designers and those
concerned with the design and delivery of curricula -- national curriculum
development projects, the professional associations, states and others who have
similar curriculum objectives; and o a driving force for curriculum enhancement
through the pressures on the curriculum generated by this assessment, which will
forward national curriculum objectives. These products will be developed at
three national sites (in California, Massachusetts, and Michigan) and the Shell
Centre, in active collaboration with NSF-supported curriculum projects and the
related State Departments of Education.
