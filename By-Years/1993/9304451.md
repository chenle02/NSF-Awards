9303351 Spetzler The recent development in the PI's laboratory of a GHz
ultrasonic interferometer with moderate pressure and temperature capabilities
(600 MPa and 400K) opens new possibilities for elastic parameter measurements.
Because of the inherently high precision of the technique and because of the
high frequency, elastic parameters and their pressure and temperature
derivatives can be determined for many new minerals and their high pressure
phases for which only small (sub millimeter) samples are available. Measure-
ments will be made on the pyrope-almandine-grossular solid solution series. This
garnet suite represents a very important mantle constituent in the major mantle
mineralogy models. ***
