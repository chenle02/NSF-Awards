For many advanced and diverse applications, ranging from chemical sensing,
catalysis, and magnetic recording, current research is increasingly focused on
exploiting the high surface-to-volume ratios of nanoparticles as a framework for
the assembly of complex nanomaterials. Structures including core/shell
nanoparticles and multicomponent hierarchical assemblies can exhibit enhanced
properties and new functionality arising from the close proximity of chemically-
distinct, nanostructured components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing scalable
fabrication processes that provide the necessary control of nanoparticle
structure for enhanced activity presents significant techno-economic challenges
for bringing nanoparticles to large- scale industrial catalytic applications.
The proposed technology with controlled precursor injection and tightly
controlled reaction zones for nanoparticle core-shell formation provides a
unique continuous process approach for scaling up core-shell nanocatalyst
fabrication and hierarchical assemblies at costs that are relevant for large-
scale industrial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Reactive Spray
Deposition Technology (RSDT) technology is a thin-film deposition process that
overcomes many of the shortcomings of traditional vapor deposition techniques
while also replacing conventional multiple step wet processing manufacturing
yielding equal or better quality coatings at a lower cost. The RSDT not only
provides high quality active films/coatings (e.g.catalysts/electrodes), it also
reduces the manpower, catalyst loading amount, energy consumption and number of
processing steps required to assemble the films. More specifically, RSDT
combines materials synthesis and deposition into a single step with several
control features, replacing at least 5 unit operations in a conventional
electrode manufacturing scheme.
