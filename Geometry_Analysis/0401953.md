DMS-0401953 Ezra Getzler and Eric Zaslow

This award supports a conference at Northwestern University on the mathematics
surrounding the theory of branes, in the context of the Emphasis Year on
Geometric and Topological Methods in String Theory at Northwestern University.
In addition, the award also supports a series of mini-workshops and seminars to
be held before the conference, which is particularly directed at students and
post-docs. This conference will foster a mutually beneficial interaction between
mathematicians and physicists. In addition, the activities are expected to play
a role in advertising potential applications of these emerging methods elsewhere
in geometry and topology.

Geometric and homotopy-theoretic methods have proved of increasing importance to
the study of string theory and associated areas of physics in the last few
years: we may mention Fukaya and Kontsevich's introduction of A1-categories and
the role of manifolds of G2-holonomy as just two examples. The flow of ideas has
gone in the other direction as well. For example, string duality has suggested
new directions of research on derived categories of algebraic varieties.
