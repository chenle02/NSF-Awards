This award funds the RIDGE 2000 project office, which is the coordinating body
for Ridge 2000 (R2K), an interdisciplinary research program focused on
integrated studies of Earth's oceanic spreading centers - the 50,000 km mid-
ocean ridge system, which is populated by hydrothermal vents that support
diverse communities of living organisms and where oceanic crust is created. The
Ridge 2000 program addresses a wide range of topics ranging from crustal
accretion to the transfer of energy from the mantle to the hydrosphere, to
biological systems supported by hydrothermal circulation. The office will
coordinate the final synthesis and integration phase of the decade-long Ridge
2000 Program that has collected a wealth of information. Community interaction
will be supported through a series of meetings each year and by teleconferences
and web conferences. The R2K office will also enhance data management and web
functions by establishing a consolidated web site at Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory (LDEO), and continue to support the existing education and outreach
activity at Pennsylvania State University.
