Cadmium is electroplated in cyanide baths in 1,166 facilities across the United
States. During the past two decades, considerable research has been conducted to
reduce toxic chemical discharge from cadmium electroplating operations. However,
economical elimination of cadmium discharge or sludge has not been reported. To
address the environmental issues related to cadmium electroplating, a novel
plasma enhanced vapor deposition concept was developed in the laboratory. In
addition to high deposition rates for cadmium and zinc, the feasibility of in-
situ cadmium reclamation to eliminate toxic chemical discharge was demonstrated.
It is also feasible to extend this concept to deposit or reclaim zinc-cadmium
alloys. However, an understanding of the effect of process variables on the
deposition rate and properties of cadmium is required. A systematic research
using statistical experimental design methods will develop this understanding.
The research could lead to an environmentally acceptable cadmium vapor plating
process (Dry Plating) as an alternative to cyanide electroplating.
