Towson University (TU), one of the sixteen National Centers of Academic
Excellence in Cyber Operations, proposes to continue and expand its
participation in the CyberCorps(R) Scholarship for Service (SFS) program to
prepare highly-qualified cybersecurity professionals for entry into the
government workforce. The project will provide scholarships to a diverse student
population and increase cybersecurity awareness among all students by offering
immersive experiential cybersecurity activities outside the classroom. To date,
the SFS program at TU has provided scholarships to twenty-six students with a
100% success rate with internship and postgraduate placement of the SFS
students. The project will have an immediate impact on the information assurance
and forensics capabilities of the Federal workforce by developing cybersecurity
professionals with strong technical skills. It will also establish and assess a
pathway in cybersecurity education with the Community College of Baltimore
County (CCBC) to support community college students through early mentoring and
advising. This collaboration provides an opportunity for recruiting students
from populations traditionally underrepresented in computing. The project will
develop out-of-classroom cybersecurity opportunities to generate interest among
broader student populations in the cybersecurity field.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SFS students are enrolled in an undergraduate Computer
Science degree with a specialized Security Track which is accredited by ABET. In
addition to the theoretical and mathematical foundation, students take courses
in programming, cryptography, network security, software security, reverse
engineering and malware analysis. In a capstone course, Case Studies in Computer
Security, students are divided into teams to build progressively more
sophisticated business networks. During live fire exercises, each team attempts
to defend their network while trying to attack the networks of other teams.
