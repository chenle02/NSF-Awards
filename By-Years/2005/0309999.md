The goal of this Minority Post-Doctoral Research and Training Fellowship in the
Social and Behavioral Sciences is to employ a combination of computational
modeling and functional neuroimaging to explore questions regarding the neural
bases of human episodic memory. Specifically, the project will investigate the
relationship between activity within biologically based computational models and
the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal within functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (fMRI). It will also use fMRI to test predictions generated by
a biologically based computational model regarding differential hippocampal and
medial temporal lobe cortex function in episodic memory. In addition, it will
explore interactions between computational models of prefrontal cortex and the
medial temporal lobe, again employing fMRI to test predictions regarding the
role of these regions in both episodic memory and cognitive tasks dependent upon
prefrontal cortical function. The synthesis of functional neuroimaging and
computational modeling methods promises significant advantages over employing
either method independently. Biologically based computational models can provide
a framework for understanding the processes supported by a particular brain
region and can be used to generate predictions for neuroimaging studies.
Conversely, functional neuroimaging studies can aid in determining the
plausibility of computational models, and provide suggestions for further
constraints upon the model.s functioning. Such a methodological interaction will
ultimately result in important advances in understanding how cognitive processes
arise from brain systems. The Fellow will receive his two year research and
training experience under the mentorship of Dr. John Gabrieli, Department of
Psychology, Stanford University.
