9423749 Lepore This project has the goal to provide a new class of
construction/building material from the inclusion of buff rubber into portland
cement, fine and coarse aggregate mixture. The material has unique properties
that allow the concrete material to function in more nontraditional
environments. The research will also contribute to understanding the coupling
agents between incompatible materials. Considering the current waste tire
problem, the project is expected to contribute new alternatives toward providing
significant improvements to the environment. ***
