SRI International will establish a permanent lidar facility at Sondre
Stromfjord, Greenland, capable of performing Rayleigh and resonant scatter
measurements. The Arctic lidar technology (ARCLITE) facility will be installed
at the Sondrestrom incoherent-scatter radar site to allow complementary studies
with collocated upper-atmospheric instrumentation, existing and planned. The
ARCLITE facility will concentrate on measurements of sodium D2 resonance
backscatter to provide information on the characteristics of the high-latitude
sodium layer, and on Rayleigh backscatter measurements to provide information on
the structure of the high-latitude mesosphere/stratosphere region.***//
