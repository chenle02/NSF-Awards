In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
electron spectroscopic studies will be carried out which aim at understanding
chemical effects on the behavior of excited molecular complexes. In addition to
its intrinsic scientific interest, this research has connections with site-
selective X-ray photochemistry and could have applications in nanolithography
and future generations of semiconductor device technology. Electron spectroscopy
will be used to determine the energies needed to remove inner-shell electrons
from small molecules in the gas phase and to study the dynamics and energetics
of the processes by which these highly excited molecules lose their energy. Also
concerned with the dynamics of inner-shell de-excitation will be a theoretical
and experimental study of the effects of molecular environment on the rate of
Auger decay in molecules containing carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine.
