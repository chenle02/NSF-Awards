The research examines energy flow in molecular systems where the electronic and
nuclear degrees of freedom are strongly coupled. Energy is input in to the
system via direct or resonant electron collisions. Subsequently, the energy
migrates into the nuclear degrees of freedom causing vibrational excitation
and/or dissociation. The nuclear dynamics is simulated using state-of-the-art
time-dependent wavepacket techniques.
