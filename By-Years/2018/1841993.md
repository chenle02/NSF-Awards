This workshop seeks to produce transformative improvements in the computing
research community's ability to understand, predict, and communicate the impacts
of its contributions, both positive and negative. It also aims to identify the
most effective means of incentivizing research that minimizes negative impact.
In the context of current public debates about the human consequences of new
information technologies, major computer science professional organizations have
begun discussing how to find ways to bend the arc of computing innovation
towards fewer negative impacts and more positive impacts. This workshop aims to
be a broader impacts catalyst, rendering the broader impacts of many funded
computing projects substantially more positive for the United States and the
world than they would have been otherwise. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This workshop
has three co-equal objectives: (1) Determine the most effective approaches for
using the research evaluation process to confront and mitigate the negative
impacts of computing research, (2) determine additional approaches that can be
effective in confronting and mitigating these negative impacts, and (3) improve
our capacity to understand and predict computing research impact through
visioning activities and the development of a research agenda. Workshop results,
including articles, technical resources, and other artifacts, will be shared
with the wider community, providing a formal framework for research development,
but also informally helping members of the computing community articulate better
broader impacts statements by providing education about how to think about the
impacts of one's research. Workshop participants will be comprised of both
computing researchers and experts on the societal impacts of new
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
