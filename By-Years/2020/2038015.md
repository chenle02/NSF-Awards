The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to support
the development of biodegradable performance fibers with inherent color and
material performance that can be attributed to protein structure for the fashion
and textile industry. This product addresses the fashion and textile industryâ€™s
concerns over the environmental impacts of petroleum-based synthetic fibers
(polyester, nylon, spandex, etc.) as an extractive raw material source that
persists in the environment as microplastics. The proposed fiber manufacturing
offers a valuable alternative to conventional textile dyeing, the second largest
sources of water pollution, and textile finishing, a source of environmental
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and human health hazards.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a
platform for engineering proteins with a desired function (color, stretch, and
moisture management) and enzymatically cross-linking them into a fiber for
textile applications. The technology enzymatically cross-links engineered
proteins that are expressed and amplified in E. Coli or yeast. The protein-based
fibers are selected, or designed, to map a desired textile property into a
functional fiber, film or biopolymer raw material suitable for industrial
spinning processes. These engineered proteins are designed to address the
demands of the textile industry by providing attributes such as inherent color
and stretch to the fibers. Proof-of-concept has been demonstrated in the
development of biopolymer composite fibers with inherent color and
fluorescence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
