The rise of digital platforms, such as cloud computing, blockchains, and machine
learning services, is leading to numerous new applications and transforming
daily life. However, users lack knowledge of other participants and it is
challenging to establish trust on these platforms. A key research question is
determining how users can protect the privacy of their data, and ensure that the
computations performed by others are valid. The focus of this project is on
developing efficient and scalable zero-knowledge proof schemes, an important
cryptographic primitive to ensure data privacy and computation integrity
simultaneously. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project advances three aspects of the
zero-knowledge proof schemes: theory, application and system level. On the
theory side, new practical schemes with linear running time in the size of the
computation are constructed based on error-correcting codes and expander graphs.
On the application side, the project investigates machine learning algorithms
and graph algorithms and develops efficient zero-knowledge proofs tailored for
these applications. On the system side, the project initiates the study of
memory-efficient and distributed algorithms for zero-knowledge proofs. The
project will bring the efficiency and scalability of zero-knowledge proof to the
next level, making it applicable and accessible to the broader community of
engineers and developers in the industry. The results will enable new
applications of privacy-preserving and verifiable data mining on digital
platforms to protect usersâ€™ data privacy. The project also develops new course
materials for undergraduate and graduate cybersecurity education, and for
broadening the participation in computing of underrepresented groups and K-12
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
