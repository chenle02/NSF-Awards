Duke University will operate the R/V CAPE HATTERAS during 1993 as a general
oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-sponsored research projects. The HATTERAS
is a 135' general purpose research vessel owned by the National Science
Foundation and operated by Duke University. The vessel is scheduled in 1993 for
a total of 216 days, of which 193 are in support of NSF-sponsored projects. The
remaining 23 days are in support of ONR, DOE and the State of N. Carolina
projects. The Hatteras will operate out of Bermuda the first four months of
1993. The vessel will take over the work normally performed by WEATHERBIRD II
while it is undergoing a four month upgrade and conversion. The rest of the year
the HATTERAS will operate out of its home port, Beaufort, where work will be
done along the shelf and slope regions of the Carolinas and Virginia. The ship
will support a mixture of biology, seismic and coring and geochemistry. The
schedule for the end of the year is light. This period will be used to continue
maintenance and upgrade.
