This is an NSF Young Investigator award. The PI's research will focus in the
area of solid-state and actuators and integrated circuits, as a means to stable,
high- performance peripherals for electronic systems and development of fully
integrated sensing/actuating systems. The specific research area of focus will
be microelectromechanical systems for high- performance sensing and actuation
devices, fabrication technologies for microstructure formation and for sensor-
actuator-circuit integration, design of high-performance interface electronics,
and definition of high- performance packaging techniques. Application areas for
this research will include implantable biomedical senors and actuators, and
sensors and actuators for transportation systems, avionics, instrumentation, and
other systems.
