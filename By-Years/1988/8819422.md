Previous studies have shown that only a small fraction of the infections
initiated in legume roots by nitrogen-fixing rhizobia successfully develop into
nodules. For unknown reasons, most initiations terminate prior to completion of
the process at all stages of development. The plant hormone ethylene has been
demonstrated to inhibit nodule formation. Conversely, studies in Dr. Peter's
laboratory have shown that the number of nodules formed on alfalfa roots by
Rhizobium meliloti is significantly increased by exposure to 1-a-amino-
ethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), a potent inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis. Together,
these results suggest that ethylene biosynthesis may have an important role in
regulating the efficiency of infection and nodule formation. This possibility is
consistent with the fact that many strains of Bradyrhizobium japonicum
synthesize a structural and functional analog of AVG. This compund, called
rhizobitoxine, is also a potent inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis in plants.
The PI will examine the role of rhizobitoxine and ethylene biosynthesis in
regulation of nodule development. Mutants of B. japonicum that have lost the
ability to synthesize rhizobitoxine will be isolated and inoculated onto host
plants to analyze the effects of rhizobitoxine on ethylene biosynthesis and
nodule development. The PI will determine whether rhizobitoxine and AVG enhance
nodule formation by increasing the total number of infections or by reducing
infection abortion. Genes required for rhizobitoxine synthesis will be isolated
and characterized. Although all plants require nitrogen for growth, only a few
plants (legumes mostly) can take atmospheric nitrogen and convert it to useable
nitrogen compounds. The present research will examine the mechanism by which
legumes initiate the nitrogen fixation process, allowing those plants to grow
without the economic and environmental cost associated with nitrogen
fertilization.
