This project proposes to perform fundamental research on the development of
classes of&lt;br/&gt;distributed control laws and algorithms for optimal traffic
engineering in a multiple-&lt;br/&gt;service enabled Internet. Having its basis
on recent results on the use of Sliding Mode&lt;br/&gt;theory in the context of
control of computer networks, the proposed research aims at&lt;br/&gt;developing
decentralized algorithms and tools for optimal traffic engineering in
the&lt;br/&gt;presence of both multiple paths and multiple classes of service.
The theoretical&lt;br/&gt;underpinnings of various traffic engineering
algorithms will be developed. It will also&lt;br/&gt;provide solutions,
implementation guidelines to practitioners in the field and
also&lt;br/&gt;valuable input to standardization bodies on the effectiveness of
various traffic&lt;br/&gt;engineering approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
