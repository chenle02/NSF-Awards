Professor Vicki Wysocki of the University of Arizona is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study the fast fragmentation of
peptides. The fundamental question in this work is one that asks why we are able
to see significant fragmentation on the timescale of the typical mass
spectrometry experiment, while the best theory available suggests that fragments
should only be observed with longer timescale MS experiments. The overall
hypothesis is that there are fast fragmentation pathways (via previously
undescribed reactive intermediates) that lead to the appearance of products on
timescales that allow observation by mass spectrometers with microsecond or
shorter experimental timeframes. The PI uses surface collisions in combination
with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (and later electrospray
ionization) and time-of-flight mass spectrometry to probe these processes. The
question is studied by varying both the nature of the surface and the nature of
the projectiles. There is a well-established collaboration with the Futrell
group at PNNL and the theorist Hase at Texas Tech. Students are well-trained in
physical-analytical chemistry and mass
spectrometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fragmentation of peptides is commonly used in
proteomics, in which mass spectrometry plays a critical role. Understanding
fragmentation at a fundamental level can lead to more efficient analytical
instruments, and predictive models for database purposes.&lt;br/&gt;
