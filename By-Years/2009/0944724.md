This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports infrastructure
upgrades at the National Solar Observatory (NSO) that will ensure the viability
of current NSO assets for supporting the solar physics community for the next
several years until the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope comes online. The
funds are designated to support forefront solar research by replacing failing
and outdated systems at NSO telescopes and data handling facilities and to
ensure the continued safety of operations at NSO observatory sites for visiting
scientists and staff. A total of $1.4M is awarded to replace obsolete and
failing instrumentation, to conduct maintenance on items that have been deferred
due to previous funding constraints, and to upgrade computing and data storage
capabilities to match the output of new instrumentation that have been installed
on NSO's flagship telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSO facilities are used by
the solar community to address many outstanding problems in solar physics and
the solar causes of space weather and its impacts on the Earth. Through these
upgrades, NSO?s ability to support this research will be substantially enhanced.
Information technology upgrades will permit NSO to store and disseminate data to
a broader segment of the solar community. NSO participation in programs to
broaden participation in research, such as the NSF Partnerships in Astronomy
&amp; Astrophysics Research and Education program and its other ongoing student
programs, will benefit from improved observing and data handling capabilities,
making it easier for students to work with forefront solar
observations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
