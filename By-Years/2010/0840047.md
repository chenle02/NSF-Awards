Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this effort is to
enable the development of high speed atomic force microscopy. The approach is to
research a transformational concept in high speed positioning: using
lithographically manufactured arrays of coils for magnetic actuation of a probe
tip. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed approach
entails the development of an integrated electronics solution by way of the
following: (1) replace the conventional piezo-actuation by an array of coils, as
opposed to a single coil, that provides electromagnetic actuation; (2) reduce
the delay in actuation to below micro-seconds; (3) investigate the efficient use
of multiple cantilevers to image in parallel where various arrays on the same
die can be dedicated to several cantilever imagers. For higher resolution high
speed imaging, the range can be sub-divided among the probes to image sub-
regions in parallel. The project will also address the issues of synchronization
among the imaging drivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the
proposed effort is in the cross-disciplinary knowledge outcome of the research
that would encompass integrated electronics, systems, and biology. It is
anticipated that such knowledge, with the help of the research assistant, would
be integrated in one current class in electronics and medical imaging. It will
also be disseminated through the website for this course. The investigator will
include one undergraduate female student currently working in his laboratory on
chip testing activities for this project.
