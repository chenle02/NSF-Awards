In this project the Principal Investigators will develop methods to rapidly
personalize the series of questions that are asked in an experiment or survey,
adjusting new questions based on a respondent?s previous answers and the speed
of their responses. The methods guarantee, mathematically, that the most
informative question is being asked at each step. The software challenge is
being able to recompute rapidly on a variety of computer platforms. We will also
make software user-friendly and widely available.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In terms
of broader impacts, this research will enable scientists to figure out, faster
and better, how people are different from each other in what they like and how
they behave. Our method will enable creation of short surveys that yield more
insight. The method will specifically be used to find out how much risk people
accept, how patient they are toward future costs and benefits, and how much they
like to cooperate and compete with other people. These methods can help
consumers and companies figure out what kind of investments they should make,
and help match workers with jobs that are ideal for them.
