Theory of Membranes and Complex Fluids - The proposed research is aimed at a
variety of topics related to memebranes and complex fluids. Membranes are two-
dimensional structures formed from any of a number of molecular entities. They
form the walls of living cells, and are important components of complex fluids
such as microemulsions. Membranes can exist in a number of forms, including
fluid, orientationally rigid, crystalline, and polymerized phases, and can form
topologically complex structures. This project focusses on equilibrium and
dynamical aspects of order within the membrane structure itself, and how these
are influenced by the large-scale effects of membrane shape and interactions
with other membranes. %%% Though the world we live in is three dimensional,
there are many examples in nature of two-dimensional systems, including
structureless interfaces between two coexisting materials (e.g., air and water),
thin films, and membranes. The structure of a thin film is determined by an
external constraint (e.g., the perimeter of a soap film). A membrane, however,
can attain a thermodynamically stable structure of its own, which can undergo
large changes of shape without losing its integrity. Such membranes are
important for the study of biomaterials, and also appear in a wide variety of
chemical synthesis processes, including production of numerous catalytic
materials.
