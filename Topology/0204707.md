This project involves the development and use of efficient triangulations in the
study and understanding of 3--manifolds. A triangulation of a 3-manifold
determines a class of surfaces in the 3--manifold called normal surfaces. A
fundamental observation is that in most cases when a 3--manifold contains an
interesting surface, then for any triangulation of the 3--manifold the same
interesting feature is exhibited by a normal surface in the triangulation. This
has provided a powerful method for studying 3-manifolds and solving certain
decision problems. Normal surface theory has, for example, lead to the
theoretical resolution of determining when two 3--manifolds, which contain
injective surfaces, are homeomorphic, to the classification of these same
manifolds, and to the determination of whether a knot in the three-sphere is the
unknot. However, even with the presence of interesting normal surfaces, a given
triangulation may have numerous uninteresting normal surfaces, which make
theoretical arguments quite tedious and computational attempts nearly
impossible. The guiding principle of efficient triangulations is reducing
unnecessary normal surfaces and improving the efficiency of computations for
triangulation based algorithms. They have exhibited remarkable success in doing
this. However, more surprisingly, efficient triangulations have exposed
interesting relations between one-vertex and ideal triangulations of three-
manifolds and new combinatorial structures, which seem to be intimately related
to the topology of the three-manifold. This project will explore efficient
triangulations with particular emphasis of their application to the
Homeomorphism Problem/Classification Problem for three-manifolds and issues of
computational complexity.

Low-dimensional topology brings together many areas of mathematical research and
provides a common ground for interaction and advance across all of mathematics.
It provides a natural geometric model of most physical phenomena. Research in
this area is making significant contribution to computational geometry and
topology and complexity theory. It has consequences in physics, computer
visualization and medical and biological modeling.
