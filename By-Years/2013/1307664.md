The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division supports
Professor Jesse H. Kroll of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the
laboratory study of chemical differences between organic compounds present at
the air-particle interface and those found within the bulk of the particles. New
analytical techniques for the real-time measurement of the surface composition
are being investigated and developed; these include combinations of soot
particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SP-AMS, a laser-based technique for the
rapid vaporization of particles containing black carbon or metal cores), tunable
vacuum ultraviolet photoionization (VUV, a soft ionization technique), and
direct analysis in real time (DART, a mass spectrometric technique for the
measurement of material surfaces). These state-of-the-art techniques will then
be used in environmental chamber studies, examining how the condensation of
secondary species affect organic aerosol composition, with a focus on the extent
and rate of mixing between various aerosol components.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is expected to provide new insights into the
formation and evolution of atmospheric organic fine particles. The direct
examination of chemical gradients and mixing within such particles will provide
important constraints on their atmospheric behavior, reactivity, and fate, and
ultimately on their role in global climate and human health.
