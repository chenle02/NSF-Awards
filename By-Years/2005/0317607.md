HRD- 0317607&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CREST Center for Nanomaterials
Characterization Science and Processing Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Howard
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI - James W.
Mitchell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Howard University (HU) will establish the CREST
Center for Nanomaterials Characterization Science and Processing Technology. The
Center will advance the chemical knowledge base underpinning the determination
of the chemical status of nanomaterials, providing the intellectual foundation
for verification of directed synthesis, and development of methods for
fabricating new nanomaterials with definable chemical identities and
technologically useful properties. In collaborations with investigators at
Lucent Technologies, HU faculty will innovate processes for converting
nanomaterials into thin film structures for device applications. HU efforts
involve the formation of a core group of research faculty that focuses on the
chemical, rather than the physical, characterization research of
nanomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and technology objectives of
the CREST Center at Howard University include: (1) executing the
characterization science research required for determining the chemical status
of nanomaterials; (2) developing methods for generating novel nanomaterials and
elucidating the vapor phase chemistry underlying the synthesis of nanomaterials;
(3) innovating processes for fabricating nanostructured materials and devices
with record setting performances; (4) enhancing research collaborations between
multidisciplinary teams at HU, Lucent Technologies, and NIST; (5) broadening
characterization research support across multiple disciplines at HU; (6)
supporting research&lt;br/&gt;collaborations in nanoscience throughout the
region, and (7) increasing the opportunity for undergraduates and graduate
student participation in research and laboratory experimentation. &lt;br/&gt;
