9352421 Sisko Belleville Area College is developing a computer-aided calculus
program to increase student involvement and introduce students to the technology
(hardware and software) they will be required to use in their professions.
Students are being challenged to become active participants as they use
Mathematica to understand the concepts and ideas of calculus. Computers are
being used by calculus students in directed laboratory classes to reinforce the
concepts and ideas of calculus. As Mathematica performs the tedious
calculations, students are developing an insight and appreciation of calculus.
"Real world" problems are being stressed as students become proficient with the
tools of their future.
