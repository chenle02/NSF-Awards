This award is to support research that will develop an aquaculture-based
calibration of the M. edulis paleothermometer. A secondary goal is the
application of the calibrated paleothermometer to fossil M. edulis shells from
coastal Maine.

The research team will design and develop aquaculture-based techniques for
monitoring M. edulis growth in controlled water conditions. They will then
document vital effects due to different age/environmental conditions as well as
those arising from different locations (Maine/Greenland). Finally age/location-
specific transfer functions will be generated for temperate and polar regions.

The broader impacts of this proposed research are that it will lead to a better
understanding of an important paleothermometer. Ultimately, better
paleotemperature estimates lead to a better understanding of the climate system
and our ability to hindcast different climate states and forecast future climate
change scenarios.
