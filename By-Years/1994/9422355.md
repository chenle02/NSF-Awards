9422355 ROBESON Wind-generated electricity has been viewed as one of the least
expensive and most abundant forms of energy. Although considerable attention has
been given to overcoming technological impediments to its use, far less work has
been undertaken to explore the physical characteristics of wind that affect its
utility as an energy resource. Foremost among those characteristics is the
variability of wind over a variety of geographic and temporal scales. The
continued development of wind resources therefore requires better understanding
of the influence of climatic variability and possible climatic change on the
intra-annual and inter-annual variability of wind. This project will explore
methodological issues inherent in the development of more accurate and more
finely refined wind resource maps by explicitly considering the effects of
regional wind variability, including statistical analyses of trends,
periodicities, and autocorrelation. It will examine temporal variations over
shorter time periods, using data gathered from 1961 through 1990 at a number of
climatic stations in the northern Great Plains states of North Dakota and South
Dakota to develop time series of wind power using one-hour, daily, and monthly
average wind speeds. Following generation of those time series, they will be
statistically decomposed into a number of components, including linear, daily,
and seasonal trends. These components will be used to explore new forms of time-
series models for wind power. This pilot project will facilitate refinement of
statistical approaches that can be used to improve knowledge about factors that
affect wind variability. This new knowledge should provide the basis for
updating maps of wind resources in the U.S., and it will permit refined
assessments of the potential for developing wind as an energy resource in
different parts of the nation.
