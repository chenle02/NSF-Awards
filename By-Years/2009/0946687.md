With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professor Jacob W.
Petrich and colleagues from the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University
will upgrade a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The upgraded instrument will enable
rapid 2D measurements with pulse field gradients and reliable 1D with increased
sensitivity, and will have variable temperature capabilities. The instrument
will be used to support research activities such: 1) preparation of
organometallic compounds that contain a range of heteroatoms including boron,
phosphorus, nitrogen, fluorine, and silicon; 2) synthetic methodologies and
applications in combinatorial chemistry; 3) elucidation of the roles of
structurally directed electron induction and transannulation in polycyclic Lewis
base and acid catalysis; 4) environmentally responsive materials, sensors and
catalysis; 5) green catalysis; and 6) custom carbohydrate
synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have a positive impact in
synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials, the environment and
biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as
research.
