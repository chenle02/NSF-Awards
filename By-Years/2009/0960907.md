Increasingly, technology mediated collaborations play a significant role in
data-driven science and engineering research. Development and operation of the
cyberinfrastructure underlying these collaborations relies upon the ?invisible
work? of infrastructure maintenance. The future of science and engineering rests
on developing and managing critical cyberinfrastructure talent responsible for
this work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will manage a workshop to develop
an understanding of the issues surrounding the creation and support of
cyberinfrastructure talent. The workshop will bring together cyberinfrastructure
project managers, system and database administrators, programmers, and user
support experts to focus on identifying lessons learned, developing a community
practice around cyberinfrastructure development and operation, and proposing
appropriate remedies to common issues in supporting cyber-research.
