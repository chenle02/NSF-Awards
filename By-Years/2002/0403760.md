NIRT: Field-effect switching of molecular charge configuration for QCA

This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering
initiative, NSF 03-043, category NIRT. Single-molecule quantum-dot cellular
automata (QCA) cells are realized by designing molecules with multiple redox
centers. The distribution of molecular charge among the redox centers represents
binary information. The key to QCA behavior is that a local electric field, the
"driver field," due to a neighboring molecule alters the charge configuration of
another molecule in a nonlinear way. Demonstration of field-effect switching of
molecular charge configuration is the focus of the proposed research. The use of
scanning probes with molecular resolution is crucial to this investigation. Our
strategy is to use chemical variation of mixed-valence pieces to remove any
ambiguities in the interpretation of our results.

Shrinking electronic devices to the single-molecule level may require abandoning
the notion of using transistors to represent binary information. The research is
exploring a different approach - using molecules, which can exist in two
different configurations to encode the binary information. This approach, called
quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA), has already been demonstrated at a larger
length scale using small metal dots. We are investigating one aspect of a
molecular QCA implementation - the switching of one molecule by the influence of
a neighboring molecule. This problem is at the heart of the molecular QCA
concept, which if successful would enable device densities perhaps a million
times greater than those possible with silicon transistors.
