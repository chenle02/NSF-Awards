Interdisciplinary (99) This project is adapting and implementing wireless
technology to create a more stimulating learning environment for undergraduate
students in mathematics and science classrooms. The more active learning
environment in which the students answer questions and solve problems rather
than watching instructors describe theories and solve problems is increasing
student performance on examinations and student satisfaction with chemistry,
mathematics and psychology courses. Previous pilot implementations are being
refined and implemented in large class sections. The project is also having a
significant impact on the preparation of future teachers by giving preservice
teachers experience in the use of technology to enhance learning.
