With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Yang will develop theoretical and computational
methods for computing the electronic structure of large molecules based on
density functional theory. He will extend recent progress along the following
two directions: (1) The direct calculation of electron density without using
molecular orbitals will be undertaken by a newly developed "divide and conquer"
algorithm. This method divides the molecule into subsystems and determines the
total electron density and energy as the sum of all subsystem contributions. It
is, in addition, well-suited for parallel computation. Effort will be made to
implement the theory on massively parallel computers, with each processor
handling one subsystem. (2) A more efficient way of implementing the solution of
the Kohn-Sham density functional equations will be developed by making use of a
local projection method. %%% The new algorithms which will be developed in this
project will enhance the predictive power of density functional theory and will
make possible theoretical studies of complex chemical and biological phenomena
that are otherwise impossible by conventional methods.
