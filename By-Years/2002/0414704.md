The problems encountered by novice and experienced users when browsing the Web
have been well documented in the literature. This project seeks to learn more
about the experiences of users with visual impairment who must use screen
readers to this end. Through a partnership with the National Federation of the
Blind, the PI will document the errors and frustrations of these users. Modified
time diaries will be used to collect data on causes, severity, responses, and
time lost. The research methods to be used for this project have previously been
employed successfully by the PI in preliminary research relating to web
usability, web accessibility, user error, user frustration, and user-centered
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: There are documented differences
in the computer usage and needs of different user groups, but there is limited
research on the errors and frustrations that diverse user populations face. The
end result of this project will be to increase our knowledge on what the causes
of user frustration are, for a large user community for which access to the Web
is a problem, so that in future work it will be possible to develop and test
improved computer interfaces for the Web that bring us a step closer to
achieving the goal of universal usability.
