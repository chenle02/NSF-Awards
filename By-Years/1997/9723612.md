This research effort is directed at examining the engineering process variables
on the mechanical properties of aromatic polyesters and copolyesters. The
proposal was submitted in response to NSF 96-4, NSF-CONACyT Collaborative
Research opportunities. It is an extension and augmentation of an already
successful cooperative research program in polymer engineering between the
University of Tennessee and the Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi. Basic
research studies will be under taken to determine the relations between
morphological control variables and critical mechanical properties and to extend
those results to the processing characteristics of the materials. It is proposed
to determine the behavior of the polymers and copolymers as a function of
cooling rate and nucleating agents and to relate the structures generated to the
mechanical properties. Successful completion of the effort will increase the
basic knowledge on the control of the mechanical properties during industrial
processing. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has agreed to participate
in the project by conducting specific analysis.
