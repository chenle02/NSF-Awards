The proposed research seeks to establish pressure effects on enzyme kinetics as
a diagnostic of enzyme mechanism of the same sort as initial rate kinetic
studies at constant pressure have been for the last 40 years or so. Pressure
effect studies on formate dehydrogenase will be correlated with isotope effect
studies. The pressure effect kinetic expressions will be developed and compared
with the results obtained with a series of enzymes whose catalytic mechanisms
are presumed to be known. %%% Studies of the time-dependence of enzyme-catalyzed
reactions as a function of enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor concentration have
developed into a paradigm for characterizing catalytic mechanism (ie. the timing
of bond-making and bond-breaking events during the converstion of substrate into
products). Understanding of enzyme mechanism is important for developemnt of
better substrates or inhibitors, etc. Mechanism information is useful for
understanding how metabolism works and for the design of drugs and enzyme
assays. The study of pressure effects on enzyme catalysis has the potential of
developing into another powerful diagnostic of mechanism which is both
independent of and complementary to concentration- dependence studies. The
proposed work could provide revolutionary new insights into enzyme function
studies.
