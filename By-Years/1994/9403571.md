9403571 Kumar Semiconductor manufacturing is a complex process, involving
hundreds of steps of processing. Wafer return several times to many tools,
leading to a highly re-entrant process flow. This proposal addresses the
problems of efficient operation, analysis and design of plants. The goal is to
advance the state-of-the art on two important fronts: (1) Optimization of Cycle-
Time Performance, and (2) Performance Evaluation of Semiconductor Manufacturing
Plants. This proposal pursues an approach of studying the constraints on the
mean value of certain random variables. It develops a programmatic procedure for
obtaining performance bounds, and illustrates its application to various fab
models and scheduling policies. This approach can be used to establish the
stability, i.e. performance recurrence, and even the boundedness of moments, of
the Markov chain underlying the system. The research proposed in this proposal
is application driven, and uses a variety of tools ranging from simulations,
heuristics, and software development, to theory. The goal is to advance the
state of the art in scheduling semiconductor fabs, as well as the theoretical
foundation of the proposed approach. ***
