This award supports a workshop to formulate a detailed science plan of
coordinated investigations aimed at answering the key questions identified in
the SeaRISE report (NASA, 1990). These key questions address the goal of the
SeaRISE initiative "to predict the contribution of marine ice sheets to rapid
changes in global sea level in the next decade to centuries" through the
attainment of the supporting objectives "to understand the current state,
internal dynamics, interactions, and history of this environmental system". This
workshop will identify the required investigations and formulate a feasible
field schedule of coordinate activities that, when completed, will achieve the
SeaRISE goal and objectives.
