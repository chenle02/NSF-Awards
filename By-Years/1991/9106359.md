This project seeks to achieve a fundamental understanding of the behavior of
the dopants (controlled impurity atoms) needed to obtain desired levels of
electrical conductivity of crystalline zinc selenide (ZnSe), a II-VI compound
semiconductor material. This material has important potential applications such
as solid state devices which emit blue light, including lasers, which are not
currently available. Such devices would provide advantages for optical
information storage systems, full color displays, laser printers, and other
purposes. However, the inability to control the conductivity of ZnSe in the way
commonly done with other semiconducting materials has thus far prevented its use
for such practical applications. Sophisticated optical spectroscopy with and
without the influence of intense magnetic fields, and electrical measurements
are being employed to explore the behavior of various impurities in the
material, and to determine which ones are most suitable for controlling its
conductivity in the way that is necessary for device applications. Close
collaborations with industrial crystal growers are an important part of the
program.
