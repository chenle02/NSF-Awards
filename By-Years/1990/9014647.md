This project analyzes the design, transfer, and use of programmable automation
in selected U.S. producer and end-user establishments in the machine
tool/metalworking sector and among purchaser firms of such products. Case
studies of 30 firms will be conducted to evaluate a set of hypotheses about
discrete chains of production. The study will identify specific inter- firm
linkages that influence the design process and design strategies, a crucial
nexus in more extensive chains of production.
