Deployable-collapsible structures have many potential applications, ranging from
emergency shelters and facilities, through relocatable, semi-permanent
structures, to space-station components. Combinations of regular pentagons and
hexagons have already been shown to be feasible. All of these concepts now need
to be combined into a set of design tools that can build and test generalized
geometric models for multi-panel "clicking" deployable structures. Such a tool
would be a CAD system which could propagate the constraints of adjacent modules
to an attachment. This tool would then generate the model for both deployment
and in- service analysis and design. //
