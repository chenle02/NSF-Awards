The laboratory experiences are linked to the lecture presentation by
incorporating laboratory video images into the computer assisted multimedia
presentations. The multimedia presentation program has the flexibility to
retrieve laboratory images for display at any point in the lecture. A computer
driven video system enhances microscopy, dissection, demonstrations and
experiments. The laboratory exercises are displayed live on the closed circuit
video system and selected segments are stored on computer disc or video tape for
further analysis or review. The video system captures, stores and instantly
retrieves rare microscopic motions and other unique laboratory observations.
Images are enlarged, and then compared in split screen.
