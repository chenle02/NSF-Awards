The objective of this award is to organize the logistics portion of the annual
Principal Investigators (PI) meeting for the National Robotics Initiative (NRI),
which was launched in 2011. The PI meeting brings together the community of
researchers, companies, and program officers who are actively engaged in the NRI
to provide cross-project coordination in terms of common intellectual
challenges, methods for education and training, best practices in education,
technology transfer and general outreach, and a centralized and lasting
repository illustrating the research ideas explored and milestones achieved by
the NRI projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting of the Principal
Investigators of the National Robotics Initiative will be two days in October
2018 in the vicinity of Washington DC. The format will include presentations by
the attending PIs of projects in their final year, a poster session with all
other projects, keynote speeches, and panel discussions. Invitations to the
meeting will include all PIs with active NRI grants, program managers with
robotics-related programs, and members of the press. This award will take care
of the venue, travel, A/V, supplies, and many of the personnel involved in
organizing the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
