0132169&lt;br/&gt;Bierman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial
support for acquisition of an inductively coupled plasma, optical emission
spectrometer (ICP-OES) and sundry sample preparation equipment. The newly
established ICP facility in the Department of Geology, University of Vermont,
will be dedicated to research relying on high precision trace element analyses
of natural samples and the teaching of students with ICP analytical techniques
and their applications. The new ICP lab will serve faculty members Bierman,
Klepeis, Lini and Rusher for studies including determination of post-glacial
surficial weathering rates, investigations of the petrogenesis of igneous
plutons, research on experimental phase equilibria, and environmental impact
studies. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
