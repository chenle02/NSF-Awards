The innovation proposed in this program is a tailored composite sacrificial
anode for galvanic cathodic protection systems for reinforced and prestressed
concrete. This anode system can be tailored for each application to provide the
desired performance characteristics by changing the composition and form of the
finished composite. The composite sacrificial anode will contain all of the
necessary components in a single unit, minimizing the need for special
installation procedures. The focus of the program will be on development and
testing of composite sacrificial anodes in aqueous alkaline solution and
concrete environments for galvanic protection of reinforcing steel and
prestressing wires. The effects of fabrication methods, anode composition,
physical characteristics and form, and concrete chemistry, resistivity and
temperature on galvanic performance will be evaluated.
