The study of L-functions or zeta functions has a long history in mathematics,
dating back to Gauss, Riemann, Dirichlet, Hecke, Artin, et al. In the last fifty
years, lots of progress has been made after Langlands introduced the deep
philosophy between number theory and automorphic forms. Among these, the
relation between special values of L-functions and periods, which the PI
proposes to study, is one of the most important problems. Precisely, the first
part of the proposal is about the global restriction problems of automorphic
representations in the framework of the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture. With
various collaborators, the PI will formulate an explicit conjecture for those
periods, generalizing the work of Ichino-Ikeda, as well as study the case of
unitary groups using the tool of relative trace formula, proposed by Jacquet-
Rallis in a special case and the PI in general. The second part of the proposal
is to understand the relation between central derivatives of L-functions and
certain arithmetic periods, namely, height of cycles on Shimura varieties. The
PI proposes to study such relation via arithmetic theta lifting after Kudla and
the PI himself, in particular, in the next unknown case of U(2,2).

The ultimate goal of this research is to better understand one of the central
questions in mathematics: how to solve equations, particularly, algebraic
equations in number fields. These equations hide themselves in various kinds of
mathematical objects, such as algebraic cycles, representations, period
relations, etc. The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is one of the most
famous questions toward this direction. Outside pure mathematics, algebraic
equations like elliptic curves, have important application in cryptography.
