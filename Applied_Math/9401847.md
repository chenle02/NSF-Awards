9401847 Cannon The principal investigator will study diffusion subject to the
specification of mass, a number of free boundary value problem related to
combustion of solid fuels, and will analyze a number of nonclassical inverse
problems. The qualitative analysis o the solutions of such problems is of
significant scientific interest in view of the wide spread application of such
problems to physical systems. Parabolic partial differential equations are
useful as mathematical models in many areas of engineering, chemistry, and
physics. By better understanding the fundamental theory of nonstandard models of
lows, better numerical predictions of real flows will result.
