Israel is a pluralistic society that contains numerous subgroups divided along
ethnic lines. This research project will extend our understanding of how
individuals conceptualize their ethnic identities and how ethnic boundaries are
created and maintained. The researcher will investigate individuals of Moroccan,
Romanian, and Palestinian backgrounds in the multiethnic community of Akko
(Acre). Each group's reaction to national policies and expectations with regard
to language use and education will be analyzed within the context of the
community. This research will add significantly to our knowledge about the
complexities of interethnic contact in relation to state power. On an
utilitarian level it may well provide insights that will be useful to resolving
the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.
