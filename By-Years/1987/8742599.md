Fish are a major component of the antarctic marine community. Knowledge of their
age and growth is essential to the understanding of the structure and functions
of the ecosystem. This supplemental award to Dr. Targett presents a unique
opportunity to increase information on one aspect of growth: the relationship
among feeding activity, temperature, and photoperiod. Thirty fish collected in
the antarctic were transported to Delaware, where growth experiments have been
carried out for sixteen months. These are the first fish successfully
transported to a U.S. laboratory. The precision of temperature control during
laboratory experimentation available in Delaware is superior to that available
in the antarctic. Research will focus on the variation in feeding rate, feeding
magnitude and changes in growth efficiency observed between winter and summer.
Support is recommended.
