This EAGER proposal seeks funding to develop a new in-situ H+ eddy correlation
(EC) system by adapting and optimizing pH liquid ion exchange (LIX) electrodes
that were originally developed for medical use (Ammann et al. 1981).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project would
support the career advancement and research endeavors of a new Postdoctoral
Scholar at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. It would also include
international cooperation through collaboration with the microsensor laboratory
group at the Max Plank Institute for Marine Microbiology and combined with the
expertise and EC instrumentation from the University of Virginia, would enable
the collaboration between three of the very few research groups presently
engaged in aquatic EC research.
