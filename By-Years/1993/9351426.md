The project will develop and implement undergraduate experiments in surface
analysis using the technique scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Although
characterization of surfaces is a central activity of many chemists in the
chemical, semiconductor, petroleum, polymer and biotechnology industries, it
remains a subject which is rarely addressed in undergraduate coursework at
institutions throughout the U.S. Because STM is capable of surface imaging under
ambient conditions (instead of under high vacuum) and due to the recent
introduction of low cost commercial instructional STM instruments, it is now
possible to implement a meaningful experience in surface analytical chemistry at
the undergraduate level. Students will image standard materials at atomic
resolution, and then examine a modified surface at low resolution, thus gaining
exposure to tunneling phenomena, surface visualization and image processing
software.
