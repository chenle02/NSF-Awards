Incorporation of a 200 MHz C/H NMR spectrometer will upgrade the curriculum by
allowing our students to experience powerful means of structure elucidation, and
it will introduce computer- controlled instrumentation. The project will
strengthen the curriculum at several levels. The second-year organic chemistry
sequence will be augmented to allow earlier and more frequent use of NMR in
compound identification and structure analysis. The course "Introduction to
NMR", part of our research introduction sequence "Advanced Opportunities in
Chemistry", will be expanded to give more students early technical skills and
encouragement to pursue later undergraduate research. Upper level courses will
use FT-NMR as an integral part of the problem-solving. The undergraduate
research program will be emphasized and greatly strengthened by the acquisition.
The grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
