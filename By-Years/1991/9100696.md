Description: This project supports participation by a U.S. delegation to the
"World Congress on Natural Hazard Reduction" planned for February 1-9, 1991 in
New Delhi, India. The congress is organized by Dr. K.N. Majumdar of the
Institution of Engineers (India). Among topics to be covered are: geological
hazards, including earthquakes and land slides; atmospheric hazards, including
hurricanes and severe storms, droughts, and floods; social science perspectives,
including mitigation planning, social theory, trends, global change, policy and
application, group behavior, policy and institutional analysis; and engineering
and environmental management. Scope: It is planned that eight U.S. scientists
covering the different topics will participate. They are expected to convey
lessons learned and approaches to hazard reduction in the U.S., to make contacts
with Indian researchers who are developing plans for the International Decade
for Natural Disaster Reduction, and to visit Indian institutes involved in
research in these areas. This project is likely to increase the interaction and
cooperation between scientists and engineers in the two countries.
