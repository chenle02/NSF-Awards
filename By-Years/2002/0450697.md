This proposal addresses the need for funds to operate the Pierre Auger
Observatory (PAO) for the next five years, starting in 2004. The objective of
the PAO is to measure, with full sky coverage, the energy, direction and
composition of the cosmic rays with energies above 10^19 eV. Large aperture
cosmic ray observatories are opening a new window to the universe. To address
this opportunity a broad based international collaboration has come together to
build a very large air shower observatory that will make an all-sky study of
cosmic rays at the highest energies. A number of cosmic rays with energies near
and beyond 10^20 eV have been reported. Yet neither the origin of these cosmic
rays nor the acceleration mechanism responsible for their enormous energies is
known. The direct search for sources as well as the behavior of the energy
spectrum above 5*10^19 eV will provide important clues to these mysteries. The
PAO, located in Mendoza, Argentina, has completed the engineering phase and
construction is underway and is expected to be complete by about the end of 2005
and to have a 20-year lifetime. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of the PAO has
already gone well beyond the construction work and the capture of the first
cosmic ray events. Close ties have been developed with branches of the National
Technical University in Argentina where a number of students are involved, not
only in building and testing equipment but in data taking tasks as well. In
terms of outreach, the Visitor Center on the Auger campus has attracted more
than 10,000 visitors from 26 countries. The collaboration sponsors a popular on-
going lecture series for the public in the host city of Malargue and nearby
communities. A particularly close relationship has been established with the
people of Malargue. In the US, the PAO works closely with the CROP project based
at the University of Nebraska that helps high school students install cosmic ray
detectors on their schools. &lt;br/&gt;
