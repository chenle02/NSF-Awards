This award supports a three-year project to conduct research and develop tools
for Internet performance diagnostics, measurement and analysis. The project
focuses on two primary areas of Internet statistics: routing stability, topology
and visualization; and network service provider performance diagnostics and
measurement. The overall goal of the project is to develop tools and perform
statistical research that promotes the stability and rational growth of the
Internet. It is expected that the project will be supported in future years by
other funding sources such as industry-wide consortia.
