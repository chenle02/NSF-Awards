****Abstract***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Science and Technology Center (STC) on
Integrated Quantum Materials (C-IQM) is a partnership involving Harvard
University, Howard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and
the Boston Museum of Science, complemented by a large number of International
collaborators. C-IQM is further strengthened and complemented by constant
interactions with the "College Network" comprising partnership with
investigators and teachers from Mount Holyoke, Olin and Wellesley Colleges in
the Boston area, as well as with Gallaudet University and Prince George's
Community College in the Washington D.C area. The focus of the Center is to use
the recent discovery of quantum materials to transform signal processing and
computation through an integrated approach that incorporates research,
education, knowledge transfer, and increased diversity enhanced by international
opportunities. These new quantum materials are changing the playing field and
show promise to completely reshape modern technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of the C-IQM is that it integrates synergistically three
research areas at the forefront of condensed matter physics: (1) Graphene (G)
with electrons that move as massless particles at a constant speed; (2)
Topological Insulators (TI) where mobile surface electrons have spins fixed to
the direction of motion; and (3) Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) Centers in diamond where
a single spin stores a "bit" of quantum information. C-IQM takes advantage of
the quantum phenomena displayed by these materials which, by persisting up to
room temperature, lead to changes in the rules for signal processing and
computation, ultimately opening the way for quantum electronics. These quantum
materials are ideally suited for integration into layered processor structures,
in which Graphene and Topological Insulators control the flow of charge and
spin, and NV-centers in diamond provide memory sites and optical input/output
channels. Layering is natural for Graphene and Topological Insulators, which
have two-dimensional electron systems on their surface. The C-IQM mission is to
understand the unique electronic behavior of quantum materials and pursue an
exciting opportunity to observe the exceedingly elusive Majorana fermion, a
particle which is its own antiparticle. Quantum electronics developed in the
Center will offer new approaches to signal processing, computing, and THz
electronics. The broader impacts of the C-IQM are found in the strategic goal to
develop a new class of quantum electronic devices and systems that will
transform signal processing and computation. An equally important goal of C-IQM
is to attract students to science and engineering, and to provide them with
exciting opportunities to become future leaders. The Center's research and
education programs bring together a diverse community to address these
challenges by involving undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral
associates, professors, industry and the public. The vision of the Center is
clearly aligned with the national research and education strategic priorities.
