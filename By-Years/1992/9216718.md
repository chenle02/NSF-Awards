The goals of the research are to determine the signal-processing capabilities of
the real-time, three-dimensional acoustic imaging system in the big brown bat,
Eptesicus fuscus, and how the bat uses sonar images to control interception of
airborne targets. It will be determined if novel signal-processing or
information- coding operations are employed during echolocation. A computational
model will be developed and evaluated and improved based on behavioral and
neurophysiological experiments designed to determine the properties of parallel
time and frequency transforms that produce spatial images of targets. This
research is important because the model will illustrate how to bring time- and
frequency- domain information together to form images. This information could be
used to advance the design of made-made systems for target tracking and target
identification.
