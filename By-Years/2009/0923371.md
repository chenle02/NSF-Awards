This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded by NSF to
Tennessee State University (TSU) for the purchase of a state-of-the-art
instrumentation consisting of portable photosynthesis and respiration system
package. The equipment set includes a Li-Cor Environmental Education Fund (LEEF)
III package; a Li-Cor 4300c Leaf Area Meter, an LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer;
and a Soil Moisture Meter. The instrumentation will be used to address a variety
of research questions in the areas of plant physiology, ecology, organic
farming, and environmental sciences. Specifically, the instrumentation will be
used to investigate plant responses to climate change such as drought and
flooding, and responses to environmental stresses such as nutrient deficiency,
soil respiration in grasslands and croplands. The acquisition of instrumentation
will also allow faculty and students to carry out the research projects that
would otherwise be significantly impeded or impossible to conduct at TSU. This
grant will allow the PI and TSU faculty to generate data that would strengthen
future proposals. The broader impacts of the proposed activity relate to both
ecophysiological research and the training of students at TSU. The new equipment
will be integrated into the curriculum at both undergraduate and graduate levels
to enrich student research training and learning. The equipment will also
increase the ability of the PIs to attract and mentor under-represented minority
undergraduate students in the fields of ecology and environmental studies, and
provide hands-on research experience to students conducting independent research
projects. Results obtained with this equipment will be published in high impact
peer reviewed scientific journals and will be presented at scientific
conferences for wide dissemination.
