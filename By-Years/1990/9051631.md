The Environmental Study program emphasizes "hands-on" experiential science
instruction and involves students in research projects in the areas of
biological science, meteorology, conservation, and astronomy. Appropriate field
equipment is being purchased to support this diverse program. Projects involve
individual and class research with the steps of selecting a problem, literature
review, research procedure, data compilation, discussion of results, summary and
conclusion. Research papers will be written and reported. This program allows
students to experience the scientific method directly through field research.
This fosters the students' interest in science, and their development of an
understanding of environmental science which will allow for wise environmental
and natural resource decisions. The college will contribute an amount equal to
the award.
