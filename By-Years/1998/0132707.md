EIA-0132707 -Harvard University-Marc D. Hauser-Primate-Inspired Specialized
Learning in an Agent Architecture: Safe and Robust Adaptive Action
Selection&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intended multi-year research project would
build a library of computational modules or idioms for representing learning and
action-selection in non-human primates. We will particularly focus on modeling
why well-learned new behavior does not always over-ride more established
behavior patterns, and under what circumstances it can come to be exploited.
This modeling could be key to designing fail-safe mechanisms in highly adaptive
intelligent systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this exploratory project, we would
adapt an existing agent architecture to model the specialized learning in
Cotton-Top Tamarins, focussing on several completed experiments already
documented in our laboratory. Conducting this research under an SGER will give
us an estimate of the scale of the software project, the level of interaction we
can expect between the modeling and our ongoing research, and the educational
potential for this system. This will help us determine the level of staffing and
funding requested in the full proposal.&lt;br/&gt;
