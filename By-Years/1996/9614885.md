9614885 The U. S. National Committee for Rock Mechanics (USNC/RM), which
represents the American rock mechanics community in the United States and
internationally, identifies critical issues in rock mechanics that need to be
addressed, and operates under the auspices of the National Research Council's
Board on Earth Sciences and Resources (BESR). The expertise, judgment, and
strategic perspective of the USNC/RM serves to define and help initiate
sponsored studies and other activities with respect to major areas of national
interest or concern in which rock mechanics problems represent critical or
limiting factors. The committee offers a forum for meetings with federal
sponsors and other interested organizations to exchange ideas and information on
important topics. ***
