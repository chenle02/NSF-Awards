This project involves the establishment of a laboratory at Hunter College, part
of the City University of New York, within the department of Geology and
Geography. The project will integrate an existing program in remote sensing and
image processing with related new and existing classes in geographic information
systems and analytical cartography. This goal will be achieved by the
establishment of a new laboratory containing four IBM-PC AT-based Earth
Resources Data Analysis Systems, with associated geographic data processing
modules, and the PMAP geographic information system software. When integrated
with existing and new department computer hardware and software, this facility
will offer a state-of-the-art instructional environment for the laboratory
component of three separate but related areas of undergraduate coursework. These
courses will strengthen an existing undergraduate program in remote sensing by
providing a common ground between remote sensing and image processing,
analytical and computer cartography, and geographic information systems. The
resulting specialization will provide students with advanced undergraduate
training for geographic information processing, and will give them experience
with a system which is becoming something of an industry standard.
