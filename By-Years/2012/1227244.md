This research examines the impact of electing criminal trial judges on their
ability to protect minority rights in the sentencing process. The study utilizes
administrative data from Kansas that includes the universe of convicted felons
from 1998 to 2010. Kansas is one of only three states that uses both elections
(in 14 districts) and appointment (in 17 districts) to choose judges. This
variation will allow the PIs to distinguish between judicial appointment modes,
controlling for state-specific factors. This research also investigates the
extent to which judicial prejudice can be learned or unlearned over time. With
more professional experience, it seems plausible that judges could update their
prior beliefs as they learn about true race-specific recidivism rates through
repeated interactions with both black and white
defenders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A "learning-by-doing" model speaks to the
concurrent policy debate over the merits of sentencing guidelines. Since the
1980's, the federal government and numerous states have enacted sentencing
guidelines in order to provide more structure in the sentencing process, which
in theory, limits racial sentencing disparities by constraining judicial
discretion. In practice, there has been mixed evidence on their effectiveness,
which raises concerns that preventing judges from utilizing their expertise is
unwarranted. If judges do engage in more race-based sentencing earlier rather
than later in their careers, then this would suggest tying the guidelines to
tenure might be a more effective implementation of this policy.
