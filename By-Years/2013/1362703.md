This award will fund the conference entitled "Representations of Reductive
Groups" to be held May 19-23, 2014, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The conference will address developments in the
representation theory of reductive Lie groups and algebraic groups over finite
and local fields, as well as connections of this theory with other subjects,
such as number theory, automorphic forms, algebraic geometry and combinatorics.
It will feature one-hour lectures from renowned experts in these areas. A
significant portion of the award will be used to support the participation of
current graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients.

Representation theory is a central subject in modern mathematics. Historically,
its study arose from attempts to understand the role of symmetry in physics.
More recently, it has become the framework to address many of the most important
and long-standing questions in number theory. The conference will highlight
exciting recent developments in this area, and will draw junior participants
into the subject.
