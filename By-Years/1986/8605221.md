This project procures equipment to support research in three areas. These
include expert system development for the synthesis of mechanical systems,
development of a practical design methodology for variable structure
controllers, and development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems for
analyzing the strength of riveted joints. The equipment is an artificial
intelligence machine, LAMBDA PLUS. For the synthesis research, the AI machine
enables the development of an expert system for synthesis of systems comprising
linkages, cams, gears, belt pulleys, and other similar components. The second
project uses the AI system's symbolic manipulation capability to build variable
structure control systems, which as the name implies are systems capable of
switching from one control structure to another when directed by internal logic.
For the third project, the AI equipment will enable inclusion in the design
process of all of the major issues associated with riveted joint failure (i.e.,
fastener tearout, installation processes, corrosion effects, etc.).
