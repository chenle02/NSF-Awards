The investigators will use computer models to better characterize the
mesospheric body forces resulting from gravity wave dissipation and determine
the propagation of these gravity waves into the lower thermosphere. The dynamics
of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) is strongly influenced by wave
breaking and momentum transport. Prior work has shown that localized body forces
re-radiate secondary gravity waves which propagate into the lower thermosphere.
These secondary gravity waves may therefore play a significant role in the
momentum budget of the thermosphere. The investigators will used existing models
to simulate the small-scale dynamics of the MLT region and the effects of
gravity waves. Airglow and radar data will be used to quantify the MLT body
forces, which will be used to model the generation and propagation of secondary
gravity waves. This study has the potential to identify a new, important process
regulating energy flow in the middle and lower atmosphere that may also have
application to stellar and planetary atmospheres where gravity wave breaking and
momentum transfer are important.
