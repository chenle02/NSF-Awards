9706129 Carmichael Previous work has determined that the phenocryst assemblages
of andesitic lavas in western Mexico are strongly influenced by the
concentrations of water that the magmas contain. Basalts and basaltic andesites
from central Mexico may contain hornblende phenocrysts and it is proposed to
quantify the P-T conditions, together with the water concentration in the
liquids, in the regimes in which hornblende is stable. In addition, phenocrysts
of pyroxene and olivine, often without plagioclase, will be used to constrain
the water concentrations in basalts and basaltic andesites without hornblende.
Ferric-ferrous ratios in the hornblendes will be calibrated with oxygen fugacity
in an internally heated pressure vessel in which the rapid quench preserves the
liquid as a glass. In addition, the geological age and environment of andesites-
basalts in central Mexico are so poorly known that mapping and sampling will be
completed in Zitacuaro region of Michoacan, Mexico.
