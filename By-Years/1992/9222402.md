Supported by an International Travel Grant, two graduate students will present
papers at two conferences in Australia. These are The Sixth International
Conference on Physics of Estuaries and Coastal Seas, and The Eleventh
Australasian Conference on Fluid Mechanics. Both conferences will be held in
December of 1992. The work, supported by a grant from NSF, describes new results
that define vertical mixing rates in density-stratified turbulent shear flows.
Such mixing plays a crucial role in a variety of environmental pollution
problems.
