The Department of Physics has recently revised the requirements for the BA
degree in physics in order to improve the preparation of students planning
careers in biological physics, bioengineering, radiology, health physics, or
medicine. A reduced number of physics courses permits the student to prepare for
the above disciplines by taking elective chemistry and biology courses. To
strengthen their preparation, the department has added a Physics of Medicine and
Biology course. This project funds supporting laboratory experiments at each
level of our curriculum. In the General Physics Laboratory, an experiment on the
fundamentals of ultrasound detection is being added. This experiment is followed
in the Intermediate Laboratory with experiments on ultrasonic imaging and
velocimetry. In the Advanced Laboratory, experiments exploring the fundamentals
of pulsed NMR are being added. After doing these experiments, the students go to
the Medical School for demonstrations and some measurements with clinical
ultrasonic and MRI instrumentation. The addition of these experiments, and the
changes in our curriculum, will better prepare students for career opportunities
in physics-related fields.
