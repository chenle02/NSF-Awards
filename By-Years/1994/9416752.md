9416752 Mullen This research is intended to advance the understanding of the
mechanical behavior of silicon at the micro- and nano-scale levels in order to
improve the mechanical reliability of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The
proposed research seeks to provide a sound fracture mechanics base for
polysilicon MEMS devices and a sound materials science base relating processing
parameters to polysilicon microstructures and polysilicon microstructures to
mechanical behavior. The overall aim is to understand and significantly improve
the mechanical reliability of polysilicon MEMS devices by combining the research
expertise of applied mechanicians, materials scientists and electrical
engineers. This synergistic collaboration will lead to new knowledge that will
significantly improve the design, fabrication and utility of MEMS devices. ***
