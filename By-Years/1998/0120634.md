0120634&lt;br/&gt;Bruneau&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a six-month
collaborative research project between Professor Michael Bruneau of SUNY,
Buffalo, Professor Akira Wada of the Tokyo Institute of Technology and Masayoshi
Nakashima at Kyoto University in Japan. The researchers will be undertaking a
study of hybrid testing at large scale high performance shake table earthquake
simulation facilities. The U.S. PI's are developing the world's most versatile
next generation earthquake engineering research facility designed to provide
testing capabilities that will revolutionize the fundamental understanding of
how large structures behave during earthquakes and will feature advanced shake
tables. It is a part of the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake
Engineering Simulation (NEES). The NEES collaboratory will include approximately
20 equipment sites (shake tables, centrifuges, tsunami wave basin, large-scale
laboratory experimentation systems, and field experimentation and monitoring
installations) networked together through the high performance Internet.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific objective is to add a new international
frontier to the NEES project in order to 1) foster international collaboration
aimed at exchange of experiences by the Japanese counterparts; 2) identify
common challenges facing the developers of such facilities, inclusion of such
experiences in the actual design development/integration of the proposed
facility at Buffalo and other NEES locations; and 3) cultivate collaborative
partnerships for future sharing of facilities to extend testing capabilities to
further the common goals. The project brings together the efforts of
laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.
Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our
knowledge base and promote international understanding and cooperation. The
researchers plan to publish the results of their collaborations on the NEES web
site.&lt;br/&gt;
