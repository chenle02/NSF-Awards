Communities which persist in the face of severe disturbances may do so because
the impact of the disturbance is mitigated by patch configuration coupled with
dispersal. This proposal examines this issue for lotic invertebrates which are
known to rapidly recover from floods but for which the recovery mechanisms are
not known. The PI will test the general hypothesis that mitigating patches,
namely debris dams, lessen the detrimental effect of floods on stream meiofauna
by reducing faunal displacement during floods and by facilitating return of
displaced fauna to the stream bottom following flood. Experimental tests of
specific hypotheses are outlined to address both the magnitude of the effect
that these mitigating patches have on the fauna and the mechanisms underlying
the effects. Experiments will involve: (1) field quantification of how the
spatial patterns of the fauna are effected by the proposed mitigating patches
and by flood; (2) field experiments in which patches are manipulated and
recovery of fauna compared with unmanipulated sites; and (3) field and flume
studies examining the mechanisms responsible for faunal response to mitigating
patches. The results will provide information on how natural disturbances effect
equilibrium conditions.
