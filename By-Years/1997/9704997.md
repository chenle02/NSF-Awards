Piatetski-Shapiro 9704997 The objective of the research funded under this award
is to investigate the lifting of generic cuspidal automorphic representations of
orthogonal and symplectic groups G to automorphic representations of GL(n). The
method that the PI and his collaborators will use is the following. First, they
will construct L-functions for G x GL(m). After that, they will apply the
converse theorem for GL(n). The L-functions should have the proper functional
equation and good analytic properties. This proposal is in the part of
mathematics known as the Langlands program. The Langlands program is part of
Number Theory. Number Theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers
and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in number
theory have furnished a driving force in creating new mathematics in other
diverse parts of the discipline. The Langland's program is a general philosophy
that connects number theory with calculus; it embodies the modern approach to
the study of whole numbers. Modern Number Theory is very technical and deep, but
it has had astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer science
and coding theory.
