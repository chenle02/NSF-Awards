This project obtains equipment for use in two biology courses, Procaryotic
Microbiology and Introductory Genetics, that enables the university to improve
the instructional laboratory experience of undergraduates taking these courses
in preparation for transfer to larger 4-year institutions. Specifically, this
project provides equipment for hands-on instruction in modern genetic techniques
such as DNA isolation and gel electrophoresis. The new equipment includes a
microcentrifuge, pipettors, gel electrophoresis equipment, a gel camera system,
and a Macintosh computer. The molecular genetic experiments enable students to
comprehend the genetic technology that is affecting the society in which they
live.
