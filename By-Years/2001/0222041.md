Although wonders have been done in developing medical technology, delivery
systems for health care - the instrumentalities and regimes for safe and
effective application of the technology to patient care -- have received much
less attention, especially from engineering researchers. This project will fund
a National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and Institute of Medicine (IOM) study to
begin remedying this shortfall by identifying opportunities for engineers to
make critical contributions to health care delivery. Jointly funded by NSF, the
National Institutes of Health, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation over a
period of 14 months, NAE and IOM will convene a committee of distinguished
members to lead an investigation accomplished mostly by NAE staff. Two major
workshops will be part of the effort, one to highlight successes already
underway and another to set an agenda for future research. Recommendations of
the committee would be collected in a summary report that may show the way to
exciting opportunities for engineers to contribute to a critical national
problem.
