High performance graphics and visualization tools are becoming a significant
factor in both experimental and computational chemistry. Further, the computing
power associated with these systems provides a cost-effective computing resource
for groups of investigators. This award from the Chemical Instrumentation
Program will help the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University to
acquire a graphical supercomputer. The areas of chemical research that will be
enhanced by the acquisition include the following: 1) Reaction dynamics and
structures of complex chemical systems 2) Ab-initio quantum chemistry 3) Non-
equilibrium statistical mechanics, inelastic and reactive molecular scattering
theory 4) Molecular modeling 5) Non-equilibrium processes at surfaces.
