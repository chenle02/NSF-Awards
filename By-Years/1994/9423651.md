9423651 Lomax Plant responses to developmental and environmental signals are
controlled by a complex set of interactions between plant hormones and other
growth regulators. The occurrence and relative ratio of the plant hormones auxin
and cytokinin coordinate plant growth and differentiation, as well as
environmental responses. There is a long history of research in this area,
however, questions remain as to how the ratio of the two hormones is detected by
the plant, as well as the molecular mechanisms of action of the hormones, either
singly or in combination. Mutants can provide a powerful toml for dissecting
physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses. The diageotropica (dgt)
mutant of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) is a single gene, recessive
mutant previously characterized as auxin- insensitive, as it neither grows nor
produces ethylene in response to applied auxin. Although isolated on the basis
of its reduced gravitropic response, the dgt lesion results in a complex
pleiotropic phenotype involving many aspects of plant form and function. Many of
these characteristics are better associated with plants overexpressing cytokinin
and it has been shown that much of the dgt phenotype can be mimicked in wild
type tomato plants with exogenously- supplied cytokinin. The studies proposed
here are designed to test that hypothesis and to establish whether the apparent
increase in cytokinin sensitivity in dgt plants is the result of auxin
insensitivity, altered cytokinin homeostasis, or alteration of some signal
transduction component which controls or integrates the response to both
hormones. Results from these studies will shed light on the regulation of auxin
sensitivity as well as on cytokinin responsiveness in plants. The information
gained will aid in our understanding of hormonal regulation of plant function,
as well as in the elucidation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of action
for cytokinin and auxin.
