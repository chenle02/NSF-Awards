This project will study singularity formation for systems of parabolic
equations. The first part of the project will deal with singularity formation in
boundary layer problems of fluid dynamics. The second part of the project will
study the role that the underlying geometry and parameters play in determining
whether or not blow up occurs is weakly coupled systems of equations. These
studies come from and have applications in mechanics of solids and fluids. A
wide variety of engineering design problems might benefit from the results of
this project.
