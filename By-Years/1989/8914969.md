Massive star formation and spiral structure in galaxies are studied by analyzing
multi-wavelength observations of the grand design spiral galaxy M81 and by
comparing these with observations of other nearby galaxies. For this
investigation, digitized optical and high resolution radio images of M81 are
supplemented by an ultraviolet (UV) 2000 Angstrom image of M81 and by Carbon
Monoxide (CO) observations with relatively high resolution. Previous work has
been extended as follows: a) Observational tests are made of new theoretical
models designed specifically to model the spiral structure of M81. b) A search
is made for CO emission from locations with high extinction in M81 to test
whether the ratio of CO surface brightness to molecular hydrogen column density
is the same in the weak CO galaxy M81 as in the Milky Way. c) A high resolution
observational comparison is made between massive star formation in nearby weak
CO and strong CO galaxies. d) The extended radio emission from the Seyfert
Nucleus of M81 is analyzed.
