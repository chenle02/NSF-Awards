This research is to utilize earthquake SV waves that have been largely ignored
by seismologists in studies of gross earth structure and source parameter
estimation even though these waveforms potentially contain as much information
on source and structure as P or SH waves. Complications in wave propagation
cause the teleseismic SV phase to be sensitive to source structure, receiver
structure, and source parameters making inversion for any isolated set of
parameters difficult. Based on success from a pilot study utilizing SV waves,
two avenues of research involving near-source structure and near-receiver
structure will be followed. A specific area of study for the former will be the
Tibetan Plateau. This work has application to the study of structure in
seismically active areas and is therefore a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program.
