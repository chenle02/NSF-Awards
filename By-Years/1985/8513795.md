This work focuses on the mechanics of roto-molding. Rotomolding is an industrial
forming process which has been applied mostly to thermoplastic materials but
holds considerable promise for thermosetting plastics. In the latter case, very
little experience exists. The purpose of the present focus of research is to
model this process. The goal is a rational basis for establishing optimum
parameters for the rapid and efficient molding of a variety of complex shapes.
