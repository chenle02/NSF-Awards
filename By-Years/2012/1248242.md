A plasmaspheric plume is a region of dense cold ionospheric plasma extending
outward into the magnetosphere from the nominal location of the plasmapause. It
has a limited width in azimuth. This study will use and improve the dynamic-
fluid-kinetic-plasmasphere-ionosphere (DyFKPI) model. This model combines self-
consistently a fluid based model of the ionosphere with a particle based model
of the plasmasphere. It will be used to determine the density distributions of
electrons and ions (H+, He+, and O+) along plume magnetic field lines and
provide formulas that can be used to determine the density along the flux tube.
The second part of this study will quantify the plasmaspheric plasma mass
delivered to the dayside magnetospause as a function of magnetospheric activity.
This research will investigate how plasmaspheric plumes deliver plasma to the
polar cap and contribute to magnetospheric plasma circulation. IMAGE RPI data
will be used in this study and compared with simulation derived density
distributions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the research is rather narrowly
focused on the structure and impact of the plasma plumes the resulting formulas
will be valuable in other studies of magnetospheric physics. The grant will
support a graduate student.
