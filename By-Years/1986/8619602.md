Advanced secondary battery systems using a solvated electron electrode will be
optimized. The lithium electrode investigated consisted of lithium initially
dissolved in liquid ammonia to give either a "solvated electron" or "bronze"
solution. Containment of this liquid negative active material from direct
contact with a nonaqueous electrolyte present in the cell positive electrode
compartment is addressed via the use of a lithium intercalated electronically
conducting ceramic membrane of the general composition LixWO2 (0.1 < x < 1;0).
Secondary electrochemical cells having the general configuration:
Li,NH3/LixWO2/LiCF3SO3,PC/TiS2 and LiNH3/LixWO2/LiCF,CuC12,SO2,CH3CN/C were
identified during Phase I which possessed respective open- circuit potentials of
2.5 and 3.4V, were electrochemically reversible and had theoretical energy
densities of 454 and 929 Wh/kg based upon 20 m/o lithium in liquid ammonia. The
high energy densities that can be predicted from batteries incorporating this
novel lithium electrode together with their anticipated long cycle life, make
them attractive candidates for such varied applications as utility load
leveling, electric vehicle propulsion and aerospace power sources.
