This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This research is
designed to study the utility of combining magic angle spinning (MAS) of dilute
spins like carbon-13 with the sensitivity of abundant spins like protons by
spatial localization methods combined with high-power cross-polarization and
proton decoupling. It is further proposed that the use of an appropriate pulse
sequence, in combination with an rf gradient, should permit rare spin NMR
spectra of localized regions of a given sample. Thus, the overall goal of this
research is to obtain chemical information from an NMR spectrum within a
selected region of a sample. Such an approach should have applications in many
areas of chemical research including 1) organic solids and polymers, 2)
reactions at interfaces, 3) isotopically labeled molecules doped into porous
materials, 4) layered materials, and 5) devices subject to defects cracks or
other imperfections. This five year continuing grant to the University of
California at Irvine for the support of Professor Shaka as a Presidential Young
Investigator is designed to promote his rapid and effective growth as an
independent researcher in the area of solid state NMR spectroscopy.
