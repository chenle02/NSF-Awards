Plant MADS-box genes encode transcriptional regulators that are required for a
variety of critical developmental processes, including organ identity,
flowering, fruit development, root development, and pattern formation. This
family of genes has diversified dramatically during the evolution of vascular
plants, and especially within the angiosperms, resulting in the large number of
these genes in modern flowering plant species. The problem at hand is to define
the roles of these MADS-box genes, as well as to understand the evolutionary
changes that resulted in their great diversity of functions. Cloning and
sequencing MADS-box genes in a variety of plant species will lay the groundwork
to address this question. These sequences will be used in a series of
phylogenetic analyses to determine the relationships among these genes.
Understanding the diversity of functions encoded by the MADS-box genes, coupled
with knowledge of how these processes have been modified through the evolution
of vascular plants, will be key in developing targeted strategies for
manipulating the growth and development of non-model plant species.
