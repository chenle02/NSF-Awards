The University of Chicago will sponsor a planning conference to focus on the
mathematics preparation for teaching elementary school. The conference is being
guided by an organizing committee which includes members from four other teacher
education institutions within Illinois. The conference participants will meet
twice, once in January and again in May 1991. In between the two sessions, the
participants will work on positions and plans coming out of the conference. The
conference participants will include mathematicians, mathematics educators,
teachers, scientist, and others from research institutions as well as
traditional teacher education institutions with large teacher education
enrollments. The conference proceedings will be widely disseminated through
additional funding from the EXXON Foundation. The proceedings will consist of
carefully delineated issues and possible approaches to address those issues. The
intent is to generate a set of possible alternative responses, supported by
sound rational, and to stimulate the field to work seriously and collectively to
improve the preparation of teachers in mathematics. The cost sharing is over 50%
of the NSF funding.
