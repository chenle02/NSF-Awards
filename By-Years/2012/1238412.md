Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is
to experimentally determine the feasibility of wavelet theory to detect arc
flash in photovoltaic energy systems as a warning of incipient arc fault. The
approach is to identify, develop, and verify wavelet transform algorithms,
implement the technique in digital signal processing hardware, build an arc
flash test chamber, and test using the photovoltaic array infrastructure at
Texas A&amp;M University. From small-scale residential systems to large-scale
utility systems, arcing poses serious threats to human safety and hinders
widespread adoption of photovoltaic energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit&lt;br/&gt;This project will conduct experimental verification through
proof-of-concept design and testing of the efficacy of the wavelet transform,
potentially transforming how arc fault detection is conducted. The proposed
research is transformative because present state-of-the-art methods can only
detect series arc faults by sensing the current in a direct current system and
relying upon frequency or time-domain pattern recognition algorithms rather than
fundamental signal decomposition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts&lt;br/&gt;The proposed method senses the bus voltage and uses simpler,
less expensive sensors than those needed to current, thus lowering the cost of
safe, reliable photovoltaic energy. Use of these concepts has broad applications
to any direct-current system, including microgrid, building systems, server
systems and telecom systems. The PI has a history of technology transfer, is
active in relevant standards development (UL 1699B), and has a demonstrated
commitment to educating a diverse cleantech/greentech workforce. This project
will offer students hands-on instrumentation training as well as opportunities
for research analysis and publications.
