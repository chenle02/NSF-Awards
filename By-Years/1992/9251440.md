This laboratory sequence integrates studies of the behavioral,
electrophysiological, histological, and neurochemical effects of medial septal
lesions in rats. The course engages students in experimental design, hypothesis
testing, and analysis and interpretation of data. Grant related equipment
includes the instrumentation, hardware and software necessary to conduct and
analyze passive avoidance behavioral experiments (Reflex-16 instrumentation) and
neurochemical analyses (HPLC). The project will significantly enhance research
opportunities for a number of young women and provide them with motivation to
pursue careers in the sciences.
