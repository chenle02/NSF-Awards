Abstract

Award: DMS-9971960 Principal Investigator: Hubert L. Bray

The goal of this project is to better understand the Penrose Conjecture in
General Relativity, which is closely related to the Positive Mass Theorem. Both
statements can be thought of as attempts to describe the relationship between
the local energy density of a space-time N (whose metric has signature 3,1) and
the total mass of N. In physical terms, the Positive Mass Theorem states that an
isolated gravitational system with nonnegative local energy density must have
nonnegative total energy. The idea is that nonnegative energy densities must
"add up" to something nonnegative. The Penrose Conjecture, on the other hand,
states that if an isolated gravitational system with nonnegative local energy
density contains black holes contributing a mass m, then the total energy of the
system must be at least m. These compelling physical statements translate into
highly nontrivial geometric statements about asymptotically flat manifolds with
nonnegative scalar curvature. The Positive Mass Theorem was not proven until
1979 by Schoen and Yau, and the most general version of the Penrose Conjecture
is still open. The investigator recently proved the Riemannian Penrose
Conjecture, which is the Penrose Conjecture for a 3-dimensional space-like
hypersurface M of N with zero second fundamental form. The proof uses a new
approach to the problem (which came out of research supported by the NSF), and
the theorem is the strongest version of the Penrose Conjecture proved to date.
This research aims to extend these results to prove the most general version of
the Penrose Conjecture, where the hypersurface M is not required to have zero
second fundamental form. It is also hoped that these new techniques can be used
to understand higher dimensional cases and the behavior of quasi-local mass in
General Relativity.

Einstein's Theory of General Relativity is one of two primary theories (along
with Quantum Mechanics) thought to best describe the laws of physics. In the
long run, it is hoped that a better understanding of the laws of physics will
lead to advances which could lead to a better standard of living for people.
Already, fundamental advances in understanding the laws of physics have made
modern technology possible. The research in this project goes to the heart of
the behavior of matter in General Relativity and attempts to answer fundamental
questions about the additivity of energy and momentum in space-time. Even so,
achieving these goals would only represent a small step forward in understanding
the implications and intricacies of General Relativity
