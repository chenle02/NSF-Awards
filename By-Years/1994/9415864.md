This award will support travel of 12 U.S. participants to a U.S.-France
workshop on Supersymmetry and Unification of Fundamental Interactions, Paliseau,
France, May 20-25, 1995. The workshop will cover research areas of
supersymmetry, string theory and unification of fundamental interactions, and
the participants will explore prospects for observing supersymmetry at colliders
and in non-accelerator and dark matter experiments. The organizers are Pran Nath
of Northeastern University and Costa Bachas of the Center for Theoretical
Physics at the Ecole Polytechnique, Paliseau, France. The workshop will consist
of theoretical and experimental presentations by established researchers and
advanced graduate students and will include two sessions to promote
collaboration among the participants. A U.S.-France working group will be formed
to coordinate experiments and ongoing collaborations.
