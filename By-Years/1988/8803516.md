In this project the researcher, a cultural anthropologist from Arizona State
University, will complete research analyzing land distribution, income patterns,
living standards, social status and political participation in an upland
Philippine farming community. Data from this current study will be compared with
information gathered in 1970-72. Wider processes of developmental change in the
region will be related to local changes over this period of time. The project
will clarify the developmental trajectories that Southeast Asian peasant
communities travel under capitalist market conditions, with a particular focus
upon conditions under which increasing social, economic and political
differentiation is the outcome of development. This research will help us
understand how such social differences sometimes create polarization between
capitalist farmers and farm workers, and sometimes creates durable economically
viable multi-strategy farm households. It is a small part in our general
understanding of the causes of conflict in the developing world.
