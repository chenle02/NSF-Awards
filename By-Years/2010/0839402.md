This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
palm-sized and low-cost instrument for measuring the characteristics and
distribution of airborne black carbon aerosol particles. Based on an existing
analyzer, the optical property analyzer will use photoacoustic detection of
aerosol light absorption in a miniature package. Current instruments are too
large to be deployed easily in the upper atmosphere. The outcome of this
proposed project is the development of a low cost but robust and accurate sensor
that can be deployed on multiple platforms, manned and unmanned aircraft,
balloons, ocean buoys, towers and in urban monitoring stations.

If successful the broader impact of this activity will stem from rapid diffusion
of knowledge that will occur once this new technology is made available to the
international community. This new instrument circumvents the limitations of the
technology that is currently being used in both research and monitoring
applications.
