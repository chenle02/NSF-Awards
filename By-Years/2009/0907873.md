This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to
address and improve the poor constraints on gradients in chemical abundances
across the galactic disk by carrying out a consistent, state-of-the-art analysis
of a statistically-robust sample of several hundred OB stars. The work will use
high-resolution spectra of about 700 OB stars that have been collected over the
last few years. The stellar sample spans a range in galactocentric distance from
~5 to 20 kpc, with an emphasis on measuring gradients in the outer disk, which
provide the strongest constraints on chemical evolution models and the best
opportunity to chart the evolution of the galaxy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Broader Impacts of this program include mentoring of undergraduate students in
the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at the National Optical
Astronomy Observatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
