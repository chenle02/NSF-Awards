Within the last year, we have altered the undergraduate curriculum in plant
pathology to reflect current technological advances in our science. Three
courses, Plant Virology, Mycology, and Bacterial Plant Pathogens, now make up
the bulk of the undergraduate plant pathology curriculum. All three laboratory
courses are targeted for upgrading by this laboratory improvement plan. We are
improving laboratories specifically in the areas of video-assisted microscopy
and molecular biotechnology. Studies of both molecular evolution and changes in
form and function with living materials are now possible. We wish to create a
curriculum that can be used as a model for teaching plant pathology at other
institutions.
