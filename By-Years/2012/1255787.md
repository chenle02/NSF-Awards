This award will provide funding to replace two old mass spectrometers with a
state-of-the-art Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer (TIMS) to complement the
existing Triton in the Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory at the University of
Maryland. The new instrument will be installed in the space currently occupied
by the two old mass spectrometers that it will replace. Specific analytical
tasks to be tackled with the new TIMS instrument include: 1) high precision
182W, 142Nd-143Nd, and 186Os-187Os isotopic analysis of ancient through young
mantle-derived materials, as a means of studying the evolution of early Earth
reservoirs and rates of mantle mixing through time, 2) high precision
measurement of Ru and Mo isotopes in early Earth rocks to search for diverse,
late accreted components to Earth, 3) measurement of Os isotopic composition and
abundance as a means of studying the timing, formation mechanisms and secondary
processes involved in the generation of subcontinental lithospheric mantle, 4)
measurement of Os isotopic composition and abundance in subduction zone
materials as a tool for tracing mantle wedge contributions to m√©lange zones, 5)
measurement of Nd and Sr isotopes in Antarctic granites as petrogenetic tools,
and 6) analysis of Sr isotopes in carbonates to gauge relative rates of
hydrothermal and terrestrial inputs to seawater through time.
