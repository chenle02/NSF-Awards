The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Research (SBIR)
Phase I project is to explore applications of open source development in
computer hardware. This model will enable new ideas and semiconductor-based
technologies to be envisioned, developed, and deployed. This project will enable
collaborative networking to build the developer ecosystem around sophisticated
chip implementations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I will advance the development of state-of-art hardware
tools for novel integrated circuit chip implementations. The system will scale
from a 28 nm process to sub-7 nm semiconductor chip manufacturing nodes. Project
objectives include: 1) implementation of open source models in hardware design;
2) initial design of circuit design blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
