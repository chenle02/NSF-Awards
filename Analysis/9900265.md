Abstract Kim/Roush

For a long time the Williams conjecture that shift equivalence is the same as
strong shift equivalence was the dominant approach to classifying subshifts of
finite type. With our negative resolution of this conjecture, the way is open to
either determine that the invariants involved in that proof are a complete set,
or to find new invariants and algorithms to effectively classify subshifts of
finite type up to topological conjugacy. We will consider group-theoretic,
cohomological, and other methods. We will also try to answer some questions
raised by Nasu on his textile systems (already partly solved by Boyle and
Maass).

Nontechnical description: Symbolic dynamics is a mathematical theory that can
handle strings of symbols that can arise in many connections. It has been used
to formulate codes for efficient computer data storage and transmission. It is
an important and fundamental part of dynamical systems theory, which studies how
systems (which might be something like the solar system, the earth's atmosphere,
or the human body) change under time. Symbolic dynamics has been applied to
topological quantum field theory, which establishes a link to modern physics,
and also to other important areas of mathematics such as the theory of knots.
The present proposal is primarily a project to classify subshifts of finite
type, which are the most extensively studied kind of symbolic dynamical system.
