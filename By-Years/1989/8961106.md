This is a SBIR Phase I project to develop a non-destructive instrument for
measuring the thermal conductivity and interface thermal resistance of thin
films utilized in electronic components. Previous methods of making these
measurements were difficult, time consuming, and not amenable to in-situ
measurements of components. This method is applicable when the films are
deposited on high thermal conductivity substrates, and a set of three to four
coatings, each with a different and known thicknesses, are applied. The
temperature-time history of a sample is taken when suddenly placed in contact
with point heat source, and this history is compared with the results obtained
from a substrate of known thickness and thermal conductivity, and utilizing the
results of an analytical developed at the University of Rochester. The
development and commercial availability of a nondestructive for thermal
conductivity and interface thermal resistance in dielectric and other thin films
will permit rapid advances to be made in the design and construction of
multilayer structures with improved heat flow characteristics. It also will be a
useful diagnostic tool in semiconductor defect detection and quality control.
