This is a small amount of support for travel and accommodation for 7 early
career researchers to attend the 2011 Northern Research Forum (NRF) Open
Assembly, Our Ice Dependent World, to be held Sept. 4-6 in Hveragerdi, Iceland.
The NRF Open Assembly is organized to provide opportunities for natural and
social scientists to talk with policy makers and stakeholders in order to work
together to identify knowledge gaps in research and policy for the future. This
Assembly highlights two central questions: 1) what are and what will be the
economic, industrial, cultural and political consequences of global ice melt
today and in the future; 2) What economic, industrial, cultural, and political
possibilities and challenges face humankind in current and future declines of
ice? In addition, the Assembly in Iceland will include in-depth science
discussions around ice from two regions, one high latitude the Antarctic and the
other high altitude, the Himalayans, and follows up on themes from three major
recent projects- the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, the Arctic Human
Development Report, and UNEPs Global Outlook for Ice and Snow.

Early career for the purpose of this project are recent PhD or PhD candidates.
The candidates will be chosen from a pool of 60 applications, already received,
representing 20 different nationalities, and will be evaluated on the basis of
1) professional experience (publications, NRF involvement, and conference
papers); 2) their statement of interest that includes the relevance of their
research to the conference topic; 3) their perspective on the social relevance
of science, how to interpret and apply it. In addition there is a strong
dissemination plan through web-casts, position papers, and scientific papers,
along with scheduled presentations to the Arctic Council and the Nordic Council
of Ministers.
