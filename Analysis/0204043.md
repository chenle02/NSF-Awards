ABSTRACT

PI: Siu, Yum-Tong Proposal: DMS-0204043 Institution: American Institute of
Mathematics

A conference at Princeton University will be held in September 2002 to study
geometric applications of D-bar estimates which have appeared in the past
decade. The conference will bring together researchers in D-bar estimates and
mathematicians in related fields to survey the techniques and problems of D-bar
estimates and their geometric applications.

One special feature of the conference is an emphasis on the participation of
young and women mathematicians. Moreover, for the benefit of young researchers
(and mathematicians in other fields) interested in learning to get into the
topics of the conference, a formal session of open problems is planned for the
conference and, after the conference, a website will be put together and
maintained under the umbrella website of the American Institute of Mathematics
(http://www.aimath.org).
