Systemic Teacher Excellence Preparation, STEP, project The STEP project is
designed to bring about large scale improvement in the preparation of science
and mathematics teachers in Montana and to serve as a national model for rural
areas with significant minority populations. STEP is developing new alliances
that form a statewide, interactive network consisting of school systems, Tribal
Community Colleges (TCC's), state Universities and Colleges, the State Office of
Public Instruction, the Montana Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the Montana
Science Teachers Association, the Montana University System and a number of
related on-going NSF supported projects in the state: the Systemic Initiative
for Montana Mathematics and Science (SIMMS), Six Through Eight Mathematics
(STEM), and the Alliance of States Supporting Indians in Science and Technology
(ASSIST). The project is providing the following: at least 2 years of early
career support for mathematics and science teachers in a rural setting; model
teacher preparation field sites in K-12 schools; increased numbers and better
preparation of mathematics and science teachers from Native American
Communities; a telecommunications network based model for fostering teacher
preparation in rural states; strong faculty teams to redesign curricula and
courses; strong institutional support for participating faculty and teachers;
dissemination of new ideas in preparing teachers; an increase in the number of
women and minority teachers in mathematics and science; and use of field sites
as "living laboratories" for research on effective mathematics and science
teaching, pre-service teacher supervision and the training of university science
and mathematics educators in rural settings.
