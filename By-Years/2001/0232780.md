This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
feasibility of an innovative, environmentally benign, enzymatic catalyst process
and an advanced reactor design for the production of silicon esters from various
feedstocks. All current processes for making silicon esters are either using
expensive rare earth metal as catalysts or using halogen elements containing
compounds as starting materials and high temperature. Some of them involve using
or generating HCl gas and the formation of complex mixtures, which cannot be
readily separated. The Phase I objective is to demonstrate feasibility of using
immobilized enzyme as a catalyst for silicon ester synthesis coupled with the
sonic-enhanced packed bed reactor technology. The investigation will focus on
esterification reactions between alkyl silanols and saturated or unsaturated
carboxylic acids to produce silicon esters with designed degree of saturation.
This enzymatic process will produce both saturated and unsaturated silicon
esters that can be used for a broad range of applications, that include
repellent coatings, contact lenses, electrical assemblies, perfumes, dyes, brake
fluid, chromatography equipment, rubber products, products to reattach detached
retinas and more. The unsaturated esters can also be used as monomers for
silicon containing polymer production.
