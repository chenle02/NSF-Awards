The Bucknell Scholars (BUScholars) program provides financial support for
approximately 95 science and mathematics majors to participate in two summers of
research, starting the summer before they matriculate at Bucknell University in
Pennsylvania. BUScholars participate in a summer transition research program, a
new STEM-themed living/learning community, special first-year coursework (STEM
foundation seminars), and a new interdisciplinary STEM discussion group, all of
which help create an environment that encourages student enthusiasm and success
in STEM disciplines. A specific goal of the BUScholars program is to increase
the number of students from underrepresented groups achieving STEM degrees.
Retention of students in STEM majors is improved through proactive mentoring and
supplemental academic support. Establishing a strong peer support system through
the new living/learning community, participation in high quality research
opportunities, and dedicated academic and post-program advising greatly
increases the likelihood of success for students while at Bucknell and later as
they enter STEM careers.

The program intends to increase the number of natural science and mathematics
majors at Bucknell by 30% over 5 years. An assessment of the BUScholars program,
particularly the perceptions and reactions of the participants, is being
combined with results from the two similar STEP projects that incorporate early
introduction of summer undergraduate research at Hamilton College in New York
and Armstrong Atlantic State University in Georgia. All participating STEP
students are being tracked on a long-term basis, with an emphasis on final
academic and career choices, and the results are being shared with the
scientific community.
