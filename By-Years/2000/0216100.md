This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will replace
current environmentally damaging metal pretreatment processes with an
environmentally benign process whereby the metal surface is etched then coated
with a sub-micron film of plasma polymerized SiO2. Current metal pretreatment
processes for painting and adhesive bonding perform well, but generate
tremendous volumes of wastes, including hexavalent chromium and various
inorganic acids. To obtain performance superior to the current state-of-the-art
wet chemical surface treatments, the surface chemistry and morphology of the
plasma polymerized films need to be tailored for specific interactions with the
adhesive. Effects of variables including substrate chemistry, monomer chemistry,
and ion kinetic energy on surface chemistry and morphology of plasma polymers
will be determined. Then, the effect of the resulting structure on the strength
and durability of adhesive joints will be determined.

By combining in-situ analytical techniques with accelerated aging and mechanical
testing of adhesive specimens, a superior, environmentally benign process based
on plasma polymerization will be developed and commercialized. These primers
will have well understood morphologies and surface compositions tailored to the
adhesive chemistry through control of the deposition conditions and/or chemical
derivitization of the plasma polymer surface.
