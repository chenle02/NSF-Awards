An experimental and theoretical research program will be conducted to
investigate fluid storage and ink delivery processes in thermal ink jet
technology. Specifically, the PI's will study the micro boiling process in a
closed chamber as well as fluid flow in a foam matrix. Several non-invasive
visualization and diagnostic techniques will be employed. The results could lead
to the development of more compact and reliable ink-jet cartridges with lower
costs in addition to opening new applications for thermal ink jet technology.
The research will build on an existing collaboration between Hewlett Packard of
Puerto Rico (HPPR) and the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez (UPRM), with HPPR
being an active participant in the research effort.
