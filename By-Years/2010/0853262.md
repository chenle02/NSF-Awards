This proposal request funds to support the annual International Conference on
Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics: Dynamics Days 2009, to be held at the DoubleTree
Hotel, San Diego, California on January 8-11, 2009, and hosted by the University
of California,San Diego. The principal co-organizers are Professors Michael Todd
(mdt@ucsd.edu) and Herbert Levine (hlevine@ucsd.edu), of UCSD?s Engineering and
Physical Science Divisions, respectively. Dynamics Days is an annual conference
organized with the specific purpose of providing an interface for researchers
from diverse scientific disciplines but with common interests in nonlinear
dynamics, chaos, and complex systems. This meeting has become internationally
known as a very effective mechanism for researchers to share their most recent
results in understanding, modeling, and controlling nonlinear dynamical systems.
