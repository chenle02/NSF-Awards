This RAPID proposal will follow the ecosystem changes that occur as a long-
disconnected floodplain of the Mississippi River at the Birds Point Levee
becomes inundated with floodwaters from the historic high flows of spring 2011.
The researchers will investigate ecosystem metabolism (primary production and
respiration) and secondary productivity of the floodplain system during the
inundation period (expected to last until end of summer 2011). The researchers
will compare their findings with data on ecosystem metabolism of the river from
past studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An event of the magnitude that is now
occurring on the Mississippi River has not been seen since the 1930's (when its
ecosystem effects were not studied). Extreme events like these call to question
past decisions to constrain the river and prevent floodplain inundation.
Research will provide a basis for evaluating alternative management strategies
to accommodate extreme flooding events which may occur more frequently under
future climates.
