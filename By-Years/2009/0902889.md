The PI's are funded to study high-sedimentation rate cores from coastal back-
barrier ponds and sink holes at three different sites on Cape Cod,
Massachusetts, Apalachee Bay, Florida, and Grenada in the Caribbean to
reconstruct a late Holocene hurricane frequency record. They will also use
storm-surge models to examine the significance spatial and temporal patterns in
hurricane-induced deposition and test potential climate forcing. Earlier data
from Puerto Rico suggests specific trends in hurricane frequency, e.g., an
increase in hurricane landfall during the past 300 years. Improving
understanding of long-term trends in hurricane landfall statistics is important
for understanding the socioeconomic impacts of hurricanes and future
projections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the study are strong:
reconstructing the history of hurricane frequency/intensity in the study area
with important implications for climate modeling and coastal zone management.
Graduate student support is also included.&lt;br/&gt;
