This award will be used to continue a long-term study of western lowland
gorillas in the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African Republic. Western
lowland gorillas are particularly interesting because unlike the more studied
herb-eating mountain gorillas, they consume substantial quantities of fruit, and
this allows a comparative study of how differences in feeding ecology influence
social organization. The long-term aim of the project is to make a comparative
study of gorillas and chimpanzees at this study site. This research is
significant because it supports an on-going research center (Mondika) for the
study and conservation of western lowland gorillas and chimpanzees. This is
important because there are no current studies where western lowland gorillas
are habituated to human presence, and we therefore know little about them.
Understanding the factors that influence social organization in African apes,
humans closest relatives, should provide insight into factors which shaped
social behavior in the earliest human ancestors.
