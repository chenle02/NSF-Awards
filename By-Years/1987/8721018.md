The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
applied laser spectroscopy between Pajo V. Cvijin of Belgrade's Institute of
Physics and George H. Atkinson from the University of Arizona is to study the
fundamental aspects of laser photoaccoustic spectroscopy and its application to
research in environmental and atmospheric sciences. Both investigators have
devoted a significant part of their research effort to the development of
ultrasensitive detection methods for atmospheric pollutants. The proposed
cooperation will broaden the research of both groups by combining the Belgrade
expertise in photoaccoustic spectroscopy applied to the the infrared spectral
region with the Arizona group's work in the visible and ultra violet spectral
regions. This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on
Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a joint fund
consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The
U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds
are involved. The grants are composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to
the principal Yugoslav institute. Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to
Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists' living
expenses in the U.S.
