Proposal Number: ECS-9617296 Principal Investigator: Swadesh Mahajan Title:
Collective phenomena in semiconductor plasmas, wakefield generation and
measurement- theory and experiment. In this research, fundamental investigations
into condensed matter plasmas within semiconductors will be investigated. The
condensed matter counterparts of plasma waves, and wake fields, in doped III-V
systems, will be generated using newly available ultrashort pulse laser
techniques. Condensed matter plasmas are an underexplored phenomena. The
knowledge generated here may have great relevance to fundamental understanding
of the behavior of bandgap-engineered structures, emission processes, and the
behavior of materials in extreme environments. It will also provide cross-
fertilization as a condensed matter counterpart for emerging research in new
extreme regimes of laser-plasma interactions in gaseous plasmas, which could
provide synergistic insights.
