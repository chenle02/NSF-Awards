This is a U.S.-Poland research project between Drs. Stanislaw J. Szarek and
Elisabeth Werner of Case Western Reserve University and Drs. Aleksander
Pelczynski, Tadeusz Figiel, Piotr Mankiewicz of IMPAN, Polish Academy of
Sciences, and Wojciech Banaszczyk of Lodz University. The researchers plan to
explore some geometric aspects of functional analysis: convexity, the operator
theory, and the interplay between the two. In both areas they intend to focus on
the so-called "local" or "finite dimensional" theory. This project in
mathematics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence.
