9711454 Walker This proposal is to continue characterization of the Os isotopic
composition of various mantle domains through time, via the analysis of
ultramafic rocks that are otherwise geochemically and isotopically well-
characterized, and that have relatively high Os concentrations and low Re/Os
ratios. Specific issues that Re-Os isotopes may be particularly useful in
elucidating are: (1) nature of material added to the Earth via late accretion,
(2) the rate at which late accreted materials were homogenized throughout the
mantle, (3) the nature and rate at which oceanic crust has been recycled back
into certain plum sources, (4) the existence of, and level of chemical exchange
between the mantle and outer core, )5) the chronology of development of
subcontinental lithospheric keels, and (6) the distribution of highly
siderophile elements in various modern and ancient reservoirs. The PI will
analyze ultramafic magmatic systems that represent upper oceanic lithospheric
materials (Archean through recent ophiolites) and materials derived from likely
mantle plumes (Archean and Proterozoic komatiites and ferropicrites). Both whole
rock and mineral separates will be analyzed from each location.
