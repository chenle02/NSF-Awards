Professor T.S. Lin is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program for the application of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance
spectroscopy. This technique will be used to study the mechanisms of spin
polarization transfer from electron spins to nuclear spins (Dynamic Nuclear
Polarization processes) which invoke the photo-excited triplet states of organic
solids. Three aspects will be investigated: resonance polarization transfer via
the integrated solid effect, coherent polarization transfer via the spin locking
experiment, and electron-nuclear cross polarization dynamics at the level
anticrossing region. The results of these studies are expected to provide the
information which will allow formulation of a theory of the resonance
polarization transfer and the cross polarization processes in general. %%% The
enhancement of the proton nuclear magnetic resonance signal in some organic
solids can be as high as a factor of 15,000 compared to the normal signal. Such
a large improvement in the intensities of the proton signals could allow the
studies of structures of guest molecules at low concentrations in these
crystals.
