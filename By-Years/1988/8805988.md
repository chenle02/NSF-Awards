A crossdisciplinary effort between the PI and John Doyle's group in electrical
engineering has resulted in the development of some outstanding control
algorithms and real usable software. Funds provided in this grant are to upgrade
the PI's computer facilities to foster further developments in this area by
providing him and his students a SUN microcomputer system including a file
server and two workstations. The specific projects to benefit from the new
equipment will include a) Analysis and synthesis of robust multivariable control
systems for nonlinear closed loop systems often operated at the intersection of
a set of complex constraints. Systems studied include complex distillation
configurations and packed bed reactors. b) On-line optimization via computers
with distribute processors. The PI will be able to contribute to the development
of the "cosmic cube" (which involves 64 processors connected in the form of a
Boolean cube) and is using it to study the optimal compressor operation of gas
transmission pipelines. c) Development of a user-friendly expert system for
robust control system design. The PI and his co-workers have already developed
some software but it requires expertise on the part of the user. Further
research will enable practicing engineers to use this software.
