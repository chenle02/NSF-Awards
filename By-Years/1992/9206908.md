This research explores and evaluates the use of parallel processing and
parallelism in network host protocol processing, through a combination of
theoretical analysis and experimental implementation, measurement, and
evaluation of a vertically integrated set of host protocol functions. The
implementations use Sequent and Silicon Graphics shared memory multiprocessors,
connected via FDDI, and a modified MACH operating system kernel. The work
considers the protocol functionality of a complete protocol stack, with emphasis
on network access, transport, and presentation layer functions.
