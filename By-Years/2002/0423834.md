Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) were among the first animals to fly, and
their wings are unique. Their distribution is world-wide, yet many taxa are
environmentally confined, making them valuable indicators of areas of priority
for conservation. We will analyze evolutionary relationships among as many
subfamilies of Odonata as possible, as a foundation for biological work on the
group. We will collect DNA sequence data from 28S rRNA, EF-1alpha, and
mitochondrial genes as well as morphology. Data will be analyzed using parsimony
and maximum likelihood methods. The project will integrate a variety of
differing backgrounds among its participants. Kjer's expertise is in molecular
phylogenetics, and seeks to utilize the expertise of morphological systematists
and introduce them to molecular methods. Frank Carle is an organismal
odonatologist, stressing the value of concordance between independent
morphological characters. May has experience studying the ecology and behavior
of Odonata. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will train an African-American
doctoral student, Jessica Ware, and a postdoctoral associate. In addition to her
scientific training, Ms. Ware is actively working in the Newark and Camden
School systems to help recruit students from groups historically
underrepresented in science to attend Rutgers. Like dinosaurs and birds,
dragonflies and their evolutionary history appeal to the public. This phylogeny
will provide a framework for discussing these organisms with the public and give
us an example of what the first animal on earth to fly might have looked like.
As integral components of freshwater ecosystems, Odonata are important as
indicators of water quality.&lt;br/&gt;
