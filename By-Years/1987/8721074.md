Near source structural and bathymetric effects present a significant problem
for resolution of earthquake source parameters using teleseismic body waveforms.
Using synthetic waveforms computed for planar dipping structures, we propose to
evaluate the sensitivity of various inverse techniques to different structural
situations. We will use more advanced ray techniques to compute seismograms for
realistic bathymetry and address the applicability of the planar dipping
interface approximation in various situations. Application of these techniques
will allow better resolution of the source characteristics of shallow
earthquakes in regions of complex structure and bathymetry such as subduction
zones.
