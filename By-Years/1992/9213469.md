Snyder The chaotic router for multiprocessor systems avoids congestion in
message routing by derouting packets chosen at random at congested nodes of a
network. The routers can thus adapt to varying message traffic. In this project,
the router is being implemented and its performance is being measured within a
testbed that approximates a real multiprocessor.
