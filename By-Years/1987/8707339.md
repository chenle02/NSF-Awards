This research activity is supported under the Research Opportunities for Women--
Planning Grant Program. This award will allow the investigator to begin
addressing two important issues in macroeconomics: (1) the failure of rational
expectations asset pricing models to predict relationships observed in U.S.
data, (2) the debate about the impact of deficits on interest rates. This
research activity will permit the investigator to write a competitive proposal
which would allow her to pursue these and related issues more deeply. The
investigator has a solid background for this type of research and the issues to
be addressed are both timely and important. There is good reason to believe that
this award will result in successful follow-up proposal.
