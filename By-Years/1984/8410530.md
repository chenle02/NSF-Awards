Unexpected dynamic behavior in machines often results in increased vibration and
noise, reduced machine reliability and life, and loss of precision. All of this
has a significant impact on overallproductivity. A clearer understanding of the
dynamics of machine components can be attained through better modeling than is
currently available. Key areas for modeling research are flexibility of system
elements, clearances in connections, and inherent nonlinearity of these effects.
Theoretical studies arecomplemented by experimental investigation. Results are
incorporated into computeraided design systems for use in the industrial
environment by the design engineer.
