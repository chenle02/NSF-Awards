A new design for real-time low light fluorescence video microscopy for
capturing kinetic images of up to 4 dyes contained in the same living cell will
be constructed and tested. It will be used to determine intracellular calcium
and pH and show how the measurements may be used to correct the intracellular
calcium values. The dissociation values (Kd's) for the fluorescent probes of
Calcium are strongly pH dependent and failure to correct the Kd for the
prevailing pH can greatly bias the apparent calcium concentration, especially in
acidic conditions. The method will be used to investigate the rapid kinetics of
intracellular calcium and pH in cultured pituitary intermediate lobe
melanotropes and to their relationship to hormone release. These cells respond
to potassium ion induced depolarization by entry of calcium into the cell with a
simultaneous acidification of the cell. The hypothesis will be tested that the
rapid acidification is caused by the influx of calcium and is not its
antecedent. The second hypothesis to be tested is that the hormone, dopamine,
through its specific receptors (D2) regulated melantrope calcium and pH.
