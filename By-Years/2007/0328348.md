The thermal management of electrical devices in close proximity, particularly
with dissimilar operating temperatures presents a unique challenge to the
thermal designer. The reliability of the components depends to a substantial
degree on the maintenance of a desired operating temperature. The challenge is
to minimize the neighbor effects, thus maintaining the different operating
temperatures on the same board without allowing the hotter electronic devices to
influence the operating temperature of the lower temperature components. This
project will be performed by a woman researcher at the University and will
augment the research agenda of the Purdue University Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Electronic-Microcooling.
