The sizes of problems that need to be solved in modern
applications&lt;br/&gt;have grown enormously. Sampling to draw a (small) subset
of the data&lt;br/&gt;to store in main memory and process in detail is thus a
natural&lt;br/&gt;alternative to computing on the entire data.&lt;br/&gt;The
project addresses the questions of how well the answers from a&lt;br/&gt;sample
approximates answers to the full problem for many
optimization&lt;br/&gt;problems that go under the name of Constraint
Satisfaction Problems. &lt;br/&gt;The project also considers problems where the
input data consists of&lt;br/&gt;matrices or higher dimensional arrays. Here
adaptive sampling (where&lt;br/&gt;the probability of sampling a piece of the
data depends on its&lt;br/&gt;relative importance) has been successfully used by
the PI and others&lt;br/&gt;recently. The existing results are to be improved.
Adaptive sampling&lt;br/&gt;calls for making more than one pass through the
data. The project will&lt;br/&gt;study models of computation, where the number
of passes is measured as&lt;br/&gt;an important resource. This is expected to
contribute to the&lt;br/&gt;discussion of models to handle large
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A third part of the proposal is to continue the
&lt;br/&gt;PI's study of rapidly mixing Markov Chains, both&lt;br/&gt;by
developing new general techniques and applying to&lt;br/&gt;specific problems
like the computation of volumes of&lt;br/&gt;convex
sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The research is expected to have
broad&lt;br/&gt;impact since the processing of massive data via sampling is
of&lt;br/&gt;enormous importance in modern computing. The&lt;br/&gt;PI teaches
specialized courses at Yale and &lt;br/&gt;hopes to disseminate the results
of&lt;br/&gt;the research to students through the courses.&lt;br/&gt;
