Over a three-year period, the Mobile Elementary Mathematics Initiative - Phase
II (MEMI-Phase II) develops the Academy for Excellence in Mathematics Education,
K-6 and prepares its members to lead and sustain elementary mathematics reform
in the 66,000-student Mobile [AL] County Public School System (MCPSS). The
Academy will include a critical mass of leaders from four groups of essential
stakeholders in K-6 mathematics reform: 36 teachers; 17 school and district
administrators; 30 business and community leaders; and 6 post-secondary
mathematicians and teacher educators. The heart of the Academy is its Teacher
Leadership Program and its carefully coordinated summer institutes, academic
year experiences, and reflection seminars which deepen Academy Teachers
understanding of mathematics and how it is best taught. The MEMI-Phase II builds
on knowledge being gained from a mostly private-funded, three-year (1999-2002)
Maysville Mathematics Initiative which involves a cluster of four inner-city and
high-poverty elementary schools in the MCPSS. As part of the Teacher Leadership
Program, Academy members will lead and support school-wide mathematics reform in
four additional MCPSS elementary schools using the Maysville Mathematics
Initiative model. MEMI-Phase II will directly impact over 180 teachers and their
3,600 students and it will set the stage for a district-wide elementary
mathematics reform initiative, including textbook adoption, that would impact
Mobile's over 2,000 elementary teachers. &lt;br/&gt;
