Research in Chemical Sciences and Engineering Proposal Number: CTS-9724404
Principal Investigator Norman Wagner and Douglas Doren Institution: U. Delaware
Profs. Wagner and Doren will purchase a new central facility for computational
research in Chemical Engineering and Chemistry in disciplines that involve the
description and prediction of molecular phenomena. Research and education areas
of application are in complex fluids and mixtures, physical interaction at
interfaces, and catalysis and surface chemistry. The proposed facility will
complement and reinforce the existing theoretical effort with a new capability
to run vectorial and parallel jobs that require large memory, disk space, and
high-speed visualization. An eight-processor Silicon Graphics Origin 2000 will
be the centerpiece, complementing an existing network of workstations.
