Through this project, funds are provided to improve undergraduate mathematics
education by developing a high-quality computational environment for students
interested in Industrial & Applied Mathematics (IAM). The Student Applied
Mathematics Computer Laboratory (SAM-LAB) is being upgraded through the purchase
of networked PC workstations running both UNIX and Windows and appropriate
peripheral hardware. These workstations will be connected to the campus network
through the purchase of a network hub. The SAM-LAB provides a high-quality,
dedicated computer environment for undergraduate majors in engineering
technologies and computer science which will help them acquire strong
analytical, computational, and numerical skills. Students using the SAM-LAB and
its configuration of computers connected to the Internet have the opportunity
to: (1) pursue advanced computational issues such as parallelization, (2)
dedicate computational resources for large tasks, (3) perform carefully
controlled mathematical experiments, and (4) develop an evolving portfolio
consisting of a set of projects. A lab manual containing detailed objectives and
procedures for each project developed during the course of this program is being
compiled and will be published. Experiences with the laboratory will be
publicized at regional American Mathematical Association and American Physical
Society Meetings. Students are encouraged to present representative work from
their portfolios at these regional meetings. Several of the laboratories using
commercially available packages or in-house developed software will be
distributed electronically. A select number will be published in appropriate
journals.
