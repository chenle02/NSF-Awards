9512860 Cuenca This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
soil hydrodynamic modeling between Richard H. Cuenca at Oregon State University
and Rafael Angulo-Jaramillo at the Laboratory for Hydrology Transfer and
Environment, French National Center for Scientific Research, Grenoble, France.
The investigators propose to develop an accurate model for soil water content
and soil hydrodynamic characteristics at different scales and in conjunction
with experimental programs. The U.S. and French teams will use data from
experimental projects, including HAPEX-Sahel (Hydrologic-Atmospheric Pilot
Experiment) and BOREAS (BOReal Ecosystem-Atmospheric Study). The results from
this research are applicable to flood control, drought alleviation and
monitoring of water resources. The project takes advantage of French expertise
and access to important and unique data.
