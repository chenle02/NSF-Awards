The Department of chemistry is purchasing a high field NMR for use in
undergraduate laboratory courses and research. The instrument is providing
undergraduates with hands-on experience in spectroscopic measurements and
interpretation of data through a policy of open-access to modern
instrumentation. Students are performing 1 dimensional multi-pulse experiments,
2 dimensional spectroscopy, and examining hetero nuclear compounds. The purchase
of the instrument is being jointly funded by the Division of Undergraduate
Science, Engineering and Mathematics Education, and The Division of Chemistry.
