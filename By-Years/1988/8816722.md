Several aspects of kaolinites (clays) will be investigated: 1) what possible
defects are present in kaolinites, 2) do kaolinites from different geologic
origins have different defect structures, 3) for those samples which appear to
be mixtures of two kaolinites, can the two constituents be separated (if so, how
do they differ crystallographically and chemically), 4) in kaolinite samples
which show different crystal morphologies, are themorphologies related to
different defect structures, 5) is there a relation between the defect structure
of a kaolinite and its chemical composition, 6) is there a relation between the
defect structure of a kaolinite and its ability to intercalate organic
compounds? In addition to their scientific interest, clays are extremely
important industrial and agricultural materials and their properties are
critical to industrial and agricultural processes.
