A unique feature of the Enhancing Ecological Education Scholarship Program at
Paul Smith's College is its setting: the college is embedded in the Adirondack
Park in upstate New York. Within this 6 million acre natural resource, the
College recruits students who are passionate about careers in Environmental
Science and Fisheries & Wildlife Science and are academically talented, yet are
financially needy. Particularly targeting students transferring from two-year
institutions and first-generation college students, the program supports them
financially (with scholarships up to four years) and academically. Students join
research laboratories at the College such as those in the Adirondack Watershed
Institute and the Center for Adirondack Biodiversity to enhance their commitment
to STEM careers. This experience strengthens their performance on their senior
capstone project which is required of all Paul Smith's graduates. Numerous
mechanisms at Paul Smith's identify challenges early and offer strategies to
address challenges as well as provide opportunities for students to develop
their scientific expertise. This enhances students' persistence as science
majors through graduation and primes them to compete for jobs in the natural
sciences. Of the scholarship recipients, it is expected that 90% will complete a
bachelor's degree and either join the work force or continue to graduate school.
