A closed aspherical manifold is a compact connected manifold whose universal
cover is contractible. Let M and N be closed aspherical manifolds, and let F be
an isomorphism of their fundamental groups. Borel conjectured that F is always
induced by a homeomorphism f of the manifolds. The investigator, in
collaboration with L. E. Jones of SUNY-Stony Brook, intends to try to settle
this conjecture. Partial results by the investigator and Jones were the main
results of the previous N.S.F. grant (DMS-8801312). The project also relates to
problems in differential geometry and algebraic K-theory; e.g., does Wh(G)
vanish for every torsion-free group G? Manifolds are locally Euclidean spaces,
which makes them very natural objects of study. For example, the physical world
in which we live has three space dimensions and (in some contexts) a time
dimension, making it either a three-dimensional or four-dimensional manifold.
Thus the instant project to understand better the structure of manifolds might
even have cosmological significance.
