This research effort will develop a state-of-practice knowledge base on
effective seismic design of buildings specifically directed at an audience of
practicing architects and faculty in university-based schools of architecture.
Although a great deal of new information has been generated in the subject area
over the last decade, it has not been systematically developed into a
comprehensive, up to date, and useful information base. The project will
generate this information base through an interrelated series of tasks which
will: * assemble and critique a state-of-practice data base on the architectural
aspects of seismic design, concentrating on information developed over the last
10 years; * identify gaps within this data base; * conduct research to address
those gaps that can be filled within the scope and time frame of the project; *
develop recommendations for addressing those topics requiring longer term
efforts; * develop a series of subject-specific final reports which will
constitute the first comprehensive knowledge base on the architectural aspects
of seismic design available in over a decade. The information developed by this
project will constitute a significant addition to the knowledge base in the
subject area and, judging from recent activities within the AIA and the
profession, will be effectively transferable to practicing architects, faculty
and students.
