In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Anders Nilsson of Stanford University, together
with his graduate student researchers, will investigate the nature of the
hydrogen bond network in liquid water. The main experimental techniques to be
used include x-ray absorption spectroscopy, x-ray raman scattering measurements,
small-angle x-ray scattering and x-ray diffraction measurements. These
experiments will be carried out at the SSRL synchrotron radiation facility as
well as with equipment in the Nilsson laboratory. The work will be augmented
with a theoretical collaboration with a Swedish computational chemistry
group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water is the reaction medium for the most important
environmental and life processes. Many of the unique chemical and physical
properties of water are due to its propensity to hydrogen-bond with itself and
other species. The work of Prof. Nilsson and his group is aimed at developing a
better description of the hydrogen bond network in liquid water. The students
working in the Nilsson laboratory will have the opportunity to work in one of
the premier light sources in the country, and will further benefit from an
international collaboration. Besides being intimately involved in the research
work, Prof. Nilsson is an outstanding ambassador for science, participating in a
number of public outreach activities at Stanford as well as at the Exploratorium
in San Francisco.&lt;br/&gt;
