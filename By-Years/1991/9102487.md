An important new technique for probing the middle atmosphere is the use of
short, powerful bursts of laser light for the detection and ranging of
scattering from atmospheric molecules and aerosols. The technique is called
LIDAR, and is very similar to the familiar RADAR technique. This award supports
improvement and testing of the newly developed LIDAR system that the PI has
designed for studies of the upper and middle atmosphere. In particular, new
detector channels will by added to extend the altitude range of the system, and
to increase the number of properties that can be measured simultaneously with
the system. The results are expected to lead particularly to improved
performance for middle atmosphere applications. As part of the testing efforts
it is anticipated that a significant data set will be obtained for use in
investigating atmospheric properties.
