An image analysis system configured for automated microscopy will be used to
quantitatively characterize experiments designed to understand various aspects
of cell behavior. Specifically, automated image analysis will be used for: -
measuring spatial distributions of cells and paths of cell movement in
chemotaxis assays. - characterizing distributions of microbial cells which
attach to surfaces during biofilm formation. - investigating growth kinetics of
mammalian cells immobilized in a polymer matrix. Experimental data are to be
evaluated using theoretical considerations postulated by the PIs.
