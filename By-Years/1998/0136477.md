0136477/Fratantoni&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the analysis and
synthesis of several types of data from the recently completed North Brazil
Current (NBC) Ring Experiment. Preliminary results from this experiment suggest
that these large ocean eddies may carry a significant amount of upper ocean
meridional mass transport in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Data available for
this synthesis include RAFOS float and surface drifter trajectories, hydrography
from multiple cruises, data from current meter moorings and inverted echo
sounders. It is expected that most attention will be given to the float and
drifter data, together with the hydrography. The analysis has several aims
including: describing the physical structure of NBC rings after separation;
determining rates of translation, mixing and decay as rings move north-west;
determining the processes responsible for deformation and destruction of NBC
rings as they encounter the Antilles; and to identify the fate of the S.
Atlantic water in ring cores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
