There are many wood structures in existence throughout the country and an
important consideration in determining the remaining life of the structure is
the determination of the in-situ strength of the wood material. This project
will develop procedures for the nondestructive evaluation of the strength of the
wood in place. The data will enable engineers to evaluate the rehabilitation
potential of the existing wood structure. The results of the investigation will
provide the basis for the development of nondestructive testing devices for use
in assessing the in-situ strength of the wood structures.
