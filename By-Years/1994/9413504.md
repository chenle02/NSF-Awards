9413504 Kennedy Quantum coherence properties of low photon number sources are
investigated using a novel approach based on many-body Green's function
techniques. These Green function methods enable the theorist to directly compute
the quantities of experimental interest and in a computationally efficient
manner. Cavity QED problems, collective motion of atoms, and laser cooling will
be examined using the new approach. ***
