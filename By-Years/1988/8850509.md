Modeled on a successful program for college and university faculty, this
3.5-year project seeks to address in a comprehensive fashion the challenges and
opportunities offered to high school teachers and curricula by the interplay of
computers and mathematics. Each of the 180 participants, most of them from
northern Ohio, will attend 2 six-week summer sessions in which he or she will
focus on one of three related "strands": computer science, mathematics, and the
use of computers to teach mathematics. Academic-year activities will include two
meetings of the participants, visits by project staff to their classrooms, and
an annual conference at Kent State University. The evaluation will assess
changes in the participants' knowledge, skills, and attitudes, in their teaching
strategies, in their schools' curricula, and in their students' achievement.
During the third year of the project, dissemination to other states will begin.
Kent State University and the State of Ohio are contributing in cost-sharing an
amount that is equal to 28% of the NSF award.
