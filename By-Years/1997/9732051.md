ABSTRACT OPP-9732051 HINKEL, KENNETH UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI The project will
gather, organize, and make available to a wide research community an
international set of data on the thickness of the seasonal active thaw layer of
the permafrost zone throughout the Arctic. The project is part of a
multidisciplinary project that addresses the impact of global change on land-
atmosphere-ice interactions (LAII) in the Arctic. The dynamics of the
circumarctic thaw layer is partly a function of the air temperature and,
therefore, may serve as a harbinger of global change as temperatures rise in
response to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. The full circumarctic dataset
will provide the wide coverage necessary to resolve small-scale anomalies and
regional variability that, if studied alone, would yield incorrect
interpretations of temporal trends in thaw depth due to regional climatic
trends. The results of this project will be used in combination with those of
other LAII projects to determine the regional impacts of global change on
terrestrial systems throughout the Arctic.
