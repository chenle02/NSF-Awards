This is a Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists and Engineers. A research
program in automating the synthesis of the VHDL language from a very high-level
architectural specification is being planned. The approach is to transition
state-of-the-art software synthesis technology to CAD design automation. A
feasibility study of several high-level architectural specification models,
which are implementation independent, is being conducted. Other activities are:
defining a set of VHDL software synthesis operators, developing representations
of pure behavioral level architectural specifications, and performing
feasibility tests of these specifications.
