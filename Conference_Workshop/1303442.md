This grant supports travel of US researchers to attend the workshop on
"Mutilevel methods and Optimization" from April 29 to May 2, 2013, at the
Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. The planned talks and panel
discussions will cover classical problems such as partial differential
equations, together with modern tasks such as web search and data mining.
Speakers and participants in the workshop come from a variety of disciplines,
including physics, biology, chemistry, economics, environment and earth
sciences, computer science and engineering. A special two-hour panel "Challenges
in Multilevel Computation: where should we be directing our efforts and our
graduate students?" is planned for the second day.

Multilevel solution methods for simulation and optimization problems over very
large number of variables is central and important to virtually all disciplines
in the sciences and engineering. These methodologies are very powerful because
they exploit the fact that most computational problems have multiple scales.
This notion of multiple scales may take on many different guises, including time
and space, pixels, particles, proteins, or web-pages. This multiplicity and
disparity of scales is an essential source of computational complexity. The
multilevel algorithms address the problem under consideration at a hierarchy of
scales, typically treating each with a method that is local to that particular
scale. The proposed workshop will bring together junior researchers and world-
class experts, mainly from North America, Western Europe, and Israel, to exhibit
and discuss their recent research on multilevel computational methods for
simulation and optimization in a wide variety of topics and applications.
Together, the diverse backgrounds of the participants in the workshop and the
planned activities are expected to expose new research directions in multilevel
computational methods and to identify the most pressing challenges in this
diverse field.
