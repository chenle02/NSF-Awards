9321787 One focus of this research is the preparation of high carbon content,
dense, refractory materials via thermal curing of three dimensional oligomeric
matrices derived from polymerization of tetraethynylmethane. A second focus is
the assembly of periodic, covalently linked two and three dimensional carbon
networks with high strength to weight ratio which could be used as "organic
zeolites." %%% With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Ken S. Feldman of the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania
State University. Professor Feldman will focus his work on the synthesis of
organic solid materials whose desirable bulk properties can be related to the
composition of the component molecules. ***
