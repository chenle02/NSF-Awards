The research considers the impact of improved Information Technology (IT) on the
structure of organizations. Recent empirical work suggests that as IT improves,
the organizations using it may find it advantageous to enlarge the scope of
individual or departmental decision-making (i.e., to decentralize) and at the
same time to make the organization's final actions more sensitive to the
information gathered by all departments (i.e., to coordinate). The research will
study formal models to determine the assumptions under which these claims indeed
hold up. That will require precise specification of the organization's actions,
goals, and information-processing activities and precise assumptions about the
self-interested behavior of the organization's members when the organization
decentralizes. In the main class of models, the relevant IT is the ability to
search large databases. To choose appropriate actions, the organization has to
track its changing external environment. Each member of the organization
specializes in some aspect of the environment, and improved database-search
capability allows the member to learn more about that aspect for a given search
cost. Search cost will be measured in several alternative ways. The results of
the research should be useful in suggesting new hypotheses and methods for
future empirical work on the impact of IT at the level of organizations.
