Abstract for the award DMS-0653023 of Dasgupta

The connection between special values of L-functions and global points, through
the conjectures of Stark or Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer, is one of the great mysteries
of modern mathematics. The proposed project aims to shed light on this
connection. Furthermore, one aspect of the proposed project is to provide
algorithms to generate class fields, and implement these algorithms in practice,
thereby involving the theory of computing. Also, the relationship between the
study of Gross-Stark units and the rapidly growing body of work on Galois
representations associated to p-adic families of modular forms is an exciting
new link to be explored.

Kronecker's "dream of youth" was to explicitly construct class fields of number
fields; Hilbert presented the problem as the 12th in his famous list. This
question has motivated many great advances in number theory, including the
Kronecker-Weber theorem and the theory of complex multiplication. The connection
between units in number fields and special values of archimedean and p-adic
zeta-functions is also a central motivating problem in number theory. Any
advances towards providing an explicit class field theory for number fields or
understanding the conjectures of Stark and Gross should be considered
significant contributions to mathematics.
