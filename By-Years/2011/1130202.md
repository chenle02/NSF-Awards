Integrated research, mentoring and culture experiences will be offered to eight
undergraduates per year in Shanghai, China. Worcester Polytechnic Institute
(WPI) senior students will be engaged in research on water treatment in an
economically growing region - Shanghai, China. The students will spend a total
of eight weeks at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) and complete their
degree-required research projects under the supervision of both WPI faculty and
faculty at the School of Environmental Science and Engineering at SJTU. WPI is
developing a research center in Shanghai that enables these opportunities for
students. This grant will further strengthen the development of this center. The
center will leverage WPI's infrastructure for these international research
projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an increasing trend for US companies to
develop manufacturing and research relationships with corresponding industries
in China. From the perspective of environmental engineering, the recognized
environmental challenges in China provide opportunities for non-Chinese entities
to develop businesses in addressing the solutions or prevention of environmental
problems. Therefore, a program that provides opportunities for US undergraduate
students to participate in research in China under the mentorship of Chinese
researchers and to learn about the Chinese perspectives in understanding the
nature of technical issues, the challenges faced, and the Chinese approach to
decision making and problem resolution could be very valuable for the
participating students. Both WPI and SJTU faculty members involved are committed
to mentoring undergraduates in research and professional development.
Experiences by undergraduates working in a research setting in China will be
valuable in broadening their understanding and forming a more effective
foundation for future technical collaborations.
