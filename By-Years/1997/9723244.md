9723244 Momany The overall goal of this research project is to develop novel
crystallization strategies based on the design of self-assembling matrices
(SAMs). To create these SAMs, sophisticated molecular techniques and
combinatorial libraries will be used to engineer antibody fragments and other
relevant macromolecules that crystallize with large voids that can accommodate
additional target macromolecules. The target for which a structure is desired
would be carried into the lattice though specific interactions selected though
Phage Display panning. A SAM-based method of crystallization will significantly
increase the rate of crystal structure determinations and thus make practical
crystallography associated with genome-projects. The approach is ideal for
crystallizing macromolecules such as peptide hormones, carbohydrates, RNA, DNA,
and membrane-bound or glycosylated proteins that have resisted standard
empirically-based crystallization strategies in the past. By creating a
mechanism that avoids empirical crystallization screens, this SAM-based approach
can have a significant impact on the entire field of structural biology. ***
