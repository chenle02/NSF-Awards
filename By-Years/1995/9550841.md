IP Physics Title: Enhanced MBL and Implementation of Workshop Physics The aim of
this project is to increase the learning, retention, and enrollment of students
in physics at Ventura College. This is being achieved by adopting a workshop
approach to teaching physics using enhanced microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL)
tools. The time students traditionally spend listening passively to lectures is
replaced by direct, peer-group collaborative enquiry in a laboratory
environment. Workshop physics uses integrated computer tools, including MBL, in
mechanics and other areas of the curriculum. Enhanced use is made of dynamic
spreadsheets and graphs for data analysis. An emphasis is placed on using these
tools for modeling. The use of digital video analysis is also being used in the
laboratory setting. Workshop physics provides a more supportive learning
environment for students and a more supportive atmosphere for traditionally at-
risk students such as those in Ventura's large Hispanic population. In addition,
the MBL equipment and techniques from Workshop Physics will be introduced into
the physical science course being developed for preservice teachers.
