This equipment will be used by six faculty members for several research
projects, including, in particular, studies of (1) materials for supporting
cell-type specific cell adhesion and cell growth for medical studies, (2)
materials for promoting nerve regeneration and repair, and the neurophysiology
of peripheral nerve regeneration, (3) materials for cardiovascular applications,
(4) materials for biosensing applications, (5) materials for the encapsulation
and immunoprotection of cells for disease therapy and drug screening, and (6)
the expression of non-native proteins on the surfaces of E. coli for
immunosorbents, immunocatalysts, and live vaccines.
