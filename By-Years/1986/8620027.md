Large networks of computers supporting both local and distributed processing
are emerging as the computing environments of choice. Application programs,
which concurrently access shared, distributed, and possibly replicated data in
these environments, need to run without interruption despite failures occurring
in the system. Although distributed systems are becoming more popular,
demonstrating their reliability is left up to observing their operational
behavior in the field. It would be more convincing, and in the long run more
cost- effective, to use a more formal means of demonstrating a system's
properties than by simply observing it in use. The objectives of this project
are: (1) to design specification languages suitable for describing properties of
reliable distributed systems; and (2) to develop proof techniques suitable for
reasoning about and guiding the development of such systems. Formal mathematics,
in particular axiomatic and deductive methods of logic, will be employed to
define the syntax and semantics of the languages and proof techniques. Formality
will be balanced by the more pragmatic concerns of making the language
expressively rich and proof techniques tractable by system developers and
implementors. The results of this work will directly benefit the following
communities: distributed systems, by helping people design, understand, and
reason about reliable systems; programming languages, by influencing the design
and semantics of future distributed languages; and formal methods, by extending
axiomatic techniques to as yet unexplored grounds.
