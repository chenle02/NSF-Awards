ABSTRACT EEC-9612120 BULLARD This award provides funding for the first year of a
four-year continuing award to the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Air Conditioning and
Refrigeration . Currently there are 18 companies involved in the Center. This
Center has been in existence for six years. Continued operational support for
the next four years will enable the Center to continue the high level of
graduate student involvement in its research program (112 have been involved to
date). The Center's research is aimed at providing the technology base for a new
generation of energy-efficient, quiet and reliable equipment that can use ozone-
safe refrigerants. The phaseout of environmentally-damaging refrigerants
rendered nearly useless he industry's massive empirical data base which served
as the foundation for design. The Center's ongoing and proposed research
provides a fundamental understanding of factors affecting: thermodynamic and
transport properties of lubricants in pure and zeotropic mixtures of
hydroflurocarbon refrigerants: heat transfer, pressure drop; frost formation and
growth; friction and wear; and system performance, controls and diagnostics.
Additional funding is provided in this award to support two undergraduate
students to work on two Center projects: "An integrated approach to experimental
studies of air-side heat transfer enhancements" and "Modeling, diagnostics and
controls for mobile air conditioning systems".
