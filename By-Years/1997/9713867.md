This project is providing travel support to selected United States
mathematicians to attend a meeting to be held in Pretoria, South Africa which is
jointly sponsored by the American Mathematical Society (AMS), the London
Mathematical Society (LMS), and the South African Mathematical Society (SAMS).
The conference blends mathematics education and research topics. Because the
meeting is one of the most important mathematics occasions in South Africa, the
AMS, through its sponsorship of the meeting, is encouraging broad participation,
especially by African-American mathematicians. *
