9603206 Bucksbaum This award supports the participation of American scientists
in a U.S.-Japan seminar on the Manipulation of Matter by Coherent Light to be
held in Gunma, Japan from September 1- 5, 1997. The co-organizers are Professors
Philip H. Bucksbaum of the University of Michigan and Kohzo Hakuta of the
University of Electro-Communications in Japan. This seminar will bring together
leading researchers in the areas of laser-atom cooling, atom optics, atomic
coherent control, and ultrafast laser-atom processes, to study emerging
connections between these fields. Topics to be discussed include Bose-Einstein
condensation of cold atoms, quantum computing, microlasers, and entangled
wavepackets. %%% The manipulation of matter by coherent light is one of the
leading fields of activity in laser-matter studies, and new advances are being
stimulated by new technologies. The recent success in observing Bose-Einstein
condensation in a weakly interacting gas confirmed for the first time
predictions made by Einstein and Bose almost a century ago. With a U.S.
concentration on gas phase studies and a Japanese focus on condensed matter and
quantum optics, the exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this
field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the
stage for future collaborative projects. ***
