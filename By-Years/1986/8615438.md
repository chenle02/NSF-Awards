The goal of this research is to unify and expand on many of the traditional
approaches to solving integer programming problems by incorporating them into a
software package. In additon, a new approach called "branch and cut" is proposed
which promises to replace the branch and bound approach traditionally used to
prove optimality. Integer programming problems arise in a wide range of
engineering optimization problems where resources, such as machines are
indivisible.
