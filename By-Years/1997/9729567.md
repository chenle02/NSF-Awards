The Institute of Ecosystem Studies, located in Millbrook, NY is an independent
not-for-profit research and education institute dedicated to the creation,
dissemination and application of knowledge about ecological systems. This grant
will help fund Internet access for the institution by supporting the acquisition
of a leased line, connection equipment, installation services and service
provider fees. The students and faculty of the Institute of Ecosystem Studies
need the Internet connections to be able to access information resources
throughout the state, the nation and the world. The connection will benefit the
faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the community in general.
The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
