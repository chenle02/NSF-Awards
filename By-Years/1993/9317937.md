9317937 Bifano The award is for investigating issues in the manufacture of
massively parallel, microelectromechanical systems by using semiconductor
fabrication technology. Arrays of electrostatically actuated diaphragms have
been manufactured by such a process, and will be evaluated for actuator
mechanical characteristics and process yield. The production of optical quality
surfaces on such multi actuator wafers by precision diamond grinding will also
be investigated, as the initial application to be investigated is adaptive
optical compensation of telescopes. Successful completion of the research would
enable precise, fine, distributed actuation which would benefit a variety of
applications. Examples of such applications are a multi zone deformable mirror
to be used for adaptive optical compensation of telescopes, and multi gate flow
control valve for precise control of very low liquid flow rates in
semiconductor, biomedical and chemical applications.
