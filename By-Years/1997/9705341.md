This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase 11 project will further refine
the concepts from the phase I results that established the feasibility of
capillary electrophoresis/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE/TOFMS). TOFMS
potentially provides nearly ideal detection capability for CE because it
combines high sensitivity, and high scan speed, with the ability (when used with
electrospray ionization) to detect ionized solution phase compounds typical of
many biological and environmental samples. Our research objectives for the phase
11 project include: (1) development, implementation, and testing of the next
generation high speed data acquisition system; (2) construction and testing of a
50 cm `inverted perfectron` TOFMS; (3) refinement of the electrospray ion source
and the interface between the ion source and the TOFMS; and (4) further
development of capillary column technology for CE. These refinements are based
on new concepts and experimental results generated in phase I and are aimed at
improving performance and reliability and increasing the cost effectiveness of
CE/TOFMS. They will culminate in a prototype instrument very similar to one that
could be introduced as a commercial product. To date no publications have
resulted from this work. We plan to publish results in the future. Two
inventions were developed during the course of this work. One deals with the
transport of ions through the differentially pumped interface connecting the
mass spectrometer to the electrospray ion source. The second is a new type of
data acquisition system. The art of both inventions will be taught in patents we
will file. We anticipate describing the them in scientific presentations and
papers as well. It is also our plan to make the inventions available as part of
a commercial TOFMS when the technology has matured sufficiently for a product
introduction.
