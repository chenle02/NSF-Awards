Biopolymers (such as DNA molecules, actin filaments and microtubules) and
biomembranes (made of lipids, proteins, and cholesterols) are the most important
building blocks of living cells. In recent years much momentum has been built up
in the theoretical simulations of biopolymers and biomembranes. Since such
simulations take very long computational time, an efficient algorithm is needed
(use fast algorithm for generating matrices or better model to reduce the cost).
This project will include the development and implementation of state-of-the-art
fast numerical algorithms for hydrodynamic interactions, and will be of benefit
to scientists and engineers studying DNA dynamics as well as emerging
applications of biomimetic membranes. This research will be conducted in
collaboration with Dr. Ming-Chih Lai, a noted expert on simulating fluid-
structure interactions, at National Chiao Tung University in Hsinchu, Taiwan. In
biologically relevant problems the non-local hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) of
macromolecules in water are essential to the underlying physics for their
dynamics. This project will develop an efficient coarse-grained numerical
algorithm with a fast multiple method for HIs between biomembranes and solvents.
In previous work it has been demonstrated that this scheme is fast and
convergent for capturing Brownian dynamics (BD) of a biopolymer under flow.
Based on these results the main focus of this project is to construct such a
coarse-grained scheme to simulate the biologically complicated membranes with
cholesterols and proteins interacting with different species of lipids. This
project will investigate numerical schemes to efficiently calculate the HIs in
coarse-grained BD modeling. By comparing with the continuum modeling, results
from this investigation will lead to validation and refinement of the proposed
numerical schemes. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with National
Science Council of Taiwan.
