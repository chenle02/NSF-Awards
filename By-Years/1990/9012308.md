Student Pugwash USA is an organization that is devoted to increasing awareness
among graduate and undergraduate students on ethical issues posed by science and
advancing technology. Programs are international, intergenerational, and
interdisciplinary, and include the organization of biennial conferences and the
development and integration of a campus-based chapter network, to build a
growing community of individuals who bring to their work a lasting commitment to
responsible decision making. This award will provide support for student
participants to attend the Seventh Biennial Conference and for chapter and
regional development activities. The conference allows approximately 90 U.S. and
foreign students to spend a week with about 40 experts and leaders in science,
government, academia and business in small group and plenary sessions exploring
the social and ethical implications of environmental, scientific and
technological change. Conference research papers and plenary speeches are often
published in professional journals. This year's conference theme is "New Ways of
Thinking: Ethical Issues in Science and World Affairs." Chapter development
activities include local and regional conferences, a national Chapter Organizing
Workshop and Chapter Meeting and Conference, the revision of chapter relevant
publications, and the development of an electronic campus-based student network.
NSF support provides approximately 15% of the costs of these activities. This
support assists Student Pugwash USA to raise additional funds from private
sector donors. This proposal comes from an organization with a track record of
successful and innovative activities to increase students' awareness of the
links between science, technology and society. The project director is very
competent; the project plan, appropriate. NSF support will allow the conference
and chapter programs to continue as the organization develops its plans for long
term financial stability. An award is highly recommended.
