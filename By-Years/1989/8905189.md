This experiment is the land portion of a seismic reflection- refraction survey
across the Oregon continent-ocean transition zone which piggybacks on an
already-scheduled seismic reflection survey. The objective is to obtain a 2-D
image of the velocity structure of the subducting oceanic crust and overlying
material from the toe of the accretionary wedge arcward to beneath the Coast
Ranges. The structure of both the offshore portion of the Juan de Fuca plate and
the western portion of the accretionary wedge are key to an understanding of the
tectonic framework of the Pacific Northwest. This research deals with the
definition of the tectonics of an area identified as a candidate for a major
subduction-type earthquake and therefore is an important contribution to the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
