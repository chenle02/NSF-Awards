A large class of optimization problems, called NP-complete problems, are likely
to be intractable. Due to the great difficulty of finding the optimum solutions
of these problems, researchers are turning towards the (maybe more significant)
search of an approximation solution in the "average" case of a suitable
stochastic model. A typical NP-complete problem is the Bin-Packing problem,
which requires finding the minimum number of unit size bins needed to pack a
given collection of items of size less than or equal to 1. In the most natural
model of stochastic bin packing, sizes of items are distributed independently
according to a given distribution u. (No special assumptions are made on u).
Abstract mathematical tools have been used to obtain with relative ease rather
unexpected results about optimal packing in this model. This project will
investigate the bin packing problem, and its variations such as dual bin packing
and strip packing, a stochastic version of the traveling salesman problem.
