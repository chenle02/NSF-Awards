The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to improve usage of computing cloud resources to minimize waste.
Increasingly, businesses are running IT infrastructure and operations in the
cloud to reduce server expenses. However, leasing equivalent cloud space from
major providers can cost companies as much as 50% of their revenue. This is in
part because businesses must overprovision to accommodate potential surges in
server use and to ensure that applications that cannot tolerate any downtime are
not interrupted. This overprovisioning causes as much as 60% of unused/idle
cloud space and an estimated $14 Billion in wasted spending annually. This
project will enable users to reduce their cloud spend by up to 90% by taking
advantage of deeply discounted server space available in spot markets, and it
will further enable users to optimize their workloads by consolidating virtual
machines, further reducing cost. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the development of two
novel intelligent-automation-based solutions. The first technology will
dramatically improve the usability of discounted virtual machine (VM) instances
(Spot Instances) for critical applications by spawning containers on discounted
Spot Instances and dynamically relocating containers between such instances
based on availability and price. The second technology will address idle
resource waste in the cloud by packing idle containers onto a small number of
VMs during the idle period, minimizing the number of active VMs and thus
reducing the cost of keeping services online. When the workload increases, the
technology will relocate containers onto different VMs, without any service
interruption. To establish feasibility, a prototype for each element will be
designed and developed. Objectives include: 1) optimize network and storage for
supporting the companyâ€™s patented container architecture for secure isolation of
containers in the cloud; 2) develop a resource scheduler for both proposed
solutions 3) develop a user interface for workload monitoring and
configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
