Professor Shahidi will continue his study of the holomorphy of symmetric cube
L-functions for non-monomial cusp forms on the general linear group on dimension
two vector spaces. This is the first step in establishing the existence of the
symmetric cube lift to the general linear group on dimension four spaces. The
investigator will also consider the questions of poles of all L-functions that
are obtained from a method previously established in conjunction with R.
Langlands. Also under consideration is the boundedness or finiteness of order on
finite strips of theses functions. In a related project Professor Shahidi will
attempt to increase the applications for Arthur's trace formula to the most
general cases by establishing new identities satisfied by normalized
intertwining operators.

This project involves questions in number theory and representation theory.
Historically there have been many examples in mathematics where important
information about the fundamental properties of numbers is encoded in the
functions of calculus. An important advance in number theory over the past
twenty years has been the increased understanding that these examples were part
of a very general theory. The full general theory is still quite a mathematical
mystery. It is so powerful, however, that each time a step toward the general
theory is made, the repercussions are felt in all parts of number theory and
representation theory. L-functions are the functions that often encode the
information that number theorists need, and the information appears at points
called the poles of the function. In this project, Professor Shahidi will
investigate several methods of extracting this information from the function.
