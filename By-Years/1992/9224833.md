This award supports work on modeling climate change on tectonic time scales and
focusing on the major glacial-nonglacial climate transitions in Earth history.
In particular, this work focuses on simulations for (1) the Ordovician-Silurian
(~440 Ma) glacial- nonglacial couplet involving a possible glaciation at high
CO2 levels: (2) simulations of conditions favorable for late Paleozoic
glaciation and regional-scale comparison of results with economically important
hydrocarbon and coal deposits on North America and Europe; and (3) implications
of northward plate motion for late Cenozoic onset of glaciation on Greenland. By
focusing on these cases this research will address some of the more important
issues needed to develop a comprehensive theory of climate change on tectonic
time scales.
