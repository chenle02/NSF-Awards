Lawson State Community College requested support from NSF to connect it's
campus to the Internet. Lawson State Community College is one of the twenty
community colleges in the State of Alabama and the only predominantly black
supported state colleges in Central Alabama. It is located in the southwestern
section of Birmingham, Alabama and serves a student body of over 2000. Lawson
State Community College intends to connect through the Alabama Super Computer
Authority. The campus needs the Internet connection to be able to access
information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world. The
connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as well
as the community in general. The award provides partial support of the project
for two years.
