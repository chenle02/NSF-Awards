The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of an engineered
probiotic as an treatment for hyperuricemia and gout. Acute gout episodes cause
debilitating pain and hypersensitivity, seriously impairing mobility. Over time,
joint damage and deformity, chronic usage-related pain, and disfigurement
follow. Although gout can be treated by drugs that lower uric acid levels, these
drugs have significant drawbacks for many patients: they have limited
effectiveness, are associated with serious side effects, and may be expensive.
Gout patients experience an estimated increase of 5 absence days annually with
an incremental cost of $3,000 per patient. The 9.2 million gout patients in the
USA spend more than $1.3 billion per year on gout drugs. Moreover, roughly half
take additional supplements. The proposed project will develop a novel probiotic
strain to address hyperuricemia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance hyperuricemia treatment
using an engineered probiotic. The proposed treatment is based on the
observation that enzymatically degrading uric acid in the intestine reduces
serum uric acid levels, unlike conventional treatments targeting the circulatory
system, the urinary tract, or function systemically. This project will use
genetic screening to identify a probiotic strain to break down uric acid,
engineering it to prevent gene mobility across species and avoid transfer of
antibiotic resistance to the intestinal microbiome. Finally, we will confirm
safety and efficacy in a mouse model of hyperuricemia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
