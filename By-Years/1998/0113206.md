Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0113206&lt;br/&gt;R. Lucht, Texas A&amp;M
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components are acquired for development of a
tunable, high-resolution optical parametric oscillator (OPO) laser source. The
system features a resonant, electronically locked ring-oscillator cavity that is
injection-seeded with tunable diode laser radiation. The pump source
&lt;br/&gt;for the OPO system is a Q-switched injection-seeded Nd:YAG laser. In
addition to serving as the &lt;br/&gt;pump source for the OPO cavity, the
fundamental (1064 nm) and harmonic (532 nm, 355 nm, and &lt;br/&gt;266 nm) laser
radiation from the YAG laser is used in sum-frequency generation (SFG)
&lt;br/&gt;processes to convert the near infrared output of the OPO into visible
or ultraviolet radiation. This &lt;br/&gt;source will greatly improve
applicability and accuracy of a wide variety of laser diagnostic
&lt;br/&gt;techniques. Specific examples include ultraviolet polarization
spectroscopy (PS) of hydroxyl and &lt;br/&gt;nitric oxide, amplified stimulated
emission (ASE) of the carbon atom, and coherent anti-Stokes &lt;br/&gt;Raman
scattering (CARS) of the hydrogen molecule.&lt;br/&gt;
