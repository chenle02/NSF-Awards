This proposal concerns an extention of the lossless Lempel-Ziv data compression
algorithm to lossy algorithm using a rate- distortion type of fidelity
criterion. The project will focus on three problems first, all related to data
compression algorithm and estimation algorithms based on log convex functions:
Identificattion of Log-Convex Parameters. Extension of Rissanen's Approach to
the Estimation Problem. An Extimation Algorithm Motivated by the Lempel-Ziv Data
Compression Algorithm. If possible, other work on data compression algorithms
based on the Lempel-Ziv algorithm and modifications will be extended.//
