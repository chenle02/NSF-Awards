This I-Corps project will increase a customerâ€™s ability to identify and mitigate
mold and HVAC issues before they happen, allowing them to better allocate their
resources and ultimately save money and maintain a healthy atmosphere and reduce
waste. The core technology is centered around a holistic approach to indoor air
quality (IAQ) and HVAC equipment maintenance. More than 75% of IAQ problems are
HVAC related, and poor IAQ results in reduced productivity of approximately 14.5
million missed workdays a year costing the US more than $168 B annually.
Widespread adoption of this technology would help companies increase their
productivity due to better indoor air quality. Several studies have concluded
that poor indoor air quality results in reduced performance. Some of the studies
have calculated the total costs associated with mold-related asthma and sinus
issues alone to be up to $32 B in medical bills and absenteeism. The approach
focuses on HVAC equipment and enabling preventive maintenance, which may save
the manufacturing industry over $200 B annually. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project is focused on developing an intelligent monitoring and
predictive system that is capable of 1) predicting future mold growth, 2) making
predictions of future HVAC system health, and 3) generating alerts, work orders,
and maintenance recommendations to the end user. Such a service does not
currently exist within traditional building automation systems, which only
monitor the mechanical systems with a focus on energy optimization, not the
environment with a focus on occupant comfort. Facility managers continue to take
a reactive approach to HVAC system maintenance and mold remediation, rather than
a proactive, preventative approach. The goal is to evaluate several approaches
to quantify the state of health of HVAC systems with limited data under the
assumption that access to proprietary data is not possible. Time series analysis
methods, such as vectorized auto regression, provide accurate anomaly detection
results under a short prediction horizon, but are not suitable for fault
isolation. Using mold growth and rate charts from the literature, a machine
learning algorithm has been developed to accurately classify the risk level of a
given temperature and humidity reading, but further work is needed to account
for a cumulative exposure rate or measurement
fluctuations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
