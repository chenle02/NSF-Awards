High-redshift quasars are currently the only objects that can give us
information about nucleosynthesis in the very Early Universe. Many exhibit
prominent FeII emission features in their spectra. Because the relative
abundance of Fe is tightly correlated with Type-Ia supernovae, FeII becomes a
very important chronological indicator of the age of star formation activity at
the earliest epochs. The principal goal of this work is to develop diagnostic
tools to interpret this FeII emission. These FeII diagnostics will be used as
cosmological probes of star-formation and to determine the iron abundance in the
quasars of the Early Universe. This project is designed to combine the efforts
of the leading theoretical, observational and experimental groups working on
FeII from the USA, Europe and Japan, and is therefore international in scope. It
includes both space- and ground-based spectroscopic observations, theoretical
and experimental input from atomic physics, and finally will culminate in
theoretical modeling of the observed FeII. ***
