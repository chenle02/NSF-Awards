The XLIII International Symposium on Multiparticle Dynamics (ISMD 2013) will be
held September 15-20, 2013 at the Illinois Institute of Technology. This
symposium will bring together particle and nuclear physicists who share common
interests in the study of multiparticle reactions at particle and nuclear
physics colliders and will provide a forum for well-established physicists to
interact with junior members in the field to work on solving the most
complicated aspects of quantum chromodynamics. Participants will discuss recent
experimental results, as well as new developments in theory that impact both
communities.

ISDM 2013 represents a good opportunity for students and post-docs to further
their training and advance their careers. These activities encourage research
across discipline boundaries. The NSF support of this symposium will be used to
support minorities, students or postdocs, who would be otherwise unable to cover
travel expenses to the symposium, registration and local expenses.
