This award is for a doctoral dissertation research improvement grant to support
research for a dissertation project, On the Origin of Vestiges: Science, Pseudo-
Science, and Society in Early Victorian Britain. It will focus on how Vestiges
of the Natural History of Creation and its anonymous author, publisher Robert
Chambers, reveal the complex and often conflictual relationship between science
and society in early Victorian Britain. Vestiges proposed the first
comprehensive theory of universal development, including the transmutation of
species, to be published in English. Vestiges was very widely read by both the
general public and many in positions of cultural and political authority. Its
integrated theory of material development and deistic design derived from many
sources that have yet to be fully revealed. This dissertation will seek to
identify and clarify the components (intellectual, philosophical, theological,
personal, sociological, and political) from which Chambers fashioned Vestiges,
in order to highlight issues of cultural and epistemic status, display the early
stages of border disputes between science and religion in Britain, and reveal
surprising political affiliations and influences among people and ideas normally
associated with liberal reform. In addition, because Vestiges occupied a
particularly precarious position as a scientific work, this dissertation will
reveal crucial but as yet ill-defined distinctions between science and non-
science at a time when such distinctions were becoming especially consequential.
Many of these issues still resonate today in conflicts between claims accepted
by scientific experts and the values and ideas of certain religious and cultural
groups. A deeper understanding of the historical components of these issues will
help scientists, cultural leaders, teachers, and policy-makers develop more
effective strategies for addressing and ameliorating some of the friction
resulting from engagements between conflicting views about the nature and status
of scientific knowledge.
