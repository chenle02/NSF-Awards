During the differentiation of B and T-lymphocytes, antibody and T-cell antigen
receptor genes undergo a complicated series of recombination events. All of the
antigen receptor variable region genes contain a pair of highly conserved
recombination signal sequences which are the targets of a site-specific
recombinase. In an attempt to identify and characterize the factors involved in
this recombination process, Dr. Aguilera has sought nuclear factors which might
interact specifically with the recombination signals. With the use of sensitive
electrophoretic assays, DNA binding factors have been identified in
recombination-positive pre-B cells which bind specifically to the V-(D)-J
recombination signals. The next goals of this research are: (1) To further
characterize the lymphocyte nuclear factors which interact specifically with the
recombination signals; (2) To continue experiments leading to the purification
of these binding factors; (3) To clone and characterize the genes encoding
nuclear factors which interact with the V-(D)-J recombination signals. The long
term objective of this research is the characterization of the enzymatic
machinery involved in antigen receptor gene recombination in cells of the immune
system. These events underlie the generation of the vast diversity of specific
receptor molecules that recognize and enable an individual to develop an immune
response to a wide array of foreign substances.
