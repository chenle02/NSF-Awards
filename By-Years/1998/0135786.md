Professor Luis Echegoyen of Clemson University is supported by the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry Program to study the electrochemistry of fullerene
compounds. Within this theme, there are four areas proposed: reactivity of
electrochemically induced reactions, including photovoltaic applications,
preparation of new crystalline materials and metal ion endohedral complexes. The
reaction mechanism to be studied is the removal of certain cyclopropane adducts
from methanofullerenes.

The field of fullerene chemistry including electrochemical study has grown since
the discovery of this new carbon form just over a decade ago. New materials with
potential for energy storage and sensors are beginning to emerge from this
research endeavor.
