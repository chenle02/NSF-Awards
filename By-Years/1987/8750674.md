This project is to modernize and strengthen the civil engineering program with
the introduction of computer-aided design and drafting. The system will be used
in varying degrees in different courses ranging from basic technical drafting to
courses in structural mechanics. The software will give the students the
opportunity to use state-of-the-art techniques in the calculation and design of
structural building systems. Finally, the laboratory will support the surveying
courses eliminating many of the hand calculations now required.
