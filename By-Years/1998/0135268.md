Three lipid-associated supramolecular preparations of the membrane-active
antibiotic Amphotericin B (AmB) are currently on the market: AmBisome, Amphocil,
and Abelcet. They are fundamentally different physically: AmBisome is a true
closed liposomal bilayer preparation, Amphocil is micellar dispersion with
cholesteryl sulfate and Abelcet is interdigitated lipid dispersion. Despite
these differences, all three preparations damage fungal membranes compared to
mammalian cell and all are more active than the original micellar commercial
preparation consisting of AmB: deoxycholate in a mole ratio of ~1:2 (Fungizone,
FZ). Simple AmB or FZ solutions may be treated with moderate heat (70 o C for 20
minutes) to produce a new self-associated state of AmB, a imsuperaggregatel.,
termed heat-treated Fungizone (HFZ). The goal of this project is to tease apart
which specificbiochemical and biophysical properties of these five Amphotericin
B supramolecular preparations make them selectively reactive toward fungal
versus mammalian cell membranes. Three factors which influence the toxicity and
selectivity of AmB preparations will be investigated by spectroscopic and
molecular biology methods: 1) direct membrane activity via ion channel
formation, 2) differences in distribution and delivery to tissues due to
differences in stability of AmB complexes in the presence of serum
lipoproteins/proteins, and 3) initiation of an inflammatory cytokine
response.&lt;br/&gt;
