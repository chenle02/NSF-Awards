Title: Student Mentoring Workshop at ICFP 2015

A Student Mentoring Workshop is being organized as part of the 20th
International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), one of the premier
conferences in the area of programming languages. The conference will be held in
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This grant will support approximately 15
students to attend the mentoring workshop plus the ICFP conference. This
proposal is intended specifically to target women students and students from
underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent
residents. The broader significance and importance of the grant relate to the
need to broaden participation, provide opportunities for students to receive
mentoring from leading members of the programming languages community, and build
the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this
important research arena.
