This action funds Michael Witek of Northwestern University to conduct a research
project, entitled "Analyzing seismic noise to understand the structure of the
Earth's crust," during the summer of 2012 at Pukyong National University in
Busan, Yeongnam, South Korea. The host scientist is Dr. Tae-Seob Kang.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is an increased knowledge of the
crust that would improve basement rock maps and resolve the locations of
aquifers and economically important minerals. Better crustal models allow
computational seismologists to better predict ground shaking and wave
characteristics in the study region. Work on ambient noise analysis and Korean
crustal structure would be an important contribution in continual efforts to
separate the effects of mantle structure from the effects of crustal structure,
thereby increasing the resolving power of vertically varying structures.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
