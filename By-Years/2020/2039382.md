Neuromatch Academy (NMA) is an online summer school that will train about 7,000
neuroscientists in modern data science and modeling methods. These methods are
the basis of considerable endeavors in industry and academia, including
neuroscience, robotics, and cognitive modeling. This project will support
student participation and evaluation of the academy.

A central component of the education of neuroscientists is intensive summer
schools, which usually run for two weeks. They are usually expensive, require
travel, and open only to small numbers of participants. NMA aims to provide a
three-week summer school in an online fashion providing outstanding quality of
education. It uses teaching-assistant-led small virtual tutorials (about 10
students each), globally broadcast question and answer sessions through
crowdcast, professor-guided project work, and a host of further approaches to
produce a deep learning experience. Focusing on a tight interactions with other
participants, TAs, and professors give it a unique profile among approaches to
online teaching. In a post-COVID world, innovating in online education is of
crucial importance and NMA has both a strong mission of innovation and a strong
evaluation plan to make sure it delivers on its promise. The evaluation approach
will consists of questionnaires sent to participants, TAs, and lecturers as well
as a causal analysis to see how NMA affects subsequent text use and
collaboration patterns.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
