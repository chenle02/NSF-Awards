&lt;br/&gt;The foci of this research are threefold. First, substructures of
"phenylogous cubic graphite" will be synthesized to afford crystalline materials
that are thermally stable porous solids. Second, hydrogen-bonding and salt-
bridge-forming functional groups will be incorporated into polyphenyl aromatic
molecules to serve as precursors to porous, three-dimensional network solids.
Third, configurationally stable, chiral twisted polyphenyl aromatics will be
synthesized. Crystals of the pure enantiomers of these molecules will contain
chiral cavities, a property very rare in existing porous materials.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Robert A. Pascal of the Department of
Chemistry at Princeton University. Dr. Pascal will focus his work on developing
methodology for the synthesis and characterization of large polyphenyl aromatic
compounds. These molecules have well-defined conformations, large cavities and
great stability. It is projected that some of them will form highly stable,
ordered, porous solids-essentially "hydrophobic zeolites." In terms of broader
impacts, the project has potential for catalysis, separation technologies, and
perhaps medical diagnostics. The project also provides an excellent setting for
the training of graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
