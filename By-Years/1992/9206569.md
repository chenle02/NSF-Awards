In 1986, 1989 and in 1991, the PI conducted Global Positioning System (GPS)
measurements in segments of Iceland, one of the few places on land where one can
study active rifting and rift- transform interactions. From historic data
extending back many centuries, a sequence of M&gt;7 earthquakes is overdue in
south Iceland and current deformation in the region must represent the final
stage of the interseismic cycle. In 1988 a magnitude 5.8 earthquake occurred
within the network, and in 1991 the volcano Hekla erupted displacing nearby
control points by up to 6 cm. Over a broad region the data support a 2 cm/year
shear signal applied to the South Iceland Seismic Zone, consistent with north
Atlantic plate motions; however, the deformation is complex and is poorly
resolved by earlier measurements. New measurements will provide constraints on
the development of shear strain and rift widening in SW Iceland. The partition
of the 2 cm/year budget between these two types of deformation may account for
the observed irregular- ities in volcanism and earthquake sequences in SW
Iceland.
