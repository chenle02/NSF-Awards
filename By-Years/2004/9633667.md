9633667 Menyuk It is proposed to study high-speed, long-distance NRZ
communication systems theoretically and computationally. The focus will be on
studying the physical effects that limit the attainable data rates and distances
in parallel with developing reduced models that allow us to study these systems
more efficiently and over a parameter range than is presently possible. Our work
will be characterized by close cooperation with experimentalists. ***
