Fluid flow in porous media is important in many areas, including oil extraction
and recovery, environmental protection, energy conservation, and the design and
operation of fuel cells, solar cells, and batteries. Development of accurate,
efficient, and reliable numerical schemes to simulate such fluid flow has
received considerable attention in mathematics and engineering communities over
the past decade. However, mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of
fluid flows in heterogeneous media and realistic settings remain a challenge.
Much of the difficulty in porous media flow simulations is due to the
involvement of different length scales, from macroscopic scale to microscopic
scale. This research project aims to develop accurate, efficient, and reliable
numerical algorithms for flows in porous media. Weak Galerkin finite element
methods (WGFEMs) will be developed for flows in highly heterogeneous domains,
porous media, and complex flows in heterogeneous media. The methods under
development are anticipated to significantly advance the utility of numerical
analysis for realistic scientific and engineering applications. Graduate
students are involved in the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to
develop new weak Galerkin (WG) finite element methods (FEMs) with excellent
flexibility in element construction and mesh generation, suited to dealing with
heterogeneous physical parameters. Additionally, it is envisioned that the new
multiscale WGFEMs will be applicable in other fields, such as structural
analysis, electromagnetic wave scattering, image processing, and computer
vision. Collaboration with petroleum industry partners is planned in this
research project.
