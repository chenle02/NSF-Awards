High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) will be introduced as an
analytical tool in the chemistry/biochemistry curriculum. The instrument request
includes a ternary pumping system, data station, and a photo diode array
detector. The HPLC will be used to improve the Honors, Organic, Analytical, and
Biochemistry classes, as well as student research and student projects.
Automated, hyphenated, chromatographic- spectral instruments, such as the HPLC
involved in this project, provide a cost effective way to introduce students to
modern analysis. The special features of this project include development of new
laboratory procedures for instructional use, impact spanning many uses in
courses and undergraduate research, and involvement of a large proportion of
women in the project.
