Towards a neuro-mechanical memory
element&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
project is to explore whether a neuro-mechanical synapse can be formed by
interfacing a neuron cell with a silicon substrate. It is based on our recent
finding that mechanical force applied at a neuromuscular synapse of Drosophila
(fruit fly) embryos produces neuronal memory. This mechano-sensing ability of
neurons is likely rooted in evolutionarily conserved properties of cells. It has
thus the potential to apply to neuro-silico interfaces. The approach to this
goal are: (1) investigate whether mechanically applied tension on a neuron using
a silicon probe can be transduced into information that can be captured, e.g.,
as an image; (2) functionalize the probe to explore whether synapse can be
engineered, and (3) explore whether engineered synapse can attain usage
dependent force sensitive memory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The
study will shed light, for the first time, on whether (and how) nature employs
mechanical tension to store and process information in an analogue fashion. It
then attempts to translate the knowledge to engineer a neuro-mechanical synapse.
If this possibility is realized, it will be a breakthrough in the engineering of
learning and memory into synthetic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact:
This study will lay the foundation for creating networks of synthetic cells that
could learn and remember patterns and share that knowledge with devices and
sensors. The knowledge will be integrated with education through (1) development
of a new course on neuro-mechanics (2) student seminars, (3) hands on teaching
modules at the local Children?s Science Museum, and (4) web page development.
