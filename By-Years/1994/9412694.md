McGinnis 9412694 Electronics assembly represents a significant component of
contemporary manufacturing, and a significant opportunity for improving
competitiveness. The objectives of this study are to clearly identify the key
operating characteristics of electronic assembly that are relevant for process
planning, assess the relevance of current research for the actual operating
situations, assess the readiness of the industry to deploy research results, and
identify opportunities for improving the industry/university collaborative
approach to developing and deploying useful research results in this area. These
objectives will be met by developing an appropriate survey instrument, surveying
manufacturing sites and analyzing the results of the survey in the light of
prior experience. The results of this collaboration will be a published, public-
domain report describing the findings.
