The award funds a non-contacting profilometer to be used in on-going research on
the wear behavior of solid lubricant films on oxide coated disks used for
magnetic information storage. These lubricant films prevent head "crashes" and
consequent information loss during start-up or power loss. Since they cannot be
replenished during the life of the hard disk their wear behavior is critical to
the over-all performance of the disk; and since they are extremely thin and
easily deformed their wear behavior is most readily studied using a high-
resolution, non-contacting optical profilometer such as the instrument funded
under this grant.
