This Workshop will be held in Hilton Head, South Carolina - March 2009.
Workshop: A Workshop on Friction: A Grand Challenge at the interface of Solid
and Fluid Mechanics. A grand challenge lies in the formulation of unified
analysis techniques addressing friction through the momentum/energy transfer and
thermal processes leading to the diversion of useful kinetic energy to parasitic
processes on atomic to continuum scales, irrespective of the media on either
side of the interface.&lt;br/&gt;Improved understanding and modeling of the
multiple origins of friction form a vital component of technologies aimed at
reducing the environmental impact of human development and transportation,
ranging from reduced wear, noise and/or vibration, increased transmission
efficiency, turbulent skin friction reduction for increased vehicle efficiency,
improved models and control of pollutant dispersion by atmospheric winds in
urban ?rough? environments to advanced understanding of environmental physics
and climate phenomena such as ice-field development and glacier melting.
