Acyclic diene metathesis polymerization was demonstrated late in 1988 by the
authors using metathesis catalysts free of Lewis acids (Schrock's catalyst).
Aliphatic and aromatic homo- and copolymers have thus been made. Monomer
structure/reactivity relationships have been established; and unsaturated
polymers containing functional groups have been prepared, including unsaturated
polyethers, polyketones, polyesters, polycarbonates, and polycarbosilanes. An
air-stable metathesis catalyst and oligomers of metal-containing polymers have
been prepared. In this research, the polymer chemistry associated with the
reaction will be explored by evaluating the influence of nitrogen- and sulfur-
containing functional groups; and by synthesizing chiral polymers, more
elaborate silicon-containing polymers, and perfectly functionalized telechelic
oligomers. Attempts will be made to advance this research by synthesizing
tailored catalyst systems possessing a high degree of thermal stability. This
Materials Synthesis and Processing grant is jointly funded by the Division of
Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry.
