This project is concerned with studying methods of prediction based on the
likelihood function alone. Determining the extent to which these predictive
likelihoods may be sensibly used and the extent to which they may be inerpreted
as pivotals is an important theoretical objective of this project. The close
connection between these likelihoods and the parametric likelihoods allows for a
study of the interrelationship between predictivism and estimation from a
likelihood perspective. Prediction or forecasting is useful and important in all
areas of science and is often the underlying reason for formulating and fitting
statistical models in the first place. This research addresses the question of
how a predictive likelihood should be extracted from an assumed statistical
model.
