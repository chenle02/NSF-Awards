The purpose of this work is to develop a new, experimentally verifiable method
to predict opssible motion instabilities of suspension or cable-stayed bridges
in a strong turbulent wind environment. Random vibration mathematical methods
will be used, including in the analysis the treatment of buffeting and self-
excited loads as random processes. Linear and non-linear fluid/structure
interaction models will be considered together with evaluation of their
applicability to diverse structural forms. The results will be compared with
experimental data from many sources.
