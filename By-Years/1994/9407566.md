A wide variety of hydrocarbons are emitted into the atmosphere from both
natural and anthropogenic sources. Isoprene (2-methyl- 1,3-butadiene) is of
particular interest because it has the largest global flux of any single
hydrocarbon species with the possible exception of methane, Isoprene reacts
rapidly with hydroxyl radical (OH) and ozone (O3) in the presence of NOx forming
3-buten-2 one( methyl vinyl ketone, MVK) and 2-methyl-2-propenal (methacrolein,
MACR). Once formed, tropospheric MVK and MACR, as well as many other hydrocarbon
oxidation products, may undergo a variety of reactions in the gas phase. It is
likely that MVK, MACR and other hydrocarbon oxidation products can also
partition into atmospheric water drops and undergo subsequent aqueous-phase
reactions leading to the formation of peroxyl radicals (HO2/RO2) and other
oxidant species, and there by, consuming MVK and MACR. Peroxyl radicals can
destroy tropospheric O3 and form peroxides that rapidly oxidize sulfur dioxide
(SO2) in the aqueous phase. The sulfate aerosol that is subsequently formed
efficiently backscatters incoming solar radiation and exerts a significant
cooling effect upon climate. These researchers therefore will study: 1)
partitioning of MVK, MACR and other hydrocarbon oxidation products from the gas
phase into water, 2) aqueous-phase photochemistry of MVK, MACR, and other
hydrocarbon oxidation products under conditions that are typical of atmospheric
water drops, and 3) aqueous-phase reactions of MVK, MACR and other hydrocarbon
oxidation products with selected photochemical oxidants.
