An organization, the Circumpolar Education Clearinghouse, will be established
to link educators and organizations concerned with the education of native
northern peoples into a network for the exchange of information and other
educationally useful activities. Initial participants in the Clearinghouse will
be from the United States, Canada, Greenland, and the Scandinavian countries.
The Clearinghouse, including its library, will be headquartered in the Alaska
Native Foundation in Anchorage. The Education and Resources Group in Boston will
also utilize its facilities and some staff members to support the project.
Program components include establishment of the Curriculum Library, a semiannual
newsletter, a conference in Alaska in 1990, and visits by Canadian, Greenlandic
and Sami educators to Alaskan schools. National Science Foundation (NSF) funding
will primarily be used to improve science and mathematics instruction in the
elementary and secondary schools of rural Alaska. Cost sharing by the partners
will total 89% of the NSF funding.
