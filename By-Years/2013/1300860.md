The research objective of this award is to utilize the swelling-induced
deformations of soft mechanical structures to dynamically shape materials.
Adaptive structures that can bend and fold in an origami-like manner provide
advanced engineering opportunities for deployable structures, soft robotic arms,
mechanical sensors, and rapid-prototyping of 3D elastomers. Swelling is a robust
approach to structural change as it occurs naturally in humid environments, and
can easily be adapted into industrial design. Studies conducted under this award
will identify the materials-defined length scales that dictate the mechanical
response of a swelling structure. The swelling-structure interactions will be
coupled with appropriate materials to controllably morph structures into a
desired shape. The incorporation of polymerizable swelling materials will allow
these complex shapes to be permanently fixed, thereby controlling the morphology
of structures across many length scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A successful
study will have broad implications for hierarchical manufacturing. The knowledge
gained from these efforts will further the fundamental mechanical understanding
of transient swelling-induced deformations, while developing a methodology for
the permanent morphing of three-dimensional soft structures. This research will
support the involvement of a strong, creative Ph.D. candidate, as well as
academically driven undergraduate researchers. In addition to impacting
education at the university level, this project will develop an innovative
program to introduce local high school students to mechanics-driven phenomena.
The program will use high-speed photography to show students the world of fast-
moving science, and use this technology to study Newton's laws of motion.
