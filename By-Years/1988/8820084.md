The Tasman orogenic belt of eastern Australia includes the Lachlan fold belt on
the west and the New England fold belt on the east. There are a number of
orogenic models for these areas including thick-skinned tectonics involving
basement rocks and thin-skinned tectonics involving thrust belt telescoping. The
north coast of Tasmania exposes a cross-section of the Tasman orogenic belt,
including basement exposures and thus provides an ideal location to test the
various hypotheses. This project will study the structural geometry and rock
fabrics along a 110 km geotraverse on the north coast of Tasmania in conjunction
with investigators at Monash University, Victoria, Australia. Results will help
constrain mechanical modelling of terrane accretion processes for Tasmania and
Victoria. Results are also important in placing Tasmania in plate tectonic
reconstructions of the Australia-Antarctic continental breakup.
