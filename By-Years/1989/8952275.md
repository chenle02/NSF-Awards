This grant supports enhancement of undergraduate engineering education at
Alabama A&amp;M University, with emphasis on improved laboratory experience in
the civil engineering courses. Equipment is provided for improvement of the
concrete laboratory and fluid/hydraulics laboratory for related courses. In the
concrete laboratory, a 400,000 lbs. compression testing machine is provided so
that large industry-standard concrete specimens can be tested for strength. In
the fluid/hydraulics laboratory, the addition of a glass-sided tilting flume
improves the laboratory experience in this area. As a result, the University, as
a member of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities, is able to produce
an increased number of minority graduates equipped with improved state-of-the-
art engineering know-how. The institution is providing matching funds in an
amount equal to or greater than the funds provided by the Foundation.
