Distributive theories, developed to explain Congressional decision making,
predict that legislatures whose members are elected in single-member district
representational systems will attempt to return policy benefits to their
districts in order to gain re-election. Alternative representational schemes are
predicted to produce alternative types of policy distributions. This project
investigates the connection between the type of election system cities use and
the distribution of capital improvement projects. Using a four city sample, this
research will evaluate the distribution of expenditures in two single-member
district and two at-large electoral systems. Topologically Integrated Geographic
Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) files together with automated Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) software will be used to map the location of capital
improvement expenditures and other critical variables to intra-urban regions.
This project will aid in understanding the policy implications that result from
the choice of electoral systems in U.S. cities. It should also demonstrate the
usefulness of GIS for exploring key hypotheses in urban politics.
