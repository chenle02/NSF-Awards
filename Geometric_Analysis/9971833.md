Abstract

Award: DMS-9971833 Principal Investigator: Guofang Wei

This proposal is concerned with the effect of Ricci curvature and integral
curvature bounds on the local geometric structure and global topology of a
Riemannian manifold. The principal investigator will study (i) deformation of
metrics to positive sectional curvature, (ii) optimal bound of isoperimetric
constant, (iii) the structures of the fundamental groups for manifolds with
pointwise or integral lower Ricci curvature bound, and (iv) structures of
manifolds with bounded weak norm.

Geometric objects such as manifolds appear naturally in science and engineering,
as configuration spaces, as Einsten's model of universe. Ricci curvature is a
fundamental concept in Einstein's general relativity. Thus the fundamental
research in these area should not only be important in its own right but also
should have implications in science and engineering.
