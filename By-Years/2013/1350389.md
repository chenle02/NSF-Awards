This CAREER award will enable the PI, Dr. Anil Seth, to study the formation of
massive black holes and nuclear star clusters through detailed studies of some
of the nearest galaxy nuclei. By combining a wide range of data sets, the PI
will determine the masses of a sample of resolved nuclear star clusters in
nearby galaxies, estimate the masses of a population of nuclear star clusters
out to 10 Mpc, and measure the properties of galaxies that host tidal disruption
event candidates. The work will subsequently address two key questions in our
understanding of galaxy nuclei: (1) how and when do nuclear star clusters form?;
and (2) do lower mass galaxies host supermassive black
holes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also launch an ambitious program to
expand the highly successful night-time astronomy program at Bryce Canyon
National Park. In particular, the PI will (1) create a ranger talk on nearby
galaxies and their nuclei to be used by staff at Bryce, (2) create an astronomy
outreach training program for rangers at other parks nationwide so they can
replicate Bryce's success, and (3) develop a summer internship program for
undergraduate astronomy students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will provide
critical contributions to our understanding of the formation and evolution of
supermassive black holes, as well as the incredibly dense stellar clusters that
lie at the centers of galaxies. It will leverage data from numerous federally
funded astronomy facilities, and link with computational simulations of the
evolution of the universe. Furthermore, the PI's outreach program will extend
beyond Utah and Bryce Canyon to inspire national park visitors across the
country to learn about the night sky.
