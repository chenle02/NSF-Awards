The project will use WOCE and other historical data to develop a quantified
description of the three-dimensional circulation of the Pacific ocean, and its
associated water-property transports and divergences. The observations will
first be examined using classical techniques to deduce an initial estimate of
the circulation; then inverse modeling will be used to produce refined estimates
of the absolute velocity field. In addition, thermo-haline and wind-driven
circulation will be investigated by making comparisons to numerical simulations
and analytical models, quantifying the associated water property transports and
flux divergences, and relating these to air-sea exchanges.
