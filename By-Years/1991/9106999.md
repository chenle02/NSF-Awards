The proposed work will examine locomotory muscle power in living organisms and
apply the findings to extinct reptiles (particularly pterosaurs, but results
will be applicable also to dinosaurs). Preliminary work by the PI has suggested
that some living reptiles possess high-power muscle fibers capable of generating
(during "burst-level" activity) twice the weight- specific contractile power of
avian or mammalian muscles. Since reptiles traditionally have been considered
inferior to endothermic birds and mammals with regard to physiology and
locomotion, this observation is remarkable. The PI now proposes to extend
measurement of locomotory muscle power capacity to a variety of extant reptiles
to determine the generality of his earlier observations. He will then apply the
results to reinterpret the nature of powered flight in pterosaurs. *//
