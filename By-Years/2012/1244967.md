The project creates a cluster of collaborating institutions that combine
students into common Computational Sciences and Engineering (CSE) classes and
uses cyberlearning technologies to deliver instruction. Students also conduct
projects that begin in a summer workshop in Embry-Riddle's Nonlinear Wave Lab
and complete them at their home institution using remote lab access. Because few
small colleges have the resources to provide undergraduate CSE courses, the
project significantly increases student participation in computational science.
The project intends to scale-up by establishing a network of clusters. The
project advances the learning of CSE by using an R&D process to provide a
coherent framework for designing instruction and assessing learning in which the
instructional and assessment methods are aligned with a common idea: Model-based
learning and reasoning. In addition, the educational infrastructure is improved
by establishing a state of the art cyberlearning network that includes a virtual
conferencing system; video communication between multiple endpoints such as PCs
& iPads; automatic recording and archiving of sessions; and remote lab access in
which all operations and measurements in the Nonlinear Wave Lab are remotely
operational and streamed online.
