Abstract CTS-9612676 The proposed project is to investigate heat transfer during
selective laser sintering (SLS) of powdered materials. The SLS technique is
relatively new for rapid prototyping. By selectively heating powders, non-
isothermal sintering of powders would occur and uneven densification would
follow. Because the ultimate shape of the solid is strongly dependent on how the
material consolidates, the densification occurring at the void level affects the
ultimate shape of the macroscale solid. The goal of the project is to understand
the heat transfer process taking place and develop a model to predict the final
shape of the solid. Such a model could us used to predict ways to minimize
unwanted growth and improve manufacturing efficiency. Experiments will be
conducted to grow solids under various non-isothermal conditions. A mathematical
model based on a volume-average formulation will be developed to predict the
shape of the grown solids.
