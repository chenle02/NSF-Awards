Howland will investigate stability and chaos in quantum systems with
Hamiltonians almost periodic in time; existence of scarred wave functions and
resonant states corresponding to unstable periodic orbits of the classical
system; perturbation theory of the multiphoton a.c. Stark effect; and existence
of absolutely continuous spectra in random Schroedinger operators and other
systems. Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a product of the
twentieth century. It is founded firmly in the last century's attempt to address
the microstructure of matter and to come to grips with the concepts of action-
at-a distance, electro-magnetism, and heat radiation. The mathematical
foundations for these developments, collectively called mathematical physics,
ranges from detailed analysis of Schroedinger operators, which governs the
dynamics of particles, to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four
known forces into a single theory.
