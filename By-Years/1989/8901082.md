Floral traits may evolve when pollinators select among variant forms of
flowers. The behavior of animal pollinators can directly influence plant fitness
through preferential visitation. Also, the sequence of pollinator visitation to
the floral morphs in part determines gene flow and the mating structure of the
plant population. Analysis of pollinator behavior in natural populations is
complex, as is extrapolation of the implications of the behavior for the main-
tenance or elimination of the floral polymorphism, and would be greatly
facilitated by an experimental approach with an uncomplex system. The behavioral
response of bee pollinators to a discrete floral pigmentation polymorphism found
in a natural population of Clarkia gracilis subsp. sonomensis will be examined.
The evolutionary implications of this response will be investgated; through
genetic studies of the floral poly-morphism, by computer simulation of the
interaction and resultant changes in floral allele frequencies through time, and
with long-term studies of experimental polymorphic populations. This combined
approach, applied to a system with discrete variation under simple genetic
control, should yield new insights into plant-pollinator interactions and their
evolutionary consequences.
