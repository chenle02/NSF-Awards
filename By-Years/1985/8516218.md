Fundamental research is needed in both the onset of chatter and tool path error,
the two major impediments to burr-free high-speed end-milling in thin rib
machining. Tool path errors will be studied by limiting cutting speed so that
tool/workpiece errors dominate the machine performance. This approach allows a
rational study of tool path errors without the complicating factor of chatter.
Dynamic and static tool path errors in end milling operations will be studied
and an expert system for stochastic error corrections will be developed.
Researchers will also develop and implement control algorithms for a
magnetically suspended spindle that will minimize tool path errors. The models
and algorithms will be experimentally tested and validated on a CNC vertical
machining center fitted with a magnetically suspended spindle.
