PI: Host, George Institution: University of Minnesota Proposal # 9723595 Title:
Hierarchical Parallel Algorithms for Simulating Plant Response to Environmental
Stress Physiologically-based process models are powerful tools for assessing
plant responses to multiple environmental stresses. They capture the intricate
behavior of systems governed by non-linear feedbacks, hierarchical constraints,
and interacting environmental factors. Devising efficient algorithms for
simulating systems defined by thousands of individual elements, however, is a
formidable challenge to computational biology. The investigators are developing
a series of parallel algorithms for managing multiple computational streams to
simulate growth of leaves, stems, and roots over a multi-computer network. Using
the inherent hierarchical nature of plant systems, concurrent physiological
processes logically nested within the three- dimensional architecture of shoot
and root systems.
