Abstract-Gupta The structure of flames is examined under conditions of highly
preheated air using methane or propane as the fuel. Specific matters of interest
include flame stability limits, flame signature, flame radiation and emission-
adsorption spectra, flame temperature, and chemical species within the flame as
affected by air preheat temperature, fuel, and flame equivalence ratio. The
experimental facility uses a pair of regenerative burners which allow the test
section to be maintained at any temperature up to 1800( K; combustion air can be
preheated up to 1300( K, giving a much higher air temperature than in
conventional furnaces. The test section is optically accessible permitting the
use of a number of optical diagnostics. Highly-preheated air combustion offers
many potential advantages but has not been deemed practical up to now. It can
reduce fuel consumption up to 30%, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, reduce
equipment size, and reduce pollutants by 20-30% for a given therm production.
The recirculating system used in this study may be a practical way to exploit
these benefits.
