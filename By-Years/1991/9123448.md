This research is concerned with the dynamics of matrix differential equations
and their applications. The equations are cast in a fairly general framework,
generalizing special instances found in some important numerical algorithms. The
dynamics of each matrix differential equation will be explored via computer
experiments, high resolution graphics and symbolic manipulations, in conjunction
with analysis. The objective is to better understand the dynamics of matrix
differential equations, and to study the closely related questions regarding the
eigenvalues and singular values of specially structured matrices. This study is
expected to find important applications ranging from development of novel
computational algorithms to theoretic solutions of new problems in differential
equations and linear algebra.
