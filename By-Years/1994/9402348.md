9402348 Purdy The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will undertake an ocean
sciences instrumentation development project to design improvements and rebuild
a unique deep-towed sound source called NOBEL (Near Ocean Bottom Explosives
Launcher). NOBEL allows geophysicists to undertake high resolution seismic
experiments at depths of up to 6,000 meters by placing the sound source and
receivers directly on the sea floor rather than having the source in the water
column some distance above the seafloor. This improved capability provides more
detailed determinations to be made of the seismic velocity structure of igneous
and sedimentary features than is possible using conventional seismic equipment.
NOBEL has been used previously with mixed success, but seismic data that were
obtained were of high quality. Design improvements to me made will improve
NOBEL's performance and reliability for a variety of future research projects.
The Office of Naval Research is cost-sharing this project.
