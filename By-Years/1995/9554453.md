Gardner, Principal Investigator Title: "Using ASTER to Improve Math and Science
Accessibility by Students with Learning Disabilities" ABSTRACT Students with
visual processing learning disabilities typically have difficulty understanding
printed materials, and math and technical subjects often present the greatest
difficulties. This project proposes to initiate the first phase in research
designed to develop the most appropriate interface strategies needed to optimize
ASTER and related audio-formatting programs for students with learning
disabilities. ASTER is an innovative computer program developed initially to
present math equations in an audio format for students with visual disabilities.
It is important that students with learning disabilities participate in tests on
ASTER navigation during the developmental phase of this software program.
Commands which might be intuitive to a student who is blind might not be as easy
for a sighted student with a learning disability. Student volunteers from the
pre-algebra course and Adult Basic Education program at Linn Benton Community
College Benton Center will be test subjects in specific experiments conducted to
answer the following questions: (1) What are the most intuitive keystrokes to
select sections to be read on the computer, to browse from section to section,
paragraph to paragraph, etc.? (2) What kind of computer screen display do
students find most helpful? (3) What additional educational features are useful?
This research project is conducted collaboratively with the Science
Accessibility Program at Oregon State University which is improving ASTER as an
aid to better accessibility to math and science written material for students
with various disabilities. Results from this project will be used in future
designs of ASTER. ***
