9502224 Murray This CAREER award emphasizes the use of two-degree-of- freedom
design techniques for generating nonlinear controllers for mechanical systems
performing motion control tasks. Typical applications include high performance
control of piloted aircrafts using vectored thrust propulsion, navigation and
control of unmanned flight vehicles performing surveillance and other tasks,
motion control and stabilization of underwater vehicles , and control of land
based robotic locomotion systems. The nonlinear controller synthesis problem is
initially separated into the design of a feasible trajectory for the nominal
model of the system, followed by regulation around that trajectory using
controllers that have guaranteed performance in presence of uncertainties. New
methods are devised for quickly generating suboptimal trajectories that
accomplish a desired control objective. Educational activities include
development of innovative curriculum in control and dynamical systems, setting
up experimental laboratories for graduate and undergraduate teaching, and
involving undergraduate students in independent research-oriented projects.***
