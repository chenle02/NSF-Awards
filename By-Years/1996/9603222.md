This award supports travel of 9 U.S. participants to a U.S.-France Workshop on
Biochronometry to take place in Lyons, France, March 1997. The co-organizers of
the this workshop are Gene D. Block of the University of Virginia and Director
of the Science and Technology in Biological Timing and Howard Cooper of INSERM,
the French National Institution for Research in Medical Sciences. The central
theme of the workshop is consideration of the physiological and molecular
mechanism underlying the generation and control of circadian rhythms. The
objectives are to: provide a forum to discuss recent scientific results, and 2)
crate an opportunity for U.S. and French investigators to identify common
research interests and plan for collaborative efforts among participating
laboratories.
