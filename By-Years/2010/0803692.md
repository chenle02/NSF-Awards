This workshop will provide a unique platform for experts in the cell/molecular
biology community and the engineering community to get together to identify the
important issues, approaches, and potential future activities in the emerging,
interdisciplinary area between cell/molecular biology and engineering systems.
The workshop builds upon the momentum of recent activities in the biomechanics
area (workshops, summer schools, symposia, etc.), and intends to broaden the
scope of this interdisciplinary area to include other engineering
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The outcome of the workshop may lead to a
coordinated effort in this important, emerging research area, which will have
profound impacts on the well-being of research and education enterprise in the
US. The results of such coordinated research and education activities will have
significant contributions not only to biology and bioengineering, but also to a
wide spectrum of health-related fields such as cancer, cardiovascular and
respiratory disease, and orthopedics. Moreover, such activities will help
produce a new generation of research leaders in this important field in the US
who are interdisciplinary by training.
