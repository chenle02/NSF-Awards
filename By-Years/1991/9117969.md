This award is for support of a project to study the concentration and isotopic
composition of O2, N2, and Ar in ice core trapped gas samples, and to begin a
program of CH4 measurements. The transport of air in the firn, and its
implications for isotopic fractionation during the trapping of gases and the
chronology of ice core trapped gas samples will be studied. Samples from the
Vostok, Byrd Station, and McMurdo Dome ice cores will be studied. Results from
this study will lead to a better understanding of the sequence of events
associated with glaciations and deglaciations, estimates of time leads and lags
between these events, and the implications of this information for mechanisms of
Pleistocene climate change. This work will also contribute to efforts to
understand how man has changed greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere
during the last 200 years.
