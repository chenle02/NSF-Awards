9418206 Fink This award provides funding for fundamental studies of minerals
employing electron energy-loss spectroscopic techniques. The general goal of the
spectrometric studies is to gain an understanding of the bonding and oxidation
state of iron in minerals and of the bonding and structure of crystalline and
opaline silica polymorphs . One important specific objective of the studies is
to determine the feasibility of using electron energy-loss spectroscopy to
measure the ratio of Fe2+ to Fe3+ in silicates with a spatial resolution of
nanometers in a scanning transmission electron microscope fitted with a special
electron detector. Determination of iron oxidation states at the nanometer scale
is not now possible but would be an important step in understanding the
chemistry of minerals and in reconstructing the geological conditions of their
formation. ***
