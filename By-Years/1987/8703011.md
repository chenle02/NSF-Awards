This research will develop and apply new singular perturbation methods to
boundary value problems for nonlinear ordinary differential equations and for
partial integro-differential-difference equations. The results will enable us to
calculate the stationary distribution of fluctuations about, and the rate of
transitions from (deterministically) stable states of dynamical systems subject
to noise. Stochastic integro-differential-difference equations and their
associated forward and backward Kolmogorov equations will also be analyzed. The
research will have direct applications to a variety of problems in science and
engineering. Among them are computer performance evaluation, customer service
queue arrangements, chemical physics, noise induced transitions between stable
configurations of a dynamical system, etc.
