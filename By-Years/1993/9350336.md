This program has two major components: research and teaching in image
processing, both having a focus on three-dimensional data. The research
component is divided into two major thrusts: 1. the development of new methods
for estimating motion in three dimensions from three-dimensional data sets. The
first aim involves optimizing data acquisition methods given a prior stochastic
description of the motion and assuming the use of a certain optical flow method.
The second aim explores the theory of three-dimensional vector tomography and
its implementation using a magnetic resonance scanner. 2. The estimation of
shape from three- dimensional data sets. This topic focuses on active surface
methods: the definition of new active surfaces, the algorithms and their
convergence properties, and the use of active surface methods for 3-D image
registration. The teaching component of this grant has two main objectives: 1.
to develop a state-of-the-art signal and image processing laboratory, and, 2. to
develop new courses and textbooks on image reconstruction. The overall goal is
to provide a comprehensive educational program at the cutting edge of signal and
image processing
