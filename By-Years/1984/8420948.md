This project is directed at the investigation of supercomputers with massive
amounts of physical memory, in the tens of billions of bytes. The hypothesis of
the research is that such machines may change, in fundamental ways, how certain
classes of problems are solved and may lead to orders of magnitude performance
improvements. Efforts are underway to validate experimentally the massive memory
hypothesis, to explore ways to build such a machine in the future, and to
investigate selected algorithmic processes for such designs. The validation
portion of the project will be carried out on a Large Memory Computer (LMC), a
conventional computer with an unconventional but economically feasible amount of
memory (either 128 or 256 MB). The second part of the project will involve the
study of a number of novel architectures for machines with billions of bytes of
memory. A full-scale Massive Memory Machine prototype capable of supporting
billions of bytes of memory will be constructed.
