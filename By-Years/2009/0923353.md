Abstract

The development of terahertz wave air-plasma photonics instrumentation is
crucial for the advanced research of intense broadband THz wave generation and
detection in laser-induced air-plasma, remote THz sensing, and nonlinear THz
spectroscopy. Our proposed instrument will unlock research by exploring the
physical mechanisms for THz generation and detection under extreme conditions
(E-field strength) with unparalleled breadth of frequency bandwidth,
sensitivity, and remote detection capability. A focused optical pulse (mJ pulse
energy and <30 femtosecond pulse duration) in gas creates a plasma, which
produces THz waves in the far field. Using either air-breakdown-coherent-
detection (ABCD) or THz-enhanced-fluorescence (TEF) methods, this plasma can
also detect pulsed THz waves with potential standoff sensing capability.

Intellectual merit: Ambient air, when excited with intense femtosecond laser
beams, exhibits a remarkable ability to generate and detect pulsed THz waves
through an optical nonlinear process. The use of air (or selected gases) as a
broadband THz wave emitter and THz wave sensor provides superior bandwidth (0.1
- 30 THz), sensitivity (heterodyne), resolution (<MHz), and the standoff sensing
capability in atmosphere which was heretofore considered impossible due to water
vapor attenuation.

Broader impact: Our proposed THz air-plasma photonics system will provide a key
instrument that will enable interdisciplinary research and advance numerous THz
wave sensing and imaging developments. This instrument will be one of the major
shared instruments in the THz Center for eleven faculty members, and over 50
students and senior researchers, and will be made available to our national and
international collaborators from around the globe.
