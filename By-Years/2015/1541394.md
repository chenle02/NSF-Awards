Fort Hays State University is upgrading their campus network to support
scientific data transfer needs of researchers in Physics, Informatics,
Geosciences, and the Kansas Academy of Mathematics and Sciences. Activities
include re-architecting the campus border with a design patterned after the
science DMZ concept in campus research and education networking and establishing
10 Gbps connectivity for science data flows.

Scientific research collaborations across campus are enabled by these network
upgrades. Physics faculty and student researchers run multiple simulations
simultaneously to investigate the effect of lasers on human retinal tissue in
collaboration with Kansas State University and the Air Force Research
Laboratory, with the goal of producing safer lasers. Geoscience faculty and
student researchers now access very large data files from the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration in investigating the causes of large, deadly
tornados in Kansas and surrounding states. In addition, they use mortality data
provided by the U. S. Military Academy to correlate anomalous weather events and
mortality. Additionally, investigators are analyzing archived data to establish
the long-term weather trends in Kansas to document how global weather changes
are affecting Kansas. Informatics faculty and students have created a big data
(Hadoop) platform that is being used to mine vast quantities of unstructured
data located across the Internet to assist Geoscience and Informatics research.
Kansas Academy of Math and Science (an early college entrance STEM program)
students are now using LandSat imagery data for their research projects.
Informatics researchers use the expanded reach and improved network monitoring
tools to test more advanced network protocols. The results of these experiments
will be shared in publications, conferences, FHSU workshops, and archived in a
data repository.
