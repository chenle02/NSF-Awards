This project provides for changes and enhancements throughout the digital and
computer engineering series of courses. The changes range from additions of
programmable logic design experiments at the introductory level to major changes
in the area of microprocessor design. The changes include a focus on high level
languages and carefully structured top down design, and use of a detailed
graphical simulation of the operation of a microprocessor. A new topic in real
time programming is also being included. Equipment being acquired includes a
number of Macintosh computers, some field programmable gate array development
systems, and appropriate peripheral equipment.
