Diverse populations of low molecular weight RNAs, found in both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic organsims, have been shown to play important roles in a wide variety
of cellular processes including DNA replication, RNA transcription and
processing, and mRNA translation. This laboratory's research efforts are focused
on the structure and function of one such small nuclear RNA designated snRNA
U14. This evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic lmwRNA species possesses a
conserved ability to intermolecularly base-pair with 18s ribosomal RNA.
Molecular and cellular characterization of mouse and Xenopus U14 as well as
genetic analysis of yeast U14 strongly indicate a role in eukaryotic rRNA
synthesis and/or processing. Recent experiments have quite surprisingly revealed
the positioning of the mouse and Xenopus U14 genes within intron 5 of the
constitutive-expressed cognate hsc70 heat shock gene, a unique genomic
organization for an snRNA. The experiments outlined in this investigation will
examine the synthesis, structure, and function of eukaryotic snRNA U14. The
biosynthetic pathway responsible for U14 biogenesis defined. The synthesis and
cellular distribution of U14 will be studied in both normally and abnormally
growing cells. U14's role in rRNA processing as well as possible involvement in
the heat shock/stress response will be examined. Finally, structural studies
will define an evolutionarily conserved U14 secondary structure, determine those
U14/18s rRNA sequences involved in intermolecular hybridization, and
characterize the U14-associated proteins of a putative U14 ribonucleoprotein
complex. Results from these studies will lead to a better understanding of the
structure/function relationships of this unique and evolutionarily important
eukaryotic lmwRNA.***//
