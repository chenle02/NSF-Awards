Under an Engineering Research Equipment Grant, a wave generator and necessary
controls will be added to an existing experimental capability which produces
droplets in a stream of much greater uniformity in size and speed than
previously attainable. The new spray formation technique depends on the
achievement of a precisely controlled time dependent fluctuation pressure near
the spray nozzle exit. The utility of the controlled droplet stream is in the
manufacture of net form high quality precision components, whit molten metal
droplets deposited and rapidly solidified to form the final shape.
