The recently discovered protonic photoconductivity (PC) in ice is to be
investigated to determine the type of charge carriers, their mobility and the
activation energy of their motion. The analysis will be supported by theoretical
calculations of the energy spectra of electrons and of the intrinsic protonic
charge carriers (ions and Bjerrum defects). These studies combined with photo-
and thermo-luminescence will be used to ascertain the electronic transitions
involved and provide a physical mechanism for the PC in ice.
