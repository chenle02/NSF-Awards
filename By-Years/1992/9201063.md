Drs. Enrico Quarantelli and Joanne Nigg, University of Delaware, and
Academician Konstantin Popov, Institute for System Studies, Moscow will
cooperate in a seminar on social science research on mitigation and recovery
from disasters and large Scale Hazards in Moscow in June 1992. Ten American
scientists will travel to Moscow to join the ten Russian scientists in
discussing, comparing and evaluating existing knowledge and research findings as
developed by both groups with the idea of developing a research agenda for
mutually beneficial future study collaboration. The meeting will have the
immediate effect of strengthening the disaster research tradition within the two
countries which are already among the leaders in the area. Indirectly, it should
accelerate the development of an international network of disaster researchers
which has started to come into being in the last decade. American participants
drawn from nine universities around the country will represent six different
disciplines; the Soviet participants are from different research divisions in
different parts of the country. Recent changes in the political climate allow a
freer exchange of information about research results and the initiation of
collaborative research projects which could contribute significantly to the
development of social science knowledge about disasters and its application to
the practical planning for and managing of hazardous occasions. This project
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading researchers in the United States and Russia to combine complementary
efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in
the field of basic scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity,
and mutuality of benefit.
