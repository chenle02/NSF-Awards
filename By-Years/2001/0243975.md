0243975 Varde&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a three-year Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Michigan. The
program will provide meaningful research opportunities for eight undergraduates
in mechanical engineering for a ten-week period each summer. The program's
research focus is on improving exhaust emissions systems; assessing alternative
fuel utilization in engines; using computer models to predict engine performance
and validation through experiments; and understanding complex engine combustion
processes and impact on engine performance. Students involved in experimental
projects will be exposed to and have opportunities to use some of the modern
instrumentation in combustion and engine research. The program addresses
important and timely issues in pollutant emission control and
alternative/efficient energy usage. Students will participate in seminars on
ethics and the values of ethics in research. The primary goal of the program is
to provide a meaningful research experience to undergraduate students in
preparation for research careers in engineering. Students will be recruited from
colleges and universities across the United States, with directed efforts at
attracting students from population groups underrepresented in research fields
in engineering in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;
