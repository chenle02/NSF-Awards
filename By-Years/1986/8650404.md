The methods of cell fractionation and macromolecule purification and the
subsequent detailed analysis which they make possible are essential for future
biologists to comprehend and practice. The acquisition of an ultracentrifuge and
two rotors significantly enhances the ability of Skidmore's Department of
Biology to teach these key concepts in cell and molecular biology. The
ultracentrifuge makes possible a series of laboratory experiments to purify
organelles (e.g. golgi, microsomes) or macromolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins) for
further characterization by biochemical and structural methods -- experiments
that were not possible without the instruments secured through this grant. The
new equipment considerably expands and updates the laboratory experience of the
students, improving their understanding of cell structure and function, the
molecular basis of cell function, and current research techniques. Courses from
the sophomore to senior level are being affected.
