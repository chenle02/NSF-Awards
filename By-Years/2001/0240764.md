The National Science Foundation has funded several comprehensive multi-user
databases on the attributes of judges who have served on the U.S. Courts of
Appeals and District Courts. No precise analog exists for the U.S. Supreme
Court. The only existing electronic database on justices of the Supreme Court
(United States Supreme Court Justices Biographical Data, 1789-1958) does not
include any justices appointed or nominated after 1958 and, owing to various
other limitations, is far less informative and useful to researchers than the
existing lower court data bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal fills this
void by creating a multi-user, public database containing a wealth of
information on individuals nominated (whether confirmed or not) to the U.S.
Supreme Court. Specifically, the database will include 238 variables, falling
roughly into 5 categories: identifiers, background characteristics and personal
attributes, nominations, service on the Court, and departures from the bench.
The PI's will announce its completion on pertinent listservs, archive it with
the ICPSR, as well as on various web sites. It will be available in multiple
electronic forms (as SPSS, Stata, ASCII, and Excel files) and in several formats
(one, largely alpha; the other, largely numeric) thereby increasing its
accessibility to scholarly, policy, and journalistic communities.&lt;br/&gt;
