9614970 Burchfiel This project involves a four-year multi-disciplinary study of
the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau that will integrate space geodetic
(GPS) measurements, field geologic and geomorphic studies, topographic and
isostatic analyses, and geodynamic modeling. The goal is to improve
understanding of the processes responsible for the development of the Tibetan
plateau and, more generally, the processes responsible for distributed
continental deformation. The study builds on the results of the current
principal investigator's work along the eastern margin of the plateau, with a
new focus on the morphological development of the plateau. In broadest terms,
they seek answers to such fundamental questions as: What is the active strain
(velocity) field within eastern Tibet and its foreland? When did it develop?
What was the prior distribution of strain and deformation along the eastern
plateau? How and when did the current morphology of eastern Tibet develop? How
does the distribution of active strain compare to current plateau morphology?
