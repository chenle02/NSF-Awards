The PI's request funding to purchase 1)a CHN autoanalyzer with autosampler
capabilities and 2) a coulometrics-based total carbon analysis system. The
instruments will be operated as shared-use instruments available to researchers
at the University. They will support a wide variety of NSF-funded research in
oceanography and marine sciences including biology, chemistry, geology and
biogeochemistry. The University is providing one third of the costs as matching
funds. //
