9452558 Faulk The purpose of this proposal is to obtain funding for the
establishment of a Production Planning and Control Laboratory. The laboratory's
principal purpose will be to provide support for a three semester-hour, senior
level university course of the same name. Many universities, community colleges,
and technical institutes have such a course but without a laboratory component.
The authors of this proposal intend are convinced that production planning and
control must be practiced in a laboratory as well as taught on a lecture basis.
A secondary purpose is to obtain equipment to be used as the basis for further
instruction in the subject of computer-controlled machining.
