This project is to use statistical simulations of geomagnetic secular
variations and reversals to assess what contributions paleomagnetic data can
make to our understanding of the geomagnetic field. A high priority in this work
is to extend Constable and Parker's Giant Gaussian Process (GGP) model for the
statistics of the geomagnetic secular variation to incorporate other secular
variation models into a more general framework. This involves making predictions
about expected VGP and field dispersion as a function of latitude for comparison
and available paleomagnetic data. Intensity measurements will also be used to
refine the model. Simulations will be used to assess the effects of different
types of remanence acquistion on paleomagnetic records. An important feature in
the GGP model is the time constants associated with variations in the field. It
may well be that, along with the variance, these are the most useful parameters
that paleomagnetists can provide for dynamo theoreticians.
