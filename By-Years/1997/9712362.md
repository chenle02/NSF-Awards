The goal of this project is the improvement of the implemented and available
software for solution of a variety of matrix computation problems, including
solution of systems of parameterized linear equations, solution of systems of
linear equations over a polynomial function domain, matrix normal form
computations, and determination of matrix similarity and equivalence. Such tools
are a heavily used portion of computer algebra packages such as Maple,
Mathematica, and Magma. Also they are relevant to custom large scale
applications. The research will focus on (1) algorithm design, (2) parallel and
distributed implementation, and (3) use of heuristics. An explicit goal of this
work is to provide implementations that are directly usable by the scientific
community. Such implementations will include stand-alone portable codes and code
to be included in the libraries of one or more of the generally available
computer algebra systems. In this sense this work will enhance the problem
solving environments available for scientific and engineering computation.
