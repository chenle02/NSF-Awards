In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Science Program in the
Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professor Ching-Hua Huang
of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta seeks to better understand
peroxy acids (POAs) as emerging disinfectants and oxidants to replace chlorine
in wastewater treatment facilities. Despite the growing interest and pilot- to
full-scale implementation of POAs in wastewater treatment, the understanding
POAs trails behind their applications. The objective of this project is to
provide a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of POAs in water. This
project has multiple broader impacts. It establishes an active collaboration
with industry partners in evaluating on-going field tests of POA-based
processes. The research enhances graduate and undergraduate student education by
promoting the participation of underrepresented groups. The new knowledge and
improved POAs-based technology benefits society by providing in safe water
treatment technology, clean water and sanitation, and smart water management.
All of the applications protect human health and the
ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual contribution of this study is
to provide new fundamental knowledge on the chemistry of POAs and their radical-
based advanced oxidation processes. Such processes may effectively destroy water
pollutants. Specific research aims include: investigating the chemical oxidation
of organic micropollutants, biomolecules and structurally representative
compounds by POAs; characterizing the ultraviolet (UV)/POA process;
investigating the degradation of organic micropollutants and biomolecules under
UV/POA; assessing the water matrix effect on the POA and UV/POA processes;
developing kinetic modeling for the POA and UV/POA processes; and performing
quantum chemical evaluation of oxidation reactions by POAs and UV/POA. The new
knowledge improves the POA and UV/POA technologies.
