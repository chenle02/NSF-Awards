This project will investigate the concept of program checking, which is a
technique for gaining confidence in the output of a program. The traditional
alternatives to program checking are program verification, which is hard to do,
and program testing, which does not provide mathematical guarantees. Program
checking strikes a healthy compromise--designing a checker for a problem is only
as difficult as designing an algorithm for it, but checking provides precise
guarantees about output correctness. One of the major goals will be to design
checkers for problems which are currently solved by unproven heuristics. Also,
efficient and practical checkers will be implemented for problems in scientific
computing, with special emphasis on checking software packages for linear
programming, problems in linear algebra, and ordinary and partial differential
equations. The other major thrust of this research will be to explore the
implications to program checking of new results on the related concepts of
interactive proofs and random self reducibility. Among the questions considered
here will be whether the satisfiability problem is checkable. Writing a checker
as part of designing software may become standard practice in the near future,
and this research aims to understand the foundations of program checking.//
