This project builds on three years of investigation on the effects of grazer-
algae interactions and predator-grazer-algae interactions in north temperate
streams to ask fundamental questions about the influence of grazing fishes
(Campostoma) on biotic communities and ecosystem-level processes or rates in
stream systems. The previous research demonstrated a link between predatory
fishes that influenced distributions of the algae-grazing minnows, which in turn
has strong effects on disribution and kinds of attached algae. The previous
research also suggested that grazing by Campostoma could have a direct influence
upon the taxa of algae that dominated Ozark stream substrates, maintaining a
"lawn" of primary productivity, and changes in kinds of algae could influence
phenomena such as nitrogen fixation, C:N ratios, or bacterial flora. This
research tests, through a combination of laboratory and field manipulations, the
hypothesis that grazing fishes have prevasive effects throughout the structure
and function of temperate stream ecosystems. Fish have largely been overlooked
as grazers in north temperate streams. The present study will use laboratory
stream comparisons of Campostoma to a variety of invertebrate taxa with regard
to strength of grazing effects upon system phenomena.
