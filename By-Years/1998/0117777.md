Digital Government: A Workshop promoting Agency-Research institution
interaction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together the grantee
researchers in the Digital Government program who are working in areas related
to the collection, maintenance, delivery and use of statistical data. Attendees
will include researchers and agency employees and upper-level managers. The
research technologies developed under theses grants in their first year or two
will be demonstrated and there will be an opportunity to discuss mechanisms for
transitioning these laboratory technologies to operational production at the
participating agencies. In addition, participants will discuss and bring up to
date a research agenda for work on information technologies in statistical
settings&lt;br/&gt;
