Engineering at the University of Virginia will purchase Optical Instrumentation
for Spectral Transmission and Reflection Measurements. The requested optical
equipment will be used in conjunction with a new and unique measurement
technique which accounts for optical interference in thin films and allows us to
obtain much more accurate values of optical constants. This equipment will be
used together with field effect characterization equipment which we already
have. This will allow us, for the first time, to perform field effect and
optical studies on the same samples of amorphous silicon and establish the
nature and distribution of localized states in amorphous silicon as well as the
changes in this distribution under voltage stress and external conditions. Such
a study is very important for improving the stability of amorphous silicon Thin
Film Transistors which determines the stability and quality of Active Matrix
Liquid Crystal Displays widely used in modern computer equipment and consumer
electronics. It is also important for understanding both unique material
properties of amorphous silicon and the TFT device physics.
