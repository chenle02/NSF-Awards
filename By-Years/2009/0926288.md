The primary goal of this proposal is to provide integrated undergraduate
research projects at the interface of biology and mathematics to produce
graduates ready for rigorous interdisciplinary graduate studies and career
opportunities. Our program focuses on investigating critical problems at the
intersection of mathematics and the biological sciences, creating new knowledge,
and advancing the fields. Each year, eight students will work in
interdisciplinary teams with biological and mathematical science professors to
conduct research on topics that include animal behavior, population genetics,
demography, and community ecology. Participants will present their work at
regional, national and international STEM meetings.

UNCG recognizes the importance of producing 21st-century graduates with broad,
interdisciplinary scientific training. The faculty mentors have strong histories
of productively involving undergraduate students and at least 30% of
participants will hail from groups under-represented in STEM fields. This math-
biology initiative is of regional importance because 92% of UNCG students are
from North Carolina, many from rural areas with traditionally little access to
science and technology.
