It is proposed to make pump-probe picosecond measurements on molecular defects
in crystalline, polymeric and glassy solids throughout the infrared region of
the spectrum with an infrared- tunable picosecond laser system. The ability to
tune to infrared vibrational transitions will make possible the first systematic
investigation of energy transfer processes while the entire solid remains in the
electronic ground state. Funds are requested for the Cornell Far Infrared
Laboratory to purchase a laser system which generates high intensity infrared
pulses with wavelengths tunable from 1.5 microns to 8 microns. This system
consists of a high-energy mod-locked neodymium yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG)
laser, part of whose output is doubled in frequency and used to pump a set of
picosecond dye laser stages. Infrared radiation is then generated by mixing the
dye laser output with the fundamental of the Nd:YAG laser in a nonlinear
crystal.
