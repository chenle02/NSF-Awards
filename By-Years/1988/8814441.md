The work involves: (1) improving the processing techniques to obtain optimum
composition of superconductors based on Bi2Sr3- xCaxCu209- , (2) understanding
the structural, superconducting and magnetic properties of this material, and
(3) determining the feasibility of isolating the material the exhibits a Tc of ~
110K from the one that exhibits a Tc of ~ 90K.
