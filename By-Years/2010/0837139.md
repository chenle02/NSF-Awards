This project continues efforts to expand understanding of effective instructor
to student and student peer to peer discourse in large lecture-style survey
science classes using Pocket PCs and laptops. This is being done by conducting
applied experiments in two different undergraduate courses in two institutions
with very different student demographic profiles. The courses are "extreme
weather" and "computer-aided design." The experiments are measuring the effect
of varying intensities of peer to peer and instructor to peer interactions
during class time, and also of different degrees of requiring students to engage
in meta-cognitive exercises related to their learning outcomes. This has broad
implications for improving the effectiveness of instructor use of personal
response systems. The planned experiments are state of the art and build on a
solid base of prior research.
