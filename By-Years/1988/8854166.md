The Bowdoin Summer Institute on Microscale Organic Undergraduate Laboratory
Techniques is designed to assist 30 faculty who will undertake this type of
laboratory approach by introducing them to the experimental methods involved.
The 1- week institute is organized around a framework of lecture-
demonstrations, laboratory exercises and informal group discussions of
microscale techniques. Laboratory experience will be emphasized, with particular
attention paid to manipulative procedures involved in preparation, isolation,
purification and characterization of reaction products at the milligram level.
In addition to the NSF funds, participants' institutions will contribute about
25% in travel costs to the operation of the project. The grantee institution
will contribute another 5%
