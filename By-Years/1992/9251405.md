An integrated computer-assisted learning environment in being established in the
chemistry, mathematics and computer science, and physics departments to
encourage development of students' scientific and mathematical modeling skills,
and facility for transferring concepts and tools between disciplines. The
primary emphasis is on coordinated development of curriculum changes and
computer exercises designed to develop student skills in analysis and synthesis
of models having multi- disciplinary applications, and with approaches
integrating symbolic, graphic, and numeric methods. Derive, Maple and
Mathematica are being incorporated into coursework as a common technology base
for the sciences. The project employs a wide area network of PC's organized into
three laboratories. Working cooperatively on this project, the three departments
are developing and implementing the concept of computer-aided integration of the
sciences through common abstraction and modeling techniques.
