9351745 Williams An undergraduate astronomical observatory is the focus of an
upper division laboratory course that will accompany an intro- ductory astronomy
lecture course for science and engineering majors. The observatory will also be
used for undergraduate honors research projects and finally will provide the
students in the liberal arts astronomy course firsthand experience of the
phenomena, tools, and methods of modern astronomy. The observatory will be
centered around a 20-inch telescope, equipped with a CCD solid-state imaging
camera and a grating spectrograph. Computerized image display and processing
facilities will be used to examine and analyze the data acquired at the
telescope. the equipment and techniques of modern research astronomy will be
emphasized in order to give the students an appreciation of the way observations
are really performed. The larger goal of the laboratory course, beyond improving
the understanding of the material covered in the lecture course, is to introduce
students to both the power and the pitfalls of using modern instrumentation and
computers to collect, manipulate, and understand information. Projects will
include measuring the masses of planets in our solar system, determining the
physical properties of stars and nebulae, measuring the ages and distances of
star clusters in our galaxy, and determining the redshifts of distant galaxies,
among other topics. The project aims to use the appeal of the astronomical
observatory to reach out to a diverse group of students and to thus introduce
them to the methods, power, and limitations of modern science. ***
