Increasingly, academic institutions across the country are employing Broader
Impacts Specialists (BISs) to help Principal Investigators address the NSF
Broader Impacts (BI) criterion. The Intellectual Merit of this proposal is a
workshop for BISs to discuss how to better design BI activities. The goal is to
establish the framework for a community of practice, that is, the enculturation
of training of BISs, the advocacy and the evaluation of BIS-designed activities
and the support of the BIS community. The 2014 Broader Impacts Infrastructure
Summit seeks engagement between the NSF and the BIS community, sharing of best
practices, and proposes organizing a national network of BISs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of the summit are an increased
understanding of the BI criterion and how BISs, especially those at Historically
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs),
and within EPSCoR jurisdictions, can create better BI activities and increased
engagement by researchers. Activities in the workshop will highlight the
contributions BISs and will include participants from HBCUs, MISs and EPSCoR
jurisdictions.
