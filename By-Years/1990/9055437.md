This project will train fifty sixth grade science teachers to emphasize
physical science investigations in their curriculum. The teachers will
participate in a three-year program to improve their knowledge of physical
science and their ability to teach this subject through inquiry. Two groups,
consisting of 25 participants each, will be involved in a summer session where
they will take part in laboratory activities, demonstrations, science and
societal issue analysis, the study of technological applications, field
experiences, seminars, and the review of instructional programs. The teachers
will then implements such activities, analyze their teaching, and gather
attitudinal and achievement data pertaining to their students. The evaluation of
the project will be based upon the extent to which it helps sixth-grade science
teacher implement inquiry-oriented science programs. The cost sharing for the
project will be thirty-seven percent of the NSF portion.
