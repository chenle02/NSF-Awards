The Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP), at the Santa Barbara campus
of the University of California (UCSB), serves the diverse goals of theoretical
physics via a unique mode of operation and structure. The visiting researcher
programs, associated conferences, and various outreach activities form a
resource for theoretical physicists at all stages in their research careers. The
primary goal is to promote scientific progress by bringing together accomplished
researchers for sufficient time to form new collaborations and to carry out
substantive research that will lead in new directions. With essential input in
the planning and implementation of its research programs from the community, the
KITP responds to new scientific opportunities, encourages transformational
research, and promotes diversity by ensuring broad representation. The programs,
which attract select groups of participants from institutions worldwide, are
designed to enhance interaction and collaboration among participants in order to
stimulate the vibrant, creative thinking that leads to insight and significant
scientific progress. This award is cofunded by the Division of Physics, the
Division of Materials Research, and the Division of Astronomical Sciences within
the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
