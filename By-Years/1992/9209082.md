In conjunction with the Public Agenda Foundation, The Business-Higher Education
Forum has created a unique public- information campaign, "Crisis in the Work
Force: Help Wanted." The campaign's goals are to help the American people better
understand the links between inadequate workforce skills and declining
competitiveness--and from there to do something to address the problem in their
own communities. Citizens will have a chance to be involved in recommendations
to develop a scientifically and technically literate workforce. Funds will be
spent on research, development of a strategy and materials. The campaigns will
be conducted with active participation of local TV stations, radio stations,
newspaper and Forum members. The campaigns are directed specifically to the
general public and the importance of being scientifically/technically literate.
