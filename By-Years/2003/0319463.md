This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop new manufacturing methods to fabricate photonic devices using the native
oxide of InAlGaAs. The Phase I objective is to develop water-vapor thermal
oxidation of InAlGaAs for the fabrication of photonic devices. A study of the
oxidation properties InAlGaAs will be performed to establish the necessary
control of oxidized structures for both vertical and lateral oxide applications.
A process model for InAlGaAs oxidation will be developed for the oxidation rate
as a function of temperature, gas flow, and Al composition. Both lateral and
vertical oxidation rates and oxide quality will be investigated for variations
with material thickness, molar composition, and heterointerface effects.
Prototype oxide-based photonic structures will be fabricated and delivered in
Phase I. In Phase II the technology will be extended to investigate the effects
of mixed carrier gas using water vapor and oxygen oxidation. In addition,
oxidation variation with n- and p-type doping concentration will be studied and
fundamental material analysis will be performed. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, photonic components with increased levels of optical
integration are needed for fiber optic communications. Currently, devices are
produced using etch and/or epitaxial regrowth technologies that are difficult to
manufacture or increase the surface area of devices near p-n junctions. The
significance of the innovation in this proposal is to study and develop InAlGaAs
oxidation as a practical technique for manufacturing planar photonic integrated
components. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
