This project will carry out theoretical calculations of intermediate energy
electroweak processes in light nuclei with the aim of obtaining new information
on the symmetry properties of nucleon-nucleon interactions. Parity violating
asymmetry in polarized electron-deutron scattering will be studied and also
neutrino-deutron scattering will be investigated. Further work will be done on
photo and electro- reactions on helium inspired by recent experimental
measurements.
