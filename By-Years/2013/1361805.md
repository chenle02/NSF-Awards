This planned center site at the University of Alabama - Birmingham (UAB) for the
I/UCRC for Health Organization Transformation (CHOT) intends to focus on the
evaluation of health care delivery innovations, such as information technology,
care coordination, and facility design strategies with the ultimate goal of
generating knowledge that may result in efficient, high-quality care that is
patient-centered and equitable. Our research activities align well with the
proposed focus of the UAB CHOT site, and can be organized into seven domains: 1)
information technology, 2) care coordination, 3) facility design, 4) efficiency,
5) quality of care, 6) patient-centeredness, and 7) equity. The new site plans
to expand on CHOT's existing capacity, extend the geographic reach of the CHOT
in the Southeast, and broaden the types of industry partners involved in
CHOT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With health care costs in the U.S. reaching nearly
18% of GDP in 2011, and projections of this rate increasing to 20% by 2020, the
need to identify ways to "bend the cost curve" has never been more critical. It
is important to develop meaningful and multi-disciplinary partnerships between
academic institutions and industry partner to yield innovative solutions to
various issues in the U.S. health care system. They can also facilitate
practice-based research related to the development and assessment of various
health care delivery interventions. UAB's affiliation with the CHOT I/UCRC will
facilitate and accelerate such research in our region by joining an experienced
learning collaborative, and by leveraging the resources of UAB and potential
industry partners. UAB's participation in the CHOT will enhance our graduate
student experience in the classroom and in the field, and will provide faculty
with opportunities for practice-based, multi-disciplinary research.
