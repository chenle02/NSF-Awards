CMIP5, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 5) promotes a standard
set of earth system model climate simulations in order to: i) evaluate how
realistic our models are in simulating climate of the recent past, ii) provide
projections of future climate change on two time scales, one near term (out to
about 2035) and one long term (out to 2100 and beyond), and iii) understand some
of the factors responsible for differences in model projections, including
quantifying some key feedbacks such as those involving clouds and the carbon
cycle. This project aims to analyse CMIP5 model output to assess the impacts of
physical processes in the Southern Ocean that influences surface water pCO2
variation, and air-sea CO2 uptake.

Systematic model intercomparisons will be carried out to tackle three main
questions: 1) How significant are the zonal variations in surface ocean pCO2
throughout the entire Southern Ocean, hence, how representative are conditions
in Drake Passage of ESMs in other areas of the Southern Ocean? 2) Does the rate
of pCO2 increase in the surface waters of the Southern Ocean concur with the
increase of total Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) upwelled to the ocean surface
south of the fronts? 3) What physical processes can explain the excessive
surface water pCO2 concentrations found near the Polar Front in half of the
eight available ESMs?

Increased knowledge of future climate change is in the interest of the US.
