Professor Maitland Jones, Jr. is supported by the Organic Dynamics Program for
his studies of reactive intermediates. Professor Jones, of the Department of
Chemistry at Princeton University, uses hydrocarbon-based precursors to carbenes
in order to avoid interference in subsequent chemistry by the more-commonly used
nitrogen-based carbene precursors and to assess the importance of such precursor
chemistry in previously studied reactions. Formation of sterically-stabilized
bridgehead alkenes through the ring expansion of 1-norbornylcarbenes and carbene
interconversions via `zipper` mechanisms are also under investigation. Analogous
zipper reactions of carboranylcarbenes will be explored as a rational route for
the synthesis of silicon-containing carboranes, and mechanistic and synthetic
studies will be carried out for 1,2-dehydro-o-carborane. Professor Maitland
Jones, Jr., of the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University, with the
support of the Organic Dynamics Program, studies the formation and chemistry of
highly reactive compounds known as carbenes. These compounds contain a central
carbon atom to which only two bonds to other atoms are present, in contrast to
the more commonly found four bonds. Although carbenes have been studied for some
time, it has recently been determined that many of the reactions claimed to lead
to their formation in fact do not give rise to simple carbenes but rather to
materials still incorporating portions of their precursor molecules. Professor
Jones has developed a synthetic route which provides for the unambiguous
formation of carbenes and allows the exploration of their reaction chemistry
unencumbered by the complications of precursor chemistry. Given their
instability, carbenes often form relatively high-energy products, including
molecules displaying patterns of chemical bonds often assumed to be impossible
to obtain. These studies advance our fundamental understanding of carbenes as
reactive intermediates, adding to our understanding and potential control of a
wide variety of significant chemical transformations.
