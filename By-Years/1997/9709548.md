This research examings the role of working memory (WM) capacity constraints and
individual differences in WM capacity in the Payne/Bettman/Johnson framework of
effort-accuracy tradeoffs in the processing of multiattribute information for
the purpose of choice. The P.I. will do so with the help of eye-movement data
and with the help of theory that links WM load to pupil diameter, thus providing
an on-line measure of effort. The goal of the research is to analyze how changes
in the difficulty of a choice task influence choice behavior. The research
develops a computational cognitive model of choice that includes working memory
operations. The proposal builds on the effort-accuracy approach to decision
making and notes that there are individual differences in decision makers (e.g.,
in their aptitudes, working memory capacities, expertise, experience, etc.).
Thus, shifts in information processing behavior may be a function of differences
in capacity rather than a trade off between accuracy and effort.
