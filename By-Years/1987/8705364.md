The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. William Rutter of the University of California, San Francisco , and Dr.
Laszlo Graf of Eotvos University, Budapest, is to study the catalytic mechanisms
of serine proteases (enzymes) and thereby address unsolved issues related to
protein structure and action of these enzymes. The intent is to discern the
fundamental molecular features of serine proteases in order to understand key
aspects of the structural basis of substrate specificity. Results should yield a
good test case for the application of site-directed mutagenesis in protein
molecule engineering. This project in biochemistry fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents, pool
resources and share research facilities in areas of strong mutual interests and
competence.
