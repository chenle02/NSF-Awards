The purpose of this basic engineering research is to produce an instrument that
will very accurately measure the velocity of some waves in tissue. Ultrasound
has become a useful clinical tool, especially in the formation of images of
internal organs. However, the accuracy of the formation of images of internal
organs depends upon the information placed into the computer to interpret the
measurement. One major reason that the ultrasound imaging pictures are not yet
very clear is that the tissue data placed in the computer and used by the
computer to form the image is not sufficiently detailed or accurate. This
research is developing new instrumentation to gain more accurate and detailed
data which can then be placed in the computer for interpretive purposes. In
addition this research will develop the means to use data for forming a better
physical understanding of tissue and its physical properties.
