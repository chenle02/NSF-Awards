Accurate assessment of earthquake risks requires an accurate inventory of the
property at risk. Typically, the inventory data must be assembled from widely
scattered secondary sources such as assessor's parcel files, U.S. Bureau of the
Census population and housing information, and aerial photographs. The
aggregation of the data into a usable form is tedious, time- consuming, and
difficult. Furthermore, the use of these heterogeneous data sources invariably
results in missing data and in some cases inventories which are of unknown
reliability. As computerized techniques for evaluating seismic hazard continue
to evolve, we will need to develop methods for assembling integrated, accurate
inventory databases. This project will develop methodologies and computer tools
for the automatic integration of inventory databases for seismic risk
assessment. A knowledge-based system will integrate multiple, differing
databases into a single unified data structure for representing seismic
inventory data. By incorporating automatic integration, the system will provide
more up-to-date, more complete data for use in seismic risk assessment.
Furthermore, new computer programs for risk assessment will need to deal only
with the unified data structure rather than with the myriad of local data
formats, thus increasing the programs' applicability. In conjunction with the
knowledge-based integration, we will develop an expert system to address the
problems of incomplete and inconsistent data within individual and multiple
databases. The expert system will formalize the heuristics and rules-of-thumb
that seismic experts use in evaluating and reconciling inventory data.
