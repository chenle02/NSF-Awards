This is research on certain aspects of modeling and control of dynamical
systems. In particular, an integrated approach to modeling and control of linear
dynamical systems will be developed based on the notion of a graph. The notion
of a graph of a dynamical system and the notion of the gap metric are important
new ideas in systems theory. The gap metric is a notion of distance between
systems suitable for use in the context of robust stabilization and control.
Approximation of models of linear dynamical systems can be done with use of the
gap metric. This is motivated by the need to synthesize controllers using "low"
order models. The description of the modeling error appears naturally in the
form of uncertainty in the graph of a given system -- graph being the set of all
bounded input-output pairs of the system. The first part of the research will be
on such modeling theory. In the second part of the research, a framework of
modeling which uses estimates of the autocorrelation function of a given signal
will be developed. In particular, measuring noisy input-output data of an
unknown linear system can be cast into this framework. An approach to recursive
spectral estimation based on autocorrelation (covariance) data is proposed. The
gap metric will be used to obtain a-priori bounds on spectral estimates and on
estimates of the uncertainty in the graph of the sought model. The third part of
the research will be to continue the development of recent results on a new
approach to spectral factorization. This is based on a sequence of
transformations on the graph of a given linear system. The technique is based on
an iterative scheme and holds the potential of leading to fast and efficient
algorithms for spectral factorization and recursive filtering.
