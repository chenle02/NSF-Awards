This proposal describes PREPnet, the Pennsylvania Research and Economic
Partnership Network, which presently links thirty- nine colleges, universities,
government, and private sector research and education enterprises to each other
and to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National
Backbone network. PREPnet plans to expand its capacity for connecting education
and research institutions and to extend its services into new regions of the
state. This should encourage smaller institutions to take advantage of
information resources available on PREPnet itself or through the NSFNET. The
items proposed for NSF support include: -Expansion of Pittsburgh and
Philadelphia network hubs; -Creation of a new network hub in State College, PA;
-Creation of a new network hub in Meadville, PA; -Terminal servers for
connecting very small member institutions at a reasonable cost; -Personnel for
outreach, marketing, and support of new members; and -Compensation to the
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center for NSFNET gateway and network support
services.
