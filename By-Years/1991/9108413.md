This oceanographic instrumentation development project is the first step towards
the design and field testing of a moored instrument array to allow measurement
of Total System Metabolism (TSM) in coastal waters and estuaries. The new
capability will allow the application of TSM measurement techniques in complex
hydrographic conditions where they have previously been impractical. The test
mooring will have closely spaced pulsed oxygen sensors and other probes. Data
will be collected and stored for periods up to thirty days. The goal is to test
the sensors' long-term stability and accuracy and whether frequent vertical
profiles of oxygen partial pressure can be made with sufficient resolution to
construct mass balances of oxygen within a defined study area. The work will
provide conclusive evidence as to the usefulness of pulsed oxygen sensors on
moorings and other long-term remote applications.
