GER-9553609 Houde-Walter The University of Rochester has a long record of
producing outstanding PhDs in Optical Science and Engineering. Students know
this, so there is an ample supply of highly qualified U.S. citizens that apply
for graduate study at Rochester each year. Student support is in short supply,
however, and this severely limits the number of doctorates in Optics produced by
Rochester. Should additional support become available through the NSF GRT
program, we can guarantee the admission of additional U.S. citizens without in
any way compromising the academic excellence of the doctoral program. Three
academic departments, The Institute of Optics, The Department of Physics and
Astronomy, and the Department of Mechanical Engineering, have joined forces to
attract the GRT program to Rochester. Together we propose several enhancements
to our already strong programs. These include Optics training in technical
communication, training opportunities for GRT students as future mentors, and
international research opportunities for GRT students. We have also developed
several new approaches to recruiting underrepresented minorities and women.
These enhancements will benefit the GRT students and will improve the quality of
doctoral education in Optics overall.
