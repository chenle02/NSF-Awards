Proposal: DMS-9800084 Principal Investigator: Alexandre Eremenko Abstract: A.
Eremenko will continue his study of the distribution of values of meromorphic
functions and their generalization, holomorphic maps from the complex line to
projective spaces, using the new methods of potential theory developed in his
previous work. With this approach he already obtained such results as the proof
of a defect relation for non-linear hypersurfaces conjectured by B. Shiffman
(joint work with Sodin, 1992) and the proof of the Modified Cartan conjecture in
dimension three (1996). Specifically, he plans to concentrate on the following
topics: normality criteria for holomorphic maps omitting hyperplanes, the study
of extremal maps for defect relations, and the Inverse Problem of the Value
Distribution Theory for maps to projective spaces, with special attention to the
maps satisfying algebraic differential equations, both linear and non-linear.
Meromorphic functions constitute the most basic class of functions used in
mathematics and its applications. This class includes elementary functions like
the exponential, cosine and tangent functions, as well as higher transcendental
functions, like the Gamma function, Airy functions, elliptic functions, etc.,
which are indispensable in physics, engineering and other applications. The
fundamental problem about these functions is the study of solutions of equations
f(x)=a, where f is a given function, and a is a given complex number. Usually
such equations have infinitely many solutions and the question is how their
location depends on the right-hand side of the equation. This is the subject of
Value Distribution Theory, a great achievement of mathematical analysis in the
second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the present century.
The logic of development of mathematics and potential applications to
differential equations require an extension of the main results of this theory
to the case of functions whose values are no longer numbers, but i nstead are
vectors. Despite major efforts by several outstanding researchers in the
beginning of the twentieth century, our current understanding of this subject is
very incomplete. Recent breakthroughs give hope of major new advances in the
area. Such advances would extend our knowledge of a basic and fundamental
mathematical subject, which is the value distribution of the vector-valued
entire functions known as "holomorphic curves in projective spaces."
