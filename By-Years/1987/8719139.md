Gravity is by far the weakest of the known fundamental interactions. Could
there exist new interactions much weaker than gravity that have remained
undetected because of the extraordinarily delicate effects they produce? The
Seattle group will develop a sensitive instrument based on a highly symmetrical,
rotation torsion balance to search for feeble forces that are not exactly
proportional to mass, as is gravity, but depend slightly on the substance (e.g.
on the number of neutrons, protons, quarks, or electrons). This will allow them
to "see" interactions approximately 60 times weaker than their present detection
limit, which is the best existing constraint on composition dependent forces.
