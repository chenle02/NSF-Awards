Challenges in CISE: Automatic Interpretation of High-Altitude Image Data for
Eco-System Modeling The goal of the joint research effort between the University
of Massachusetts Computer Science Department and the Department of Forestry and
Wildlife Management is the development and demonstration of a practical
methodology to enable highly automated and accurate scientific monitoring of
natural resource and land use via aerial video and photography. A secondary goal
is to use portions of the same system for wildlife surveys and management. The
research project will almost completely automate and significantly extend the
manual methodology currently in use involving airborne video data collection,
time-consuming manual image registration, and construction of customized expert
system classifiers for vegetation and terrain cover. Thus the proposed computer
science research spans technical issues in computer vision, machine learning,
and high performance computing.
