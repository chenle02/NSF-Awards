This is a fundamental academic bioengineering research proposal which will be
directed toward the area of Doppler ultrasound measurements. This technique has
gained major importance in diagnostic applications because it permits non-
invasive imaging of the blood flow through the heart and major blood vessels. At
this time it has been shown mathematically that using coherent swept frequency
signals allows the measurement of Doppler frequency and range and permits the
cancellation of stationary echoes. The latter is necessary for medical
applications. This is a very novel approach to a serious problem in medical
diagnostics.
