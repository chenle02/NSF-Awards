The goal of the proposed project is to provide skilled employees for the
biotechnology industry. To achieve this goal, a collaboration will be
established between the Biotechnology Laboratory Technician Program at Madison
Area Technical College, the University of Wisconsin Teacher Enhancement Program,
and the industry-based BioPharmaceutical Technology Center Institute. This
proposal, An Advanced Biotechnology Education Partnership Program, is a well-
coordinated, highly integrated effort to: (1) develop and disseminate curriculum
materials specifically designed for technician training at the two-year
associate degree level; (2) provide teacher enhancement activities in
biotechnology including summer institutes, mentoring and curriculum development
partnerships for associate degree and secondary level school teachers; and, (3)
support the development and coordination of industry-led, statewide programs to
offer work-based experiences for high school students. The proposed program will
thus link together the development of instructional materials with faculty
enhancement, student laboratory experiences and school-to-work initiatives.
