ECS-9711051 Shira Broschat In this research, a computationally efficient
algorithm for ultrasound imaging of small breast tumors will be developed by
combining imaging processing techniques with wave theory. The research also
includes, through its Materials Classifications step based on statistical
pattern classification, realistic inclusion both of materials properties of the
tissues involved and realistic distribution of scattering centers and
structures. Preliminary results indicate that this approach provides excellent
reconstruction and can distinguish between tumors and cysts. The ultimate goal
of the research is the detection of millimeter-sized breast tumors in what is
experimentally a strong scattering environment. The algorithm will also prove
useful for other areas where strong scattering is a problem.
