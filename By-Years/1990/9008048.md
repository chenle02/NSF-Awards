Studies in theoretical physics will focus on investigations of geometric phases
in quantum mechanics which are generalizations of those originally discovered by
Berry, and on quantum mechanical phase shifts which can occur in the presence of
electromagnetic or gravitational potentials. These investigations concern the
fundamental character of quantum mechanics, and will help to illuminate the
subtle nature of this theoretical framework in terms of which essentially all
submicroscopic physical phenomena are understood.
