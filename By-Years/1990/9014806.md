A broad-based program of theoretical and observational research on cosmic rays
and their interaction with the magnetic fields of the sun and the solar wind is
proposed. Included will be the continued operation of the Thule and Newark
neutron monitoring stations through 1993, including development of new
electronic units for the detectors. Specific tasks will include: (1) detailed
analysis of solar particle events occurring during the present solar cycle, with
special emphasis placed on understanding the remarkable fine structure observed
in 1989. (2) sunspot cycle (11 year) and magnetic cycle (22 year) variations of
the cosmic ray diurnal radial gradient. (3) sunspot cycle and solar magnetic
cycle variation of the cosmic ray north-south anisotropy and radial gradient.
(4) long-term variations and north-south asymmetries of the sun and solar wind.
(5) the three-dimensional structure of interplanetary magnetic turbulence, as
revealed in cosmic ray measurements. (6) magnetic helicity effects in cosmic ray
transport. (7) particle scattering near 90 degrees pitch angle during
dissipative, dynamic turbulence. ***
