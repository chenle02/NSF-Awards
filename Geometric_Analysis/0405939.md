Abstract

Award: DMS-0405939 Principal Investigator: Ilia Zharkov

The proposed research lies in the subject of mirror symmetry, of which there are
several mathematical interpretations. The investigator will address a possible
link between two of them -- the homological mirror symmetry of Kontsevich and
the duality of Strominger-Yau-Zaslow torus fibrations -- by studying the
limiting metric behavior of maximally degenerating families of Calabi-Yau
manifolds. The main objective of this research is to prove the metric collapse
conjecture for the toric Calabi-Yau families. The key ingredient here is to
understand the behavior at the discriminant. Another direction is to study the
Kaehler affine structures on the limiting space. Finally, the tropical geometry
approach is proposed for the limiting counting of holomorphic curves and
understanding the degeneration of the Fukaya side of the homological mirror
symmetry.

In recent years there has been a remarkable renaissance in the interaction
between mathematics and physics. After a long period during which mathematicians
and physicists pursued seemingly independent paths, their interests have now
converged in a striking manner. Deep connections have been established between
quantum field theory and string theory on one side and topology, algebraic and
differential geometry on the other. Mirror symmetry is considered by many to be
the mostly responsible for bridging the gap between the two fields created in
previous decades. On a broader scale, as physicists nowadays believe that a
Calabi-Yau 3-fold together with 3+1 Minkowski space constitute the space-time of
10-dimensional string theory, a better understanding of these manifolds will
help to uncover mysteries of the Universe.
