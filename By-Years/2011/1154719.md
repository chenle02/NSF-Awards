This award will enable an international collaboration for software development
in computational chemistry between researchers in the United States and the
United Kingdom. This international collaboration arose from a joint NSF/EPSRC
workshop on Software Development for Grand Challenges in the Chemical Sciences
held in Oxford, United Kingdom in June 2011. This award will fund planning and
community building workshops, and exchange visits to catalyze projects.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will lay the foundation for the development
of new community software that will impact all quantum chemistry programs. The
resulting improvements will subsequently benefit the array of computational
chemistry and physics software (e.g., solid-state physics and molecular dynamics
codes) that depend on quantum chemistry models, and will ultimately provide a
path to solving grand challenge problems such as large-scale ab initio
simulations of metallic systems, the spectroscopy of solvated systems, or
photoactive biological processes.
