This project asks how women in the central valley of Oaxaca, Mexico manage
their households while a male member migrates. This region of Mexico has one of
the highest migration rates in the country. The project, involving an
anthropologist from Agnes Scott College in Atlanta and her Mexican colleague
from the University of Guadalajara, will study the nature of the families,
households, and resources women in migrant households deal with. The researchers
will describe the women's households of origin and ascription, compare
households with migrants to those of non-migrating siblings, and describe the
economic behavior of women in migrant households. The project will test
hypotheses about the impact of wages on migration: that men migrate alone
because their migrant wages are insufficient to support their families at their
destinations; that men are able to migrate because female labor finances the
trip and supports the household in the meantime; and that local conditions in
Mexico can explain variations in migrant sending rates over time. The project
will use a mix of methods, a survey of about 1,000 women in 20 communities (a
10% sample of central valley communities); an extensive life history interview
with five women from each community to determine kinship, lineage histories,
household consumer-worker ratios, and more traditional ethnographic interviewing
and participant observation. This research is important because it will advance
our understanding of the causes of Mexican migration to the US. By focusing on
the role of women and of local conditions in the originating households the
project will contribute valuable new knowledge to complement the existing
surveys which focus on males. │/¥Á┤ ╣&gt; ¥©Á └Á╝` ║╝Á│╣¢Á Á┬║Á╝╣_Á&gt;¥/%
