9404809 Chen This research is a collaboration between the University of Illinois
and Purdue University to analyze short-period and broad- band seismic waveform
data from the northwestern Pacific. Because of the complex tectonic setting and
major subduction zones in the area, pronounced variation in lithospheric and
upper mantle structure is expected near this margin. Using high-resolution
seismic waveform data, a detailed study of such variation can place additional
constraints on mantle dynamics and mineral physics. Using high-quality seismic
data from the broad-band networks, the proposed work complements existing long-
period and travel time studies in this region. ***
