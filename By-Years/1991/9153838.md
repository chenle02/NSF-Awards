This three year proposal describes a joint effort between the New York State
Education Department's Bureau of Science Education and Public Broadcasting
Program in conjunction with New York State's Elementary Science Mentor teacher
training network. Video based inservice material will be designed and developed
that presents hands-on problem solving to all elementary teachers regardless of
their ability to attend workshops. A secondary goal is to design and develope
video based materials to inform and motivate school administrators and parents,
to become actively involved in striving toward the long range goal of creating
quality hands-on problem solving elementary science programs for their children.
The established Mentor network will be used to train one teacher/mentor in each
of the 1,000 public and nonpublic elementary schools in New York State. These
1000 teacher/mentors will then train or make available the "stand alone" video
materials to the 80,000 elementary teachers in their buildings. The cost sharing
will be forty-seven percent of the NSF portion.
