Keating 9500982 Professor Keating will work on problems in arithmetic geometry.
He will try to compute the arithmetical intersection numbers for certain
divisors on moduli spaces of abelian varieties. He also will study the general
theory of p-adic dynamical systems from he point of view of the field of norms.
Finally he wishes to study the actions of certain automorphism groups of formal
groups on the moduli space of deformations of that group. This project falls
into the general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the
oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has
proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
