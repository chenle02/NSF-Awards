This project will focus on the design and implementation issues of adding object
identity, database schema templates, typing, and generalized database updates to
deductive databases for increased modeling power and programming flexibility.
All these features can be elegantly expressed within the framework of high order
logic. The current logic programming and deductive database paradigm will be
naturally extended to higher order logic by employing many sorted first order
proof theory. The resulting data model should be efficiently implementable.
Uniform treatment of data and logic program by the structuring and typing
facilities will support the development of an expressive logic based database
programming language, suitable for a broad range of applications.
