The Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington will use this award
from the Chemical Research Instrumentation Program to help acquire a mini-
supercomputer. The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the
acquisition include the following: (1) computational research on the electronic
structure of organic and organometallic molecules, (2) wave packet dynamics and
surface scattering, (3) surface scattering and condensed matter simulations, (4)
simulations of molecular fluids and biologically important molecules and quantum
theory of highly excited states, and (5) quantum and semiclassical simulations
of clusters and molecular dynamics simulations of sputtering from surfaces. %%%
The computational demands of modern chemical research require the proper
computing system that would avoid wasteful bottlenecks by balancing a variety of
computational capabilities with individual workstations, networks, hardware and
software maintenance, support personnel and training in all areas of
computational chemistry. Many new insights into kinetics of chemical reactions
can be developed through theoretical studies with use of mini supercomputers
when the experimental data are inaccessible.
