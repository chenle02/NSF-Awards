A jointly supported NASA, NSF workshop will examine bipolar processes of
climate change. Research results and climate models suggest that climate changes
observed in Antarctic and Arctic records have occurred similarly in both polar
regions. The workshop participants will examine the recent results collected
seaprately at the two poles and discuss a strategy for modeling climate changes
that involve bi-polar interactions of the climate. The increased communication
between scientists separately studying Antarctic or Arctic climates will foster
development of better models and enhanced collaboration that will lead to
improved understanding of global climate changes.
