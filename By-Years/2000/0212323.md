The continuance of life through cell division requires that each daughter cell
receive one and only one chromosome set from the parent cell. High fidelity DNA
replication and chromosome segregation are fundamental components to this
process. During DNA replication, each parental chromosome is exactly duplicated.
At the same time, the resulting chromosomes (called sister chromatids) become
tightly paired along their length. This pairing between chromatids identifies
the sisters over time. Upon cell division, the pairing mechanism is inactivated
and the sisters segregate away from each other into the newly forming daughter
cells. This is the hallmark of proper cell division. Defects in sister chromatid
pairing have dire consequences for the organism, causing severe abnormalities of
many kinds. This project will help characterize the mechanism by which sister
chromatid pairing is established. CTF7 (also called ECO1) is an essential
component of the sister chromatid pairing pathway in yeast and Ctf7p is highly
conserved throughout evolution. The goals of this research are to 1) map Ctf7p
protein interaction domains required for sister chromatid pairing, 2) test
molecular models of how sister chromatids are paired, and 3) identify new
components that are required for sister chromatid pairing. These goals will be
accomplished using biochemical, molecular, genetic and high-resolution light
microscopy approaches in yeast cells. The successful completion of these goals
will enable the investigator to build a testable physical model of how sister
chromatids become paired and elucidate the regulatory mechanisms involved. In
addition to advancing the understanding of chromosome segregation, this research
program will strengthen the scientific infrastructure at Lehigh University, an
institution with a high percentage of undergraduate students. Students and post-
doctoral fellows will acquire new intellectual and technical skills from this
project.
