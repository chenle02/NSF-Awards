Collaborative proposal: ISI and TIES Conference Support Program

Abstract

This collaborative project supports travel of new researchers from US
institutions to two international conferences in Statistics during the summer of
2003. The conferences are the International Environmetrics Society (TIES) 2003
Conference, held in August 2003 in Beijing, China, and the International
Statistics Institute (ISI) Conference on Environmental Statistics and Health
(ISI-ESH), held in July 2003 in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. The conferences
provide a forum for these new researchers to present their work and interact
with established researchers in statistics who work on environmental and health
related scientific issues.
