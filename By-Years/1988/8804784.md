The electrical coupling coefficients in rocks are widely used in oil, gas and
mineral prospecting. Examples include downhole resistivity and spontaneous
potential measurements as well as surface gophysical self-potential profiling.
Interpretation of the measurements in terms of microscopic rock properties
requires a detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of ion transport in pore
networks. Inhomogeneities in geologic membranes can arise as a result of
intimate mixing, sedimentation and diagenesis of mixtures of minerals or in the
form of organic surface coatings such as kerogen in shales. These
inhomogeneities may significantly alter the membrane properties of the rock. No
systematic study has been undertaken to investigate this dependence. It is the
objective of this project to obtain a better understanding of the nature of
electro- chemical-kinetic coupling in these inhomogeneous systems.
