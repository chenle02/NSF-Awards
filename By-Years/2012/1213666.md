This award provides partial support for US students and lecturers to attend the
second "Biennial African School on Fundamental Physics and its Applications" to
be held in KNUST, Kumasi, Ghana, from July 15 to August 4, 2012. There will be
three main topics at the school: 1) theoretical physics, 2) experimental sub-
atomic physics and 3) accelerators and technologies. The contents will be aimed
primarily at doctoral students and on students finishing their last year of
university studies, but young researchers will also be encouraged to apply. This
school will serve as an opportunity for US students and professional physicists
to interact with their counterparts in sub-Saharan Africa and to form
collaborations and partnerships. The program is supported jointly by NSF
Division of Physics, through its programs in Elementary Particle Physics
Experiment and Theory, and the NSF Office of International Science and
Engineering through its Global Venture Fund.
