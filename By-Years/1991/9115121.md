The spectral absorption lines of hot, rapidly rotating "B" type stars show
traveling "bumps" which travel across the lines with time. Although these bumps
were first thought to move periodically in a predictable way, leading to an
interpretation that traveling waves (nonradial pulsations) were responsible, new
data indicate that the bumps are often missing. In order to judge whether this
apparent unpredictability is caused by the "beating" of different pulsation
modes or by an aperiodic phenomenon, long strings of spectroscopic data are
needed. In the past long "campaigns" have been difficult to undertake because of
practical scheduling and allocation problems at national facilities. In early
1992 Georgia State will put into operation its new spectroscopic "Multi-
Telescope Telescope. This facility will have a large effective light gathering
power and a Charged-Couple Device detector and will permit the PI to obtain
large amounts of data to examine the frequency of the "profile bump" phenomenon
in rapidly rotating B stars and to ascertain its periodic nature. The PI also
believes that the large database assembled will enable him to determine whether
nonradial pulsations are responsible for episodic mass loss in the enigmatic
group of rapidly rotating "Be" stars.
