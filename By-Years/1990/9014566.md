This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of chemically modified electrodes. Professor Crooks will study new
methods for constructing molecular assemblies on electrode surfaces that provide
nanometer-scale templates for molecular imprinting. This research will use a
suite of surface-sensitive methods including scanning tunneling microscopy,
atomic force microscopy and electrochemical microscopy to characterize the
molecular dimensions of these assemblies. This work would be important in
providing ways for developing new chemical sensors, new electronic materials and
lithographic technologies.
