With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania will
acquire a Departmental Beowulf Cluster for Computational Chemistry. This
equipment will enhance research in the following areas: a) polyborane catalysis
and coordination chemistry (Sneddon); b) computational methods for combinatorial
protein design and protein folding (Saven); c) computational methods in the
development of ligands for asymmetric synthesis (Kozlowski); d) dynamics of
water molecules in anion solvation shells (Klein); e) the role of structure and
conformational change in biological electron and ion transport (Blasie); and f)
correlating alloy chemistry with metallic glass formation (Rappe).

A cluster of fast, modern computer workstations is vital to serving the
computing needs of active research departments. Such a "computer network" also
serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms,
provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities, and supports
research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing. These studies
will have a significant impact in a number of areas, including development of
more efficient catalysts, biochemistry and materials sciences.
