9414115 Lauffenburger This project is on research to better understand the
dynamics of growth factors and their receptors, focusing on the epidermal growth
factor system. The object of the work is to manipulate growth factor ligands as
a means of altering trafficking. There are three specific aims for the period of
study: (1) to manipulate parameters in receptor/ligand and receptor/cell
interactions in order to test previously constructed models of receptor
dynamics; (2) to investigate ligand transport through model tissues; and (3) to
study model autocrine/paracrine regulatory systems created by inserting
engineered ligands and regulatory elements into cell lines. The understanding of
growth factor/receptor dynamics and trafficking could lead to improvements in
wound healing, drug delivery, gene therapy, and tissue regeneration. ***
