The International Botanical Congress (IBC) is the largest international
conference in plant biology and extends the broadest disciplinary coverage of
any such conference. It provides an opportunity for plant scientists of all
disciplines to showcase their research to peers from around the world, while
fostering communication and collaboration in ways that only can develop from the
sort of personal interactions and networking that occur at such conferences.
This proposal will support travel by graduate students and postdocs to attend
the 19th International Botanical Congress in Shenzhen, China, July 17-29, 2017.
It will support 32 participants.

The IBC is held every six years and serves a critical role in international
communication within and across disciplines in plant biology, as well as a
valuable opportunity to establish international collaborations. Participation is
particularly valuable for young scientists as they establish their careers. The
opportunity to reach so many scientists within any individual discipline creates
an unequaled opportunity for exposure by a young scientist. The once-in-six-
years frequency of the Congresses means that for most young scientists, there is
only one opportunity to participate in an IBC during these critical stages of
professional development. The intent of this proposal is to offer awards to
graduate students and postdocs who are presenting in a symposium or poster
session to enable them to attend this meeting.
