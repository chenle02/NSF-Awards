This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
novel microbatteries. As microsystems emerge from the lab into applications such
as implantable medical devices, smart surgical tools, and discrete, autonomous
sensors, there is a critical need for power systems of a similar physical size
(a few cubic mm or smaller) to the new miniaturized systems themselves. The
microbattery developed under the Phase I effort exploits a volumetric approach
to deliver power with a minimum volume and a minimum footprint. Compared with
thin film batteries, which are surface area devices requiring a large footprint
to achieve useful capacities. These novel devices meet the need for a small
self-contained source of electrical power. The objective of the project will be
to reduce the critical dimensions of the device to the order of 1mm, fully
characterize their performance, and develop production and assembly procedures
to manufacture integrated devices. The commercial and broader impacts of this
technology will be to emerging new devices based on microsystems technology
(devices containing microelectronics and MicroElectroMechanical Systems, (MEMS))
such as implantable medical devices, microsensors for broad area surveillance,
and microsatellites.
