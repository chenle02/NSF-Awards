Research will be carried out at the millimeter-wavelength interferometer at
Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO). The instrument currently consists of
three 10.4-m, high accuracy millimeter-wavelength telescopes, equipped with low
noise SIS receivers for the 2.6 and 1.3-mm bands. The interferometer will be
used for high resolution aperture synthesis of the molecular emission and dust
continuum in planetary atmospheres, the envelopes of evolved stars, and
molecular clouds and protostellar nebulae in the Milky Way and external
galaxies. The first observations will be done in the 1.3 millimeter wavelength
band, where the instrument has twice the angular resolution. The sensitivity to
dust emission also increases by an order of magnitude. Major new additions
include the implementation of a second 2.6 millimeter wavelength receiver
channel and sub-aperture optics (to enable complete imaging on all spatial
scales from 1 arcsecond to several arcminutes). A digital spectroscopic
correlator system is also under construction with funds from the California
Institute of Technology. The scientific investigations to be carried out range
from an arcsecond resolution imaging of distant, ultraluminous galaxies to
mapping of nearby protostellar nebulae at resolutions of 100 astronomical units
(AU). The former studies will enable us to discern and understand the sources of
enormous luminosity in galactic nuclei (and perhaps quasars); the latter will
provide the first detailed images of pre-solar nebulae.
