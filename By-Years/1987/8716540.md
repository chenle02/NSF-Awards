Suitable radar systems operating in the VHF band can determine the bottom
topography of an ice sheet, provide information about bottom sediments, and
indicate layering within the ice sheets. This information is an indication of
ice sheet history and potential slippage zones. This award will support the
completion of modern ice depth-sounding radar system for use by glaciologists in
Antarctica. During the term of this award, modification and testing of the radar
for use on the C-130 and smaller aircraft will be completed, and system soft
ware will be developed.
