This 3-year study will elucidate the historical response of the lower Great
Lakes to nutrient enrichment and abatement, and provide a basis for monitoring
changes in trophic state variables in other large, deep-water lakes. Data
collected will calibrate existing proxy indicators to modern conditions and
develop new techniques for estimating past, present and future changes in the
trophic state of the Great Lakes. The field program will include data collection
from the water column, sediment traps and cores from Lake Ontario and Erie.
Laboratory experiments will determine the effects of nutrient enrichment on the
carbon and nitrogen isotopic signature of organic matter produced by
phytoplankton.
