The objective of this research award is to develop high throughput manufacturing
processes for the efficient production of multi-layer nanolaminates. Low
frequency (~1 Hz) pulsed plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) has
been engineered as an alternative to atomic layer deposition for self-limiting
growth of metal oxides (i.e. 1 Ã…/pulse). Pulsed PECVD offers a number of
benefits including high net rates (> 30 nm/min), a larger process window, and
wide applicability to a large number of precursors / materials. The proposed
work is directed at accomplishing two major goals. The first will be an
examination of interfacial issues associated with the formation of mixed metal
oxide nanolaminates. Second, pulsed PECVD synthesis of oxides will be integrated
with self-limiting deposition of polymers by the same method to form
inorganic/organic nanolaminates. Acrylate and silicone based polymers are
targeted to extend nanolaminate manufacturing to an array of flexible polymer
substrates.

If successful this process technology is expected to impact the manufacturing of
nanolaminates for numerous applications, including high performance dielectrics,
optical components, and diffusion barriers for flexible electronics. A robust
approach to the synthesis of high quality organic/inorganic nanolaminates will
be an enabling technology with broad cross-cutting potential. The broader
impacts of this work will also include the training of a PhD candidate and the
engagement of undergraduate researchers in areas of great technological
importance. The materials and expertise produced by this work will be
incorporated into an existing silicon processing lab course and a graduate
elective in plasma processing. The PI and his students will work with the
Colorado School of Mines K-12 outreach team, developing teacher workshop
materials in the areas of optics, plasmas, and photovoltaics for school
districts with large populations of poor and minority students.
