Spanish Translation of Windows to the Universe Website

This project supports translation of the successful Windows to the Universe
website (http://www.windows.ucar.edu) into Spanish. The Windows to the Universe
(W2U) project was initiated in 1995, to develop a user-friendly learning system
for students and the general public for the Earth and space sciences, linking to
interdisciplinary humanities connections. All content on the W2U site is now
available only in English. The site serves over 4 million users per year, ~65%
of whom are K-12 students who visit the site frequently for classroom research
and free-time browsing. The site is composed of thousands of multi-level hybrid
cgi-html pages that are dynamically interpreted to serve content back to the
user at the upper elementary, middle, or high school level. Each page also
includes multiple images, and the main image on each page typically is linked to
a larger version of the same image on a separate html page. All pages on the
site include image credits, captions, and labeled and unlabeled buttons and
navigation tools. Translation of the site into Spanish therefore requires a
combination of text translation as well as graphics revision to develop a full
second version of the site to serve the Spanish- speaking community. The project
team will translate the web site with a multi-step process over a two-year
interval, ensuring accuracy of the translation through the use of a full-time
professional Spanish translator and Spanish-speaking geoscientists. They will
also develop a page translation management interface that will facilitate the
interaction of the translators and W2U project staff. Project staff will attend
two Hispanic science education meetings in the second year to disseminate
information about the availability of the new Spanish-language version of the
W2U site.
