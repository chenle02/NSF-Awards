This award is for the study of the large scale structure of the universe.
Current observations show inhomogeneities on much larger scales than previously
thought. Dr. Szalay, a leading theoretician, will work with a number of
observers specializing in this area to clarify and confirm some of the puzzling
data which seem to indicate periodic distributions of matter with redshift at
great distances. The success of the proposed research may bring major advances
in our understanding of the structure of the universe.
