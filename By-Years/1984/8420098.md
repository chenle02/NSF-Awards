Hydrodynamic instabilities in thin (0(.01-10 um)) fluid films caused by
interfacial effects are theoretically studied. Three different types of
interfacial instabilities are under investigation: a Marangoni instability
resulting from a transverse temperature gradient across the film; instabilities
arising from capillary action at the free interface of an annular film; and
surface chemical reaction induced instabilities. In each of these
investigations, the film is modeled as a viscoelastic liquid, and particular
attention is focused on the nonlinear stability characteristics, and the
deformation patterns of the film which may arise in nonlinear asymptotic states.
