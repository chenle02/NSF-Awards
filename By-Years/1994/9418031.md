Heaney 9418031 The funds requested in this proposal will support Professor Peter
J. Heaney of Princeton University and his research group in their investigations
of microcrystalline silica SiO2 . This work will explore the ways in which
silica microstructures reflect the chemistry of the environments in which they
formed. Although these kinds of investigations have been intensively pursued for
biogenic marine silica, the structural characteristics of silica minerals from
evaporitic environments remain relatively unknown. Our ignorance of these phases
is especially unfortunate, since evaporitic silica is an important paleoclimatic
indicator and is commonly associated with economic ores. By using transmission
electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and electron probe microanalysis,
Heaney and coworkers will determine the way in which evaporitic silica forms and
transforms over time. These studies will involve three interrelated projects: 1)
Microstructural analysis of moganite, a newly recognized silica polymorph; 2)
Determination of the crystal structure of the hydrous sodium silicate magadiite
and the structural pathway between magadiite and moganite; and 3) Examination of
replacement mechanisms between evaporitic silica and preexisting carbonate. This
work will establish a microstructural understanding of the diagenetic alteration
of silica minerals from evaporitic deposits, and it will reveal silicification
mechanisms of shell carbonate at the atomic scale and should shed light on
fossilization processes.
