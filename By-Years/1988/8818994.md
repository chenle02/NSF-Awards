This work studies the formation of thin films and coatings of several high Tc
Superconducting materials in the Y-Ba-Cu-0 base system with Bi, Tl and/or Sr
additions. Nanosecond laser evaporation techniques and rapid thermal processing
methods will be used to stabilize these non-equilibrium phases. Using these
processing methods the number of Cu-O planes may be increased which also
increases the superconducting transition temperature Tc. Modeling of the laser
evaporation will be performed to understand and control the deposition process
and to minimize the total thermal budget during in-situ deposition and
subsequent annealing. The epitaxial growth and texturing of thin films to
maximize critical current densities wil be investigated in detail.
