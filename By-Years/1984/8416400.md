Japan is ahead of the U.S. in introducing significant earthquake hazard
reduction and preparedness innovations, particularly when it comes to the
industrial sector. Thus, the U.S. could learn a great deal from Japan in this
regard. This project will assess the applicability of Japanese industrial
earthquake risk reduction practices to the U.S. by comparing existing practices
among Japanese and U.S. firms. The emphasis of the study will be on private
sector measures. The process whereby earthquake risk reduction activities have
evolved and their funding and place within the corporate structure will be
studied. In addition, existing engineering-oriented solutions will be analyzed.
The interaction between government agencies and the private sector in promoting
risk-reduction practices will also be investigated. Data will be collected in
both countries through site inspections at relevant institutions, interviews
with key officials, and the acquisition and analysis of documentary information.
