The Phase I and II tests of the full-scale steel structure of the U.S.-Japan
Cooperative Research Program were recently completed. Interpretation and
analysis of the Phase I test results are now in progress in Japan. Japanese
researchers will not be performing significant analysis of the test results for
Phase II, and the emphasis of the analysis of the Phase I analysis may not be
suitable for U.S. practitioners, because U.S. and Japanese practices are quite
different. The Phase I and Phase II test results are analyzed from a U.S.
perspective; these results are correlated to U.S. practice and appropriate
recommendations are developed for seismic design as well as future research; and
these results are disseminated to the practicing profession. An interim report
is prepared within 6 months of the start of this study to quickly disseminate
general test results and conclusions. A more detailed final report is prepared
at the end of 24 months.
