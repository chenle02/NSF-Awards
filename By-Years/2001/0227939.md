The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is hosting a workshop on June 5 - 6,
2002 to promote the formation of research partnerships between researchers in
designated EPSCoR states and the scientific staff from the Department of Energy
(DoE) laboratories and facilties. The workshop is sponsored by the DoE Office of
EPSCoR program and is co-sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF)
EPSCoR program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of the workshop is
to provide a forum for researchers from the EPSCoR states to: 1) report advances
in EPSCoR-funded research activities, 2) update their knowledge of Department of
Energy and NSF programs and activities, 3) learn about the Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory user facilities and research directions, 4) explore
opportunities for research with Department of Energy scientists, 5) develop
plans for future research projects and 6) learn about DoE laboratory
opportunities for training and hands-on research experience for undergraduate,
graduate, postdoctoral fellows and new faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
