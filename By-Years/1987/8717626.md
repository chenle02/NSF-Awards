The investigators will carry out theoretical calculations of radiative
transition probabilities and collisional scattering cross sections for the ion
Fe+. The lines from this ion dominate and complicate many astrophysical spectra.
Use of a Cray 2 computer allows vastly greater accuracy than any previous
projects. Most information about stars is derived from an analysis of their
spectra. But many stellar spectra are complicated by hundreds of spectrum lines
due to the iron ion Fe+. Correction of these lines requires a detailed
calculation of the atomic levels of Fe+ and various transitions between them. A
calculation of the required accuracy is now possible by use of a Cray 2
supercomputer. Pradhan has the computer codes and helpful national and
international collaborations needed to accomplish this calculation under the
present grant.
