9452406 Mendez This project is designed to encourage women to study science. We
will make our introductory and conceptual physics laboratories more conducive to
our female students in three ways: 1) increasing self-confidence and hands-on
experience by using computer assisted data collection and adopting several
assignments developed by Priscilla Laws and the Workshop Physics Group at
Dickenson College; 2) relating abstract concepts to the real world by using a
microcomputer video digitizer to digitize videos and then analyzing them to make
quantitative measurements; and 3) decreasing the feeling of isolation and
introducing our students to the powerful tool of networking by having our
students collaborate on experiments with physics students at Randolph-Macon
Woman's College through the Internet computer network.
