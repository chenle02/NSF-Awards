Pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars characterized by the regular emission
of radio (and in some cases optical) signals. The pulsation frequency of
different pulsars ranges from seconds down to milliseconds. The Principal
Investigator proposes to continue with his radio observations of pulsars,
concentrating on: 1. high-precision pulsar timing observations, in part in
preparation for the NASA Gamma Ray Observatory (to be launched in 1990), 2.
search for millisecond pulsars, and 3. initiate a "glitch patrol" of daily
observations of selected pulsars. The motivation for this work is to achieve a
better understanding of the nature of pulsars, their place in stellar and
galactic evolution, and to apply the data to gravitation physics, cosmology,
astrometry, and timekeeping.
