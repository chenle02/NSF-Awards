The research deals with reliable stabilization of control systems when some of
the sensors and actuators fail in real-time. Controller decomposition is used so
that closed-loop stability is still maintained when one of the controller is no
longer operational. The work is based on characterization of plants which can be
stabilized using decentralized feedback and parameterization of all stabilizing
decentralized controllers. The research will also extend factorization theory to
the analysis and synthesis of nonlinear systems, where general theory is
difficult to develop and the extensions will be indirect.
