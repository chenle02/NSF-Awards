The Molecular Physics Laboratory (MPL) of SRI International continues to host a
site for the National Science Foundation's Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Program. The MPL has a worldwide reputation for its
fundamental and applied research in atomic, molecular, and laser physics. During
the past 11 years, 106 undergraduate students have participated in MPL's REU
program, collaborating with Ph.D. mentors from the MPL staff on a wide variety
of experimental and theoretical research problems in these areas.

The program recruits highly qualified undergraduate students; helps them
identify the best match of student, mentor, and research project; and strives to
provide a rewarding summer research experience. MPL staff provide each student
with both formal and informal opportunities to perform exciting research,
discuss their work, present project results, and explore career possibilities in
science. We expect this REU program to continue to produce student/mentor co-
authored presentations and publications, undergraduate students who have a
better sense of the work of Ph.D. scientists at a research institute, and our
research staff renewed by the energy and fresh perspective of young scientists.
