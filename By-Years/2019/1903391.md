The PI will conduct research in two directions in the area of the geometric
Langlands program. The Langlands program started as a series of conjectures
proposed by Robert Langlands beginning in 1967. From its origins in number
theory and representation theory, it developed into a framework connecting and
influencing many areas of mathematics. In particular, the geometric Langlands
program is formulated in terms of algebraic geometry and can be interpreted in
physical terms as a duality in quantum field theory. This project introduces new
geometric ideas into the area. It is likely that the techniques developed in
this project will find applications in other areas of mathematics. This award
provides training of graduate students through research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
more detail, the PI will work on the classical limit of the local geometric
Langlands conjecture and on the duality for compactified Jacobians of formal
curves. In earlier work, the PI has studied the classical limit of the global
geometric conjecture; while progress in the special case of the group GL(n) was
made, it became apparent that the general case will require new tools. One goal
of this project is to develop such tools using local methods. At the same time,
the research focuses on an essentially unexplored direction in the geometric
Langlands program: while the general shape of conjectures is known (and stated
in the proposal), the details are unclear at this point. The project aims to
clarify the situation by using the easier case of GL(n) to test various
conjectures before attempting to prove them in
general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
