Dr. Dinsmore, a professor of anatomy at Rush Medical College, is undertaking a
training/study and research program under the guidance of Dr. Robert J. Richards
in the Program of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of
Chicago. He is also working with Dr. Frederick Churchill of Indiana University.
During the course of this professional development award, Dr. Dinsmore is
gaining familiarity with and experience in the methods and materials of the
history of science and acquiring the skills in doing research in this area. The
research component of this award is directed towards examining the
transformation of zoology from an observational to a controlled experimental
science. Dr. Dinsmore hypothesizes that this transformation occurred in the 18th
century and centered on the issue of animal regeneration studies. Dr. Dinsmore
has found that from the start of these regeneration studies, the simplicity of
experimental execution allowed virtually anyone to repeat the observations; the
network of correspondence assured that the discovery of animal regeneration
would be broadcast widely and that the experiments would be replicated with
varying results and interpretations; and the novelty of the results would
attract wide attention from a broad range of the educated public. Dr. Dinsmore
is investigating how these circumstances helped to transform what had typically
been an examination of "curiosities of nature" into a systematic science. He is
carrying this research out at the University of Chicago, at Indiana University
and at the Bibliotheque Publique et Universitaire in Geneva Switzerland.
