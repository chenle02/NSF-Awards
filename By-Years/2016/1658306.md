The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide
home owners with reliable, real-time appliance energy information and guidance
to manage their electricity consumption more efficiently and to facilitate the
transition to distributed renewable energy generation and local microgrids
through a low cost electricity data acquisition and analytic device. A smart
energy system relies on balancing various internal power demands in order to
maximize efficiency and minimize cost to users. This technology offers a low-
cost, easily-installed device that can be used in residential settings, allowing
consumers to identify which appliances are operating at a particular time and
the real-time cost of electricity consumption. It can provide real-time data to
the residential customers in order to facilitate broader energy management of
distributed installations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on
a smart energy analytic disaggregation system is built with open-source,
embedded system composed of low-cost, off-the-shelf components, combining
hardware and software. The system uses mathematical transformations to compress
the data and machine-learning classification algorithms on the embedded
processor to decompose building electric circuit load signals. Data are linked
to appliance specific components by capturing and analyzing current and voltage
data at a high sampling rate, differentiating among individual appliance
signals, their harmonics, and unique signatures. The device has capacity for
multiple sensors and can be updated continuously or daily via the existing
internet infrastructure. The more devices and the longer it measures and
analyzes, the better the algorithm becomes at appliance energy use
identification.
