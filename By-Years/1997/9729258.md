ABSTRACT EEC-9729258 SCOTT The oil and gas industries have a significant impact
on almost all aspects of life in the U.S. The Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Corrosion in Multiphase Systems at Ohio University
(EEC-9220961) studies the flow of gas and oil in pipelines. Louisiana State
University is attempting to become a research site associated with the Center.
This proposal funds a planning meeting to determine the feasibility and
viability of Louisiana State University becoming a research site of the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Corrosion in Multiphase
Systems. The research agenda envisioned for the added research site would
address multi-phase drag reduction. The specific projects being considered are
"Field-Scale Testing of Multiphase Drag Reduction in Wells."
