The overarching objective of the work proposed here is to support a productive
interdisciplinary collaboration that will simultaneously generate meaningful
quantitative research results in the neurosciences and foster the acquisition of
the physiological background that will permit me to develop an independent
research program in quantitative modeling of neuronal morphogenesis. The
proposed work will be performed at the Center for Collaborative Neuroscience at
Rutgers University, and will focus on developmental and regenerative mechanisms
associated with Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurons and their associated glia.
This work will involve two research projects to be performed under the guidance
of Prof. Wise Young, MD PhD and Chair of Cell Biology &amp; Neuroscience, and
Prof. Martin Grumet, PhD and Director of the Center, in close collaboration with
appropriate faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and visiting
scientists affiliated with the Center. The aims of this work are to quantitative
test the hypotheses that morphogenesis of Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurites in
vitro can be well described by a stochastic model, and that the function of such
stochastic morphogenesis is to efficiently explore space in search of targets.
The approach that will be used to achieve these aims will involve direct
numerical simulations of axonal and glial structures that are validated and
modified to accord with 3D imaging of neuronal cultures. Throughout this work,
the guiding objective will be to use modeling to derive concrete, testable
predictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IGMS project is jointly supported by the
MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of
Mathematical Sciences (DMS).&lt;br/&gt;
