The National Science Foundation supports a number of incoherent scatter radars
spread in latitude from the polar regions to the equator. These facilities are
used to study the upper atmosphere and ionosphere in order to understand the
global changes that occur due to the impact of solar radiation and particles
from above and tidal,gravity wave and electrical inputs from below. This project
is a continuation of studies aimed at the understanding of the low and
equatorial electrodynamics using data primarily from the incoherent scatter
radars at Jicamarca,Peru and Arecibo,Puerto Rico, but also in conjunction with
in situ satellite data. The main areas to be considered at this time relate to
the response at these low latitudes to sudden changes at high latitudes,
perturbations associated with magnetospheric and disturbance dynamo electric
fields and comparison with various convection and electric field models. 8/16/89
