9614229 McMillan This research proposes to develop and calibrate a new method of
volatile analysis based on infrared reflectance spectroscopy, which will only
require singly polished samples, and which does not rely on measurement of
sample thickness for concentration determination. Preliminary results show that
the technique will work for CO3 and H2O species in the concentration range above
~0.1-0.5 wt% for basaltic compositions, and encouraging results have been
obtained for CO2 dissolved in rhyolite at the 500-2000 ppm level. These
fundamental spectroscopic studies will be applied to several suites of samples.
The results will be useful to workers in the fields of geochemistry and
volcanology.
