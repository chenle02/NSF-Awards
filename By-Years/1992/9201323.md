This project will organize, convene and report on an NSF regionally-based
workshop on architectural research needs in earthquake hazard mitigation. The
workshop will review and analyze the current state-of-the-art in relation to a
range of earthquake hazard mitigation in architectural and nonstructural
systems, and in relation to broader land-use planning issues and physical urban
design issues. Future research needs will be identified and prioritized for
these same systems under the goals of the Architectural and Mechanical Systems
(AMS) program element. As one of three regional workshops on the topic subject,
this workshop will focus on East-Coast issues. A Final Report on Workshop
results will be issued for distribution to the architectural and urban design
research community and for NSF use in program development.
