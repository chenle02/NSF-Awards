Molecular dynamics models materials at the level of atomic scale. In a computer
simulation one follows the motion of the atoms, which obeys Newton's second law.
For crystalline solids, molecular dynamics offers a microscopic description of
the crystal and defect structure, which is ultimately responsible for the
overall material properties. It offers more insight on why the material behaves
the way it does, and it has become an extremely important tool in material
modeling and simulations. However due to the computational complexity, such a
simulation can only be conducted for a small system. Typically it is focused
around material defects where the deformation is quite large, and the atoms in
the far field are eliminated. Such a truncation procedure creates artificial
boundaries, where boundary conditions have to be imposed in order to take into
account the missing atoms. The boundary condition provides, for example, the
position of the atoms at the boundary, which will be needed in the force
calculation for the atoms inside the system, and therefore required to allow the
simulation to proceed. Straightforward approaches often lead to wave reflection
at the boundary and therefore severely deteriorate the simulation results. This
project aims to develop systematic boundary conditions that serve the following
purposes: (a) prevent wave reflection at the boundary; (b) maintain the external
loading; (c) control the system temperature. These boundary conditions will
greatly improve the accuracy and reliability of molecular dynamics simulations
and will help to study the dynamics of material defects under various kinds of
loading, and in different temperature regimes. The project also involves
numerical analysis aspects and applications of these methods. The proposed
research will expose the students to physical modeling, large-scale simulations,
mathematical analysis, and interdisciplinary research.
