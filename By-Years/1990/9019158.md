Systematic studies of perennial species of Helianthus will follow two major
lines of research. One is to use data from analysis of chloroplast DNA
restriction site mutations to clarify several phylogenetic problems. These
include the relationship of Helianthus to the putatively related genus,
Phoebanthus, the relationships among the infrageneric groups of Helianthus
(sects. Helianthus, Ciliares, and Atrorubentes), and the relationships of two
enigmatic species, H. porteri and H. agrestis. A second major line of research
will be to use data from chemistry, chloroplast DNA and nuclear ribosomal DNA
restriction site analysis and isozymes to clarify selected situations that
involve hybridization or polyploidy in species of the genus that occur in the
southeastern United States. The results of the project will be to provide a firm
phylogeny for Helianthus as a basis to understand topics such as biogeography
and chemical evolution in the genus, and to clarify the systematics of the genus
in the southeastern United States.
