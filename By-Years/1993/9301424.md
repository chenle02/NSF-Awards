King's College requests support from NSF for connection of its campus network
to PREPnet. PREPnet is the midlevel network located in the state of
Pennsylvania. PREPnet will provide operations management and information
services and it will give operations management and information services and it
will give King's College connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
million bits per second) National Backbone network. The university needs greater
functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries,
and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail
system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a
unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational resources.
