This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research by Dr. David N. Hendrickson of the Chemistry Department,
University of California at San Diego, on electronic effects in metal-containing
solids. Detailed studies will be carried out on transition metal complexes that
have two or more electronic states which are close in energy. For compounds in
which vibrational modes are closely coupled with electronic modes, changes in
crystal lattice parameters such as those caused by modifying solvent or
counterions can result in spin-crossover or phase transitions in response to
changes in light or other external parameters. The primary goal of this project
is to verify and characterize magnetic bistability in a molecular species,
specifically a dodecanuclear manganese compound. Investigation of optically
sensitive iron complexes and electronically sensitive cobalt complexes will also
continue. The long-term goal of this research is to develop molecules or
collections of molecules for use in electronic circuits and devices. Nanoscale
devices which change spin, number of electrons, or magnetic properties in
response to electric, magnetic, optical, or thermal changes may be useful for
switches or information storage. In this research, compounds containing a small
number of metal atoms will be tested for sensitivity and specificity of response
to external physical stimuli. Only a few examples of molecules in which the
magnetic field changes in response to changes in external magnetic field are
known, so this research may open a new area of investigation.
