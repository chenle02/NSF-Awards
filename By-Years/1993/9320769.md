9320769 Tu This program provides a systematic research effort on tin-bismuth-
antimony-based solders. Their wetting behavior on copper and
silica/chromium/copper/gold surfaces is measured and compared to lead-tin
solders. The science of instability at the wetting tip due to dynamic
interfacial reaction between the liquid solder and the solid copper is
emphasized in this study. For this purpose cross-sectional transmission electron
microscopy of the reaction at the wetting tip using thin film samples is
employed. Also solder wetting on single crystal surfaces of copper is examined.
This wetting behavior is the most important processing parameter in the
selection of lead-free solder for electronic packaging. Both low melting point
(about 180C) and high melting point (about 300C) lead-free solders will be
studied. %%% The lead-based solder used in microelectronic devices is an
environment issue. For environmental conscious manufacturing lead replacement
and reliable lead-free solders are urgent issues. ***
