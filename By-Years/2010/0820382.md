The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the Georgia
Institute of Technology addresses the need for new electronic materials and
associated processes for applications in microelectronics, optics and sensors.
Materials growth methods, electrical, chemical and physical characterization,
pattern generation, device fabrication, and theory/modeling are invoked to
ensure holistic and interdisciplinary approaches to the development and
investigation of novel materials and devices. The single Interdisciplinary
Research Group on Graphene Science and Technology investigates fabrication and
characterization approaches for the implementation of epitaxial graphene as an
electronic material. The MRSEC has extensive collaborations with corporations,
national laboratories and universities world-wide. Broad educational activities
and outreach programs that integrate materials research into K-12, university
and professional education are supported and fostered. Shared experimental
facilities at Georgia Tech and partner institutions ensure the ability to
fabricate and characterize materials for use in a variety of
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
