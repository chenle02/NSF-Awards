This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Latest in
Geometric Analysis" that will be held November 24-30 of 2019 at the Mathematical
Research and Conference Center in Bedlewo, Poland. The conference focuses on
recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of geometric analysis
and geometric measure theory. A number of distinguished mathematicians have
agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award gives early career
researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF
an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing
committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups
