9634239 Emanuel Numerical weather prediction has advanced to the stage where
further improvements are increasingly limited by the observational base.
Numerical weather prediction models depend on the assimilation of observational
data collected mostly form fixed locations. However, in certain extreme weather
situations such as hurricanes or severe winter storms, additional observations
are obtained by specially deployed platforms under the supposition that
additional observations will improve the forecasts. This strategy certainly has
been successful for hurricane track forecasting. It is then logical to explore
whether the strategy of targeted observations could be applied more generally to
weather forecasting and how such a strategy could be optimized. The principal
investigators will investigate the possibility of improving forecasts by
selectively observing the atmosphere at the locations and times where the
forecast would most benefit from additional information. These locations are
determined by real-time estimates of the likelihood of error in the analysis at
the time of data assimilation and estimates of the sensitivity of forecast error
to the presence or absence of observations. As an a-priori estimate of the
likelihood of analysis error, a measure of the spread among members of an
ensemble of 6- or 12-hour forecasts would be used. Such measure is the amplitude
of the so-called "bred modes." Preliminary modeling studies show that targeting
observations based on the amplitude of these modes leads to a significant
reduction in the forecast error compared with randomly locating the same number
of observations. Further improvements may be gained by targeting observations
based on a model adjoint-derived measure of the sensitivity of forecast error to
data in the next assimilation cycle. Thus, the primary goal of this research is
to find the optimal observation targeting strategy based on both a-priori
analysis error estimate and adjoint-derived forecast error sensitiv ities. These
strategies will be tested using a hierarchy of numerical models and as part of a
field experiment in conjunction with the international Fronts and Atlantic Storm
Track Experiment (FASTEX). ***
