This area of mathematics approaches viscous transport equations in terms of a
noisy inverse flow map. This is a natural generalization of the method of
characteristics (used for inviscid problems) to viscous problems by adding noise
to particle trajectories and averaging. The main focus of this research is to
apply these techniques to the Navier-Stokes and Boussinesq equations. The
Navier-Stokes equations can be elegantly formulated in the above framework using
the inviscid Webber formula, which essentially represents the Navier-Stokes
equations as the average of the Euler equations plus Brownian motion. We have a
wide variety of applications in mind: A numerical (stochastic) method to compute
solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, a study of the effect of obstacles and
boundaries on viscous fluid flows, turbulence models for incompressible fluids,
analytical estimates and weak solutions, and front propagation in the Boussinesq
equations.

This research is based on the framework in which a viscous incompressible fluid
can be explicitly represented as the average of an inviscid fluid plus Brownian
motion. A study of several aspects of fluid dynamics in this framework is
proposed. One important application is the implementation of a numerical method
to compute fluid flows in turbulent settings (for instance air flow around an
airplane wing, or in a jet engine). A related application is to use this method
to find a "turbulence model" for fluid flows: namely, the velocity field of the
fluid is expressed as a slowly varying "mean field" (which is easy and
inexpensive to compute), plus a rapid fluctuating "noisy" part, which is modeled
using stochastic methods. Another application is to study boundary layer effects
on the interior flow in the inviscid limit. A study of burning and flame
propagation is also proposed.
