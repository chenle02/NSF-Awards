This project addresses polymer photoresist processing through infrared near
field optical micros-copy (IR NSOM) and Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy
(CARS) microscopy. These methods permit access to latent images in the polymer
film at various stages in the photoresist processing. A key aspect is to probe
the films spatially and chemically through observations of chemically modified
vibrational bands within the polymer films. The project involves an active
collaboration with scientists at IBM Almaden, William Hinsberg and Frances
Houle, who also provide deep ultraviolet, chemically amplified polymer
photoresists tailored to special require-ments of the experiments. The project
involves experiments to probe line dimensions, acid diffu-sion, the influence of
vapor uptake, and other deep UV polymer lithographic
chemistries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental research
issues associated with electronic/photonic materials having technological
relevance. Broader impacts of this work to society are that new methods of
measuring line dimensions and for following chemical processes are developed to
address ultra-small feature sizes. The results of these studies assist industry
in making less expensive and more powerful tools for society. Through the active
collaboration with William Hinsberg and Frances Houle at IBM on this particular
project, students learn essential teamwork skills and how to be responsive to
additional challenges and deadlines outside the academic environment. Students
are trained in a variety of important technologies, including lasers, optics,
photoresist chemistry, and nanoscale measurements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
