When we help others, is our ultimate goal ever to benefit them (altruistic
motivation), or is our ultimate goal always some form of self.benefit (egoistic
motivation)? Considerable evidence indicates that feeling empathy (sympathy,
compassion) for a person in need can increase the motivation to help that
person. Past research indicates that the motivation to help associated with
empathic emotion is at least in past altruistic (i.e., directed toward the
ultimate goal of increasing the others' welfare). This research will extend
earlier work, seeking the psychological antecedents of the empathy.altruism
relationship. A model is presented that identifies two proximal antecedents of
empathic emotion..perception of the other as in need and valuing the other's
welfare. This model is based on recent conceptions of emotion that emphasize the
central role of value as a precondition for emotional response. Six potential
sources of valuing another's welfare are then identified, and nine experiments
are proposed to test (1) the relationship between valuing the other's welfare
and empathy and (2) the ability of each of the proposed sources to induce
valuing of the other's welfare and, thereby, the empathy.altruism relationship.
These experiments should increase our understanding of the conditions under
which we feel empathy for a suffering person and, as a result, altruistic
motivation. This understanding, in turn, should take us an important step closer
to the development of empathy.based programs for moral education, therapy, and
organizational behavior, programs capable of fostering more positive social
relationships.
