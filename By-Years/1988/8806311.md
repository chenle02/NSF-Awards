This proposal requests support for the acquisition of a new analytical scanning
electron microscope to support research programs in materials and biological
research, conducted in the Center for Electron Microscopy and Microanalysis. The
new instrument will provide improved resolution and back scattered electron
detection, and new capabilities such as light element detection, low voltage
high resolution microscopy, electron beam induced current mapping, and electron
beam lithography.
