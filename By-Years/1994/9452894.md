9452894 Engstrom The South Dakota EPSCoR Systemic Improvement Plan is designed
to move the state towards greater research competitiveness in the upcoming three
to five year period. The plan focuses on enhancing the research capability and
productivity within South Dakota, building upon previous EPSCoR programs and
independent research accomplishments. Three institutions will be involved: the
University of South Dakota, South Dakota State University, and the South Dakota
School of Mines and Technology. The plan is organized into two fundamental
parts, the building of infrastructure and scientific research focus areas.
Infrastructure development will include: 1) strategies that build a sustained
research base in South Dakota; 2) strategies that impact short-term research
productivity; and 3) strategies that relate to economic development. The
infrastructure activities will be implemented within the context of three
interdisciplinary and interinstitutional scientific research foci. The first
group, "Surface and Interfacial Science," builds upon developing expertise in
structure and processes occurring at the junction of two dissimilar phases. The
second project, "The Role of Membranes in Cell Regulation," involves scientists
from various disciplines within the biological sciences. A third project,
"Imaging and Modelling of Coupled Environmental Processes," will build upon
cooperation of the universities with the EROS Data Center north of Sioux Falls.
