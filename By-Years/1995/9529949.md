9529949 Kochar While poverty is generally associated with low rates of saving, a
striking feature of a number of developing countries is the coexistence of
extreme poverty with high savings rates. In the South Asian economies, for
example, poverty coexists with household savings rates which average 16% of
disposable income. In such economies income growth appears to be constrained not
so much by the rate of savings but by the apparent willingness of households to
hold their savings in relatively low yielding forms. Understanding why this is
so is critical for designing policy which enhances the productivity of savings,
and, correspondingly, increases income. Surprisingly, there is little empirical
research on this topic, despite its obvious importance. This research planning
grant will permit the investigator to develop an empirical research program on
the relative importance of expected marriage payments and the variability in
earnings as motives for household savings in south Asian economies. This
research carries important policy implications. The belief that income
uncertainty and credit constraints motivate household savings and contribute to
the poverty of households has resulted in an influential literature which
advocates interventions in credit and insurance markets. In contrast, if
households save for consumption expenses and if it is this which diverts assets
from income-enhancing investments, the more effective policy would target
investments in areas such as women's education and employment which may have the
effect of reducing dowry payments.
