Research is conducted to determine the effects of a series of additives on soot
formation in C H /O /N diffusion flame. The additives to be studied include:
P(OCH3)3, POBr3, Sb(OCH3)3, SbBr3, CH3Br, MoBr4, and (NH4) 6M07024. The effects
of the additives are to be determined by measureing without and with additives
added to fuel or air flow: flame temperature profiles using fine wire
thermocouples; the location and intensity of emission from C2*, CH*, and soot
particles using selected bandwidth photography; total positive ion
concentrations using langmuir probes; OH concentrations using UV light
absorption; temperatures will also be measured from OH rotational line ratios;
and total soot concentrations using two wavelength laser extinction techniques.
