A critical stage in the advanced evolution of stars like the Sun occurs as they
rapidly shed the mass of their envelopes to become dying white dwarf stars.
Radiation from the hot white dwarf remnant star excites the ejected material as
it slowly leaves the vicinity. The result is an object called a "planetary
nebula", which is visible only in certain specific wavelengths. The Principal
Investigator will continue previous work in analyzing the strengths of spectral
"emission lines" to determine the chemical abundances of the material in eight
planetary nebulae in order to understand the sequence of nuclear reactions that
occurred in the interior of their central stars prior to their creation by
ejection. The PI will make use of a modern solid-state array detector (CCD) with
a new echelle spectrograph on the three-meter telescope at Lick Observatory to
enable him to measure many lines too weak to be measured in previous studies.
Also, the PI will utilize up-to-date model atmosphere computations to permit him
to synthesize the abundance results from all these data into a self- consistent
picture of the element abundances. This study will provide new information on
the effects of density variations, geometry, and chemical abundance variations
within the observed nebulae.
