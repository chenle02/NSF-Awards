Bianconi The overall goal of this proposal is to optimize the properties of new
inorganic polymer network materials and to create others of specific designed
properties by new synthetic techniques. The approach is to use a recently
devised process for the functionalization of polysilyne network polymers to
introduce new functional groups which enhance, modify, or create new electronic
and physical properties in the polymers. Specifically, fluorinated and alkoxide
side chains will be explored as means of improving these polymers' sensitivities
as deep UV photoresists. Grafted polymer sidechains will also be studied as
means of altering the polymers' solubility properties and decreasing their
absorptivities at 193 nm, the target wavelength in microlithographic
applications. Attempt will be made to create new surface-imaging methods, and
new materials, by applying functionalization reaction sequence to solid-state
surfaces. Finally, syntheses and properties will be optimized for two new
network backbone polymer systems, the polystannynes and the polycarbynes. The
tin-based polymers will be studied as soluble photolytic precursors to
conductive and transparent optical glasses, and the carbon-based polymers will
be studied as examples of previously-unknown carbon-based macromolecules and as
low temperature and pressure precursors to diamond and hard carbon ceramics. %%%

would have substantial impact on the development of new fabrication and
processing procedures for electronic and photonic devices and for the
understanding of the fundamental chemistry and properties of soluble inorganic
network.
