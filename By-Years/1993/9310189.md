9310189 Council Different personality constructs are often assessed during the
same research session. Although widely employed, this methodology may be
vulnerable to context effects. Context effects occur when the taking of one
personality scale influences scores on another scale administered in the same
assessment context. This project will systematically investigate context effects
in personality assessment through examining their cause, their degree and scope,
and possible remedies. The goal of the research is to improve on previous
research through testing predictions from a general theory of context effects in
personality assessment and confining the context to a specific domain of
personality, negative affectivity. The desired outcome of the research is to
provide better information on the generalizability of context effects. ***
