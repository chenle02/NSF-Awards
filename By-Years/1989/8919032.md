The low-temperature properties of amorphous solids are remarkably different from
the well-understood behavior of crystalline materials. At temperatures below 1K
this difference is caused by localized excitations. It is not known what the
excitations are for any amorphous solid, but they appear to arise from the
tunneling motion of some entity having atomic size. A purpose of the proposed
research is to further establish the role of the localized excitations in seveal
low-temperature properties, to determine how to manipulate or control the
excitations, and eventually to identify the excitations in certain amorphous
systems. At higher temperatures, both the specific heat and thermal conductivity
of glassy solids again exhibit unusual behavior normally not found in a crystal.
The proposed research will also attempt to establish a qualitative explanation
for these features. The experimental approach involves measurements of specific
heat, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and ultrasonic and dielectric
dispersion on samples of silicate glasses, amorphous polymers, and
orientationally disordered solids as the disordered matrix of each sample is
modified systematically.
