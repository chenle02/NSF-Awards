Dr. Joseph Noel has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Noel's doctoral degree was from Ohio State University under the
direction of Professor Ming-Daw Tsai. Dr. Noel intends to continue research at
Yale University under the sponsorship of Professor Paul Sigler. Dr. Noel's area
of postdoctoral research will be the elucidation of the structural basis for
enzymic catalytic mechanisms as revealed largely by x-ray crystallography. He
will be crystallizing the membrane photoreceptor protein, rhodopsin. The
experience gained from this study should facilitate longer-range studies of the
structure, chemistry and evolution of chorismate mutase. The Postdoctoral
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
