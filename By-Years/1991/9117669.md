This research involves the investigation of the seismic structure and tectonics
of back-arc spreading centers and subducting slabs using body waveforms. The
structure of back-arc basins undergoing current extension will be compared to
the structure of inactive backarcs, and the width of the zone of low seismic
velocity and high attenuation beneath backarc rifts will be determined. Also,
the configuration of possible aseismic extensions of slabs into the lower mantle
will be investigated by means of S-wave residuals. In both studies, earthquake
body phases along several paths will be utilized to reduce the effect of
earthquake location and seismic structure uncertainties.
