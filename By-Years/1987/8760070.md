This grant supports R&amp;D toward a nuclear radiation detector based on the
cubic semiconductor TlBr. The research will be focussed primarily on developing
techniques for producing single crystals of high purity Thallium Bromide. The
high atomic numbers of the constituent materials of this new semiconductor imply
high photo-electric absorption efficiency, and correspondingly more compact
detectors than are now commonly available. In addition, the 2.5 eV bandgap of
the material permits operation at temperatures up to 250oC. A detector with
these characteristics would find a wide range of specialized applications.
