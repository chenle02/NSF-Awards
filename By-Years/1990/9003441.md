The primary goal of this research is to extend the theoretical basis for
designing and maintaining programming languages. The ultimate goal of this line
of research is to give programming language designers more ability to design
languages which can be methodically extended in a variety of directions (e.g.,
the introduction of parallelism) and implemented on a variety of machines while
preserving the correctness of existing programs. To achieve this goal, a number
of basic conceptual issues, and some case studies will be examined to
investigate the practical importance of the theory. The conceptual issues
include the relations between operational, denotational, and axiomatic
semantics, the definitional and conceptual power of structured operational
semantics, and expressiveness of various sequential and parallel primitive
operations. The case studies may include the design of parallel extensions of
ML.
