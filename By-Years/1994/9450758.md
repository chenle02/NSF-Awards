9450758 Martinez-Planell Through this project, a coalition of two and four year
colleges and universities in Puerto Rico are changing the way calculus is
taught. In addition to preparing faculty to use the Core Calculus Curriculum
materials, the project is promoting and assessing the use of collaborative
learning techniques with the Hispanic student population. The materials produced
as well as the assessment of student achievement will also be of value to
universities with large Hispanic populations.
