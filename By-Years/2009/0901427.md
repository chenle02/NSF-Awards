attention on characterizing local Noetherian rings in terms of the behavior of
certain subcategories of modules, extending her research to methods from
homological algebra and representation theory. The idea stems from a successful
description of rings of finite Cohen-Macaulay type, which flourished in the mid
1980s. Results about finite-dimensional algebras are generalized to rings of
higher dimension. Such a description was recently extended to rings with a
finite Gorenstein type. The PI?s main goal is to understand which categories of
modules have the right properties to provide a description of the ring when
finiteness conditions are available. To do so, the PI proposes to investigate
further the relationship between the properties of the category of totally
reflexive modules and those of the base ring. For example, the PI proposes to
understand the long standing open problem to characterize which properties of
the ring force every totally reflexive module to be free. As totally reflexive
modules come from infinite complexes, the investigation naturally includes
methods from homological algebra, where the properties of modules are linearized
by a possibly infinite approximation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is
devoted to investigating problems in commutative algebra with the main goal
being to understand the set of solutions of polynomial equations in many
variables. In the effort to describe such a set of solutions, algebraists study
the set of functions defined on the set of solution when a visual intuition is
not available. As functions can be added and multiplied, the set of functions
has the structure of a commutative ring, of which the most familiar example is
the ring of polynomials. It is well established that understanding a ring is
tantamount to understanding the category of its modules, which are
generalization of vector spaces over fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
