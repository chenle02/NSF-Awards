The Department of Mathematics at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology will purchase computing equipment which will be dedicated to the
support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for
several projects, including in particular: 1. Algorithms on 4-connected Halin
Graphs and Reduced Halin Graphs. 2. A Branch and Cut Approach to Problems in
Computational Logic. 3. Bayesian Estimation of Weibull Parameters. 4. Griffith
Cracks Within a Finite Anisotropic Solid. 5. Semi-coarsening Multigrid Methods
for Elliptic Partial Differential Equations.
