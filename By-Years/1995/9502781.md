9502781 Wysin This U.S.-Brazil Collaborative Research grant will support the
research of Gary Wysin, Kansas State University, in collaboration with A. S. T.
Piers and M. E. Gouvea of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais to perform
theoretical and computational analyses of the properties of topological
nonlinear excitations in quasi-two-dimensional magnets. The research will extend
the current understanding of the properties of the vortex, soliton, and spinwave
excitations in these systems. The magnetic properties of topological excitations
will be determined partly by perturbation theory from exactly known solutions,
and partly by numerical simulations. The proposed studies will provide a better
understanding of the particular spin structures that make up the topological
excitations in two-dimensional magnets, as well as determine the internal normal
modes of the excitations. An important contribution will be the characterization
of the role of topological excitations in the phase transitions in such magnets.
While topological defects have been shown to be significant factors in phase
transitions in superfluids and superconductors, in liquid crystals, and in other
physical systems, the proposed work will carry the investigation of these
effects to easy-plane and easy-axis two-dimensional magnets. The Brazilian group
brings experience in the analytical study of such properties, while the U.S.
group has experience in computer simulation of the same class of properties. ***
