Property (T), which states that every isometric action of a group on Hilbert
space has a fixed point, is an indispensable tool in the study of rigidity.
Isometric actions on Hilbert space can be described in the language of low-
dimensional cohomology with coefficients in a unitary representation. A result
of Chatterji-Drutu-Haglund shows that median space actions are sufficiently rich
to embody the theory of isometric actions on Hilbert space. Through this
proposal, the PI will expand on recent collaborations and look at the
connections between isometric Hilbert space actions and actions on median spaces
via the tool of low dimensional cohomology.

Newton affirmed that the universe "looks the same in every direction." This
cosmological principle leads to the conclusion that the large scale geometry of
the universe must be spherical (absence of parallel lines), Euclidean
(uniqueness of parallel lines), or hyperbolic (existence and non-uniqueness of
parallel lines). These geometries can only be understood in the large scale
since Einstein's theory of general relativity asserts that masses locally
distort the space-time fabric. Understanding the study of large scale geometry
and symmetry was revolutionized by Gromov's approach to group theory. A group is
the collection of symmetries of an object. The PI's research is concerned with
CAT(0) geometry, a mix between Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries. More
specifically, she studies rigidity, which can be thought to address the
questions: 1) Can a group be represented as a collection of symmetries of a
certain geometric object? 2) If so, is such a representation unique? The study
of rigidity is important in its own right as a mathematical phenomenon.
Nevertheless, it could one day lead to a better understanding of our universe.
