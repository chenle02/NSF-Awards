9401015 Hsia This grant supports the research of Professors J. Hsia to work on
problems in number theory. Professor Hsia will continue to work on the
arithmetic of integral and hermitian quadratic forms. Inparticular he will work
on strong approximation for definite spaces and effectiveness results. He also
intends to continue his study of spinor genera. This is research in the field of
number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as
the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest fields
of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons.
However, within the last half century, it has become an essential tool in
developing new algorithms for computer science and new error correcting codes
for electronics.
