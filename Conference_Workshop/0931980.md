BLAST 2009, 2010, 2011

The 2009-2011 BLAST conferences will be the second through fourth in a series of
yearly meetings devoted to logic and related areas of mathematics based in the
mountain/western midwest region. The BLAST conference series focuses on Boolean
Algebra, Lattice Theory, Algebraic Logic, Universal Algebra, Set Theory, and
Set-theoretic Topology. Together, these areas form a cohesive sub-unit of logic
and have strong connections with other mathematical disciplines such as Algebra,
Combinatorics, General Topology, and Mathematical Physics.

The 2009 meeting will take place August 10--14, 2009, at the New Mexico State
University at Las Cruces, the 2010 meeting will take place at the University of
Colorado at Boulder, the 2011 meeting will take place at the University of
Kansas at Lawrence.

The BLAST 2009 program includes 8 invited speakers, 4 tutorials, and 40--60
contributed talks. There will be substantial funds designated support travel and
lodging for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.
