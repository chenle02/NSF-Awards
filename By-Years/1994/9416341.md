ABSTRACT This proposal is for travel funds to help support a workshop designed
to bring chemists and chemical engineers together for the purpose of defining
research horizons for "Environmentally benign chemistry". The intended audience
is academic chemists and chemical engineers. The workshop will be sponsored by
the National Science Foundation (CTS and Chemistry Divisions), Council for
Chemical Research, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Center
for Waste Reduction Technology (AIChE). The program committee consists of
chemists and chemical engineers from industry, and make decisions on financial
support of the academics who attend. We anticipate a total attendance of less
than 100. The main goals of the workshop are to develop areas of focus for
research into chemical synthesis and process engineering as they relate to
environmental concerns; interest the academics, especially the chemists, in
these research areas; and provoke brainstorming on environmentally relevant
basic research in the chemical sciences at universities.
