This project is a collaborative effort to construct the first self- consistent
computational model of a substorm by coupling the physics of the inner
magnetosphere and the ionosphere (as represented by the Rice Convection Model)
and the physics of the tail (as represented by the Los-Alamos/Goddard MHD model
of tail dynamics). A third element is an equilibrium code that has been
developed through a Los Alamos - Goddard - Rice collaboration. The fully merged
Tail-MHD/RCM model is anticipated to be a powerful tool for testing substorm
ideas for theoretical consistency and for making precise theoretical predictions
that can be compared with observations. The project has evolved as part of the
GEM effort to develop a modular Global Geospace General Circulation Model and
consists of a prototypical coupling of a Core Module to a Tail/Substorm Module.
