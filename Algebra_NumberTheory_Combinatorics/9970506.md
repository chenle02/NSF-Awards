Abstract

This project involves the construction of modular generating series associated
to algebraic cycles on certain Shimura varieties. The fact that such generating
series should be the q-expansions of modular forms reflects some sort of hidden
symmetry in the distribution of algebraic subvarieties of these varieties. In
addition, in certain cases, there is a more delicate type of generating series
whose coefficients lie in the arithmetic Chow groups of an integral model of a
Shimura variety. Such series appear to be related to the derivatives of Siegel-
Eisenstein series and hence, in turn, to the central derivatives of automorphic
L-functions. Thus, it is hoped that one may ultimately obtain information about
higher dimensional analogues of the Gross-Zagier formula and the Birch-
Swinnerton Dyer conjecture.

The powerful techniques which are now emerging in modern number theoretic
geometry have made it possible to manage previously intractable problems
centered about solving equations with integers. Strong connections have been
found between the geometric properties of graphs associated with an equation and
the integer solutions to that equation. For example, the celebrated Mordell
conjecture, proved by Faltings in 1983, asserts an equation whose graph is a
surface with at least two holes can have only a finite number of integer
solutions. The present project involves more complicated versions of this
connection in which the equations and their graphs require extra dimensions and
the `integer solutions' may actually be other kinds of geometric objects
(curves, surfaces, etc.)
