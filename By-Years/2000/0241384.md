Penrose's Cosmic Censorship Conjectures suggest that, in astrophysically
realistic strong-field gravity situations, Einstein's theory of general
relativity will break down (become singular), as a crushing singularuty that
destroys all matter that falls into it. Examples are known of solutions to the
theory with completely different types of singularities. In most cases, it is an
open question, as to whether the singularity structure of these examples is
stable or whether the addition of realistic matter will convert the singularity
to the crushing type. The question is open because calculation of the new
solution including matter is very difficult. The PI and collaborator have
developed a number of conjectures to bypass the difficulty be relating the
singularity structure of the new (but unknown) solution to the behavior of test
(non-gravitating) matter in the original solution.. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project continues the development and testing of these conjectures for classical
and quantum mechanical matter sources. This is an RUI project. Undergraduates
from the US Naval Academy will be involved in this reserach through the use of
algebraic manipulation software to test the conjectures.
