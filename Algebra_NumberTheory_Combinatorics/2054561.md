The theory of cluster algebras is a young research area in mathematics that was
set in motion by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2002. Their original motivation came
from representation theory, a branch of modern algebra, which examines the
symmetries of an algebraic structure rather than examining the structure
directly. Representation theory has numerous applications in physics and
chemistry as well as other mathematical fields. The cluster algebras provide a
mathematical framework for fundamental patterns that occur throughout
representation theory. Surprisingly, these patterns are also observed in various
other branches of science which, a priori, are not related to representation
theory. This project will enhance the understanding of cluster algebras and
provide new research directions in an already highly active research area. The
investigator will establish and develop relations between cluster algebras and
other areas of mathematics. These new connections will allow explicit
computational results as well as structural development. The project will also
investigate longstanding open questions. The project will involve graduate
students in the proposed research.

The research project focuses on cluster algebras and their relation to
combinatorics, knot theory, number theory, and representation theory of finite-
dimensional algebras. The investigator will pursue several objectives. He will
work on establishing explicit formulas for the generators of a cluster algebra
of arbitrary type. He will also develop a fundamental connection between cluster
algebras and knot theory which will realize important knot invariants as
specialized cluster variables. Furthermore, he will create a combinatorial model
for the category of maximal Cohen-Macauley modules over a class of finite-
dimensional algebras that arise naturally in additive categorifications of
cluster algebras as the endomorphism algebras of clusters. He will also study
Markov numbers from a novel point of view using the cluster algebra of the once-
punctured torus.
