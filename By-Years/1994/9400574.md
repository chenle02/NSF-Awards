9400574 Nakamura This project involves an investigation into the vertical
transport of potential vorticity in baroclinic eddies as a means of
understanding the tropospheric potential vorticity budget. The principal
investigator is particularly interested in the roles of the surface
frontogenesis and tropopause folds as sources/sinks of potential vorticity as
well as the rate of exchange between the troposphere and stratosphere in storm
track regions. The research will involve the use of several idealized two-
dimensional and a three dimensional model to look the processes by which
transport occurs and an analysis of a year long model simulation of the general
circulation done with a state-of-the-art model to assess the statistics of
potential vorticity variability. This research is important for understanding
atmospheric general circulation and may provide important insights into
tropospheric-stratospheric exchanges and the transport of anthropogenic gases
into the stratosphere. ***
