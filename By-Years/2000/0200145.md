This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Molecular characterization of
microbial respiratory arsenate reduction: diversity and environmental expression
of metalloid reductase genes." Microbial respiratory arsenate reduction can
significantly alter the mobility and toxicity of arsenic in the environment.
Little is known about the molecular mechanisms for arsenic respiration. The
research goals of this research are to identify genes involved in arsenate
respiration in a variety of species, including Sulfurospirillum and Shewanella
strains, and measure arsenate respiratory activity in contaminated sites.
