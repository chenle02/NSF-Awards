Tropical cyclones, with their conspicuous signatures on weather satellite
images, pose a tremendous threat to human life and properties when they make
landfalls. Our understanding of their genesis and evolution, however, is
limited. One contributing factor to this limited understanding is the oceanic
location of the tropical cyclones where routine meteorological observations are
few. Through Professor Gray's conscientious effort, he has a unique collection
of rawindsonde and aircraft reconnaissance data of the tropical cyclones in all
ocean basins, spanning the last decade or two. Theoretical work and numerical
simulations of tropical cyclones promote progress only after they meet
observational evidence. Under this grant, Professor Gray will continue his
observational studies of the formation, structure, change in intensity, and the
tracks of tropical cyclones. Professor Gray is respected internationally for his
contribution to the study of tropical cyclones. He is certainly well qualified
to pursue the work.
