Hurtado, Hill Throughout South America, indigenous communities are less
economically prosperous and more vulnerable to infectious diseases than are
neighboring rural peasant non-indigenous communities. Little is known about the
extent to which economic prosperity is affected by the health status of adults
in diverse rural communities. This project will study the relationship between
health and economic productivity. In association with a public health project
funded by NIH, the NSF project will do preliminary work to prepare for a major
project to test hypotheses derived from a causal path model with adult health
status as the predictor variable, economic productivity and various aspects of
economic decision making as intermediate variables, and the well-being of
household members as the outcome variable; examine and control for the effects
of ethnicity on causal variables in the model; determine to what extent
variation in health status across communities accounts for differences in
economic prosperity in the communities in the Mbaracayu Reserve in eastern
Paraguay.
