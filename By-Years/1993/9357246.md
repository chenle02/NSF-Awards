9357246 Hardin Understanding how single cells and sheets of cells move, and
what controls their movements, is fundamental for understanding early embryonic
development. A particularly striking series of morphogenetic movements occurs
during gastrulation, when massive tissue movements and cell migrations transform
the early embryo from a hollow ball or disc to a three-layered embryo possessing
all of the basic structures of the emerging organism. Because the movements of
gastrulation are so complex and dramatic, we have turned to a seemingly simple
system, the sea urchin embryo, in order to discover general rules that all
embryos use during gastrulation. In particular, we want to answer the following
questions: (1) What motile behavior(s) underlie epithelial cell rearrangement
during gastrulation, and how are such behaviors coordinated to produce
invaginations? (2) How do such rearrangements rely on attachments of epithelial
cells to the apical extracellular matrix, or apical lamina, and to the basal
lamina? In order to answer these questions, our laboratory is seeking to use
novel approaches to unite classical techniques, computer-enhanced imaging, and
molecular biology. In particular, we will use computer-assisted videomicroscopy
and low-level fluorescence imaging to study the motility of cells as they
rearrange during gastrulation. Using the imaging techniques as an analysis tool,
we will use blocking antibodies and competitive peptides, either expressed from
cDNA clones or synthesized directly, to examine the effects of perturbing the
attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix on motility in rearranging
epithelia. In addition, we will use the technique of chromophore- assisted laser
inactivation of protein function (CALI) to perturb these attachments at a highly
local level to examine very specific regions of interest during gastrulation. As
an embryo develops, the fairly featureless fertilized egg must be transformed
into an animal with a recognizable body plan and many highly organized
structures. This NSF Young Investigator Award supports studies on the forces
that shape embryos. In particular, we are interested in gastrulation, when cells
move in dramatic ways to reshape the embryo, producing the basic body plan of
the animal. We are studying a simple system, the sea urchin embryo, with the
hope that by understanding this simple organism, we will eventually understand
much more complex one. ***
