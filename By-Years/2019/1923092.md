A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is being organized as part of
the 40th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Programming Language Design and
Implementation (PLDI), the premier conference in the areas of programming
languages and compilers. The conference will be held in Phoenix, Arizona, as
part of ACM's Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC). This award
specifically supports students from underrepresented groups and gives priority
to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the mentoring workshop in
addition to the PLDI conference. The impact of the award relates to broadening
participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to receive
mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of
researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in programming languages and
compilers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
