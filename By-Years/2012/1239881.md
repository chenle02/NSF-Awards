This proposal supports student involvement and attendance at the 2012 ACM
Siggraph Conference. This is the premier computer graphics conference in the
world, attracting over 15,000 attendees and typically filling over 100,000 feet
of exhibition space. The annual film show is a venue for viewing the latest
advances in animation and visualization. Although many attendees come for the
exhibition, the Siggraph Conference has long been the premier place to publish
technical papers in computer graphics. The Siggraph Pioneers (20+ years of work
in the field) started a mentoring program in 2003 to add more students to the
technology pipeline. While small in number, the impact has been high as the
students do not merely attend the conference, but rather are mentored by
longstanding members of the community. Because each Pioneer is assigned no more
than two students, the Pioneer guides the students to talks, courses, etc. that
were not immediately on the student's radar. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit and broader impact of the proposed activity lies in the
educational opportunities provided the student by the mentoring process. The
program also focuses on underrepresented groups (e.g., women, Hispanics, and
African-American) who would have no opportunity to hear about Siggraph, let
alone attend, without the mentoring program. The students are exposed to the
latest research and hardware covering the use of computer graphics for numerous
topics that benefit society ranging from engineering design to entertainment.
