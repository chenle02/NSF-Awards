This CAREER Award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports the research and education plans of Karin Ruhlandt-Senge of
Syracuse University. The goal of the proposed research is to develop reliable
synthetic routes to organoalkaline-earth derivatives. Initial studies will be
directed toward facile routes to prepare diorgano alkaline-earth species and
organo alkaline-earth halides. Possible applications in synthetic inorganic,
organic, polymer and materials chemistry will be explored. The advantages of
heavier organoalkaline-earth derivatives over organomagnesium derivatives will
be investigated. Graduate students and students in undergraduate laboratories
will be involved in the work and will learn to prepare air-sensitive compounds
and handle them by Schlenk and dry-box techniques. Ruhlandt-Senge has developed
a combined laboratory experience involving mentorship between seniors and first
year chemistry students in which they prepare and investigate carefully chosen
inorganic compounds. Ruhlandt-Senge is also involved in the Minority High School
Student Apprenticeship Program and participates in the training of high school
and prospective high school teachers.
