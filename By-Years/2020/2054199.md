Operator Theory was originally developed as a mathematical language to describe
Quantum Mechanics. It has spread to many other areas in pure and applied
mathematics, such as Control Theory. Control Theory is the design of systems
like automatic pilots and self-driving cars that must react, but not over-react,
to their environment. As the systems get more complex, and more features are
incorporated, new problems arise. The PI will work on developing new
mathematical tools to deal with these problems. This project also contributes to
US workforce development through the training of graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will study problems in Operator theory,
function theory, and the interaction between them. Non-commutative functions are
functions whose input is two (or more) operators, and whose output is an
operator. This is a relatively new field, but already has applications in
control theory, algebraic geometry, and semi-definite programming. The PI will
study non-commutative functions, which can often shed light on the commutative
case, and have recently become important in Control Theory. The methods will be
a combination of techniques from multivariable operator theory, functional
analysis and several complex variables. In addition, the PI will work on using
mathematical models to study the development of Alzheimer's disease, the
analysis of acoustic signals, and risk measurement models for
COVID-19.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
