This project corrects a deficiency in the instrumentation available for
laboratory use in the multi-disciplinary Environmental Science program at
Youngstown State University. Acquisition of an organic carbon analyzer, a
particle size analyzer, two inverted microscopes and, a purge and trap apparatus
for trihalomethane is used to supplement instruction related to pollutant
transport in natural waters and assessment of drinking water quality. Laboratory
experiments are combined with lectures, giving students a thorough understanding
of key environmental problems and the most modern techniques for quantifying
them. The ultimate goal is to enhance the qualifications and employment
potential of chemistry, biology, and civil engineering graduates for careers in
the environmental field. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
