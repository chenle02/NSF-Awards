This award provides funds to the anthropology department of Clevland State
University (CSU) to purchase a representative set of key hominoid fossil primate
teaching casts. The casts requested will be used to institute formal laboratory
sections that will accompany an upper level undergraduate course in human
paleontology. The casts will also be used for introductory courses, and human
osteology courses. Students in the human paleontology course will be required to
carry out a series of exercises that illustrate the quantitative and qualitative
techniques which are used in analyses of (a) phylogenetic reconstruction, (b)
identification of evolutionary trait complexes, (c) allometric size and scaling,
and (d) functional morphology, In addition, students will be required to
maintain a computer data base for weekly lab reports and their evaluations of
various analytic techniques. The funds will (a) permit expansion of CSU
undergraduate course offerings in physical anthropology, (b) provide
anthropology majors, minors, and non-majors with an opportunity to directly
confront fossil evidence of human evolution, (c) provide students with an
opportunity to conduct, or initiate, analyses that directly involve fossil
discoveries that have played a pivotal role in the development of human origins
theories, and (d) encourage interest in graduate studies directed toward
improving our understanding of human morphological and behavioral adaptations.
The grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal
sources.
