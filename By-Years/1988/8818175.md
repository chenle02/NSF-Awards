The objective of this project is to conduct research on the potential use of
helium, injected into water, as a tracer to determine pathways used by the water
in its movement through aquifers, suboceanic and other hydrologically important
environments. Tracers now used for this purpose include various types of salts,
dyes and radioactive substances. This research involves development of an
instrument, based on use of a detector, the operation of which exploits the know
high permeation of helium through quartz glass. Plans are to evaluate the
concept on several different types of problems that require the tracing of the
movement of water including determination of the hydrological properties of
aquifers, locations of interconnections between sources and sinks of pollutants,
and tracing of pathways that provide for movement of water through fissured and
fractured rocks. The calibration of mathematical models that predict the fate of
environmental pollutants that move through subsurface media and that are
discharged into surface waters is dependent on use of tracers. Helium is
potentially advantageous for use as a tracer in comparison with substances that
are not inert and that exist environmentally in relatively large and variable
background concentrations. Helium is also relatively abundant in commercial
quantities and is reasonably soluble in water. This research may lead to use of
helium injection as a tracing method to replace or complement current practices
using conventional chemicals, dyes and radioactive substances. **
