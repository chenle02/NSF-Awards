This project is creating several integrated mathematics/physics projects that
are (1) strengthening the student's skills at applying mathematical concepts and
(2) better preparing students for a highly technical workplace. These classroom
projects use physics concepts to motivate the study of mathematical concepts.
The mathematics is immediately applied to revisit the physics concept and serves
to uncover the physics. Both the physics and mathematics community are calling
for the pedagogy used in classrooms to reflect current knowledge about how
students learn as well as to reflect the technology available. The projects
serves to produce a student-centered classroom where students are expected to
take on the responsibility for learning using the instructor as one of the
resources. Technology (CBLs and MBLs) is being utilized to collect data with
spreadsheets and graphing calculators used as tools to organize and analyze
data. Students are developing the skills that are necessary to work
collaboratively (e.g., the ability to utilize the resources of each team member,
the ability to express oneself clearly, and the ability to be sensitive to the
individual needs while still requiring a final product) as well as the skills
that are necessary for them to work independently (i.e., the ability to read
critically, the ability to develop a process and a plan of action, and the
ability to find resources as needed). Communication skills are being developed
as the solicit-confront-resolve model is used extensively. These projects
demonstrate that an integrated approach to mathematics and physics helps
students by providing them with a better understanding of the physics, and with
the ability to apply the mathematics. The projects are being disseminated at
state and national meetings of physics and mathematics professional
organizations, and by publishing the projects as a collection.
