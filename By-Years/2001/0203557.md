&lt;br/&gt;While many of the insights are readily demonstrated for dense linear
algebra operations, there are natal extensions that impact sparse direct
methods. It is the goal of the proposed project to pursue a unified approach to
all of these insights in an effort to put software architectures of linear
algebra libraries for this domain of operations on a solid scientific footing.
We will undertake a one year pilot project that will demonstrate the following:
(1) The systematic approach can be used to derive highly efficient kernels for
specialized dense linear algebra operations that are encountered in sparse
direct methods; (2) The abstract program interface that has been demonstrated to
allow high-performance implementation of dense linear algebra operations will be
extended to apply to sparse matrices that are viewed as hierarchical matrices;
(3) We will lay the foundation for a mathematical description of sparse matrices
as hierarchical matrices which we believe will allow the derivation methods to
be extended to operations on hierarchical matrices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
