This application requests partial funding for a 1988 FASEB Summer Research
Conference on "Yeast RNA: Transcription, Translation, Splicing,
Transposition,and Replication," to be held June 12-17, 1988, at the Vermont
Academy, Saxtons River, Vermont. The conference is under the auspices of the
Federation of the American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB). There will
be nine major sessions with 36 invited speakers and poster sessions. The topics
to be covered are: Transcription (including cis determinants, transacting
regulating elements, and in vitro systems), Translation and translational
regulation, Splicing (including self-splicing systems, intron-encoded maturases,
nuclear splicing, in vitro systems, and regulation by splicing), Retro-
transposition (the Tyl system, and RNA Replication (including single and double-
stranded RNA "viruses" and in vitro systems). The focus will be on yeast as the
leading model eukaryotic system. This meeting is important and relevant in that
yeast is one of the most powerful of all experimental organisms and RNA has been
recently found to have new and unexpected functions within the cell. This
meeting will bring together scientists who are involved with studies of RNA in
the yeast system who might otherwise have little interaction.
