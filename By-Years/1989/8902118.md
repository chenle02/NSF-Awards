Dr. McNutt will learn the theory and techniques relating to the acquisition,
processing, and interpretation of marine seismic data. This will allow her to
make maximum use of seismic data she has collected or plans to acquire from
French Polynesia. Dr. McNutt will teach a graduate course on the origin of depth
anomalies in the ocean basins. The course will be designed to illustrate the
importance of hypothesis testing and multi-disciplinary approaches to problem
solving. She will also organize an informal brown bag seminar series which will
provide women graduate students and junior staff members with the opportunity to
hear from more senior women scientists about their various research projects and
different approaches to balancing personal and professional activities. This
project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities
for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of
science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science
and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and
engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions. By
encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment
in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
