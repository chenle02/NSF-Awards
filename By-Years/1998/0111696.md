Dr. Victoria DeRose of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&amp;M University
is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for her work on
investigating interactions between metal ions and RNA (ribonucleic acid) in the
hammerhead ribozyme, a small catalytic RNA, using spectroscopic methods to probe
ligands bound to manganese(II) and cadmium(II) positioned at specific sites in
this ribozyme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies will further our understanding
of the metal-dependent mechanism of catalysis of ribozymes, which are novel
biocatalysts, and the contributions of metals to the structure and stability in
complex RNA systems. Students and post-doctoral associates will be trained in an
interdisciplinary area that encompasses inorganic, spectroscopic and biochemical
disciplines.
