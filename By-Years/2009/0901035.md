This proposal is aimed at breaking the convexity bounds for $L$-functions on
high rank groups. The principal investigator has already made the first progress
on breaking the convexity bounds for self dual L-functions on GL(3). The
problems related to breaking the convexity bounds for L-functions on high rank
groups in various aspects are discussed in the proposal. Concrete conjectures
are made, possible difficulties are discussed, new techniques and tools are
mentioned. These projects are closely related to one of the most fundamental
open problems in number theory - the Lindeloff hypothesis for degree n
L-functions. The subconvexity bounds are the first steps toward the Lindeloff
hypothesis.

The proposal is concerned with the study of the size of certain number
theoretical functions (infinite sums with one complex parameter) which are
constructed on some geometric spaces. Bounding such functions are important not
only because of its theoretical value but also because of its vast applications.
For example, one application would be a stronger quantum unique ergodicity
conjecture which tells us the convergence of certain measures on certain
geometric spaces as well as the rate of convergence of these measures. This is a
very important problem in mathematical physics. Other applications will be found
in the future.
