The project examines the structure of classes of problems solvable by constant-
depth families of circuits biult from unbounded fan-in gates of various
descriptions. All of the classes under consideration are contained in the
complexity class NC1, which is a model for the family of problems solvable by
very fast parallel algorithms. The principal goal of the research is to answer a
number of open questions concerning the inclusions among these classes; in
particular, to settle the question of wheather either iterated addition mod m or
the majority problem is complete for NC1 with respect to constant-depth
reductions. This work will employ the recently discovered characterization of
NC1 and its subclasses in terms of formal logic and finite automata. These
characterizations make it possible to apply model-theoretic and algebraic
methods to the study of circuit complexity. It is hoped that, in addition to
settling these immediate questions, a new methodology for proving lower bounds
in computational complexity will result, and that this will be of benefit in
studying classes of higher complexity.
