Abstract

Award: DMS-1007414 Principal Investigator: David R. Morrison

String theory provides consistent high-energy extrapolations of theoretical
models of particle physics, as well as naturally unifying those models with
gravity. One promising type of string theory model for particle physics known as
"F-theory" has seen a resurgence of interest in the past two years. The research
funded by this grant will investigate the mathematical underpinnings of F-theory
models (which are known as "elliptic fibrations" in the mathematical world),
with the goal of answering some key mathematical questions which will clarify
the physical properties of the models. The goals are the determination of the
extent to which the F-theory constructions can be studied locally; determining
how the mathematical structure of the local Picard group allows the hypercharge
gauge symmetry in the physical theory to survive to low energy; and studying
various specific aspects of elliptic fibrations (codimension three phenomena,
canonical bundle formulae) which may affect how numerous the F-theory models
are.

Particle physicists have employed a wide variety of sophisticated mathematical
tools to help explain the behavior and structure of our world at a subatomic
level. In preparation for the data which will soon be available from the Large
Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN),
theoretical particle physicists have been refining their predictions; in some
cases, these refinements can only be made if the mathematical tools themselves
are improved. The research funded by this grant aims to improve one of the
important mathematical tools currently being used, a tool known as ``elliptic
fibrations'' which comes from the geometric study of solutions of polynomial
equations, a part of the mathematical field of algebraic geometry. Recent uses
of this tool by theoretical particle physicists have focussed attention on some
areas where it needs improvement in order to be able to make the necessarily
calculations for particle physics; this research will make those improvements.
