The proposed research is concerned with the use of low temperature solid
electrolytes in fuel cells. The proposed research addresses the material
requirements for low electronic and high ionic conductivity. The proposed
approach is the formation of a two layer composite electrolyte. The first layer
will be a CeO2 -based or perovskite-based solid electrolyte with high ionic
conductivity upon which a thin layer of zirconia is deposited, using
electrochemical vapor deposition, to block the electronic current.
