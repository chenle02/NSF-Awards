Soybean is one of the world's staple foods and it is the second most cultivated
crop in the Unites States. The 14th Biennial Molecular and Cellular Biology of
the Soybean Conference, to be held August 12-15, 2012 in Des Moines (IA), will
present recent advances in the basic understanding of this crop at the sub-
organismal level, and will highlight cutting-edge technologies in soybean
genomics. The recent release of the soybean genome sequence and related genomics
tools will help improve the understanding of complex genetic traits important
for soybean improvement. This meeting attracts a wide range of soybean
researchers including molecular geneticists, breeders, physiologists, and
pathologists. Funding provided by NSF will broaden participation by defraying
the costs of participation for students and postdoctoral associates with
specific emphasis on women and underrepresented groups.
