This grant supports a study of vegetational and climatic history of southwest
Alaska as part of ongoing studies of late-Quaternary environments of
northwestern North America. Specifically, this study will: 1) describe the
relationship of modern pollen to modern vegetation and climate of southwest
Alaska, 2) collect and analyze fossil pollen from lake sites in order to
describe the paleovegetational and paleoclimatic history of the region, and 3)
combine these data with previous palynological data to enhance our present
understanding of late-Quaternary climate and vegetation in northwestern North
America.
