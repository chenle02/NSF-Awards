The award is for a planning grant funded under the Minority Research Initiation
Program. The purpose of a planning grant is to provide financial support for an
investigator to prepare a competitive research proposal. This planning grant
will enable the investigator to prepare a research proposal which focuses on
analyzing the effects of mergers and buy outs on wages in various industries. As
a result of less restrictive antitrust policy, and increased deregulation, the
frequency and size of mergers rose significantly during the 1980's. There is
concern that employment relations will be altered by this structural change in
product markets. Union leaders, for example, content that the wave of corporate
mergers in the 1980's disproportionately harmed union members. Mergers
occasionally resulted in the new corporation repudiating existing unions or
seeking major concessions. This raises the possibility that one reason for
mergers is to capture union rents. This proposed research will attempt to
explain the pattern of mergers using individual worker data.
