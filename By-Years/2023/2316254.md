Sexual harassment poses a major obstacle to the retention and advancement of
women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.
Fieldwork is an integral part of some types of STEM research, yet it presents
unique challenges that are conducive to sexual harassment, discrimination, and
incivility, including social isolation and limited communication methods.
Although universities require physical and equipment safety plans, there have
been few efforts to ensure safety from harassment in fieldwork environments.
Therefore, this project aims to pilot a Comprehensive Approach for Safe,
Inclusive, and Responsible Research (CASIR2) that specifically addresses sexual
harassment, discrimination, and incivility to promote the safety and inclusion
of women in STEM with an emphasis on off-campus and off-site research fieldwork.
The project will pilot CASIR2 with a collection of field teams, consisting of
faculty and undergraduate and graduate students, at two universities to promote
the safety and inclusion of women in STEM fieldwork. The project will contribute
to scientific knowledge about the components and conditions of strategies that
can reduce harassment.

CASIR2 consists of four components: (1) Bringing in the BystanderÂ®, an in-person
bystander intervention program, adapted for field research; (2) a Pre-departure
Orientation that includes a facilitated discussion on field safety and
respectful interactions between team members; (3) a Fieldwork Safety Toolkit
includes virtual resources detailing effective communication, setting
boundaries, and reporting; and (4) a Post-fieldwork Debrief that includes a
facilitated discussion on the fieldwork trip and review of the safety template.
The research team will quantitatively and qualitatively examine the impact of
implementing CASIR2 on research participant experiences related to sexual
harassment, perceptions of the fieldwork climate and intentions to persist in
STEM, and intentions to help others and seek help. Project findings could
improve research environments and promote greater inclusion of women in STEM.

This project is jointly funded by the Directorate for Geosciences and the
Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and is managed by
the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences.
