1636821 &lt;br/&gt;Lynd, Lee R. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks
support for the Clostridium XIV Conference that will be hosted by the Thayer
School of Engineering at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire from August
29-31, 2016. Clostridia represent an important class of bacteria that are used
for the conversion of either plant-derived carbohydrates or gases into biofuels,
such as ethanol or butanol and other useful chemicals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
scope of this international conference is to bring together the world's leading
scientists, young investigators, industrial researchers and practitioners, and
graduate students working on fundamentals and applications of solvent- and acid-
forming Clostridia to assess the latest contributions and future opportunities
in this field. Discussion topics will include physiology and genetics of
Clostridia, synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, feedstock utilization and
ecology as well as bioprocessing and industrial
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the
Conference, the award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program
of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program
of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.
