Ranked data arises from m raters ordering by some mechanism n items to express
their preferences for the item. Such data can represent election voting,
psychological and medical surveys, book and movie recommendation, and web-site
ranking system such as search engines. In this proposal the investigators
develop the theory and methodology of statistical inference in the case where n
and m tend to infinity, and each rater provides an increasingly censored or
partial preference information. Under this scenario, they demonstrate how to
obtain consistent non-parametric estimators and develop efficient computational
procedures for their use. Another aspect that is examined is visualizing
preference data by embedding it in a low dimensional space, and designing
appropriate surveys for preference data.

The methodology and theory developed in this proposal should help build superior
recommendations systems which are becoming increasingly popular in today's
online businesses. Such systems build a customized list of recommended items
based on the user's past preferences. The proposal also develops visualization
techniques for such data which should increase the ability of businesses to
analyze customer survey data. In the past such techniques have been either ad-
hoc and lacking statistical interpretation, or computationally prohibitive. This
proposal aims at developing useful tools for preference data that are both
statistically interpretable and computationally efficient, in a realistic large
data setting.
