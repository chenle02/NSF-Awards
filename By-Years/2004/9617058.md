Kirshner, Robert 96-17058 Dr. Kirshner wishes to continue the scientific
analyses made possible by the completion of the Las Campanas Redshift Survey.
The survey contains 26,418 reshifts of galaxies selected from a CCD- based
galaxy catalog covering 700 square degrees and is the best data set for
investigating many of the aspects of the distribution of galaxies in the
Universe. The list of topics includes measuring the distribution of galaxy-
galaxy velocity differences, refining the estimates of the power spectrum on
scales over 100 Megaparsecs, studying relations between galaxy spectra and
galaxy density, estimating cosmic density from kinematic signatures in the
velocity distributions and seeking clues to the underlying dark matter from the
fluctuation spectrum of galaxies on the largest scale.
