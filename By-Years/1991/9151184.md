Th3 department of Chemistry is purchasing a Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR)
Spectrophotometer for use throughout the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. The
instrument is enabling undergraduates to study theoretical and instrumental
aspects of infrared spectroscopy as well as data analysis concepts. Advanced
students are cooperatively developing new experiments with the faculty and
undertaking independent research projects with the aid of the new equipment.The
FT-IR spectrometers and associated work-stations will allow a full compliment of
modern spectroscopic training to be offered to Viterbo students. Not only will
relevant technical expertise be gained by our chemistry, biology and pre-
professional students but important knowledge about one of the most powerful
analytical techniques will be gained by our non-science students. This
experience, combined with a strong curriculum, will keep our students
competitive for future work in industrial/government laboratories, teaching or
graduate school.
