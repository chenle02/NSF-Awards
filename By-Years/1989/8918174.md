In the 1940's Barbara McClintock identified a new type of genetic element in
corn that she proposed (to the general amazement of the genetics community) to
move around within the genome. These "jumping genes" or transposable elements,
as they have come to be called, have recently been shown to exist in a wide
variety of organisms and are known to cause mutations in the DNA at sites where
they insert. As the widespread occurrence of these transposable elements became
apparent, their importance as a major source of genetic variation, subject to
natural or artificial selection to produce population change, became an issue.
The particular aspect of this problem addressed by this project is whether the
response to artificial selection for a quantitative trait (an inherited trait
controlled by many genes and influenced by environmental factors as well)
differs between populations that are genetically identical except for the
presence of a particular transposable element. The hypothesis is that mutations
caused by the transposable element in genes that affect the quantitative trait
might serve as an additional source of usable variation, allowing a greater
response to selection to occur in populations containing the element.
