This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of mass
spectrometry. During the five-year tenure of this award, Professor Williams and
his students will pursue the development of novel instrumental and computational
techniques in mass spectrometry, chromatography, and laser spectroscopy for
probing structure and function of large biomolecules; applications of new
dissociation methods for ionization in tandem mass spectrometry; and novel
sample introduction techniques for interfacing liquid chromatographic methods
with mass spectrometry. %%% The successful attainment of the goals of this
project should enable the broad advancement of analytical mass spectrometry,
especially as applied to the characterization of large biomolecules, and give
rise to substantive improvements in hybrid mass spectrometric/liquid
chromatographic methods. Additionally, this NSF Young Investigator Award should
significantly assist Professor Williams in his establishing a vital and
productive program of research and research training.
