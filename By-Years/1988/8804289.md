The objective of this research program is to advance earthquake hazard
mitigation through information obtained from the October 1, 1987 Whittier
Narrows (California) earthquake, specifically in the area of lifeline research.
The Whittier Narrows earthquake caused extensive damage to water distribution
pipelines. While theoretical modeling of earthquake induced damage has been
actively pursued, the theoretical models are based upon damage mechanisms that
are not well understood, and there is very little data related to the direct
observation of earthquake induced damage. Such data is needed to validate these
models, so that they can be used with confidence in deriving seismic design
criteria. At present there is no code for buried pipelines. Thus, this project
involves a thorough field investigation and analysis of the damage to water
lifeline systems around Whittier, California. In addition, the predictions of
the existing models are being compared with the observed behavior, and the
models are being modified based on this comparison and the understanding derived
from the observations. Finally, effective recommendations are being derived from
the models and the observations for the design of new pipelines, and the
retrofitting of existing systems.
