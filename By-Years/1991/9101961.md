The principal investigator will continue his study of submanifolds of the simply
connected constant curvature manifolds using the techniques of Lie sphere
geometry. In particular he will attempt to give a classification of the taut and
Dupin submanifolds. The investigator will also continue to involve undergraduate
students in his research thus providing them with a solid background for
graduate study. The simply connected constant curvature manifolds are Euclidean
space, the sphere, and hyperbolic space. These manifolds are very special and
serve as test cases for many questions in differential geometry. The principal
investigator will attempt to classify all submanifolds or surfaces in these
manifolds which are taut or rigid.
