9514160 Zagare This investigation refines and extends a generic two-stage
escalation model of incomplete information. In this game-theoretic model,
Defender is provided with two distinct ways (other than outright capitulation)
to resist a challenge. The Challenger is unsure of Defender's willingness to
resist either by responding-in-kind or by escalating. Previous examinations of
this model find that the status quo is almost as tenuous under policies that
requires flexibility at the local level as it is under deployment policies that
rely completely on strategic threats to deter aggression. Limited conflicts are
most likely in the policy space between the extremes of Massive Retaliation and
Flexible Response. The research generalizes and extends the underlying models to
explore certain theoretical issues raised in the course of the investigator's
prior research, and moves it toward an empirical test. To increase model
verisimilitude, Defender's capability is treated as a variable, the number of
conflict stages are increased, the sub-strategic options available to Defender
expanded, Defender's decision-making separated at each stage, and the asymmetry
assumption dropped. The end result is a firmer understanding of how acute
interstate crises can be managed, how escalation can be controlled, when and why
extended deterrence works and, especially, how limited conflicts can be kept
limited. The breakup of the Soviet Union and the subsequent disintegration of
the Warsaw Pact heightens both the significance and urgency of these important
policy problems. ***
