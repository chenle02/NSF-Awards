The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or
careers. The project at Clark Atlanta University seeks to improve students'
mastery and use of mathematical concepts through course redesign, assessment,
and implementation of evidence-based teaching strategies. Undergraduate students
are involved in the project as researchers and supplemental instruction
leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the objectives to: redesign and
implement a one-semester Pre-Calculus course; implement active learning
courseware in Pre-Calculus and Calculus I courses; conduct student enhancement
training; institute a supplemental instruction program; and conduct faculty
development. School of Education faculty participate in the project by assessing
and studying which intervention or combination thereof is most effective. This
new approach is designed to improve the quality of STEM education for all
undergraduate STEM majors, thus increasing the minority STEM talent pool of
rigorously prepared students for the workforce, graduate or professional
school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
