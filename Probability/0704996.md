We propose to investigate a number of problems in probability theory that arise
from genetics and ecology. We will extend our analysis of the impact of the
fixation of beneficial mutations, develop analytical results to help quantify
the effects of Hill-Robertson interference, which occurs when a second
advantageous mutation occurs before the first one reaches fixation and study
diffusion approximations for the related problem of codon usage bias. We will
obtain rigorous results for the sequentially Markovian coalescent, which has
recently been introduced as an approximation for genealogies with recombination,
investigate the nature of regulatory sequence evolution in Drosophila and other
organisms with large effective population size; study the subfunctionalization
explanation of the persistence of gene duplicates, and consider random Boolean
networks, in order to gain insights into gene networks. Inspired by ecology, we
will use spatial models to understand conditions needed for the emergence and
maintenance of cooperation between individuals, and we will investigate changes
that occur when the parameters governing the interactions in predator-prey and
epidemic models evolve. The last decade has seen the generation of incredible
amounts of DNA sequence data. However, having the text of the instruction manual
that controls life is just the beginning, we need to understand how the
expression of genes is controlled and how genes interact in biological networks.
These interactions cannot be directly observed so one needs to develop
mathematical models to test hypotheses, and to infer how genetic systems evolved
to operate as they do. In particular, our research will investigate (i) how
rapidly changes can occur due to regulatory sequence evolution, which is
commonly quoted explanation for many of the differences between humans and
chimpanzees, (ii) whether or not the subfunctionalization hypothesis provides a
satisfactory explanation of the paradox of the preservation of gene duplicates,
and (iii) to improve our understanding the patterns of variations caused by
adaptive evolution. These are just three examples of many at the interface
between biology and mathematics. An important aspect of our proposal is to train
graduate students to work in this exciting area.
