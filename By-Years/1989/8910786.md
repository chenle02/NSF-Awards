This research is concerned with the econometric analysis of choices made by
individuals or firms. In the case of an individual choosing among a discrete set
of alternatives (such as what mode of transportation to take to work, whether to
buy a house, etc.), a well- established approach is the model of stochastic
utility maximization. In that approach, the utility or other objective function
associated with each alternative is modelled as a parametric function of
observed variables, plus a stochastic component which represents the effects of
unobserved quantities, such as unmeasured attributes of the alternative and
taste of the individual. Specifying a joint probability distribution of these
stochastic components then leads to a choice probability model. For discrete
choice, the standard models of this type include the probit, logit, and
generalized extreme-value models. The principal focus of this project is the
extension of these methods from discrete choice to continuous choice. Examples
of continuous choice include time of day decisions (such as when to start a trip
from home to work, when to make a phone call, or when to send out a shipment)
and decisions involving geographic coordinates (such as where to locate a new
facility within a metropolitan area). This extension involves considerable
theoretical and practical difficulties, and has received much less attention in
the research literature than has discrete choice modelling. The project is
important because, first, it should result in a better understanding of the
econometric theory associated with the maximization of stochastic processes.
Secondly the study should lead to an improved understanding of the tradeoffs and
other factors involved when individuals, firms, or institutions make decisions
about geographic location and about the timing of economic activities.
