In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Sankaran Thayumanavan of the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst will develop methods for assembling organic
nanoparticles through polymer self-assembly. The research will involve three
components. In the first part, the project will focus on the development of
organic nanoparticles with well-defined surface characteristics. In the second
part, polymer-nanoparticle complexes will be generated using the well-defined
surface functional groups of the nanoparticle and the complementary functional
groups present in the polymer. The final part will involve development of
strategies for eliciting fluorescence changes in the polymer-nanoparticle
complexes due to the presence of large analyte molecules. The broader impacts of
this project will involve interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and
graduate students by cross-training the students not only across the sub-
disciplines of chemistry, but also across other scientific disciplines that will
see the impacts of this project. The project will also assist in broadening the
participation of underrepresented groups in STEM research via participation in
the Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and Professoriate program.

Nanotechnology's impact in diverse areas of present day technology starts with
the ability to synthesize well-defined nanometer-sized objects (nanoparticles)
with well-defined surfaces. This research project seeks to develop fundamentally
new ways of synthesizing functional nanoparticles that can bind with proteins to
form complex materials or to generate observable signals. Such nanoparticles
could lead to versatile sensing technologies that could impact biotechnology.
