This program concentrates on an experimental study of the optics of relativistic
plasmas produced by the propagation of an ultrashort laser pulse through a
gaseous medium. The pulse reaches intensities exceeding 1019 Watt/cm2, thus
entering a new regime of high-field laser-matter interactions that can be
attained in a table-top arrangement. The work will take advantage of the laser
technology of the Center for Ultrafast Optical Science and is supported through
the NSF/DoE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering.
