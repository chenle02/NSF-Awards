The successful development of a cooking gas range with major improvements in
fuel efficiency and pollutant control is the objective of this proposal. Current
concerns of indoor pollution in the U.S., and extravagant waste of fuel in
hundreds of million of households in the third world, would make this event a
major contribution to mankind. The use of suitably designed catalytic burners,
with a geometry suitable to maximize radiative exchange, is the key to this
approach. Although a portable propane model is in existence, the design of a
model usable with current home fuels (natural gases mostly) is a worthwhile new
challenge.
