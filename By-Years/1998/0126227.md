The PI's propose to conduct an in-depth study of the learning of secondary
students engaged in making sense of complex system through participating in
classroom participatory simulations. In particular, the PI's will study the
complimentarity of two forms of reasoning: object based and aggregate reasoning.
These forms of reasoning will be used to as resources to in making sense of
complexity. To do so, the PI's will extend the functionality of the HubNet
Participatory Simulations architecture by building an integrated simulation and
modeling environment (ISME). This environment will be built to couple the
networked simulations with object based (NetLogo) and aggregate Model-It)
modeling tools. Finally, the PI's will extend and refine the Participatory
Simulation Activities (PSA) and through iterative curriculum design incorporate
the PSA inot curricular units targeted for secondary classrooms.
