9353952 Pauling This three-year program sponsored by the California State
University Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) is
designed to promote updated, current instructions in molecular life sciences and
biotechnology at the undergraduate level. The program will offer summer
workshops in molecular life sciences and biotechnology for community college and
comprehensive university faculty. There will be six workshops in Molecular
Biology for the Inexperienced at California State University (CSU) campuses
throughout California (Bakersfield, Northridge, Sacramento, San Francisco, San
Marcos, and Sonoma), aimed primarily at faculty teaching lower-division courses.
Follow-up sessions will be coordinated with the annual CSUPERB Symposium and
Conference held at the Cal-Poly Pomona campus. This coordinated approach will
lead to stronger liaisons between California Community College and CSU faculty
in the molecular life sciences, and to improved instruction in the molecular
life sciences at the lower division levels. ***
