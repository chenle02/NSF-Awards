The proposed project covers several important topics in Extremal and
Probabilistic Combinatorics. The first group of questions concerns the Ramsey
and Turan numbers of sparse graphs. More precisely, the author wants to study
degenerate graphs, i.e., graphs in which every subgraph has bounded average
degree. Here one goal is to show that such graphs have Ramsey numbers which grow
linearly in the size of the graph. An additional goal is to obtain tight
estimates for the Turan numbers of degenerate bipartite graphs. Both problems
were posed many years ago by Erdos, and despite all efforts are still open.
Another set of questions deals mainly with the study of the chromatic and choice
numbers of graphs. The author plans to study two conjectures about graphs whose
choice number is equal to their chromatic number. Since usually there is a huge
gap between these two parameters, cases in which equality holds are extremely
interesting. Another set of questions is about asymptotic properties of random
graphs. Here investigators goal is to understand the distribution of independent
sets of nearly optimal size in sparse random graphs, and use this to determine
the asymptotic behavior of its choice number. It is sometimes the case that an
existence proof, supplied by the probabilistic method, is not sufficient and it
is better to have an explicit construction. One of the major open problems in
this field is to construct exponentially large graphs, without a clique or an
independent set of size k. In this project investigator intends to consider this
problem together with its bipartite version.

Leave nothing to chance. This cliche embodies the common belief that randomness
has no place in carefully planned methodologies. In modern Combinatorics at
least, nothing can be further from the truth. Here the Probabilistic Method has
been developed intensively and become one of the most powerful and widely used
tools. Use of probability proved to be helpful in tackling many long standing
open problems. Another major reason for the development of this method is the
important role of randomness in Theoretical Computer Science. Here algorithm
which make random choices during its execution proved to be simplest and fastest
for many applications. The PI plans to develop new probabilistic tools and
techniques and apply them to various combinatorial problems. Some of these
problems and conjectures have been open for few decades.
