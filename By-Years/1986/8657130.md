The PI will use his broad laboratory experience to measure the time history of
chemical species during a combustion event. Advanced diagnostics (UV Raman,
laser induced fluorescence) will yield such information on such major species as
H2,N2,O2, and H2O for a variety of steady flames. Similar information on nitric
oxides (NO, NO2) will help elucidate nitric oxide formation in turbulent flows.
Finally unsteady phenomena will be studied with the help of a unique free
electron laser, which possesses high energy (100 mJ per pulse) and repetition
rate (1MHz). There is a lot of current interest in resolving the chemical
kinetics of flames for very high speed or very unsteady conditions (hypersonic
propulsion, pulse combustors, turbulent structors). The number of fuels of
interest is also increasing, as economics makes some new compounds more
competitive (or some traditional ones less so). All these needs will be well
served by the PI's experience. He will make valuable and accurate contributions
to the data base.
