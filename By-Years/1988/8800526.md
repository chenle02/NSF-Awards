Sheldon Chang will continue his work on minimal surfaces. The origins of this
subject lie in the study of soap films. Because of the surface tension in these
films they naturally form minimal surfaces. That is, for a given boundary they
have minimum area of all surfaces with this boundary. In the mathematical theory
this property translates into a curvature property of the surface. Nowadays
surfaces with zero mean curvature are referred to as minimal surfaces. Chang's
research is concerned with the existence of minimal surfaces within a given
surface. This is a very natural and important extension since such minimal
surfaces provide a natural extension of the notion of geodesic, that is, minimum
length path, in the surface. Chang has developed remarkable expertise in the
rather inaccessible topic of geometric measure theory. Many of the most exciting
developments in minimal surface theory have made use of this theory. He will
build on recent work of others concerning integral currents and varifolds to
attack these problems. The major focus of the work will be to study the
topological type of these minimal surfaces and the size of their set of
singularities. Probably the most difficult hurdle to overcome will be to find
techniques which apply to the high codimensional situation.
