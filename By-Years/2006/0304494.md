ABSTRACT:

Spiders have been using protein-based nano-materials with the ability to self-
assemble into fibers for over 450 million years. However, it is only in the past
10 years that an understanding of the basis for this process has emerged.
Investigators from the University of Wyoming, Nexia Biotechnologies Inc., the
University of Bologna, and the University of Kansas will work together in
testing three basic hypotheses and engineering concepts. (1) Amino acid sequence
motifs from spider silk can be used to create nano-springs and self-assembling
elastic materials. (2) The elasticity of the individual molecules and the
materials will be proportional to the number of elastic motifs they contain. (3)
The elastic modulus of the materials can be varied by using different amino acid
sequence motifs found in various spider silks.

Possible applications of the spider silk proteins seem widespread. The molecules
themselves can serve as springs in a variety of nano-materials based
applications. If our hypotheses are correct we can control the elasticity and
elastic modulus of each protein spring. Since these nano-materials will self-
assemble into fibers or films they can be used in any application where the
unique materials properties of these silks will be of advantage. Uses range from
artificial ligaments and tendons to protective clothing to composite materials.
