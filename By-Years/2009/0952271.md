This research will seek to elucidate the pathway for thioarsenate decomposition
by microbial assemblages, using alkaline, sulfidic and arsenic-enriched Mono
Lake bottom waters as a study site. Enrichment cultures and manipulation
experiments will be performed to test the effects of different electron
acceptors on thioarsenate decomposition. The PI will analyze the microbial
communities to determine which organisms and which enzyme systems respond to
enrichments with thioarsenates to aid in identifying pathways. These experiments
are designed to address the following questions: 1) What is the behavior of
thioarsenate with arsenate, nitrate or oxygen as electron acceptors? Are there
specific groups of microbes associated with each pair of reactants? 2) What are
the products of the reaction? 3) How does gene expression change during
thioarsenate decomposition? What are the pathways involved in thioarsenate
oxidation?

The results of this study will be relevant, not only for a better understanding
arsenic cycling in Mono Lake, but for modeling arsenic in other neutral or
alkaline environments where arsenite and sulfide are present and exposed to
changing redox conditions. Thioarsenate transformation may be of particular
importance in alkaline hot springs, industrial waste sites, or aquifers with
bedrock containing arsenic- and sulfur-bearing minerals. One outcome will be a
better understanding of arsenic transformations and mobility under fluctuating
redox conditions in anoxic groundwater. The information may also be useful in
designing bioremediation strategies. The proposed studies are also relevant to
understanding and modeling the role of arsenic in the early stages of the
evolution of life on Earth.
