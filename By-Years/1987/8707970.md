The principal goal of this work is the development of techniques for the
efficient, reliable calculation of atomic and molecular properties, taking full
account of electron correlation effects. The techniques will be tested via high
accuracy bound state calculations on small atomic systems. The principal tool
used will be the principal investigator's extension of the work of Charles
Schwartz and of Klahn and Morgan on rates of convergence for the Rayleigh Ritz
variational method. The recently developed formulas for the analytic evaluation
of three electron matrix element integrals, which are based on earlier work of
Bonham, and which have now been programmed in FORTRAN, will also be used.
Significant improvements in accuracy and reliability with a reduced expenditure
of computer time are expected. The initial stages of the work would be of
interest to applied mathematicians and to atomic theorists concerned with high
accuracy bound state calculations on small systems. Subsequent extensions to
larger systems should be of interest to other atomic and molecular theorists and
to quantum chemists.
