The project focuses on a question of fundamental importance for understanding
the global oceanic carbon cycle: What factors and processes control whether
organic matter deposited in marine sediments will be remineralized or buried.
Organic matter deposition, remineralization, and burial will be studied at sites
along transects in a shallow, highly productive North Carolina coastal lagoon
and on the upper continental slope off Cape Hatteras, NC. Specific objectives
include: (1) determination of how the fraction of organic carbon deposition that
is remineralized varies along these two coastal transects, (2) determination of
sources and ages of the reactive fraction, (3) determination of the chemical
composition of reactive and unreactive fractions of the organic matter at sites
along these transects, and (4) determination of the effect of respiratory mode
on organic matter remineralization rates and chemical composition of buried
material. Objectives (1), (2), and (3) involve extensive field work while
objective (4) involves as well-controlled laboratory microcosm study. Combining
field data and laboratory experiments provides a powerful tool for directly
testing hypotheses regarding the mechanisms by which environmental parameters
influence organic matter reactivity.
