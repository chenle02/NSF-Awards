9322037 Jennings Montana State Univ This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,
and Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division will support an annual
workshop in organometallic chemistry. The participants will be organometallic
chemists from academia, industry, and private and government research
organizations. The goals of the workshop are to facilitate communication among
researchers in the different kinds of organizations and to foster the exchange
of new ideas much earlier than is possible through formal publications. The
format of the workshop is designed to encourage maximum participation by all
attendees, and the plan for selecting attendees will ensure broadly based
participation. The topics to be discussed will span a broad spectrum from
synthesis of new organometallic compounds to the utilization of such compounds
as catalysts or as precursors for making new materials. However, the topics of
"Benign Chemical Synthesis and Processing" and "Critical Technologies" will form
the overall themes of the workshop.
