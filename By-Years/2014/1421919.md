Datasets that are collected in engineering, social, commercial and other domains
are becoming increasingly larger, complex and irregular in structure. There is
an urgent need for the development of methods that formalize and automate
analysis of such data and are capable of extracting valuable information.
Recently, a theoretical framework called signal processing on graphs has emerged
as a new approach to analyze data with irregular structure; it extends
fundamental signal processing concepts to data residing on arbitrary graphs, as
well as formulates data analysis problems as standard signal processing tasks.
Moreover, as data often needs to be analyzed at multiple levels of detail, the
investigators develop the fundamentals of the multiresolution analysis on
graphs, extending the theory of discrete signal processing on
graphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research extends relevant signal processing
concepts that are critical to the development of the multiresolution analysis,
including signal translation, scaling, and sampling, to general graphs. The
generalized definition is consistent with the classical multiresolution theory
for time data and images; it also addresses additional challenges presented by
structures and properties of graphs. Additionally, this research involves
techniques and devices for the application and implementation of multiresolution
analysis methods to data on graphs. The investigators also develop a set of
general, theoretical methodologies that can later be instantiated and applied to
datasets of different origin, nature and structure.
