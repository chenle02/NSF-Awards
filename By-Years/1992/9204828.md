This award provides 42% of the funds needed to acquire a gas source stable
isotope ratio mass spectrometer to be installed and operated in the Department
of Geology at Washington State University. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary for this acquisition. The instrument
will be suitable for measuring the ratios of carbon and oxygen isotopes in
carbon dioxide samples prepared from carbonate, silicate and oxide minerals, as
well as the deuterium to hydrogen ratios in hydrogen gas samples prepared from
water or mineral samples. It will be used primarily in studies of the role of
fluid-rock interactions and fluid evolution in the production of vein deposits
of economic value. The instrument will be made available for use by faculty and
graduate students at Washington State University, The University of Idaho, and
other regional research groups.
