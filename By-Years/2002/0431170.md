This project seeks to develop the fundamentals of physical
layer&lt;br/&gt;wireless multi-antenna communications to enhance and
significantly impact&lt;br/&gt;the design of current and future-generations of
cellular telephony, personal&lt;br/&gt;communication services, and wireless
local area networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental limits of delay-sensitive
wireless channels for realistic fading&lt;br/&gt;models will be sought along
with the development of innovative power- and&lt;br/&gt;spectrum-efficient
methods for use over multi-antenna systems. These methods&lt;br/&gt;will extract
all the available spatial, temporal, and spectral degrees of&lt;br/&gt;freedom
and diversity under practical constraints on cost and complexity&lt;br/&gt;that
are relevant for hand-held or laptop communication devices. To
this&lt;br/&gt;end, new performance criteria will be formulated based on which
the analysis&lt;br/&gt;and optimization of various complexity-constrained
communication schemes&lt;br/&gt;will be carried out. The planned research will
emphasize tight interactions&lt;br/&gt;among, and the discovery of new methods
in, the information and&lt;br/&gt;communication theoretic foundations of fading
channels and the associated&lt;br/&gt;coding, modulation and signal processing
functions.&lt;br/&gt;
