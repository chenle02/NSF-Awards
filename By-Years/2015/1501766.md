This project concerns a number of open problems in non-archimedean dynamics, a
field on the interface between number theory and traditional (archimedean)
dynamical systems. This project joins together the very different realms of
dynamical systems and of number theory. Diophantine problems, which ask about
the set rational number solutions to polynomial equations, have been a major
theme in number theory from ancient times to the present day. On the other hand,
the study of dynamical systems has arisen far more recently, exhibiting not only
a purely mathematical beauty but also spectacular computer drawings of fractals
and related sets. This project draws on, builds on, and joins together both
fields. In addition, as in three earlier successful projects, the investigator
plans to supervise some students in an REU summer research project to aid in
their mathematical training. Any computational data produced in the REU will be
published or posted on the web, for the benefit of the larger research
community. Naturally, any results will also be disseminated via websites such as
ArXiv and publication in mathematical journals. In addition, the PI is currently
writing a graduate-level textbook on dynamics in one non-archimedean variable,
as the field has too few expository texts today.

One key class of problems concerns Galois actions on non-archimedean dynamical
systems, related to the central number theory problem of understanding the
absolute Galois group of the rational numbers. On the one hand, non-archimedean
dynamics provides the local information needed in arithmetic dynamics, which in
turn realizes itself as a particular kind of Diophantine problem. A second class
of problems concerns the ergodic properties, especially the entropy, of such
dynamical systems; the entropy is a number that measures the amount of chaos and
unpredictability in the system. These two topics are tied together by the study
of Julia sets in Berkovich spaces, which are technical objects that, in the past
decade, have proven to be of central importance in the study of non-archimedean
dynamics. The project also draws on tools from complex dynamics, ergodic theory,
and non-archimedean analysis. The problems to be studied branch into new areas
but are continuations of rich theories with long and storied histories. In
particular, the Galois action problem promises to provide new (dynamical) tools
for attacking the study of absolute Galois groups, while the study of the
associated entropy issues promise to provide new examples in the study of the
ergodic theory of dynamical systems.
