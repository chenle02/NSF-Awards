9711307 Devine The Southfriere Hills Volcano in Montserrat began erupting on 18
July 1995, creating an urgent need for volcanic hazard assessment. normal
components of hazard monitoring (seismicity, ground deformation, etc.) have been
complemented by near real-time petrologic studies of eruption products in order
to provide estimates of pressure and temperature conditions, and melt volatile
content, in the magma storage region beneath the volcano, as well as the rate of
magma ascent form that reservoir to the surface. Such information is critical
because volatile content and magma ascent rate influence the eruptive style of a
volcano. Rapid ascent of water-rich magmas leads to explosive eruptions, whereas
slow ascent leads to passive degassing and effusive eruptive behavior. On 17-18
September 1996, the volcano changed briefly from effusive to explosive eruptive
style. The change in eruptive behavior resulted from an increase in magma ascent
rate. Funding is requested to allow the P.I. to continue petrologic studies that
provide estimates of the likelihood of a transition from effusive to explosive
eruption behavior.
