Recombination, the production of progeny with new combinations of genes, is one
of the basic activities of genetic material at all levels of the biological
kingdom. The basic mechanisms of recombination are not completely understood in
any species, but much has been learned in recent years by a combination of
molecular and genetic studies in yeast. The generality of these findings is
uncertain, and there is a need for parallel studies in other eukaryotes. The mtr
gene of Neurospora offers special advantages for studies of mutation and
recombination. Rare segregants can be efficiently detected going in either
direction; wildtype to mutant or mutant to wildtype. The gene hs been cloned and
sequenced. A detailed analysis of spontaneous mutation is being completed which
has involved the sequencing of 63 different mtr mutants. This system can now be
used for a detailed molecular description of meiotic recombination. %%%

study of recombination in the filamentous fungus Neurospora will make a
significant contribution toward meeting this need.
