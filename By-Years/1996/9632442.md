This research project studies the applicability of composite moment resisting
frame systems made of composite Steel Reinforced Concrete (SRC) columns and
steel beams for zones of moderate-to-high seismic risk. The seismic design
philosophy for composite moment resisting frame systems is based on developing a
desirable beam-sidesway mechanism, where ductile steel beam flexural hinging
develops throughout the building and hinging develops at the first story column-
foundation interfaces. The research tasks include: (a) experimental
subassemblage testing to evaluate various reinforcing details for composite SRC
columns and beam-column joint regions that provide efficient energy dissipation
capacity and deformation capability during seismic loading scenarios. The
response behavior of the subassemblages will be investigated for continuous
steel beams through the joint with and without floor slab interaction by headed
shear studs (b) experimental subassemblage testing to evaluate various
reinforcing details to ensure sufficient strength and deformation capability at
the critical first story SRC column-concrete foundation interface, and (c)
analytical studies using the well-established nonlinear analysis program IDARC
to model the response behavior using data from previous subassemblage testing
and this research study. Parametric studies will be performed to identify
important hysteretic properties in the composite subassemblages and expanded to
evaluate the response behavior of complete composite moment resisting frame
systems during earthquake excitations. The applicability of the results to
develop design guidelines and reinforcing detail requirements for composite
moment resisting frame systems during earthquake excitations. The applicability
of the results to develop design guidelines and reinforcing detail requirements
for composite moment resisting frame structural systems made of composite SRC
columns and steel beams for zones of moderate-to-high seismic risk will be
evaluated.
