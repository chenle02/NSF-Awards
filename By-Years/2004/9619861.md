9619861 Berque, David DePauw University REU: Research Experiences in Computer
Science for Students at Undergraduate Institutions This Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports 9 students per year in programs
carried out during the summers, for three years. Participating students are
grouped into three research teams each comprised of three students and one
faculty mentor. The students work on projects involving robotics, pen-based
computing, and modeling of file system performance. They have full access to the
computing facilities of the University including specialized equipment such as a
laser operated white board which supports one of the projects. Activities
include conducting research as part of a team, disseminating results, and
participating in a community of scholars. Substantial effort is placed on
recruiting students underrepresented in computing, particularly women, and
students from non-research institutions. Participants have normally completed
their sophomore or junior year of college and are majoring in computer science.
