9314747 Farvardin This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
research in communications and signal processing among three investigators:
Nariman Farvardin of the University of Maryland; Michel Barlaud of the
University of Nice; and Patrick Sole of the French National Center for
Scientific Research in Valbonne, France. The objective of their research is to
develop efficient and powerful image and video compression signals by using
wavelet based methods. The U.S. and French investigators will study the problem
using different approaches. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration
expertise in perceptual image models, trellis and structured vector quantization
and combined source- channel coding. This is complemented by the French group's
experience in wavelet filters and lattice vector quantization schemes. The
proposed research will advance our understanding of wavelet based compression
schemes and could lead to the development of improved wavelet based image/video
coders. These coders have numerous applications in medical imaging, geographical
information systems, video-teleconferencing, high resolution television
broadcasting, and archival and digital libraries.
