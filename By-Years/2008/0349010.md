This CAREER award funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division supports research by Dr. John F. Turner of the University of
Tennessee, Knoxville to study the solution structures of superacids and
superacidic systems, fluxional molecules and organometallic catalysts using the
technique of neutron diffraction. The proposed research involves both synthetic
chemistry and neutron scattering measurements. The long-term goals of the
research are to develop structural characterization tools for species that defy
other methods of analysis-- e.g. electron or X-ray diffraction
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational plan aims to teach the
importance of understanding the structure of matter to both students at the
University of Tennessee and high-school students in the surrounding areas. A
major focus of the plan is to introduce the application of neutron scattering to
the study of the structure and dynamics of matter and to educate the public in
the ways in which the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the nearby Oak Ridge
National Laboratory will play a role in these efforts.
