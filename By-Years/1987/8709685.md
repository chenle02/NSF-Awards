Palynology and paleolimnology will be used to reconstruct the climatic history
of the Western Amazon basin since the last glacial maximum. Sediments cores will
be raised from Amazonian crater Lake Kumpaka, from an ancient Amazonian riverine
lake, Zancudococha, and from the lakes in the southern Ecuadorian Andes.
Fossiliferous Amazonian exposures shown by radiocarbon dating to be of glacial
age will be sampled and explored. Pollen and diatom analyses will be undertaken
to reconstruct histories of vegetation and lake levels in order to test the
hypothesis that glacial climates of the western Amazon were cooler rather than
drier than Holocene climates. This project is important because it will
delineate the paleoclimate history of this vast tropical region, a region
critically important to our understanding of climate change and one virtually
unknown. The research will be carried out in collaboration with Professor
Steinitz-Kannan at Northern Kentucky University under NSF grant number
ATM-8713211.
