A new approach to electrostatic precipitation is proposed that utilizes
electrostatically charged heavy solid particles which are sustained in
suspension between parallel walls of the precipitator with a dc applied electric
field. These particles, which are larger by a factor of 102 to 104 then the
dust, will scrub a flowing dust laden gas as a result of impaction and
electrostatic attraction to the solid particles. The solid particles are
continuously swept through the precipitator in a cross-flow motion relative to
the flowing dirty gas and are made to undergo a self-cleaning action by
collision with the boundary wall of the precipitator where they receive at
either of the parallel walls of the precipitator from the action of the applied
electric field. Alternatively, the "dust carrying" solid particles can be
allowed to pass out of the precipitator for washing while a makeup of clean
solid particles is supplied. In either case, the process is continuous in a dc
electric field.
