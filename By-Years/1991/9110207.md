Research on elections has concentrated on the behavior and choices of
individual voters. However, questions about the roles played by candidates and
their campaigns as influences on voters typically have been ignored. Yet voter
choice can only be understood within the context of a campaign and is properly
conceived as a result at least in part of a contest between competing
candidates. This innovative research attempts to measure the impact of campaign
strategies on voter choice in U.S. Senate elections. Specifically, this research
will collect data on the campaign behavior of US Senate candidates in the 1988,
1990 and 1992 elections. Candidate activities and positions will be determined
based on newspaper coverage of the campaigns. These data will be merged with
data on voter attitudes in these campaigns thus permitting assessments of the
extent to which candidate positions are perceived by voters and influence their
decisions. When completed this study will greatly enhance our understanding of
the impact of campaigns on voter choice including the impact of negative
campaigning and of campaigns in which candidates offer choices, not echoes.
