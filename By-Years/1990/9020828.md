The research supported by this grant will concentrate on determining the
mechanism of cavity nucleation, growth and linkage in superplastic metals.
Quantitative metallography will be used to evaluate the effects of temperature,
strain rate, and grain size. The results will contribute to the understanding
the limits of superplastic deformation in such applications as high strain sheet
metal forming.
