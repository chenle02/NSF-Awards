This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program, a U.S. Global
Change Program. The research project relates changes in the thickness of the
active layer to variations in seasonal climate across representative Arctic
Alaska landscapes. A network of long-term observational sites, based at
locations with histories of prior studies and data will be established. The
primary focus of this study will be a thin layer of soil above the permafrost
which thaws and freezes on an annual basis and is known as the "active layer".
This soil-active layer mediates biological, biogeochemcial, hydrological,
geomorphic, and other heat and mass transfer processes. This project is a
component of a larger interdisciplinary program known as the ARCSS FLUX Program.
