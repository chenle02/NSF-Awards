Opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in ongoing research
projects in experimental physics are structured in a summer REU program.
Students may choose from a wide variety of forefront physics activities, under
the direction of senior faculty members from the Department of Physics at the
University of Arizona, or also from in research groups located in several other
university academic units including Astronomy, Optical Sciences, Lunar and
Planetary Studies, and Atmospheric Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary
source of participants is students who have completed the equivalent of the
first or second year curriculum in science or engineering at the community
college level, in preparation for transfer to a 4-year degree program. The
10-week program will support 12 students each summer. Graduate teaching
assistants from the physics department serve as mentors. Special orientation and
skills activities are individually tailored during the first two weeks of the
program, which enhance the ability of the participants to make significant
contributions to the research projects. Weekly participant meetings include
interim oral reports and lead to a formal presentation and final written report.
