The investigator proposes to develop highly-parallel, efficient, accurate and
rapidly-convergent algorithms for evaluation of the interaction between waves
and geometrically complex structures. The family of algorithms to be developed
by the investigator will focus mainly on (1) The design of a general methodology
based on approximations of Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators capable of producing
intrinsically well-conditioned boundary integral equation formulations for a
wide suite of scattering problems with all types of boundary conditions, (2) The
implementation of these formulations within a computational toolbox that
delivers fast, high-order solvers for scattering problems which can also handle
geometries described by CAD models produced by all of the major CAD engines, and
(3) The design and Finite Element and Boundary Element implementation of non-
overlapping Domain Decomposition Methods (DDM) for the solution of Maxwell's
equations based on quasi-optimal transmission conditions. The proposed approach
consists of the following main elements: (a) High-order integral equation
solvers that rely on high-order surface representations that accept as input
commercial CAD formats as well as triangulations and even point clouds; (b)
Pseudodifferential calculus-based design of coercive approximations of
Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators that on one hand leads to well-conditioned
integral equation formulations that require small numbers of Krylov-subspace
iterations for a wide range of electromagnetic problems and on the other hand
leads to transmission conditions that optimize the norm of the iteration
operators that lie at the heart of non-overlapping Domain Decomposition Methods
for the solution of Maxwell's equations; and (c) Use of equivalent sources, FFT-
based acceleration algorithms to achieve fast integral solvers. Â  The algorithms
that are to be developed as part of the proposed work are of fundamental
significance to diverse applications such as radar, electronic circuits,
antennas, communication devices, photonics. The simulation of electromagnetic
wave propagation in complex structures gives rise to a host of significant
computational challenges that result from oscillatory solutions, low-fidelity
representations of complex geometries, and ill-conditioning in the low and high-
frequency regimes. The recent efforts of the investigator and his collaborators
resulted in the development and analysis of a highly efficient computational
methodology which resolved several of these difficulties and whose extension,
proposed hereby, will enable the investigator to fulfill an ambitious plan: to
simulate with high fidelity realistic scattering environments.
