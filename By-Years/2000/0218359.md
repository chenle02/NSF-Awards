University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular Robotics for DNA
Nanostructures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop
molecular motors that are incorporated into self-assembled DNA lattices. The
main goal of this project will be to develop experimental proof-of concept
demonstrations of the construction of novel DNA motors such as a DNA motor that
is designed to have both translational and rotational motion. Incorporation of
molecular motors into DNA arrays has many applications: It can selectively
manipulate molecules using molecular motor devices arranged on DNA tiling
arrays; A DNA array of motors may offer a mechanism to do DNA computation of
arrays whose elements (the tiles) hold state; Parallel cellular automata
computation may be executed from arrays of finite state automata each of which
hold state. This project is also developing DNA nanostructures containing motors
that operate autonomously without environmental changes. Methods are being
tested to use "fuel DNA" to provide energy to drive the motion of DNA
nanostructures. As an alternative approach, experiments are conducted to
incorporate protein motors such as Kinesin into DNA lattices. In particular, the
use of selective aptamer binding to link protein motors to periodic sites of a
DNA lattice will be tested. The resulting arrays of protein motors have many
applications to nanorobotics, e.g., they are potentially very useful for sorting
and transport of nanoparticles. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
