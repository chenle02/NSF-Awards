The project will emphasize the recruitment, retention, graduation and graduate
school placement of Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans who are enrolled in
selected undergraduate degree programs at four (4) member institution. The
disciplines from which students are eligible to participate are biology,
chemistry, mathematics, physics and all engineering specialties. PROJECT GOALS
The overall goal of the FGAMPSE is to significantly increase the number of
targeted minorities who obtain undergraduate and graduate degrees in the
sciences and engineering by: 1.) recruiting and graduating these students from
the AMP disciplines of their choice in four (4) years; 2.) establishing working
relationships with a large number of graduate institutions for the purpose of
facilitating the placement of project graduates; 3.) enhancing graduate school
placement opportunities for project graduates through the provision of greater
and better research experiences; 4.) initiating and strengthening working
relationships among students and between students and faculty with the aim to
improve students' academic performance; 5.) reducing high attrition in the
freshman and sophomore years by providing these students with summer refresher
courses that review and preview important math and science concepts; and 6.)
bringing together on member campuses significant numbers of highly motivated
minority students who, by their organized and serious approach to their work,
will serve as positive role models for other minority students.
