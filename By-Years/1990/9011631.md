This Research Initiation Award is for a study of knowledge based sensor
integration to interprete incomplete and imperfect sensory information about a
physical environment. Knowledge sources may included object models, known image
or scene correspondences, and information from multiple sensors or multiple
views. Dr. Walker will use a frame based representation and reasoning framework
to unify the problems of model based image interpretation, camera position
estimation, and multisensor fusion. Progress along these lines may permit better
scene interpretation with standard vision systems and may simplify design of new
sensors and systems.
