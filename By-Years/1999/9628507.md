9628507 Verosub The PIs propose to examine the acquisition of thermoviscous
remanent magnetization on geologically significant time scales by studying
randomly-oriented cobbles and boulders that have been exposed to earth's
magnetic field for known intervals of time. Thermal demagnetization will be used
to determine the unblocking temperatures of the secondary magnetization
components which have developed in these rocks and will be complemented by
detailed mineral magnetic investigations designed to characterize the
mineralogy, grain size and domain state of the magnetic carriers. This work will
provide important insight into the relationship between a time and temperature
in the acquisition of thermoviscous remanent magnetization. ***
