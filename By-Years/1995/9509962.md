7 # 9 9 ) ) ) ) ) 3 = = = = = x x The goal of this project is to develop a
sound basis and methodology for the representation of corpora and linguistic
information in corpora, as well as for the design of text-handling tools, for
use in corpus-based natural language processing (NLP) research. The work is
undertaken in collaboration with the Laboratoire Parole et Langage in Aix-en-
Provence, France. The project involves (1) analysis of the needs of corpus-based
NLP research, both in terms of the kinds and degree of annotation required and
the requirements for efficient processing, accessibility, etc.; (2) analysis of
general properties and configuration of corpora, analysis of the relevant
structural and logical features of component text types, and the design of
encoding mechanisms that can represent all required elements and features while
accomodating the requirements determined in (1); and (3) specifications for text
software design, coordinated with (2), designed to avoid redundancy and maximize
the modifiability, extendability, and reusability of corpus-handling software.
The methods and materials developed in this project will provide a comprehensive
framework for the machine representation and manipulation of large corpora for
corpus-based NLP research, thus enabling both software and data to be easily
shared, used, and re-used in the future. u h 9 9 9 9 9 9 = / B Ide - Abstract
