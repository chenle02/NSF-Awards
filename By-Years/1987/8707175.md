This project represents a continuation of research previously supported by NSF
grant EAR 85-07925, involving studies of the structure and atomic motions in
molten and glassy silicates using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
A previously developed high-temperature NMR probe and furnace system will be
used to continue studies of NMR lineshapes and relaxation times of Si-29 and
Na-23 in alkali silicate and aluminosilicate melts, extending the studies to
include wider composition and temperature ranges. In addition, O-17 measurements
will be initiated, and the resulting observations of atomic-scale processes will
be related to known thermodynamic properties of the melts. Work will also be
continued on glasses and the glass transition, emphasizing the effects of quench
rate (and therefore transition temperature) on structure and defects. Finally,
the clustering of protonated species in hydrous glasses will be studied using
multiple quantum 1-H NMR techniques. The results of these studies will improve
our understanding of the fundamental thermodynamic and transport properties of
important silicate melts and glasses.
