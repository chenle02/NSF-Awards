This award provides partial support for the replacement of five outdated
environmental chambers with state-of-the-art, walk-in chambers for which
temperature, light and humidity can be fully controlled and monitored. The new
chambers will allow properly controlled experiments in the ecology, evolution,
behavior, development, physiology, genetics, and molecular biology of plants and
insects. New chambers will allow researchers to control temperature, light and
humidity in order to rigorously determine their effects on important plant and
insect traits. In addition, a high degree of control over the growth environment
will ensure that any differences seen between experimental groups are a result
of the treatments and not due to phenotypically plastic responses by the
organisms studied. The new facilities will support an active group of over two
dozen researchers and their students. The chambers will provide opportunities
for graduate and undergraduate research and education for a large and diverse
population of students, including women and minorities. Research uses are
expected to lead to advances that will improve our understanding and management
of the natural environment, and of our understanding of plant development and
growth. The chambers will enable study of plant-insect interactions that will
lead to progress in basic understanding and in management practices for
agricultural and reserve lands. &lt;br/&gt;
