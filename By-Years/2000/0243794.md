This award provides funding for a summer internship program at University of
Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO) located in Narragansett,
RI. This program has been active since 1986 and is called the Summer
Undergraduate Research Fellowships in Oceanography (SURFO). Nine students/summer
will participate in an eleven week research/education program that allows them
to conduct independent research projects. The program aims to expose students
who are majoring in math, physics, computer science and engineering to aspects
of oceanographic research, and normally recruits rising Juniors with strong
computational skills. Students receive one-on-one research instruction from a
faculty mentor. They participate in a variety of educational activities,
including an orientation session, a seminar series, field trips and several
professional development workshops. At the end of the summer, students prepare
both an oral and a written presentation on their research.
