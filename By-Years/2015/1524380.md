This project uses a comprehensive set of empirical and design-based methods to
strengthen our scientific understanding of technology-mediated practices that
bridge local community engagement and administration. This research will result
in empirical insights and novel software systems that will guide the design of
practical, scalable, and usable technologies that connect community-based
participation with policy making and local governance. It will also provide an
empirical basis for understanding how new forms of deliberation and management
can be integrated into practices and procedures designed to engender
accountability and broad access to policy development and local government. The
research will contribute to the design of cyber-human systems that support
digital democracy through the design of technology to mediate interaction with
constituents in order to enable broad participation, and integrating robust
communication tools into daily work practices to facilitate a more effective and
efficient workplace.

The specific steps of the research are to: 1. Develop qualitative insight into
the cooperative work practices of urban policy making, paying particular
attention to information sharing and sense-making practices in both the
community at large and members of local government. 2. Develop experimental
interfaces to support information sharing and sense-making derived from the
qualitative insights of cooperative work practices and evaluate and compare
these interfaces over iterative deployments. 3. Develop a design framework for
computer-supported community engagement and validate the design framework
through summative evaluation. Understanding how to design systems for community
engagement that incorporate cooperative work practices with novel forms of data
production, new modes of community participation, and innovations in cooperative
work has direct implications for complementing the goals of digital democracy,
but also for participation in scientific, medical, educational and other domains
where the integration of broad public involvement through crowdsourcing and
citizen-based initiatives is driving innovation.
