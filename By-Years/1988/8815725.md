Two important technological advances in the United States, one, the effective
coverage of the nation by the digitized topographic maps to resolutions of 30
meter by 30 meter pixels can be used now to develop real time flood forecasting
methods. The project will develop such a model with the goal of obtaining
parsimonious parametrization of models by using as much data as possible.
Precipitation prediction will be based on a continuous formulation, in time and
space, of the development of rainfall. Raingage and radar data will be used
conjunctively to update model states via a distributed filtering algorithm. The
rainfall-runoff model proposed is based on the distributed knowledge of the
geomorphology and the hydrologic response will be suggested and this concept
will be tested in the field by making use of radar facilities and river basins
within the laboratory's range.
