This award is for support of the work of the U.S. research team that commenced
field work in Armenia following the catastrophic earthquake that struck on
December 7, 1988. The work of the multidisciplinary U.S. team has emphasized the
following areas: - mapping of surface fault rupture, - deploying arrays of
instruments to monitor seismicity and to record strong ground shaking from the
aftershock sequence, - examining damaged and collapsed buildings and acquiring
drawing for further analysis, - inspecting seismoscope and accelerograph records
of the main shock, and large aftershocks, - visiting the nuclear power plant
near Yerevan, - mapping landslides and liquefaction, - examining the performance
of lifelines, and - determining human and societal behavior in the emergency
response and recovery environments. This research effort should provide
important lessons for earthquake hazard mitigation in the U.S. as well as the
U.S.S.R.
