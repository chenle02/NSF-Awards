Measures of Dependence and Model Selection in Multiple Regression

Kjell A Doksum, DMS-0505651 Abstract

The investigators approach the dilemma that estimation of curves and surfaces
such as the conditional mean is virtually impossible with high dimensional data
by focusing instead on the estimation of measures of dependence between a
response and a set of covariates. These measures of dependence take the form of
signal divided by noise. They are used to select the subset of covariates to
include in the model, and to choose tuning parameters. The signal measures the
strength of the dependence of Y on a set of covariates. The noise is a standard
error, that is, an estimate of the standard deviation of the estimated signal.
It will be small when too many variables are included in the model and when the
tuning parameter sacrifices precision for smaller bias. Choosing variables and
tuning parameters that minimize signal to noise leads to procedures that
converge at the traditional root-n rate. The investigators use asymptotic and
Monte Carlo methods to investigate the properties of such procedures. They also
relate them to traditional model and tuning parameter selection procedures and
compare traditional procedures with the signal to noise approach.

The last few years have seen the establishment of large databases' containing a
large number of variables that are to be related and compared. A good example is
the data produced by the human genome project where a great number of genes need
to be considered as possible contributers to a certain disease. Dealing with a
large number of variables is difficult because many of them will contribute
variability (noise) that may drown out potential interesting relationships
(signals). The investigators approach this problem by using general flexible
model equations to represent important relationships between variables. Then
variables and aspects of the equations are selected to minimize the ratio of
signal to noise. This procedure automatically weeds out the variables that
contribute mostly noise and selects an equation that emphasizes the signals
present in the data.
