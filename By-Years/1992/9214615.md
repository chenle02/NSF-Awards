Replacement instrumentation is proposed for campus-wide research and student
training on the St. Paul campus of the University of Minnesota. The TEM
replacement sought is an analytically configured TEM with microprocessor
controls, electronic image capture and analysis capabilities, and a light
element detector and analyzer. On-going student training and research
capabilities would be greatly enhanced by state-of-the-art instrumentation.
Current research efforts, with state and national priorities, benefiting
immediately from the proposal are: a) Soil chemistry and physics related to
atmospheric acid deposition and pesticide residues; b) Wood decomposition and
bioprocessing of lignin removal for paper product; c) Nitrogen fixation by
plants to reduce fertilizer needs; d) Forest water quality and applied ecology;
e) Development and disease resistance in plants; and, e) Food quality and
structure research.
