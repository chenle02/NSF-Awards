The main objective of the proposed conference is to foster the exchange and
dissemination of state-of-the-art technical information between researchers,
educators, and practitioners on the use of geomechanics and of geotechnical and
geo-environmental methods in assessing and solving environmental problems.
Conference topics will be categorized under: 1. Contaminant characterization; 2.
Pollution and Hazard Assessment; 3. Hazard Mitigation/Pollution Abatement; 4.
Waste Management/Regulatory issues; and 5. Educational and Training Programs.
There will be strong focus on the problems of the Mediterranean region, however,
the topics covered will be of interest to the entire international community.
