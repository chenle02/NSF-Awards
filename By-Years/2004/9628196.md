9628196 Peacor This grant provides $125,000 as one-half support of the costs of
acquiring a new scanning electron microscope system (SEM) for the Department of
Geological Sciences at the University of Michigan. Specifically, the SEM will
include detectors for secondary electrons, an energy-dispersive X-ray system for
detection of elements with low atomic numbers and the capabilities for back-
scattered electron imaging and image digitization and analysis. The new
instrument will replace an aging (circa 1985) Hitachi S-570 SEM that is plagued
with leaking vacuum pumps. poor sample stage design and only allows analog
capture of electron images thus precluding digital image analysis which is the
state-of-the-art in modern SEM's. The capabilities of the new SEM to analyze
hydrated samples will allow for analyses of biological materials in addition to
geological samples. A wide range of research will be conducted with the
instrument, including but not limited to, studies of the trace element
geochemistry of hydrothermally altered oceanic rocks, thin film research,
metamorphic petrology, ore deposit geochemistry and characterization of dental
materials. It will also benefit the analytical needs of a large community of
graduate and undergraduate students. ***
