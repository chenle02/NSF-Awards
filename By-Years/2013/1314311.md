This award funds the research of Professors Peter Goddard and Edward Witten at
the Institute for Advanced Study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work of Professors
Goddard and Witten is devoted to the study of elementary particle physics,
including its connections to other areas of study ranging from astrophysics and
cosmology to condensed matter physics and geometry. The project will partly
support the research of the principal investigators, a senior visitor, and a
substantial group of postdoctoral fellows who are working on these topics.
Current and planned research of this group covers a very wide range of topics,
including the connections between gauge theory (the modern language of
elementary particle physics), string theory, and geometry; the possibilities for
supersymmetric models of particle physics that might be relevant at accelerator
energies; new methods of computing and studying the scattering amplitudes of
elementary particles; new experimental hints of cosmic dark matter; and new
relations among old and new quantum field theories in different
dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include the
training of a large number of young postdoctoral researchers. For many years,
the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) has provided an ideal "training ground"
for young postdocs to work with the best of their peers and gather critical
research experience. Ultimately, IAS postdocs help populate the most active
teaching and research institutions in the country, serving in turn as mentors
and teachers of students in the physical and biological sciences. The IAS also
hosts a widely attended summer school (Prospects in Theoretical Physics), often
in topics closely related to the present project, which benefits IAS postdocs as
well as students and postdocs from around the US and the world.
