Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will be concerned with
superstrings (which are one - dimensional objects) and their higher -
dimensional generalizations, known as super p - branes. In particular, the role
of these objects as effective, long-distance descriptions of topological defects
in supersymmetric quantum field theories will be explored. The theory of
superstrings shows promise as a theory which would describe all of the forces of
nature, including gravity. Supersymmetry relates the particles which make up
matter to those which carry the forces between bits of matter. The study of
strings and their generalizations as topological defects has proved to be of
importance in elucidating the nature of string theory.
