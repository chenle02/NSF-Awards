The Ricci flow has become an important tool to search classical metrics on
manifolds since it first appeared in Hamilton's seminal 1982 paper. As an
important evolutionary equation, it sets up a bridge between geometry and
topology. In the past three decades, there have been many exciting achievements
of the Ricci flow. In 2002, Perelman used the Ricci flow to solve the folklore
Poincare conjecture. In 2007, Richard Schoen and Simon Brendle used the Ricci
flow to prove the famous sphere theorem. These examples and many others
highlight one fact that the Ricci flow is a powerful tool which deserves
intensive study. The success of these previous examples is based on the
knowledge of the global behavior of the Ricci flows with special conditions.
Specially, either the dimension of the underlying manifold is three, or the
curvature operator (or isotropic curvature) is nonnegative. However, in a
general higher dimensional Ricci flow, we can hardly determine the sign of the
curvature operator. The global picture of the Ricci flow is still unclear. There
remain a lot of technical difficulties to overcome. Therefore, the study of the
Ricci flows with weaker curvature constraints becomes natural and necessary. The
Ricci flows' behavior under sectional curvature and Ricci curvature bounds have
been solved by Hamilton and Sesum. Naturally, the next step is to understand the
behavior of the Ricci flow under the condition that scalar curvature is
uniformly bounded. On the other hand, Perelman's fundamental work reveals that
there are many Ricci flows where scalar curvature is uniformly bounded.
Therefore, the Ricci flows with bounded scalar curvature deserve comprehensive
study. My research proposal is to study these Ricci flows.

The Ricci flow is an evolution equation solution on a Riemannian manifold. The
Ricci flow is an important tool to find Einstein metrics, which are crucial in
general relativity and mirror symmetry, my study is closely related to physics
and Kahler geometry. It naturally interacts with mathematical physics, algebraic
geometry, algebraic topology, complex analysis and partial differential
equations. Therefore, the study of the Ricci flow has broader impact outside the
area of geometric analysis. Among all Ricci flows, the Ricci flow with bounded
scalar curvature is a very important type. This type of Ricci flows appear
naturally in many settings. For example, according to the deep work of Perelman,
the scalar curvature is uniformly bounded along the Ricci flows on many Kahler
manifolds. My research proposal focuses on the study of the Ricci flows with
bounded scalar curvature. The success of this project will greatly benefit the
understanding of properties of many Riemannian manifolds.
