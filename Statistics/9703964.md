Politis 9703964 This project involves the on-going development of resampling and
subsampling as they apply to dependent data, i.e., time series, random fields,
and (marked) point processes. The investigator's efforts redirected towards: (a)
relaxing the conditions for asymptotic validity of computer-intensive methods
for dependent data (e.g., allow for nonstationarity, slow mixing rate, etc.);
(b) rendering subsampling more `automatic' by devising a built-in procedure for
estimation of the rate of convergence of the statistic in question; (c)
improving the accuracy of distribution estimation by techniques such as
Richardson extrapolation, and by optimal choice of block size; (d) developing
appropriate resampling/subsampling methods in the case of alternative data-
collection scenarios as is the case of measurements at irregularly spaced
locations, i.e., data from a marked point process; and (e) exploring the idea of
`local' resampling for time series. This research focuses on the development of
computer-intensive methods of statistical inference for the analysis of
dependent data without having to rely on unrealistic or unverifiable model
assumptions. The statistical analysis of dependent data is vital in many diverse
scientific disciplines; thus this research has potentially many practical
applications. For example, consider the problem of stochastic computer
simulation of complex manufacturing systems that is an important issue in
Industrial Engineering; the methodology of subsampling for `almost' stationary
time series is most helpful in order to assess convergence and accuracy of the
simulation. For another example, suppose that X(t) denotes an environmental
measurement, e.g., rain precipitation or ozone concentration as measured at
location t. Typically, the t-points where X(t) is measured are irregularly
scattered in space or on the earth's surface. The development of a general
methodology for statistical inference involving data of this type is a
significant contribution i n spatial statistics and, in particular, studies
involving geological, atmospheric, and environmental data.
