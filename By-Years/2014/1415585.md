Teacher specialists can play an important role in enhancing the content and
pedagogical content knowledge of other teachers. Through NSF and other funding,
a growing cadre of leaders are prepared to provide such support to other
teachers. However, as districts face increasing budget constraints,
administrators often reassign these specialists to full-time teaching
responsibilities.

This project will study whether elementary mathematics specialists who
participated in an intensive educational program supported by DRK-12 have
continued providing leadership when they returned to teaching full-time. The
research questions are: 1) In what ways are specialist-teachers continuing to
use their leadership expertise in their school, district, and state? 2) How do
district administrators, building administrators, and teachers shape specialist-
teachers' opportunities for leadership? What other factors shape these
opportunities? 3) What is the impact of specialist-teachers on their schools'
leadership culture? Answers to these questions will help to ensure that
substantial investments in leadership development continue to yield returns,
even when the individuals trained are no longer in formal leadership positions.
