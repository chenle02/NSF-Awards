The Interdisciplinary Consortium for Research and Educational Access in Science
and Engineering (INCREASE) is proposed as a way to connect researchers at
Minority serving institutions (MSIs), including their students, with each other
and with the research community at large nationally funded labs in order to
enable collaborations and sharing of facilities to support basic research. The
objective is to connect early career faculty from MSIs with successful national
laboratory research teams and create a plan for their development into
successful authors of competitive proposals and high impact research
publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;National laboratories such as the Brookhaven
National Laboratory (BNL) and the SLAC National Laboratory (formerly know as the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) have access to specialized research
equipment that is frequently too costly for any one educational institution to
provide. Through INCREASE, a consortium of institutions will become part of the
Department of Energy facility user community, enhancing their efforts to
establish research activities at their home institutions. They will be able to
utilize highly specialized and unique equipment in support of their research. In
turn the equipment will experience increased utilization as it is now accessible
to a larger community of researchers at minority serving institutions. Both
graduate and undergraduate students at the institutions will also benefit
through exposure and involvement in cutting edge research and direct research
connections with federally funded laboratories.
