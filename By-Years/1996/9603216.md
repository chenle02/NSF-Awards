9603216 Hungerford This award supports a three-year collaborative research
project between Professor Ed V. Hungerford of the University of Houston and
Professor Osamu Hashimoto of Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan. The researchers
will undertake an investigation of light hypernuclei by pion, kaon, and photon
beams. The goal of the collaboration is to selectively study S=-1 and -2 light
hypernuclei. They will concentrate their investigation on those aspects of
hypernuclear physics which better elucidate unsolved problems in hadronic many-
body physics. This collaboration requires close working relations between
theorists and experimentalists, which has been one of the traditional strengths
of this field. The researchers plan to take advantage of the fact that a number
of new experimental facilities have just been, or will soon be commissioned, for
the study of nuclei embedded with strange hyperons. These facilities should
provide new, more precise information thus anticipating a major advance in this
field. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden
our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and
cooperation. ***
