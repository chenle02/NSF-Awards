Developer testing has been widely recognized as an important and valuable means
of improving software reliability, partly due to its capabilities of exposing
faults early in the software development life cycle. However, manual developer
testing is often tedious and insufficient. Testing tools can be used to enable
economical use of resources by reducing manual effort. To maximize the value of
developer testing, effective and efficient support for cooperation between
developers and tools is greatly needed and yet lacking in state-of-the-art
research and practice.

This research aims to create a systematic framework for cooperative developer
testing that provides practical techniques and tools, with an integrated
research and education plan. In particular, the research addresses fundamental
research questions around specification of test intentions by developers to
communicate their testing goals or guidance to tools, satisfaction of test
intentions by tools, and explanation of intention satisfaction by tools. Test-
intention satisfaction and its explanation assist developers in accomplishing
not only their testing tasks but also debugging tasks. The framework also helps
infer likely test intentions to reduce manual effort in specification of test
intentions. Among the broader impacts of the project includes improvement of
software reliability and collaboration with industry to transfer technology.
