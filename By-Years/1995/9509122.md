9509122 Ichiye While electronic structure calculations of gas-phase molecules is
a very well developed field, such calculations for molecules in solation are
still in their infancy. This research will incorporate solvent effects into
electronic structure calculations of proteins. Simple continuum solvent models
are insufficient to describe phenomena such as hydrogen bonding, local
dielectric perturbations and phenomena involving separations of only a few water
layers. To model the molecular nature of solvation, the approach used here will
add a statistical mechanical integral equation theory, previously developed by
this group to describe aqueous solvation of globular molecules, into density
functional electronic structure methods. %%% While electronic structure
calculations of gas-phase molecules is a very well developed field, such

will incorporate solvent effects into electronic structure calculations of
proteins. Electronic structure calculations are very important in computational
and theoretical biophysics. For instance, they are important in gaining a
fundamental understanding of the structure-function relationships of electron
transfer proteins and enzymes. They are also important in the development of
potential energy function parameters. ***
