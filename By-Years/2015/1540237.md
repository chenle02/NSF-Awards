The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program supports a travel award for three
graduate students at US universities to participate in the 14th International
Congress on Combustion By-Products and their Health Effects held June 14-17,
2015 in Umea, Sweden. The International Congress has met every two years since
1990, the Congress usually attracts between 100 and 200 delegates from all over
the world. The students are selected by the Standing Organizing Committee for
the conference based on need and the quality of abstracts submitted for
presentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental research is interdisciplinary
and this meeting brings together scientists, engineers, and health care
researchers to discuss the environmental issues surrounding combustion. This
meeting brings academic, government, and industrial representatives together to
present research findings, update international policy, and discuss critical
issues concerning emissions of toxic by-products from the combustion processes.
