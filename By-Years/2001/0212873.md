Phylogenetic Structure of Woody-Plant Communities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Webb,
Ackerly, &amp; Donoghue; NSF proposal 0212873&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
ecological communities of organisms found in nature have usually been treated as
collections of independent species. However, the great advances made recently by
phylogenetic biologists in understanding the "tree of life" mean that ecologists
can now examine the evolutionary relationships among the species in their
communities. Knowing this phylogenetic structure also enables ecologists to
detect the processes organizing species membership in the communities, and thus
provides a powerful new tool to understand species-rich systems. In the proposed
research software tools will be developed for assembling and analyzing community
phylogenetic structure, and will be applied to an endangered, rain forest tree
community in Borneo, and to the Californian flora. A comparative survey of the
phylogenetic structure of other plant communities around the world will also be
performed. The proposed research will promote a closer integration of
evolutionary biology and community ecology.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
