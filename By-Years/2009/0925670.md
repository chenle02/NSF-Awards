The objective of this research is to develop radios for multi-function bird
tracking tags. Each radio tag will support geo-localization, in-flight telemetry
and networking. The approach is to develop a passive-mixer-first radio
architecture that connects highly flexible baseband circuitry to the antenna
through a "transparent front-end."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State-of-the-art radios
provide programmable gain, bandwidth, and center frequency, but have fixed
antenna interfaces, dramatically reducing their flexibility. The proposed
?transparent front-end? allows direct interaction between highly controllable
baseband circuitry and variable, poorly controlled antennas. Thus, all important
properties of the radio are made programmable, including previously fixed
properties such as impedance matching, allowing on-the-fly reconfiguration.
Furthermore, this flexibility comes with little or no cost in terms of power
consumption or performance. By developing the theoretical and practical aspects
of the design of transparent front-ends, this project will complete a multi-
decade trend from fixed, single function radios to fully flexible multi-function
transceivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because transparent front-end radios enhance
performance while reducing cost and size, they are likely to find use in a
variety of scientific and commercial applications. The project also provides a
showcase of different aspects of wireless technology which will be used in
educational demonstrations. By permitting link-ups between RF tags and
commercial handheld devices, this project will also add a new dimension to
citizen science in field ornithology. The research program will support graduate
research and undergraduate design projects and outreach activities to K-12
students.
