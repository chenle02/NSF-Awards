Anonymous communication has received increasing attention in the past decade
because of concerns on privacy issues of communication through the Internet.
Although these existing anonymous communication networks can greatly help
protect communication privacy, these networks, especially the low-latency
anonymous communication networks, are vulnerable to a number of traffic analysis
attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is to study new
architectures for anonymous communications in order to defeat traffic analysis
attacks, both passive and active traffic analysis attacks. The project focuses
on hiding traffic patterns by dissipating statistical structure information of
network traffic through network coding, which has never been tried before.
Compared to the existing approaches, the new approaches will be able to hide
traffic patterns while achieving higher bandwidth efficiency and suffering less
degradation in the quality of service. A scientific foundation for anonymity
networks is to be established through an understanding and analysis of the
complex relationship among the levels of anonymity, usability of the networks,
and amount of network resources needed. The project, if successful, will help
stimulate new researches on anonymization approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given
increasingly pervasive nature of computing and communication setting and
increasing popularity of anonymity networks, protecting communication privacy
and privacy of various Internet applications is of great societal importance.
The project also serves as a means to introduce minority students to academic
research activity and to bring additional undergraduate and graduate to research
in the network security and privacy area.
