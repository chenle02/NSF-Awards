This project provides a Peltier Thermoelectrically-Cooled Silicon Detector (TCD)
system to support a Scintag 2000 x-ray diffraction (XRD) unit. The new
instrumentation fills a recognized need to introduce XRD techniques in chemistry
and to significantly increase the capabilities in geology. Courses immediately
introduce and result in more and better hands-on use of XRD experiences and more
sophisticated XRD laboratory exercises include Mineralogy, X-ray
Crystallography, Independent Study, Physical Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis,
and Inorganic Chemistry. Beyond this, the upgrade in instrumentation opens
exciting new avenues for undergraduate research. The project continues to
introduce XRD diffractometry in the sophomore (geology majors) and junior
(chemistry majors) years followed by progressively more advanced real problem-
solving experiences in the senior-level courses in both geology and chemistry.
The impact of the instrumentation upgrade on instruction can be assessed by
student evaluation and peer observation of assigned laboratory activities.
