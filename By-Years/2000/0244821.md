The proposed research involves group research in Particle, Fields and Strings.
The group proposes to explore physics beyond the standard model with an eye on
understanding two important fine-tuning problems, the hierarchy problem (why are
the masses of the particles very different (much lighter) than the Planck mass)
and the cosmological constant problem. In the context of higher dimensions, the
hierarchy problem becomes why are the extra dimensions so large? The PI's intend
to explore discretized extra dimensions as a method of constructing new classes
of field theories using the principle of deconstruction. This is an entirely new
method of model building. As an alternative to Supersymmetry and its inherent
doubling of the spectrum of particles being the relevant physics expected at new
colliders such as LHC, the PI's are exploring a qualitatively new approach to
the hierarchy problem based on having a light Higgs that is a pseudo-Goldstone
Boson. This approach is called the "little Higgs" model and it has new
predictions for TeV Physics. The PI's intend to continue their exploration of
duality symmetries as well as the geometric engineering of quantum field
theories using string geometry.
