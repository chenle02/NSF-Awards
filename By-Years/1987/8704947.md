The ubiquitous presence of acoustic-gravity waves at all levels of the
atmosphere is well known. These waves, after being excited by various sources,
can propagate throughout all levels of the atmosphere from the troposphere to
the thermosphere and can propagate large horizontally distances on the global
scale. As these waves carry momentum and energy, they may play and important
role in determining the large-scale circulation in the middle atmosphere and in
coupling between the thermosphere and the lower atmosphere. The World Acoustic
Gravity Wave Study (WAGS) study involves periodic campaigns, in which the PI and
his associates participate. They were involved in a workshop on WAGS in January
1987. They will analyze data from the campaigns and perform theoretical
investigations on the interaction of radar beams and propagating waves. Other
theoretical research topics include the interaction of gravity waves with
atmospheric vortices, such as are found in cyclonic disturbances. The subject of
gravity waves is receiving increased attention as a source of energy and
momentum coupling between the lower and upper atmospheres, and of mixing and
turbulence throughout the atmosphere. The PI and Co I are internationally
recognised experts in the field.
