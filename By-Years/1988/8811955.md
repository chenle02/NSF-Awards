The objective of this research is to demonstrate experimentally the feasibility
of using optical squeezed states to enhance the available sensitivity of
frequency modulation spectroscopy when used as an optical sensing probe of a
chemically complex, gas phase environment of the type commonly encountered in
materials processing reactors. Such a demonstration would be the first to use
optical squeezed states to advantage in a spectroscopic application and would
open up the possibility of using absorption spectroscopy to detect low
concentration or otherwise difficult to detect molecular and radical species at
very high sensitivity. The use of squeezed states will reduce the amplitude
modulated background level normally associated with frequency modulation
spectroscopy to below the usual shot noise or quantum limited value.
