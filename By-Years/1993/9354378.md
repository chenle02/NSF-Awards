9354378 Sarquis Faculty at two two-year campuses are revising the General
Chemistry course to make it more interesting, relevant, and accessible to
students with various academic backgrounds. This effort includes the design,
development, and testing of discovery-based laboratory scenarios and take-home
lecture supplements that illustrate topics in Chemistry through activities
beyond the classroom. In addition to demonstrating general concepts, the
activities also involve students in critical-thinking and group problem-solving
skills used by professional chemists in industry and academia. To further ensure
success, the project is built on the pedagogical foundations of constructivism,
Science-Technology-Society, and cooperative learning. Following pilot
implementation and revision, these advances in the General Chemistry curriculum
will provide a model for adaptation at other two-year colleges and small four-
year schools. ***y
