9505597 Pursley The 1995 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory will
be held in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, on September 17-22, 1995. Papers
presented will address new results in: applications of information theory, image
and speech coding, communication systems, multi-user information theory,
cryptography and security, neural networks, data compression, optical
communications, data networks, pattern recognition, detection and estimation,
Shannon theory, distributed information processing, signal processing, error-
control coding, source coding, and stochastic processes. This symposium is a
premiere meeting in the field of Information theory. Travel through this grant
will provide travel support for U. S. participants, primarily graduate students
and new faculty members, whose papers are selected for presentation at the
symposium, but who lack the funds required to travel to the conference. ***
