9626296 Young With this award, the University of Illinois will acquire a
simultaneous thermal analysis-mass spectrometry system for effluent gas
analysis. The system features a state-of-the art gas-sampling skimmer, that
operates at high temperatures and prevents condensation of volatiles prior to
analysis. Samples can be studied up to 2000 C either under vacuum or in a
variety of inert or corrosive gases. The equipment will be used to study a wide
variety of materials including: formation and regeneration of activated carbons,
catalysts for NOx reduction, characterization of aerosols, formation of novel
cement-polymer composites (organo cements), hydrous minerals, synthesis of
ceramics through pyrolysis of inorganic polymers, and development of high
temperature phase diagrams. The instrument will be located in a central facility
available to all researchers at the University of Illinois, as well as
scientists from other institutions. The system will provide a unique national
resource for thermal analysis of materials. ***
