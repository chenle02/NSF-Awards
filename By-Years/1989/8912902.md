Although significant progress has been made in studies of the greenhouse effect
in many of the natural sciences, relatively little effort has been devoted to
the downstream assessment of the economic and social impacts of the greenhouse
effect. This proposal is designed to improve understanding of both substantive
and methodological developments concerning the economic and social impacts of
global environmental change, through both a regular workshop reviewing ongoing
research and a program of research focusing on specific areas of global
environmental change. The workshop will involve bringing together social
scientists and others working on energy and resource economics, forestry,
agriculture, and methodology to improve both research techniques and substantive
knowledge of the likely impacts arising from the greenhouse effect. The other
major task will focus on developing an hedonic model of the value of climatic
variables for use in evaluating potential climatic changes. This technique will
provide a much more detailed analysis of the economic impact of climatic change
than have past studies, and in addition will provide regional detail on the
distribution of the impacts of climatic change.
