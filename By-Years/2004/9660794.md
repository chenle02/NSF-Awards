This project addresses novel, high permeability ceramic membranes for oxygen
separation from air. High permeation is the result of both, novel materials and
an enhancement in surface exchange kinetics by more than an order of magnitude
using a patented process. This approach has already led to an improvement of
over 700% in power density (> 1.2 watts/cm2 at 800√ùC) of solid oxide fuel cells
over the state-of-the-art. Highly efficient oxygen ion conducting membranes for
voltage driven and mixed conducting membranes for pressure driven systems will
be fabricated in the form of thin dense films over porous supports. Their
permeation characteristics will be investigated. It is anticipated that the
resulting membranes will exhibit at least ten times greater permeability than
the best known oxide perovskites. A preliminary design of an oxygen separator
using these ceramic membranes will be made. The potential commercial
applications of oxygen separation systems based on these ceramic membranes
include: (1) Oxy-gas retrofit in glass industry, (2) Oxygen generators for
medical industry, chemical industry, (3) Preservation by oxygen removal in food
industry, (4) Oxidative coupling of methane, (5) Source of pure oxygen for
semiconductor industry.
