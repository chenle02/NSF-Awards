This project is enhancing the quality of undergraduate instruction through the
use of a student-grade Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR)
spectrometer for the acquisition of proton and carbon-13 spectra. The 200 MHZ
instrument provides excellent sensitivity and resolution at a reasonable cost.
It is being used in laboratory courses throughout the chemistry curriculum
including organic, inorganic, analytical, physical, and biochemical courses as
well as in undergraduate research projects. Students have hands-on experience in
preparing samples, obtaining spectra, determining structure, measuring coupling
constants and relaxation times, and using the instrument for other chemical
analyses. Thus students gain a thorough knowledge of the capabilities and
limitations of NMR for solving a broad range of chemical problems. This
experience better prepares them as professional chemists and problem solvers,
whether they enter the workforce immediately upon graduation or continue their
formal education in graduate school. *
