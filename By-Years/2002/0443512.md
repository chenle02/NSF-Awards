This project will pursue the theory that the climate anomaly associated with the
North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations is mostly an artifact of temporal
averaging and is the result of the superposition of two distinctive patterns
that occur in different winter seasons. These two patterns, referred to as Type
A and Type N, evolve as a result of different dynamics involving sub-seasonal
climate anomalies across the United States and Europe. The primary objective of
the project is to provide a more fundamental understanding of the dynamical
framework which may allow for more accurate seasonal predictions with relatively
finer spatial and temporal resolution, building upon earlier research by
combining analysis of observations with atmospheric general circulation models,
supplemented by several simpler modeling schemes. This work is expected to make
a significant contribution to the development of the next generation models for
seasonal prediction. The project involves unfunded international collaboration
with researchers in Canada. One graduate student will be supported by the
collaborating investigator at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the Climate
Variability and Predictability Program (CLIVAR).
