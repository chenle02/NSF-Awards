Diane C Bassham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number IOS- 1353867, Autophagy and
ER stress in plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tolerance of changing environmental
conditions is critical for plant growth and survival as they are unable to seek
refuge from the environment. A key unresolved issue is how plants adapt their
cellular functions to respond to stress conditions such as heat and drought. Two
pathways required for stress tolerance are autophagy, in which damaged cell
components are broken down and recycled, and the unfolded protein response, in
which misfolded proteins activate the expression of genes that mitigate stress
damage. In this project, the relationship between these two pathways will be
examined. Additional proteins that are required for the regulation of both of
these pathways will be identified and their functions analyzed by a combination
of biochemical, cell biology and genetic approaches. The mechanism by which
cells select substrates for recycling by autophagy will also be determined. This
will provide insight into how plants sense adverse environmental conditions, how
stress response pathways are then activated and how different responses work
together to produce stress tolerance. The results of this project could provide
information leading to the production of stress tolerant varieties of
agriculturally important plants. The project will provide research training in
plant genetics, cell and molecular biology for graduate and undergraduate
students. In addition, the results of the research will be incorporated into a
module of the Meta!Blast educational video game to help undergraduate and high
school students learn cell biology. Seed stocks and plasmids generated in the
course of the research will be donated to the Arabidopsis Biological Resource
Center for distribution to the scientific community.
