This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in
manufacturing processes for low-cost, multi-functional composite materials that
have marine, rail and other ground transportation safety applications. The key
steps will involve (1) development of innovative manufacturing methods using
out-of-autoclave processes, that are derivatives of liquid molding approaches,
to co-infuse resin systems in multi-layered composites of simple shapes
representative of structures and (2) production of a number of fiber ply/metal
foam combinations and measurement of mechanical and physical properties of these
combinations to assess potential improvements in structural performance such as
damage tolerance and high fatigue life. &lt;br/&gt; Existing materials designed
to protect against flying debris or provide impact protection in vehicles tend
to be heavy and to be appendages on structural systems. The new materials
produced here, which consist of a metal foam surrounded by facing plies of
resin-infused glass, carbon, or aramid fibers, will be designed to integrate
affordability and functionality. Improved properties will lead to new markets
with a focus on enhanced passenger protection in aviation, marine, and ground
vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;
