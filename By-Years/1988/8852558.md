This institution specializes in training future communications professionals,
among whom are significant proportion of minorities. The Science Department
provides instruction in basic science which is integrated with the students'
communications specialties through the preparation of reports such as videotapes
or films on individual research projects. One of the shortcomings of the
students' training has been the lack of experience with modern instrumental
techniques. The instruments purchased through this project have applications in
all Biology laboratory courses, and are available for use in students' research
projects. As a result of this improved science training, it is expected that
graduates, in their future careers in communications, will be able to report
more effectively to the public on matters of science and technology. The grantee
institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-
Federal sources.
