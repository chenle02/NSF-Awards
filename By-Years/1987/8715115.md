The Engineering Foundation Conference "Chemical Engineering Education in a
Changing Environment" is a unique attempt at rapidly introducing high technology
applications, such as the processing of electronic and photic materials,
biochemical processing, the handling of hazardous materials and wastes,
biocontainment, and electrochemical processing into the standard chemical
engineering curriculum. This will be done by having invited speakers briefly
introduce their technology areas, and then discuss one or two detailed examples
of the use of chemical engineering fundamentals to solve problems in these new
technology areas. These examples and their solutions will be in a form that
chemical engineering faculty unfamiliar with these technology areas could
nonetheless use directly in standard courses such as thermodynamics, fluid
mechanics, mass transfer, kinetic and reactor design. Recommendation. This
project provides financial support to allow chemical engineering faculty to
attend the Conference "Chemical Engineering Education in a Changing
Environment", and to prepare and distribute the Proceedings of this Conference.
Support totalling $31,400 is provided by the Engineering Directorate and the
Science and Engineering Directorate in FY 1987.
