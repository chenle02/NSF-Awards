The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to facilitate access to banking services
through use of blockchain/distributed ledger technology, even with limited
internet access. The proposed technology can make transfers more affordable and
convenient. Digitizing transfers increases speed, reduces exchange and transfer
fees, and lowers the risk associated with carrying cash.  This proposed
technology enables access for the 13 million people currently underserved by the
financial industry. If successful, this technology could improve efficiency and
resilience of transfers worldwide. The project's anticipated results include 60%
cost reduction compared to traditional transfer systems, &lt;30 second
transaction completions, and an anticipated 0% fraud
rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project proposes to research and
develop a blockchain-based solution to store, send, and make transfers without a
smartphone or internet. The proposed core technology includes a blockchain back-
end that powers an Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) front-end,
allowing mobile devices to securely send and receive data without an internet
connection. This project’s intellectual merit lies in (1) developing the first-
of-its-kind blockchain-based system for international transactions with access
even in low bandwidth/no bandwidth environments; (2) creating a digital identity
protocol that is distributed, accessible offline, and usable by any entity
without exposing personally identifiable information (PII); and (3) developing
the first machine learning-based microlending algorithms using offline behaviors
to predict, prompt, and automate actions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
