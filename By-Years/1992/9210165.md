The proposed research will investigate the mechanism of isotopic and chemical
interaction between metasomatic fluid and upper mantle assemblages. Xenolith
samples from South African kimberlites and alkali basalts for the southwestern
United States have been chosen for study. Neoblasts, porphyroclasts, and non-
recrystallized phases will be analyzed for REE, LILE (Ba, Sr, Rb, Na, K) and
HFSE (Ti, Nb, Zr, Hf, Ta) by a combination of electron microprobe and SIMS to
discern the relationship of incompatible trace element geochemistry to
recrystallization. Possible variations in oxidation state associated with
textural variations will also be investigated. Isotopic measurements (87Sr/86Sr,
and 143Nd/144ND) will be made on separates of porphyrocalsts and neoblasts of
olivine and orthopyroxene to determine whether isotopic compositions vary
systematically with grain size. In addition, isotopic measurements for garnet,
clinopyroxene, and when possible minor phases (i.e. oxides or mica) will be
determined so that the total data set can be combined with data for garnet and
spinel lherzolites from basalts. This investigation will add to the
understanding of the upper mantle processes which result in metasomatism.
