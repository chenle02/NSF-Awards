This proposal between Dr. Bernard Sadoulet, University of California, Berkeley
and Dr. R. Sunyaev, Space Research Institute will support a workshop with six
leading Russian experimentalists to describe several major projects in particle
astrophysics and astronomy. They will also invite four leading Russian theorists
to discuss the theoretical implications of these projects. The organizers
envisage a one-day presentation by the Russians to an audience of potential
American collaborators, participants in the 16th Texas Symposium on Relativistic
Astrophysics and the 3rd Particles, Strings, and Cosmology Symposium, to be held
jointly at Berkeley from 13-20 December 1992. This project in particle
astrophysics and astronomy fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence.
