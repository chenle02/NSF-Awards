This project will investigate the use of CMAC neural networks for the control of
vibrations. Vibration control problems can be large scale, non-linear and
difficult to model mathematically. Traditional control methods depend on
assumptions (models) about the system structure and generally involve extensive
real-time calculations. In contrast, CMAC develops the control signal from an
experience based of measured system data. One analogy is the sailor who develops
`sea legs`. the sailor uses previous experiences to compensate for boat motion,
not modeling or real-time calculation. The UNH Robotics Lab has reported many
applications of CMAC including robot control, process control, pattern
recognition and signal processing. The real-time operational speed and reduced
memory requirements make CMAC an attractive alternative to there neural
networks. Other neural networks do not offer the bandwidths required for typical
vibration control problems. The CMAC approach offer the ability to work with
multiple frequency disturbances. The investigation will be both theoretical and
applied. The theoretical investigation will be to optimize the CMAC weight
patterns improved dynamic range, and better functional approximation (and hence
better vibration cancellation) characteristics than the traditional CMAC. the
Theoretical investigation of CMAC network are expected to extend the range of
applications of CMAC control to include approximate dynamic programming, the
adaptive critic, and non-linear optimization problems. The application in this
study will be the reduction of hull noise for submarines subject to internal
vibration sources. A fully instrumented reduced scale submarine at the
underwater test facility at the University of New Hampshire will be used for
real-time testing of the CMAC control concepts. the submarine application are
has many of the same characteristics as other vibration control problems such as
noise reduction in automobile and aircraft cabin interiors and hence, this
investigation will impact a variety of applications.
