9622343 Reeder This award supports the research of Professor M. Reeder to work
in automorphic functions. He intends to work on unipotent representations of
reductive p-adic algebraic groups. He also intends to work on p-adic harmonic
analysis. The idea here is to see how various computation relating to Plancheral
measures relate to the geometry of the fixed point varieties of flag manifolds.
Automorphic function theory arose out of Non-Euclidean geometry in the middle of
the nineteenth century. Both mathematicians and physicists have thus long
realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their
basic nature. This field is principally concerned with questions about the whole
numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its
historical roots and thus to problems in areas as diverse as gauge theory in
theoretical physics and coding theory in information theory. ??
