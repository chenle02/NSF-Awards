8912126 Shaneson Shaneson plans to study the local and global analysis and
topology of singular spaces in general and of algebraic varieties in particular.
He also plans to continue to work on some open questions concerning 4-manifolds.
In addition, he and Mark Steinberger (SUNY at Albany) will continue to pursue
the classification of linear representations up to topological similarity. These
are all central problems in geometric topology, and some of them can be expected
to migrate into theoretical physics with an appropriate time lag, if history can
be our guide.
