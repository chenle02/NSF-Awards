This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

Since its founding in 1891, the Ohio State University Herbarium has grown to
become the premier collection of plants from Ohio, documenting the change in
plant diversity and distribution in the state through the last century. This
project focuses on databasing and imaging a large proportion of the herbarium's
Ohio plant specimens, information that will be made publicly available through
their website at http://herbarium.biosci.ohio-state.edu/. In addition, there
will be a mapping facility to allow rapid determination of the distribution for
each species.

The project will have considerable impact beyond its scientific contribution.
The large community of interested non-professional botanists in Ohio will be
able to use the database and associated images to aid in identification and to
learn about the distribution of species in our flora. Other professionals, such
as land managers, will be able to assess the rarity of species in Ohio that are
found on their lands, providing a tool for better stewardship. Because of the
species that are targeted, this project will facilitate completion of the Flora
of Ohio series, the last volume of which is underway. As an educational benefit,
the project will provide experience with museum collections and methods for up
to 20 undergraduates and three graduate students.
