The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Gang Yu Liu of the University of
California Davis. Prof. Liu and her students will study the mechanism and
kinetic properties of nanografting and use these finding to regulate the outcome
of surface reactions and self assembled monolayers (SAMs) formation on surfaces.
The experimental approaches developed during the course of this study such as
advanced nanofabrication methodology, molecular resolution imaging and
structural characterization and qualifications of mixed self assembled
monolayers will benefit the fields of nanotechnology and SAMs-based chemistry
and biochemistry. The study will provide excellent educational training
opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees in the cutting
edge area of nano-scale resolution chemical imaging.
