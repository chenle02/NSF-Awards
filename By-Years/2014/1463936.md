1463936&lt;br/&gt;Kulp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports the acquisition
of a quadrupole detection inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS)
equipped with high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) and laser ablation
(LA) microprobe sample introductions systems for the Department of Geology at
SUNY-Binghampton. The HPLC front-end will allow for the determination of the
speciation of trace metals and metalloids in the environment for investigations
of the geomicrobiological cycling of trace elements, in particular Arsenic and
Antimony, that are toxic at certain valence states. The LA probe will allow for
the introduction of evaporite and marine carbonate hosted fluid inclusions into
the ICP-MS for determination of major (e.g., Na, Mg, Ca, K) and minor (Ba, Br,
Sr) element concentrations and their ratios as proxies of the chemistry of the
seawater from which they formed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies of fluid
inclusion chemistry in Halite and marine carbonates can shed light on the
variability of past ocean chemistry throughout the Phanerozoic with implications
for understanding past climate and mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal processes. The
instrument will also support studies of trace metal concentrations in mineral
aerosols with relevance to environmental health research, studies of igneous
petrogenesis with implications for understanding magma chamber processes, and
studies of the composition of metallic and oxide nanoparticles used for advanced
fuel cell and Li-ion battery engineering. The instrument will support graduate
student research training in analytical geochemistry. This support is congruent
with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and may advance the
national prosperity and welfare through advancing knowledge of the fate and
transport of potentially toxic trace metal species in the environment and
related strategies to mitigate environmental health impacts and in promoting
green energy technology engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
