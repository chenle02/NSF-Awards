This project has as a goal the mathematically rigorous construction and study of
quantum field theory models. This would be an aid to the understanding of
elementary particle physics, ultimately predicting particle masses, scattering
amplitudes, and so forth. It would also help in the study of some properties of
many body systems, particularly critical phenomena. Specific models to be
studied are the following. (1.) The Sine- Gordon model in 2 dimensions. This is
a scalar field with a periodic interaction. It also describes a classical
Coulomb gas. (2.) phi-fourth models in 3 and 4 dimensions. These are scalar
fields with a quartic self-interaction. (3.) Quantum electrodynamics in 3
dimensions. This is the theory of electrons and photons. (4.) Yang Mills in 3
and 4 dimensions. This is a pure non- Abelian gauge theory.
