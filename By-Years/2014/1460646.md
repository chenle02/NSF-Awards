This travel grant supports the participation of U.S.-based students in the 2015
Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) Summer School in
Probability, to be held at McGill University in Montreal, June 15- July 11,
2015. The school is devoted to training of doctoral students in the area of
probability. It anticipates some participation of advanced undergraduate
students, recent Ph.D.s, and also some regular faculty. The PIMS Summer School
2015 is a fantastic opportunity for graduate students and junior researchers to
learn about some of the most active research areas in modern probability theory
from top experts in the field. The junior participants are often current and
future academic faculty, able to spread the knowledge of these fundamental
techniques further in the research community. The PIMS probability summer
schools, launched in 2004, play an outstanding role in the development of an
exceptionally strong community of probabilists in North America and have a
proven track record of fostering long term collaborations between the
participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants will learn current
techniques in some of the most active areas of probability theory, including
random matrix theory and its connection to free probability and enumeration of
maps, high dimensional percolation and scaling exponents near criticality,
continuum scaling limits of critical random structures and their connection to
probabilistic combinatorial optimization and dynamic models of diffusion on
random networks as well as stabilization of partial differential equations via
the addition of randomness. It is expected that the participants will engage in
active research on some topics covered by the main courses and related
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete description of the conference can be
