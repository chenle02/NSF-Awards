Generation and manipulation of quantum entanglement of light fields are key
techniques in the development of practical schemes for quantum information
processing (QIP). In this project, the investigators will explore the all-
optical route towards generation and control of the wave-packet mode properties
of single photons, photon pairs, and multi-photon entangled states. To achieve
this they will use the rapidly-advancing techniques of optical frequency
conversion in second-order nonlinear optical crystals having controlled periodic
structure for the purpose of phase matching. Such nonlinear photonic crystals
can have tailor-made properties, giving the flexibility to design the wave-
packet mode properties needed. And index wave-guiding structures can be
introduced to control the transverse properties of the spatial modes.
Furthermore, recently the method of one-dimensional quasi-phase matching has
been generalized to the case of two-dimensional nonlinear photonic crystals. The
combination of custom-designed periodicity (1- or 2-D) and waveguiding has the
potential to lead to an unprecedented level of optical quantum-state control.
