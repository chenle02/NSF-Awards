With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Claire Ramsey will conduct 18
months of sociolinguistic research on Mexican Sign Language. She and her
consultants will survey 30-40 users of this language, the youngest of whom are
in their mid-60s. The project's first stage will emphasize life histories; the
second stage will emphasize analysis of relational features and region and
coding for verb/classifier features. This project is significant for three main
reasons: (1) It will enhance the already-established network of US and Mexican
researchers who are collaborating on sign language research. (2) The project's
archive of Mexican Sign Language samples will be available to Deaf and hearing
teachers of deaf children, to interpreters, and to the Mexico City Deaf
community. (3) The research will add to knowledge about processes of maintenance
and morbidity in sign languages.&lt;br/&gt;
