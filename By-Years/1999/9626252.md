9626252 Rong The proposed research lies in the general area of Riemannian
geometry. More specifically, it deals with various applications of collapsed
Riemannian manifolds with bounded sectional curvature to global Riemannian
geometry. These applications include structures of fundamental groups of compact
manifolds, and Gauss-Bonnet-Chern type theorems for noncompact manifolds.
Riemannian manifolds are an abstraction of spaces possessing a notion of
distance. These are abstract spaces in that a Riemannian manifold does not have
to lie in an ambient space, unlike curves and surfaces in 3-space. Collapsed
Riemannian manifolds have certain 'singularities' which make them harder to
study, but they arise naturally as limits of certain families of nonsingular
Riemannian manifolds.
