0104649&lt;br/&gt;Phadke&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Arun Phadke and Virgilio
Centano of Virginia Polytechnic and State U. in a collaboration with Hans
Ottosson of Enersearch AB in Malmo, Sweden. The research will focus on
catastrophic failure of power networks, exploration of methods for damage
assessment, control, and restoration of electric power grids following
catastrophic disturbances. Disturbances to be studied include natural disasters
such as earthquakes and tornadoes, and man-made disasters such as terrorist
attacks and human error. The Virginia Tech group will concentrate on information
system infrastructure overview, computer networks, and electric power networks
for robustness in the face of catastrophic events. The Swedish group will make
substantial contributions in each area, and will be able to offer ways to
enhance infrastructures for improved performance. Catastrophic failures of power
networks are a universal phenomenon, and restoration of service to lost loads
occupies the interest of engineers throughout the world. In particular, there is
a significant pool of knowledge on these topics in Northern Europe, which this
collaboration will &lt;br/&gt;
