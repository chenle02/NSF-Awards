This project is mathematical research on Lie groups and their representations.
Such groups, for instance the group of rotations of a sphere, are important
because they embody the symmetries of situations that arise in many areas of
mathematics. The present work is expected to have a high degree of contact with
differential and algebraic geometry, with number theory, with differential
equations, and with the theory of algebraic groups. More specifically, Professor
Millson will study spaces of homomorphisms from a lattice in a Lie group to
another Lie group, and will also pursue geometric questions concerning locally
symmetric spaces associated to orthogonal and unitary groups. Professor
Varadarajan will work on meromorphic differential equations, invariant
differential equations and oscillatory integrals, and invariant analysis for
reductive group actions.
