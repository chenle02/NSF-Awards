This project is funding the development of a Biotechnology Advanced Certificate
program at Harold Washington College (HWC) in Chicago. This certificate
specifically targets students who already have either a 4-year or a 2-year
degree in the appropriate science. A student interest survey, performed at the
college, indicated that these students are interested in working in either the
biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry. The program is designed based on
industry feedback obtained through a survey and meetings with industry. Students
in this program master biotechnology laboratory skills in the context of both
increased academic knowledge, and what they need to know to work in the
industry; for example the development and use of standard operating procedures
(SOPs) and Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs). The majority of students finish the
program in 2 to 3 semesters, ending with a capstone research project. This
project is done at HWC, or in a partnering University of Illinois at Chicago
(UIC) laboratory, or at a biotechnology company. The possibility for broad
impact on the traditionally underserved student population is huge, since HWC is
the only affordable institution of higher learning in this area of Chicago.
