Cloud droplets may collide and capture aerosol particles because of their
different responses to gravitational, inertial, phoretic, or electrical forces.
Dr. Tinsley has shown theoretically that electroscavenging, which refers to the
electrostatically-induced capture of charged aerosol particles by charged cloud
droplets, can be important even in weakly electrified clouds. On this grant he
will extend his calculations of collection efficiency to aerosol particles with
radii ranging from 0.001 to 10 micrometers over a wide range of combinations of
temperature, pressure, humidity, particle charge, particle density, and drop
size. Electrical, inertial, and phoretic effects will be treated separately and
in combination. An exact formulation of the electrical forces between conducting
charged spheres will be compared with the image charge theory used earlier. The
results will be used for estimating the rate of scavenging of aerosol particles
by clouds, an important consideration for atmospheric chemistry and possibly for
the formation of precipitation through the collision of droplets with ice-
forming nuclei. An effort will be made to parameterize the results for use in
numerical cloud models.
