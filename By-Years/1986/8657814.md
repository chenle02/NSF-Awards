Something of revolution has occurred in control theory in the past 10 years
which involves a renewed focus on the critical role that uncertainty in modeling
physical systems plays in controller design. Although this revolution has
included the introduction of significant new mathematics into the field (e.g.
Structured Singular Values (SSV or mu), H infinity optimal control, mu-
synthesis), it is most noteworthy for the impact it is having on practical
applications. There has finally emerged systematic, quantitative methods for the
design of robust control systems, systems that provide performance in the
presence of substantial uncertainty about the physical system being controlled.
The focus of this research effort will be on further extensions to the
mathematics, particulary mu-synthesis. This effort will complement the other
research in this area at Caltech, which is focused on applications, nonlinear
control, and system identification.
