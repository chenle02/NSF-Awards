Michael Falk will continue his research into the interplay of combinatorics and
algebra with the topology of the complement of an arrangement of hyperplanes
over the field of complex numbers. The emphasis will be on two related problems:
the classification problem, and the K(pi,1) problem. The classification centers
on the following question and its converse: is the topology of the complement of
an arrangement determined by the intersection pattern of the original
hyperplanes? The K(pi,1) problem asks for necessary and/or sufficient conditions
for the vanishing of certain topological obstructions in the complement. This
simple object, the complement of a collection of (n-1)- dimensional linear
subspaces in n-dimensional space, displays a surprisingly rich structure. The
variety of methods which have been found useful for analyzing it come from
combinatorics, differential equations, and K-theory.
