This small exploratory grant will examine the use of optical character
recognition (OCR) for handwriting in pre-hospital admission related to emergency
medical services. When such information is put into digital form, it can be
queried and accessed for various forms of analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Epidemiological
analysis for identification and tracking of diseases will be one area of
interest where statistical data available quickly after hospital admission is
critical. Several government agencies in New York will participate, including
the New York State Dept. of Health.&lt;br/&gt;
