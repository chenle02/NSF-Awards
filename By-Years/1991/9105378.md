Reviews of classical embryological studies generally argue that the anterior-
posterior axis in the developing nervous system results from anterior and
posterior inducing activities in dorsal mesoderm acting during gastrulation. It
is also usually concluded that these regional properties are present in the
dorsal mesoderm even before gastrulation commences. Dr. Grainger has found,
however, that the regional inducing capacity of anterior and posterior mesoderm
in Xenopus embryos is not fixed at gastrula stages, but only at neurula stages,
He also finds that regional neuralization in the responding ectoderm is only
fixed at the later stage as well. These results and a critical reevaluation of
the literature on neural induction lead him to support a model differing from
the classical view; he suggests that regional inducing capacity in the mesoderm
and the establishment of anterior-posterior properties in the nervous system are
only gradually acquired during gastrulation. He proposes experiments which will
test several aspects of the proposed model and thereby aims to clarify the
nature of the tissue interactions leading to regionalization of the nervous
system. These studies will provide the information required for future studies
of the signalling systems and gene activities leading to neural regionalization.
