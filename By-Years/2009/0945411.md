This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses three
fundamental challenges to the broad adoption of hydraulic actuation in small
mobile robotic applications: poor efficiency, poor controllability, and noisy
operation. Component level and system level innovations will be combined for a
novel, integrated approach to hydraulic actuation which overcomes these
challenges. Hydraulics research has received relatively little attention since
the 1950's, hence there are significant opportunities for improvement.
Hydraulics research is important because no other actuation technology has come
close to matching the power-density (strength X speed / weight) of hydraulic
systems, and power density is critical for robots intended to do real
work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this
project is large if the challenges that have traditionally limited the adoption
of hydraulic actuation technology can be overcome. It will open up a whole new
range of applications for this actuation technology and for the first time make
possible robots with human/super-human abilities to manipulate, lift and carry
objects in unstructured environments. This will benefit numerous market sectors
such as assistive technologies for aging populations, warehouse automation,
search and rescue, construction, security, entertainment, and flexible factory
automation to name a few. In addition to this, any existing sector that
currently utilizes hydraulic actuation (such as earth moving equipment and
aviation) will benefit significantly from the significantly improved hydraulic
efficiency saving millions of dollars in fuel and preventing untold tons of
carbon from being released into the atmosphere. Preliminary analysis has show
that over 10X improvement in efficiency is achievable in many applications. This
research if successful will make hydraulics a green technology.&lt;br/&gt;
