9521194 Sumney This proposal describes a cooperative partnership between the
U.S. Government, as brokered by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through a
new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), and the Semiconductor Research
Corporation (SRC). The new MOU extends an eight-year cooperative partnership and
permits various Government Agencies to provide support to SRC for semiconductor
research. This research is conducted in U.S. universities with a resultant
intellectual and physical technology transfer to the U.S. Semiconductor
Industry. The intellectual technology part is the knowledge-base provided by
graduate students industry while the physical part is the actual research
findings in the form of technology development coupled with software/modeling
programs. ***
