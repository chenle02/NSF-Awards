NACLO is a high school Olympiad contest in linguistics and language
technologies. Formulating contest problems is not straightforward because the
contest does not have pre-requisites. Because students are not expected to know
linguistics, specific languages, advanced math, or computer programming, the
problems must be self-contained, and yet must still test the skills such as
algorithmic thinking, abstractly representing a solution space, reducing a
solution space, and evaluating a solution. These skills represent computational
thinking, the part of computer science that does not involve computers. Some
problems also introduce tools of linguistics and language technologies such as
finite state machines and context free grammars. So more generally, this Small
Grant for Exploratory research tackles the new problem of designing a curriculum
of training sessions and contest problems that introduce high school students to
computational thinking as it applies to the processng of human languages. The
importance of the project is to inspire students to study linguistics and
computer science and to increase participation and diversity in those
fields.&lt;br/&gt;
