Networks and Development: Exploring an Emerging
Theme&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development economics
focuses on the economics aspects of improving the quality of lives of less
privileged groups regardless of whether they are in advanced economies or less
developed economies. Networks are an ideal tool for modeling the micro aspects
of such behavior since they can be used to focus of the different levels and
types of relations that can exist between individuals in close knit societies.
The proposed conference will be the first one to focus entirely on this emerging
area of study. Our goal is to bring together senior scholars working in this
area to provide an assessment of the current state of knowledge as well as
provide directions for the future by setting out a body of open problems. Junior
scholars and recent graduates who will benefit from the feedback received as
well as from a well defined research agenda. Moreover, an explicit attempt will
be made to expose graduate students from LSU and nearby universities in
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas to this emerging area of research.
Bringing together researchers that use the entire spectrum of methodological
tools as well as junior and senior researchers will provide many opportunities
for fruitful collaboration. The conference will cover all aspects of the
proposed theme: theory, empirical and experimental work.
