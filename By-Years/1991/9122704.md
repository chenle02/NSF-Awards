Moment resisting R/C frames are the most common type of structural system used
for low to moderate rise structures in regions of high seismic risk. If properly
designed and detailed they are very ductile systems capable of enduring the most
severe earthquake input motions. At least two common connection problems have
not been adequately researched, namely wide beam connections and eccentric beam
connections. Due to the lack of experimental studies for these two special
cases, conflicting design recommendations have been developed. Wide beam
connections are permitted by ACI Committee 318 in seismic zones. However, citing
the lack of research, Committee 352 does not allow the use of wide beam
connections in seismic zones. The goal of this research study will be to
generate information through analytical and experimental studies on the behavior
of these special connections under large load reversals and to develop tentative
design recommendations. The focus of this project however, will be on
connections with wide beams. This research effort is expected to develop safe
design guidelines for seismic reinforced concrete beam to column connections
with wide beams.
