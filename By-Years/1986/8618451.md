The general objective of this program is to develop new chemical reactions and
synthesis strategies that will allow complex organic chemicals to be synthesized
efficiently. As a result of the central importance of carbon in organic
chemistry,our studies focus on the development of new selective (chemo-,regio-,
and stereoselective) methods for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The studies
proposed are broad in scope and encompass both mechanistic studies aimed at
developing a fundamental understanding of chemical reactivity and total
synthesis studies aimed at exploring the utility of the reactions we are
developing for the preparation of specific complex target structures. The
majority of our efforts during the proposed project period will focus on
developing new cyclization reactions to prepare medium ring heterocycles and
carbocycles. Of all the types of ring systems (small, common, medium and large)
existing methods are least satisfactory for preparing medium rings. Our studies
are based on an important discovery made during the current grant period that
medium ring ethers can be formed efficiently by simple acetal-alkene
cyclizations. Other investigations will focus on developing new methods to
prepare monocyclic b-lactams in enantiomerically pure form. We will also
continue our collaborative computational and experimental investigations to
develop new models for predicting regio- and stereoselectivity in Diels-Adler
reactions of highly functionalized cycloaddition components.
