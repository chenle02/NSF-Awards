The P.I. will study his newly developed techniques relating group presentations
to certain graph theoretical data, allowing him to extend earlier results
concerning s-transitive graphs, generalized polygons, the sporadic group and
distance-transitive graphs. He will continue his efforts to generalize these
techniques and to apply them to a variety of problems related to sporadic
groups, finite geometries and amalgams. He also will continue his investigation
into the theory of locally s- transitive graphs based on various innovations of
Delgado, Stellmacher and the P.I. which have recently yielded a dramatically
simplified proof of Goldschmidt's theorem on trivalent graphs with an edge-
transitive automorphism group. This research will focus on the area of
mathematics which bridges graph theory and group theory. This blending of
combinatorics and algebra has been a very fruitful endeavor enhancing both
subjects. Weiss is a major worker in this area and his results will surely prove
very important.
