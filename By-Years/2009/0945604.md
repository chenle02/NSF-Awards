This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop
cost-effective organic absorber-based photovoltaics devices by incorporating a
unique solar absorber into the p-type semiconductor, which will increase
absorption over a broader range of the solar spectrum, leading to the increase
in the device current, and thus the energy conversion efficiency.

The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to improve
the energy conversion efficiency and reduce the cost of Organic Photovoltaics
(OPV) devices. Compared to traditional photovoltaics technologies, OPV
technology provides the opportunity to generate solar electricity using abundant
raw materials and be environmentally friendly. The major challenge that hinders
the application of OPV devices is its low conversion efficiency. This project is
anticipated to achieve 10-15% improvement of OPV energy conversion efficiency as
compared to current technology.
