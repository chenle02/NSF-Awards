Abstract 9705712 Robert J. Zimmer The goal of this project is to study a
variety mf questions within the general program of investigating actions of
semisimple Lie groups and their discrete subgroups on manifolds. This includes
an investigation of the topological, geometric, and analytic features of the
spaces on which these groups act, and the corresponding features of the actions
themselves. Applications of these questions to ergodic theory and differential
geometry will be studied as well. The techniques of algebraic ergodic theory,
i.e., the interaction of the ergodic theory with algebraic groups, in
conjunction with differential geometry, will be used throughout the project. The
study of symmetry has played a fundamental role in mathematics and its
applications. Within mathematics it has become understood as one of the central
themes of most disciplines, and it has had applications as diverse as particle
physics, design of efficient networks, coding, and radar. This project aims to
contribute to this general development by the study of situations in which there
is a large symmetry group, in many cases exactly the situation in which
applications are most present.
