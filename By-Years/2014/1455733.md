By analyzing and predicting program dynamic behaviors, program behavior analysis
offers the fundamental support for program transformations and resource
management. Its effectiveness is crucial for the maximization of computing
efficiency. This research proposes to include program inputs---a so far
virtually ignored dimension---into the focus of program behavior analysis,
cultivating a new paradigm, namely input-centric program behavior analysis and
adaptation. This input-centric paradigm will create many new opportunities for
enhancing the matching between software and hardware, hence significantly
improving the performance and power efficiency in modern
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technique, input-centric program
behavior analysis and adaptation, consists of three components. The first two
components, program input characterization and input-behavior modeling, resolve
the complexities of program inputs, extract important features, and recognize
the correlations between characterized input features and program behaviors. The
third component, input-centric adaptation, capitalizes on the novel
opportunities that the first two components create, making dynamic optimizations
proactive and holistic, but without losing the adaptivity to inputs and
environmental changes. Together, the three components make evolvable programming
systems more feasible than before. In such a system, the input-behavior models
embody the central knowledge base, which grows incrementally across program
production runs. As the knowledge base becomes larger, behavior prediction
becomes more accurate, stimulating better software-hardware matching and making
the program and runtime systems perform increasingly better. Because of the
fundamental role of program behavior analysis in software-hardware matching,
this research helps pave the way for advancing the optimizations in various
layers in the software execution stack (compilers, virtual machines, OS, etc.).
