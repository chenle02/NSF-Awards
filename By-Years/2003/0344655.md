Homologous recombination between chromosomes is a fundamental source of genetic
variation and the basis of nearly all genetics and breeding. Meiotic
recombination also permits construction of genetic maps, important for
applications ranging from marker-assisted selection to map-based cloning of
valuable genes. Remarkably, despite its central importance to genetics, little
is known about the process of homologous recombination in higher plants, and
even less about how it is controlled. This is a comprehensive study of the
meiotic recombination process in maize, the largest agricultural crop in the
U.S. and a uniquely suited model system for these studies. The study is broad in
scope, from discovering new genes involved in the process to mechanisms of
crossing over and electron microscopy of protein complexes carrying out
recombination events. This research will directly enhance understanding of how
plant genomes generate and maintain diversity, how plant genomes are organized
and how plant genome organization can influence recombination outcomes. The goal
is also to develop a resource on which the community can base future studies of
recombination in all plants.
