In this project, Kriz works in K-theory and related areas. For example, methods
of Real K-theory, which he generalized to the subject of Real cobordism jointly
with Po Hu, are receiving current attention because of their relevance in the
recent solution of the famous Kervaire-Milnor problem by Hill, Hopkins and
Ravenel. A part of this project is dedicated to investigating further questions
arising from these developments. In another aspect of the project, Kriz
investigates algebraic and Hermitian K-theory, following his recent joint paper
with Hu and Ormsby solving the homotopy limit problem for algebraic Hermitian
K-theory. This leads to new investigations in motivic homotopy theory.

The field investigated in this project is a part of algebraic topology, which
plays a central role in contemporary mathematics: its methods are used in
diverse fields from geometry and analysis to number theory and algebra. The
field also has interdisciplinary application. It has become clear in recent
years that algebraic topology, and specifically K-theory, on which this project
focuses, are crucial tools of mathematical physics in its ongoing quest toward
explaining the fundamental physical laws of our universe.
