One of the major problems in modern cosmology is understanding how structure
arose in the expanding universe from a very smooth early state. This is
generally thought to be the result of gravity. This project obtains new
understandings of the development of structure by gravity from various kinds of
initial conditions which may have existed in the early universe The
investigators develop and apply nonlinear mathematical approximation methods as
well as computer simulations of the formation of structure. They concentrate on
the further development of statistical tests which can be used to objectively
compare computer models to astronomical data.
