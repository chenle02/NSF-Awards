9508402 Chapman The PI will modernize and extend his current laboratory
facilities and make a series of rock thermal diffusivity measurements to be used
in climate change studies. He will upgrade his equipment by the replacement of
the existing microvoltmeter and the addition of computer control, and will
incorporate a new needle probe to permit measurement of rocks unsuitable for the
present setup that makes use of a divided bar, and to allow measurement of
thermal diffusivity. The experiments will measure rock samples from sites where
well-bores have allowed ground temperature determinations over the last 2
centuries. These experiments will allow independent assessment of the accuracy
of the bore-hole measurements. ****
