9418215 Drake This award provides partial (52%) funding for the acquisition of
components needed to assemble a multi-anvil high-pressure system that will be
installed in the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona.
The University is committed to providing the remaining funds required for the
acquisition. The apparatus is designed to sustain experimental sample pressures
up to 250 kilobars with simultaneous temperatures up to 3000K. Research
applications of the equipment will include controlled experiments to measure the
partitioning of trace elements between liquid and crystalline phases thought to
be present during the early formation history of the Earth and other planets.
