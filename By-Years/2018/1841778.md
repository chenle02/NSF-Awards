This award provides funding for US participation in the conference
"International Workshop on Partial Differential Equations and Complex Analysis"
that will be held August 13-17 at the Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos in
Brazil. The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in
the fields of Several Complex Variables and Partial Differential Equations.

A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this
