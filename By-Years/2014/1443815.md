Data centers (DC) are digital warehouses for information technology (IT)
equipment such as computer servers, network switches, and storage devices. To
maintain their computational reliability, waste heat from the DC facility is
removed by dedicated cooling hardware such as computer room air conditioning
units and rear door heat exchangers. Because these cooling hardware systems
demand 40-50% of the data center electricity consumption (often in the order of
few million kWh), their energy-efficient operation is imperative for the
optimization of total cost of ownership for a DC. This team has developed a
real-time software application that will recommend the optimal cooling set-
points for different cooling hardware in a data center.

The proposed software (DataCOOL) will deliver real-time end-to-end cooling
resource optimization software for data centers. The critical value proposition
of DataCOOL lies in its data center cooling cost optimization, derived from
elastic resource allocation and risk mitigation from stochastic data center
traffic. These values are derived from a model-order reduction algorithm. The
proposed technology could potentially save 15-25% of a data center's annual
operational expenditure. An extensive literature survey indicates that the
proposed methodology is substantially different from the existing approaches.
The primary target customers would include large IT companies with data centers
such as: Cisco, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook. On the other hand, the
team also expects to work closely with mid-size data center companies like
Equinix, Internap, and QTS to validate that the proposed prototype is delivering
claimed cost-saving benefits.
