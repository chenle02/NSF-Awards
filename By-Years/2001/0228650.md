The Directorate for Education and Human Resources Programs (EHR) of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) proposes to organize and
facilitate the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Graduate Teaching Fellows in
K-12 Education (GK-12) Principal Investigators' Annual Meeting to be held early
in November 2002. In doing so, AAAS will work cooperatively with NSF's Division
of Graduate Education, which houses GK-12, to organize a two-day meeting for
principal investigators and other members of the GK-12 funded programs,
including K-12 teachers and graduate teaching fellows. AAAS/EHR will arrange
pre-conference activities, develop the agenda in cooperation with NSF staff,
host the meeting, oversee all meeting logistics, interpret and summarize
findings from discussions and presentations, and prepare electronic and print
documents.
