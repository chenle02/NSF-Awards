The goal of this project is to understand how nerve cells in the spinal cord
produce locomotion. The studies will be conducted using a lower vertebrate as a
model system. The spinal cord of all vertebrate animals is composed of the same
types of nerve cells which are organized in a similar manner, but the spinal
cord of lower vertebrate has fewer cells and simpler behavior; thus, the
decreased complexity makes it a good model system. These studies will
investigate how intersegmental coordination is produced; that would be analogous
to studying in humans how the neurons controlling flexion and extension of the
hip are coordinated with the neurons controlling flexion and extension of the
knee and ankle. The principle investigator, Dr. Karen Sigvardt, will work in
collaboration with mathematicians to develop a mathematical framework for the
results of the studies which will utilize both physiological and anatomical
techniques. This work will contribute to knowledge about the way in which the
spinal cord controls coordinated movements.
