This project is developing innovative, theoretically rigorous algorithms to
learn from continuously arriving (streaming) data. Specific challenges addressed
are class imbalance (one of the concepts to be learned is very rare, as in
disease detection), cost constraints on both obtaining features (e.g.,
computationally expensive image processing), and cost constraints on obtaining
class labels (e.g., human annotation.) The algorithms developed in this project
make it possible to effectively address big data challenges in streaming data
due to increased complexities in various aspects such as heavily imbalanced data
distributions, ultrahigh dimensional features, a large number of labels, highly
complex constraints, etc. The project will also contribute to training future
professionals in big data analytics, including participation in the University
of Iowa's undergraduate summer research program and high school student training
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most work devoted to online learning algorithms
and their analysis were developed with the goal of minimizing a symmetric
measure (e.g., the classification error) and without considering practical
constraints arising in big data. This project addresses imbalanced data by
developing online learning algorithms for minimizing asymmetric measures
including F-score, area under the ROC curve, and area under precision and recall
curve. Convex or non-convex surrogate loss functions that well-approximate these
asymmetric measures are constructed and minimized in an online fashion. The
project also develops online algorithms under three types of constraints arising
in big data context namely constraints on computing costs, on query costs, and
complex inequality constraints, by exploring techniques in randomized
algorithms, active learning and convex optimization. The developed algorithms
are being evaluated in real applications including biomedical semantic indexing,
social media mining, and image annotation.
