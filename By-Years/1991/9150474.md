Faculty from seven institutions (four women's colleges, a former women's
college, and two coed universities) will develop a laboratory-intensive
curriculum for introductory chemistry. Fourteen laboratory modules will involve
students in beginning inorganic or organic chemistry for two to four lab periods
each. The project will design 28 modules in all, and each module engages
students in projects in chemistry from everyday life. They will be tested by
undergraduate students from the consortium and local high school teachers,
modified, and put in place at those institutions. Seven additional institutions
will give the tested modules a trial run. Finally, the modules will be put in
form for publication. The results of this instruction will be judged on the
basis of increased number of students taking higher level chemistry courses and
staying in the science "pipeliine".
