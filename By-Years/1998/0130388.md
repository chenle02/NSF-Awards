Bloomington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Topological Quantum
Computation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of quantum computation is being
constructed from abstract study of topological properties of collective electron
systems. One example is the dancing pattern of quasi-particles in fractional
Quantum Hall effects. The dancing patterns of quasi-particles are described
mathematically by braids. In this context, the Berry phase of the quasi-
particles gives rise representations of braids. In mathematical terms, these are
modular functors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is using insights from
modular functors to investigate the possibilities for physical realization of
quantum computers. The chief advantage of topological quantum computation is
physical error correction. The rich mathematical structure of modular functors
is also employed to design new quantum algorithms. Topological Quantum
Computation Numerical Laboratory is being established as an intermediate step
towards the physical implementation of a real quantum computer based on the
principles of modular functors. A lecture and seminar series at Indiana
University is organized to training students. This cross-disciplinary project
involves topology, condensed matter physics, and computer science.&lt;br/&gt;
