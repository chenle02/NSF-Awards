This workshop is designed as a first step to exchange information and write a
report on the evolution of biochemical mechanisms for signal transduction, from
simple unicellular to complex multicellular organisms. The workshop will search
for general principles and will hope to start a database and network, and to
catalyze research in this important area of biology. The workshop will begin to
define the important issues in the evolution of biological information
processing.
