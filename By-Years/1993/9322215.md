ABSTRACT -- CTS-9322215 Emery The proposal requests funds to support cooperative
work between the University of Washington and the Moscow Aviation Institute. The
project will utilize the combined expertise of the two institutions to address
problems involving optimal parameter estimation methods and optimal sensor
location procedures for thermal and thermal-based structural problems. The
collaboration will combine the expertise of the Moscow Aviation Institute in
deterministic one-dimensional inverse and sensitivity problems with that of the
University of Washington in two-dimensional statistical sensitivity studies
using finite element methods.
