This grant support acquisition of new computational equipment in the Department
of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of New Mexico. Specific
equipment will include: 1) a dual CPU Sun Enterprise server; 2) a SunBlade
workstation; 3) two dual Intel CPU PC workstations; and 4) a digital linear tape
(DLT) storage device. New computational equipment will augment an existing but
aging UNIX-based computer network in the department and will be used for
research and education in lithospheric geodynamics, gravity modeling and
landscape evolution. ***
