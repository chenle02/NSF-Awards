This workshop brings together political scientists and legal scholars within the
Law and Social Sciences discipline to facilitate greater intellectual coherence
in the future research directions of scholars studying the role of comparative
and international law. The workshop will assess the extent to which current
graduate training and current programmatic focus can be altered in the future in
order to facilitate greater intellectual synergy among scholars in this area. As
such, the two day workshop will bring together leading junior and senior
scholars in this area to define the expected research needs and propose research
directions for scholarship and training in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
workshop is anticipated to strengthen existing interdisciplinary engagement
within the Law and Social Sciences discipline -- it brings together law faculty
with their social science counterparts around key research questions as well as
common programmatic concerns.
