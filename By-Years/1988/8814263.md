This Presidential Young Investigator Award project is in the general area of
analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of interfacial charge
transfer. The objective of this research is to develop a quantitative,
predictive description of the microscopic variables which control photoeffects
at the semiconductor/liquid junction. Specific efforts include exploration of
new semiconductor/liquid junctions, development of quantitative theories for
describing behavior of known systems, and development of chemical and physical
probes for the characterization of surface recombination sites at these
junctions. This action provides the $25,000 base plus $37,500 in fully matched
funds for the fifth and final year of this Presidential Young Investigator Award
which was originally granted to Professor Lewis (CHE-8352151) when he was a
faculty member at Stanford University. The studies which are enabled by this
award are providing insights into how photoelectrochemical processes at
semiconductor/liquid interfaces can be controlled and are pointing the way
toward the rational design of new and improved photoelectrochemical systems.
