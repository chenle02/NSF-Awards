9614235 Ostrom A new approach, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass
spectrometry (MALDI-MS), to determine the amino acid sequence of the protein
osteocalcin in bones of ancient organisms and their closest modern ancestors to
establish preliminary evolutionary relationships and assess indigeneity. The use
of osteocalcin, the particular samples available, and the application of MALDI-
MS provide a unique position of strength for the proposed research. Osteocalcin
has several extremely important attributes which include intimate association
with the hydroxyapatite mineral phase of bone, preferential preservation over
time, exclusive occurrence in vertebrate mineralized tissues, absence in common
contaminators including microbes, invertebrates and plants, retention of
immunological specificity via radioimmunoassay (RIA), and the existence of an
extensive database of protein sequences for osteocalcin. In our particular case,
prior work has confirmed the presence of osteocalcin via RIA for all ancient
samples. The MALDI-MS technique is not subject to the myriad of problems that
confront traditional methods for protein sequencing. Although this approach has
never been attempted on ancient proteins, we intend to demonstrate its potential
to delineate ancient protein sequences and, thus, identify indigenous organic
matter. Given the exclusive yet ubiquitous occurrence of osteocalcin among
vertebrates, the techniques developed in this project will be directly
applicable for molecular studies on any number of other vertebrate lineages with
obscured evolutionary relationships.
