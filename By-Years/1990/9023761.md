This work continues the nuclear theory program of Carl Shakin and Louis Celenza
at CUNY Brooklyn. A broad range of problems will be addressed concerning nuclear
structure and reactions at mean-field and relativistic energy scales and
problems related to the underlying quark substructure of nuclei. The emphasis is
on relativistic theoretical frameworks. Some selected topics are the description
of nuclear matter using light front dynamics, the general theory of
electromagnetic response functions, a comparison of instant and light-front
dynamics and light-front structure functions of nucleons.
