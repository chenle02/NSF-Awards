Recognition of inherited zircons of 3200 m.y. age in a mid-Devonian pluton in
eastern Maine suggest that Archean basement may be present in parts of the
northern Appalachians. This research will examine a number of plutons along a
transect from southeastern to central Maine to establish whether small amounts
of inherited zircons are present in plutons of different compositions with
different emplacement histories. These plutons are present in areas previously
interpreted as belonging to different source terranes. The present research
would establish whether characterization of inherited zircons is a feasible
techique for terrane recognition.
