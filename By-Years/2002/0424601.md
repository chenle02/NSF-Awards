This award supports participants in a two-day symposium on reasoning and
learning in cognitive systems to be held at Stanford University on March 20-21,
2004. The purpose of the symposium is to bring together researchers and students
in order to allow them to share recent results from their own specialties within
artificial intelligence and cognitive science, particularly about machine
learning and reasoning, in order to foster collaborations and new research
directions that reflect facets of cognitive systems currently overlooked in
current research. A central aspect of the symposium will be invited talks and
commentaries to be given by established researchers whose work provides a good
sampling of research at the intersection of reasoning and learning.
