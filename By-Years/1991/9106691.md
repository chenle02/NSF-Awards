Duke University Medical Center is currently improving its facilities for
Molecular Biophysics, and this equipment will be central to an X-ray 'shared
resource' of the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center. It will be available to all
faculty members in this field of research and will help the Department of
Biochemistry in their efforts to attract a new faculty member in the field of
protein crystallography. Finally, it will also act as a major focus for a
Molecular Biophysics graduate program that is being developed within the Medical
School. The program will help to attract quality students to the many groups at
Duke that are becoming involved in structural research.
