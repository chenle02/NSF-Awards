Bargaining is an essential element in the resolution of the conflict in many
situations. The situations range in importance from a couple's decision to
attend a ballet to the negotiations over nuclear disarmament. In these
situations, cooperative actions can result in gains to all involved but
conflicts arise over the selection of a particular action because this choice
determines the distribution of these gains. Through implicit or explicit
bargaining, parties often reach mutually acceptable outcomes. That these
conflicts more often result in agreements rather than in deadlocks suggests that
bargaining behavior is systematic. Experimental evidence on bargaining problems
also suggests that bargaining behavior is systematic. This project continues to
develop an original and very promising way of modelling the systematic features
of bargaining behavior. The approach taken breaks each bargaining problem into a
series of interrelated simple bargaining problems. A multilateral solution to
the bargaining problem is derived from solving each of the simple bargaining
problems in a way that captures their interrelationship. This is exciting
research because only one of the traditional solution concepts for cooperative
games has yielded significant insights into economic problems. The development
of a second useful solution concept for cooperative bargaining games would be a
major contribution. The basic theory of multilateral bargaining was developed by
the investigator under her previous NSF award. This award permits her to use
multilateral bargaining to analyze bargaining equilibria for marriage markets
with nontransferable utility and two-sided matching markets, such as labor
markets, where desirable matches may involve more than one participant on one
side of the market. She also plans to show that multilateral bargaining is
consistent with rational behavior by proving that the multilateral bargaining
solutions of noncooperative games coincide with the set of Nash equilibria
outcomes.
