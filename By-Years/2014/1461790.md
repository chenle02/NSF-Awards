This project will focus on the interconnections of environmental degradation and
mass violence after the cessation of armed conflict. The project will address
specifically how programs designed to augment both water and food security in
the aftermath of civil war may actually facilitate further conflict and
violence. Water-management projects, including the intensification and expansion
of irrigation schemes, well illustrate this dynamic. It is widely understood
that water management issues have a bearing on post-conflict societies. However,
much of the literature presumes that armed conflict contributes to the
destruction of these schemes whereas peace-building efforts improve such
schemes. This relationship is not so straightforward, in that many post-conflict
practices may lead to renewed, but altered, forms of conflict and violence. This
project therefore will provide insight into the complex dynamics of armed
conflict, post-conflict rebuilding processes, and the impact on the environment.
This has important implications in that resource scarcities, including that of
water, are assumed to lead to more conflict in the future.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Through the use of recent advances in geospatial technologies,
coupled with archival research, this project provides an empirically-grounded,
scientific approach to the interplay of conflict and the environment. Drawing on
theoretical insights developed in environmental security studies, specifically
water and food security studies, this project will advance basic knowledge on
deforestation that results from the construction of irrigation schemes in a
post-conflict setting. Investigators will focuses on the case study of Khmer
Rouge irrigation projects that were developed during the Cambodian genocide.
This study is important in that it provides a real-world empirical example from
which to examine actual policies and their subsequent impact on the environment.
Throughout the course of this project, two graduate students will obtain first-
hand research experience working in a foreign setting.
