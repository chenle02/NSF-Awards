The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to increase
student and eventually, employee engagement, by better aligning skills and
innate interests with degree programs, particularly novel STEM programs. In
response to increasing demand for new types of jobs, degree programs such as
Computational Genomics and Music Technology have combined fields that have
historically been distinct. This project enables students to discover both
traditional and emerging majors relevant to them. By providing actionable
insights and better alignment of interests early on, this decreases the friction
of changing majors (~80% currently) during college and begins to mitigate
widespread lack of engagement (~70%) in the workplace. Compared with traditional
methods that match GPAs, test scores, unstructured essays, and resumes, with
schools, majors, and job openings, this project could revolutionize the way
students identify, train and prepare for their future careers.

This I-Corps project is based on a novel patent-pending technology of a unified
multi-dimensional data representation method called Skills Genome. Skills Genome
can be exploited by several machine learning models, allowing for capturing and
modeling complex student data inputs such as critical thinking, communication,
interests, leadership, etc. with temporal graphs. By making the structure of the
graph accessible to several machine learning models, the method improves
accuracy, relevance and facilitates scale. Specifically, this tracks the
student?s development timeline, so they can best determine the timing and
sequencing of skills needed for their chosen careers. Further, by matching
profiles at scale, new insights into potential careers can be surfaced, along
with the next steps needed to achieve them.
