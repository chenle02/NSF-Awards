9525858 Huyer Oceanographic data from hydrographic survey collected within the
TOGA COARE (Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment) domain will be
combined with data from stationary platforms (both ships and moorings) to study
advective and mixing processes in the upper western tropical Pacific. Budgets of
potential and turbulent kinetic energy will be conducted in order to (1)
determine rates and magnitudes at which atmospheric forcing can supply potential
energy to the surface layer of the Warm Pool; (2) identify the important
processes associated with the dynamics of the surface layer under various
forcing conditions; and (3) parameterize entrainment and mixing in the
thermocline.
