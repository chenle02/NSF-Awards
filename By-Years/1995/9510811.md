This action funds an NSF/Sloan Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Molecular Evolution for 1995 for two years. The training and research plan will
be conducted at Yale University under the sponsorship of Dr. Leo W. Buss of the
Department of Biology. The research will focus on the expression of genes in a
non segmented, radially symmetric organism. The spatial and temporal expression
patterns of these genes in the life cycle of a marine Cnidarian are expected to
suggest their primitive functions and provide the foundation for subsequent
comparative study of the emergence of morphological novelty.
