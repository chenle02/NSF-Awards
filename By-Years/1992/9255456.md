Workshops to enhance Quantitative Instruction on American Society (QIAS) will
bring together 40 social scientists teaching at the undergraduate level. The
workshops will involve two sequential sessions in each of two years. During the
initial five-day June workshop participants will use microcomputers to work
actively with data exploration software and large scale data bases doing
exercises which foster scientific thinking, analytic skills and an inquiry-
based approach to social science teaching and learning. Participants use their
own data along with data from the General Social Survey and the National
Election Study to develop material for their own courses. Following this
workshop faculty participants will return to their home campuses and experiment
with altering curriculum to include quantitative instruction. The following
January they will reassemble at a three-day follow-up workshop and demonstrate
their materials for their workshop colleagues. Throughout the program networking
will be encouraged and instructional applications shared through a newsletter.
