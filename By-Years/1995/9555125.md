Engineering education often focuses on disseminating technical information,
without helping students make the connections between this information and both
their own life experiences and the processes they will encounter in their
careers. This results in a lack of true understanding, excitement and motivation
for the subject matter. Students from non-traditional backgrounds and with non-
traditional learning styles are particularly affected. The goals of this project
are to integrate exposure to chemical engineering processes into the curriculum,
motivate students to become actively involved in their education and view the
world from a chemical engineering perspective, satisfy the variety of learning
styles of chemical engineering students, and assess the effectiveness of
multimedia approaches in achieving the above goals. Interactive multimedia
software will be developed. The software will be divided into three components:
Technical Content Modules, Chemical Engineering Case Studies, and an
Encyclopedia of Chemical Engineering Equipment. These components can be used
together or individually in introductory chemical engineering classes as well as
in freshman design courses. This software will integrate graphics, animations,
full color still images and moving video clips into a multimedia package that
will allow students to learn the basic concepts in chemical engineering through
exploration of actual situations ranging in scope from simple bench-scale
experiments and day to day experiences to chemical manufacturing plants. The
effectiveness of these materials will be tested, and the software will be
disseminated nationally through the use of CD-ROMs suitable for both Macintosh
and Windows computers, and through the World Wide Web. In addition, it is likely
that Prentice-Hall will distribute these materials. N.SF Form 1295 (11/93)
