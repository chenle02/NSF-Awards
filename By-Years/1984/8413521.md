Research into trapped particle instabilities is a difficult area for
experimental study because both ions and electrons are involved. A specialized
small experimental chamber has provided insight into mechanisms of growth of
instabilities in plasmas. The research results both experimentally and
theoretically now indicate that feedback systems working in the relatively cool
portions of the plasma might be feasible. This concept is being examined more
carefully by additional research.
