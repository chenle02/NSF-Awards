The grant is for partial support for the purchase of a quantitative energy
dispersive x-ray micro-analysis system for the scanning electron microscope of
the Materials Science Department at Marquette University. The instrument will
support the research of several investigators by providing the capability of
qualitatively and quantitatively determining the chemical composition of
microscopic constituents in ceramic and metallic specimens. Topics of research
for which the instrument will be used include studies of diffusion induced grain
boundary migration in materials, characterization of zinc oxide varistor
materials, characterization of ceramic oxides which are used for solid state
detectors, etc. The investigators are all judged to be outstanding scientists,
and the instrument will add greatly to their capability to perform their
research.
