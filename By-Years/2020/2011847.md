Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and
Universities to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to
strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate
education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty
member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution.
and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at Fort
Valley State will redesign three biology courses. Students at Fort Valley State
University will be provided undergraduate research opportunities and learn
scientific communication. FVSU faculty will be able to enhance their teaching
techniques by participating in training workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fort
Valley State University proposes to enhance the academic infrastructure in
biology to meet the increasing demand for minority scientists to pursue careers
in clinical and laboratory research. The curricula in three upper-division
courses will be revised with an emphasis on integrating modern concepts in
biotechnology. This will be accomplished by employing constructivist pedagogy,
integration of course-based research experiences (CUREs), and cyber-instruction.
The practice of active learning is likely to build studentâ€™s core competencies-
application of the process of science, quantitative reasoning, effective
communication, collaboration, appreciation for the interdisciplinary nature of
science, and mastery in scientific communication skills. Through active
engagement, students will make meaningful connections, gain multiple
perspectives on modern-day-science leading to improved critical learning and
problem-solving skills, and thus will be better prepared for the 21st-century
skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
