The Huanghe (Yellow River) is one of the world's largest in terms of sediment
discharge to the ocean (approximately 1.1 billion tons per year) and largest in
terms of suspended matter concentration 25 grams per liter. This award will
allow retrieval of both river and estuarine data for the Huanghe. The former
data set includes measurements of average daily discharge (of water and
sediment) at a number of selected stations along the river, from above the loess
hills that form the primary sediment source downstream to Kenli (20 kilometers
from the river mouth). The estuarine data include hydrographic, current meter
and suspend matter observations and samples collected synoptically during three
cruises 1984 and 1987 for periods of 2 to 3 days. The river and estuary data
both include several stations across the channel cross section, thus allowing
proper width-and- averages to be calculated and compared with numerical models.
These unique data sets will allow characterization of transport patterns of the
Huanghe along its path with respect to time and distance as well as discharge
patterns into the adjacent Gulf of Bohai. The present study focuses primarily on
the estuary itself: how the sediment discharged at its head propagates through
the estuary and is discharged to the delta front.
