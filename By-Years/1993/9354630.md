9354630 Olivo The Neuroscience Simulation Project will develop realistic,
interactive, computer-based simulations of experiments in neuroscience, a field
of rapid growth and increasing undergraduate interest. The simulations are
targeted at introductory and intermediate courses in biology, psychology and
neuroscience, especially at large courses that do not include a laboratory.
Students in such courses often have difficulty understanding the remarkably
rapid and dynamic responses of neurons, because these aspects are not conveyed
well by static pictures in textbooks. Realistic, interactive simulations in
which students see and hear neuronal responses as they control stimuli
interactively give a much better understanding of the pace and dynamics of
activity in the brain and nervous system. The Neuroscience Simulation Project,
which will be extended and enlarged by this funding, was founded at Smith
College in 1990 with partial support from the New England Consortium for
Undergraduate Science Education. Its first software release, MacRetina,
generated strong interest in the neuroscience community and won a Distinguished
Natural Science Software Award in 1992 from EDUCOM. The pedagogical and
technical challenges mastered in producing MacRetina will serve as a strong
foundation for the proposed development of new simulation software. ***y
