With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program in the Chemistry
Division, Professor Szalewicz will develop new methods which allow the accurate
prediction of molecular properties and apply these methods to small molecules of
chemical interest. The PI will employ a basis set of Gaussian type geminals
which will explicitly contain the interelectronic distance. This basis set will
be used within the framework of high-level many body perturbational and coupled
cluster methods. The method will be applied to diatomic and multi-center
molecules containing up to about twenty electrons. Specific problems in
spectroscopy and structural chemistry will be investigated.
