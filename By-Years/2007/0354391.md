The ongoing effort to produce gravitational wave templates by the accurate
numerical modeling of astrophysically interesting sources remains stymied by
numerical instabilities revealed by the lack of satisfaction of the constraint
equations. It appears as though these difficulties are most likely to be
resolved by a close link between formal mathematics and hard-core numerical
methods. The resolution to this quandary proposed is that the source for the
instabilities is the constraint equations when not adequately enforced. The
proposal is to develop a fully constrained evolution code by starting from an
already existing finite element code for the Einstein constraint equations.
&lt;br/&gt;The principle aim of the first of these projects is to solve the
instability problems that plague many of the existing black hole collisions
studies. If black holes are stable objects then the instabilities found in
previous numerical computations must be artifacts of the approximations made and
not features of genuine black hole evolutions. It is hoped that the approach of
the PI will solve this crucial problem. A second topic of investigation will be
Light cone estimates for Einstein's equations. This approach will be used to
show under what conditions time evolution of Einstein's equations will lead to
the curvature becoming singular. &lt;br/&gt;
