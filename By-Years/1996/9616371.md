Managing Difference in Orientation and Strategy in Group Negotiation The
proposal involves a study of how initial differences in motivational orientation
of group members affects group member's strategic behavior in the course of a
negotiation and thus, the outcome of the negotiation. The PI outlines 10
hypotheses about how changes in the proportion of individualistic versus
cooperatively oriented negotiators will influence the negotiation process and
outcome. These hypotheses will be tested in an experimental setting.
