This award is for support of a workshop on the role of the Laurentide Ice Sheet
in the climate system. The interaction and relative importance of the ocean,
atmosphere, and ice in the climate system during the last glacial cycle will be
the focus of the workshop. A number of new and significant developments in
research of ice-age climates, ice-sheet dynamics, and the geologic record of
climate change indicate that ice sheets played a dynamically significant role in
climate change of potentially global significance. The primary objective of the
workshop is to coordinate multidisciplinary studies of the climate system in
order to initiate data-model integration and model development.
