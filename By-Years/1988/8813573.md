This is a Minority Research Inititation (MRI) grant to examine the growth
factors that control hormonal actions that produce testosterone. Some of these
growth factors are synthesized and secreted by certain highly specialized cells.
The study of the process is complicated in mammals because cells at all stages
of development are present at any one siting. the investigator will test
qualitative and quantitative effects of growth factors on sperm cell
development. The planning period will allow the development of a process to
isolate, prepare, and identify sample cell cultures in the laboratory. This
grant will provide support for a well-trained Minority biologist to prepare a
competitive proposal to submit to the MRI research initiation component.
