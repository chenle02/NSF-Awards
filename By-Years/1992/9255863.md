The American Institute of Physics (AIP) and the American Association of Physics
Teachers (AAPT) are hosts to the XXIV International Physics Olympiad in
Williamsburg, VA in July 1993. The Olympiad, held annually in a different
country, provides opportunity for five students from each of about forty
countries to participate in an international competition. The Olympiad is a
seven day event which consists of a theoretical examination of three questions
to be answered in five hours and an experimental investigation to be done in
about four hours. Also included in this Olympiad are field trips to Busch
Gardens, Williamsburg and CEBAF, time to interact, and ceremonial events. The
examination are critiqued, translated, graded and discussed with the team
leaders during the Olympiad. The selection process in the US gives opportunity
for over 600 students and their teachers to become acquainted with the world
class standards. The AIP does the fund raising and the AAPT plans, organizes and
implements the Olympiad. Problems used to select the US team will be published
in a magazine for physics teachers to demonstrate world-class problems.
