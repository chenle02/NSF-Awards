The investigator proposes to develop parallel methods for solving unconstrained
optimization problems and to implement them on a 1024-processor hypercube such
as the NCUBE 1 machine at the University of South Carolina. In particular, she
proposes to parallelize those parts of the algorithm that are costly and where
speedups are most useful, namely the linear algebra solution and updating. The
PI wants to approach the problem by finding updating strategies for the Hessian
on the basis of the type of linear equation solver used to find the direction
dk. These would not include, for example, the factored or unfactored parallel
versions of the BFGS method using either the Hessian or its inverse since these
have already been parallelized. The PI would consider two methods for solving
linear equations: a) the LU factorization or some variation of it, and b) an
iterative method using multiple blocks. In summary, the PI would like to
parallelize a quasi-Newton method for solving unconstrained optimization
problems using LU updates and to find updating schemes for the Hessian where the
Hessian is split into multiple blocks.
