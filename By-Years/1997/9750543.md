A GC-MS is being used for the enhancement of all organic laboratory instruction,
both lower and upper division courses as well as the organic chemistry lab for
non-majors. Specific experiments are proposed for each laboratory class that
will afford the students the opportunity to become familiar with both the
instrumentation and the data analysis. *
