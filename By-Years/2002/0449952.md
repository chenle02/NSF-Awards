In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Yoshitaka Ishii of the University of Illinois at
Chicago will develop solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods to
study paramagnetic-metal organic complexes and peptide nano-assemblies. The
ultimate goal of these experiments is to develop useful tools for elucidating
the structures, both atomic-level and supramolecular, of these types of
ubiquitous materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Ishii will incorporate modern
NMR methods, including multidimensional, biomolecular, and advanced solid-state
methods and into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum. In addition, Prof.
Ishii will launch an international cooperative exchange program involving
undergraduate students from his university with partner institutions in
Japan.&lt;br/&gt;
