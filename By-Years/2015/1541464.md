The CC*DNI project expands Boise State University's research network by
establishing two Science DMZs connected to the Idaho Regional Optical Network
(IRON). The Science DMZs are located on the edge of the University network and
at the Idaho Computing Consortium site, hosted at the Idaho National Laboratory
Supercomputing Center. Utilizing Software Defined Networks (SDN), OpenFlow
Switches and an OpenFlow Controller, Boise State enables IRON to switch data
traffic at a high throughput rate between researchers at the University and the
High Performance Computing (HPC) equipment at the National Laboratory. This
enhanced regional research network provides a fast, extremely secure and dynamic
network environment for the larger data sets our researchers are analyzing with
parallel computing using University, National Science Foundation and Department
of Energy assets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing the monitoring software
perfSONAR framework throughout the regional optical network allows constant
monitoring of throughput, performance and latency issues. Improving the control,
speed and ease of transferring large data sets is imperative to advancing Boise
State research as the scope and volume of data increases and as the University
increasingly relies on distributed and national Cyberinfrastructure assets. The
SDN switches and controller allow high transport speed across the regional
optical network that is normally slower due to the latency of routed traffic.
Reliable high speed data traffic is the infrastructure that researchers expect
as they expand large scale data intensive scientific research. This project
enhances the high performance computing throughout the Idaho research community,
the Rocky Mountain Advanced Computer Consortium and XSEDE.
