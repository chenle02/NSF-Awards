Results from present studies of boundary scavenging in the Pacific ocean
suggest that as much as 70% of dissolved particle-reactive chemical species,
like 10Be, may be removed from the ocean in margin environments. This
prediction, however, is based on only a few studies of margin environments in
the eastern Pacific and presumes that enhanced deposition of particle-reactive
chemical species occurs in all ocean-margin environments. In a contemporary
study in the western North Atlantic no evidence has been found for enhanced
deposition of the radioactive tracers that are commonly used to evaluate
boundary scavenging. A better understanding of the factors that lead to very
different removal efficiencies at different margins is required before the
ocean-wide transport and fate of particle-reactive chemical species can be
modeled and protected. This research will test two hypotheses to explain the
absence of boundary scavenging off the east coast of the U.S., one of which is
related to the presence of strong western boundary currents off the east coast,
and the other related to export of fine-grained particulate manganese. A multi-
pronged approach to test these hypotheses will be employed. Specific tasks
include; 1) tests for boundary scavenging of 10Be in the Middle Atlantic Bight,
2) an examination of samples of fine-grained particulate matter collected by
large volume in situ filtration to assess the enrichment of radiotracer
concentrations in Mn-rich particulate phases being transported away from the
margin, and 3) a study of boundary scavenging at an eastern North Atlantic
margin to complement recent studies off the east and west coasts of the U.S.
