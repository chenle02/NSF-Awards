This project will address approximation properties of C*-algebras and their
connection to noncommutative dynamics, group theory, and operator spaces.
Perron-Frobenius operators are a natural and useful way to study the time-
evolution of densities. The principal investigator will study the dynamics of
classical Perron-Frobenius operators as well as noncommutative Perron-Frobenius
operators, with a special focus on topological entropy. In another direction, he
will investigate how the completely bounded approximation property behaves with
respect to reduced free products, focusing on the analogies with free products
and weak amenability for groups. Finally, the project will study how the local
linear structure (from an operator space point-of-view) of a C*-algebra controls
the algebraic, topological, and representation theoretic properties of a
C*-algebra.

Approximation theory is an extremely useful concept in mathematics. The basic
idea is as follows: take an infinite (and therefore difficult for the human mind
to comprehend) mathematical object that one seeks to understand; then
approximate this object by similar, yet finite (and therefore theoretically
easier for the human mind to comprehend) mathematical objects; finally, fit all
of these approximations together to compose a clear understanding of the
infinite mathematical object. The mathematical objects in this proposal bear the
technical name C*-algebras. They were first studied in the context of quantum
mechanics but have since realized numerous connections to nearly all areas of
mathematics, for example, to dynamical systems and to group theory. This project
aims to treat three seemingly separate areas of mathematics (dynamical systems,
group theory, and operator spaces) with the same tool of approximation theory,
all in the context of C*-algebras.
