This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to produce
a new, high-resolution x-ray detector for fluorescence measurements of lighter
elements. For x-rays generally near 30 keV and below, there exist several
tradeoffs between today's choices of lithium drifted silicon (Si/Li)) detectors
and high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. Si/Li) detectors offer simple
spectral decomposition but have limited active volumes. Conversely, HPGe
detectors can offer larger sizes, but pulse height analysis is complicated by
short x-ray penetration and overlapping escape peaks. The technical goal is to
develop a detector from high purity silicon, with a contact structure that
allows for increasing detection volumes without high capacitance -antithetical
to high-count rates. The work will entail device design and computational
modeling, developing new electrical contact fabrications on high purity silicon,
manufacturing numerous test detectors and evaluation under various conditions,
including temperature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this technology could
be how the detectors will be utilized and the basic science learned through the
fabrication process. These detectors are used in many applications for the
identification of completely diverse samples. Just a few examples include
materials science, surface science, environmental analysis, industrial process
and quality control, forensic sciences and archaeology, and geological and
extraterrestrial exploration. In virtually any of these applications, a new
detector providing greater counting efficiency yields more productive and
definitive results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
