Dr. John Sutherland has proposed the organization of a workshop meeting to
discuss important new research opportunities and initiatives in coastal marine
ecology. Participation will include both long-standing leaders in benthic
ecology, as well as some of the creative young scientists who are shaping the
future of the discipline. This area of research is changing rapidly with the
collaboration of scientists from various disciplinary backgrounds, all leading
to much increased understanding of how living organisms interact with one
another and their physical setting to determine the structure, functioning,
development, and diversity of natural communities in the coastal regions of our
nation and world. Many of these collaborative investigations are beginning to
provide basic scientific knowledge that can be useful in the development of
marine biotechnologies, for example, studies on how plant chemical defense
compounds (natural herbicides) act to deter herbivores. Dr. Sutherland is a
leading figure in coastal marine ecology. He has been a productive research
scientist with funding from the Biological Oceanography Program. The Program
recommends support for the proposed workshop at $10,000.
