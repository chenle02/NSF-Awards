9305017 Kumar The nonlinear Kerdock and Preparata codes have been something of
an enigma in coding theory since they are both Hamming distance invariant and
have weight enumerators that are dual under the MacWilliams transform just as if
they were dual linear codes. Recent research by the author and other researchers
has provided an explanation for this phenomenon, namely that the two nonlinear
binary codes are projections under the Gray mapping of two quaternary codes that
are linear and which are in fact, duals! The connection with quaternary codes
has brought up a whole host of interesting questions relating to linear
quaternary codes, linear and nonlinear binary codes, sequences and lattices. In
the research project, such questions are being investigated. It is expected that
the research will have both practical and theoretical benefits. ***
