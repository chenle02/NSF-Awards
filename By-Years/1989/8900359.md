This award provides funds to initiate a summer undergraduate research experience
for 8 students in physiological ecology at Alma College and is intended to
provide "practicum" in scientific research. The goal is to better prepare
undergraduate students for graduate programs by enabling students to bridge the
gap from student to practitioner of science. Special attention will be given to
searching and reading literature, framing testable hypotheses, devising
experimental protocols, developing technique and expertise with instrumentation,
analyzing data, and writing a paper. Weekly meetings to discuss progress and
problems and monthly seminars (by students and visiting scientists) will
underscore the notion of communication among scientists. Students will work on
individual projects with faculty mentors. The three proposed projects include:
desert adaptations, body temperature regulation, biophysics, and histology of
desert reptiles; plant disease and epidemiology involving "ash-yellows", a
bacterial disease of significant ecological and economic importance; and
symbiotic relations between a wood-boring beetle and a fungus living in infested
maple saplings. Each project has laboratory and field components and each
project will invite a prominent researcher to present a seminar and consult with
students.
