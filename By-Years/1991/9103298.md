Coalition building as an appropriate measure of party organization is the focus
of this study. Aspects include examining how prospective gubernatorial
candidates form coalitions in order to win their party's nomination. This
involves the people they ask to join their campaign for the nomination, the
resources these people have, the strategies they use to win and the results.
This research will help reveal the circumstances under which parties are unified
or divisive in the performance of this function, and the type of organization
which is associated with unity or division. Collegial interaction at the
Institute for Governmental Studies will aid in the analysis of the data and the
conclusions which arise from them. The major objective of this research is to
discover the role of the political party in the nominating process. The project
furthers VPW program objectives to provide opportunities for women to advance
their careers in science or engineering through research, and to encourage other
women to pursue careers in these areas through the investigators' enhanced
visibility as role models on the host campuses. In this project, the proposed
activities which contribute to the second objective include: leading a seminar
on comparative state politics which engages students, faculty and guests in a
systematic examination of a problem (the capability of state parties to recruit
and nominate candidates for public office); teaching a course in political
science; and interacting with other visiting scholars at the Institute of
Governmental Studies.
