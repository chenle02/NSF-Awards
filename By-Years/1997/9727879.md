DMS 9727879 International Conference on Spectral and High Order Methods, 1998
ICOSAHOM98 will be the fourth International Conference On Spectral And High
Order Methods. The first three meetings were held in Como, Italy in June 1989,
Montpellier France in June 1992 and Houston Texas in June 1995. With a frequency
of three years ICOSAHOM has played the role of an international focal point in
the field of spectral and high order methods and the conference and its
proceedings have proven to be essential to researchers active in developing new
algorithms as well as those that implement high order methods to solve realistic
problems of interest to scientists and engineers. The objective of the
conference is to bring together researchers with interest in the theoretical,
applied and computational aspects of high order and spectral methods. Subjects
include, but are not limited to, spectral methods, high-order finite difference
and finite element methods, h-p finite element methods and wavelet based methods
for the solution of partial differential equations. Applications include
electromagnetics, fluid and structural dynamics problems, efficient solvers and
preconditioners for high order methods and parallel aspects of spectral and high
order methods. It is anticipated that the participants will include physicists,
mathematicians, scientists and engineers from many other areas involving and
utilizing spectral and high order methods.
