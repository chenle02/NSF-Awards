In this project funded by the Advanced Materials Program of the Chemistry
Division and the Solid State Chemistry program of the Division of Materials
Research, Hollingsworth will design organic solids with specified structure,
reactivity, and physical properties. The energetics of organic functional group
interactions in the solid state will be developed by studying guest species in
channel inclusion compounds. The interaction energies obtained will be useful in
materials chemistry for facilitating supramolecular design and synthesis of new
organic materials. The ultimate goal is to synthesize organic molecular crystals
with the same degree of stereocontrol that is now commonly achieved in single
molecule organic synthesis. %%% This research program represents a rational and
holistic approach to understanding intermolecular forces in organic solids and
is expected to greatly facilitate the design and development of new organic
materials. Among the likely applications of this proposed research is the
fabrication of devices with nonlinear optical properties useful in laser-based
systems, such as communications.
