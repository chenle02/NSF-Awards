A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these
institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging,
rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that
may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the
traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project
aligns directly with that goal, allowing the institution's faculty and
administrators to design and develop a comprehensive plan for improving and
expanding STEM instruction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keweenaw Bay Ojibway College
(KOBCC) serves the L'Anse Indian Reservation in Michigan. The project leaders
will conduct a cohesive set of activities that will inform the design of a lower
division STEM instructional program, grounded in Anishinaabe culture and a
renovated instructional space. The project will entail the key activities of:
design the STEM curricula; infuse culture into instruction and identify needed
IT resources; specify the physical renovations necessary to craft required
instructional space; and consult with peers at similarly situated TCUs. At the
end of the planning period, KBOCC should have a concrete plan upon which to
develop a STEM instructional capacity-building proposal to implement a model
associate degree STEM curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
