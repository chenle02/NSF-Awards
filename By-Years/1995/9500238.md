9500238 Wise The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose to study the role of
protein folding chaperones in the secretion of foreign proteins from yeast.
There is evidence in the literature that protein folding in the lumen of the
endoplasmic reticulum may be the rate-limiting step in the overall process of
secretion, and that chaperones such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and
KAR2 (the yeast homolog of mammalian heavy chain binding protein) play a key
role in intracellular protein folding. The PIs plan to vary intracellular levels
of PDI and KAR2 by use of regulated promoters, and to determine the resulting
effects on foreign protein secretion. The PIs also plan to isolate novel
chaperones by screening recombinant DNA libraries for genes whose overexpression
enhances foreign protein secretion or complements a genetically induced defect
in protein translocation into the secretory pathway. ***
