Dr. Shaik Jeelani has served at Tuskegee University (TU)for more than 36 years
as Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Associate Dean and Interim Dean of
Engineering and Architecture, and Vice President for Research and Sponsored
Programs. He spearheaded the development of TU's first Ph.D. program in
Materials Science and Engineering, which was launched in 1998. He recruited,
mentored and graduated 19 Ph.D. students through this program within a short
period, contributing to TU becoming the largest producer of African American
Ph.D.s in Materials Science and Engineering. Tuskegee University is also well
known for its innovative K-12 programs, all designed and implemented by Dr.
Jeelani. He has won numerous awards including the United Negro College Professor
of the Year Award, the 1996 Outstanding Contribution for Mentoring Award by the
National Association of Minority Engineering Program Administrators, and the
2001 Global Messenger Award for mentoring K-12 students and teachers. The
Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in Engineering (SECME) established an
award in Dr. Jeelani's name, entitled "The Shaik Jeelani Selfless Service
Award," which is presented each year to a SECME constituent who goes beyond the
call of duty in providing effective mentoring for students.
