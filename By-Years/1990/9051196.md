This project involves the acquisition of a laser beam machine tool to expand the
capability of the existing welding and manufacturing process facility. The
machine tool's laser is a coherent beam of light that can be focused to a high
energy density spot for the welding, cutting, drilling, heat-treatment or
marking of engineering materials. Although applied mostly to metals, the laser
beam can also be used to machine non-metals such as plastics or composite
materials. These versatile machine tools are being routinely used by industry to
reduce costs and improve the quality of manufactured products that require
welding, cutting, drilling, surface treatment, or marking and will be similarly
used in this laboratory. The award is being matched with a greater amount (103%)
by the principal investigator's institution. //
