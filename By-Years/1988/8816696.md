Understanding of how signals and other combinations of waves propagate through
irregular media depends on our knowledge of the interaction of the waves with
the medium. The direct or local interaction is well understood, but the
cumulative effect upon a long propagation path is more complicated. For many
purposes of signal evaluation it suffices to calculate the arrived signal only.
To do so, the signal energy scattered in other directions is mostly neglected.
In this work, the effect of the neglected energy is taken into account, as are
-in particular- the ramifications for backscatter and signal attenuation. Signal
attenuation cannot be properly accounted for without these corrections,
backscatter in principle can obscure reflections from a desired target far into
the propagation medium, and source strength can be severely underestimated when
cumulative backscatter is ignored. The method of this work is based upon a
recasting of the wave equation into two coupled equations for Forwards and
Backwards waves, and upon useful approximations for decoupling the resulting
equations for stochastic moments (averages of powers of the signal strength)
from each other. Fundamental new results include calculations of the backscatter
losses and provision of a basis for older, heuristic two- flux scattering
models.
