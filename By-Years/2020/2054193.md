This grant will use tiny force sensors to measure the forces that exist during
the earliest stages of tissue formation and for the maturation stages that
follow. The push and pull of cells on each other are a critical part of
biological development and tissue formation. This is particularly true for the
growth of muscles, bones, and connective tissues in our bodies. Cells are
stimulated by these local forces, responding in ways that help create the
complex structures needed for more mature tissues to function properly. Direct
measurement of cellular-scale forces is difficult, particularly in cell-dense,
3D samples. The information gained from this work will fill a knowledge gap in
developmental biology and tissue regeneration. The research team will include a
diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, in addition to local
public school teachers, who will be central to our outreach efforts in
communicating the importance of interdisciplinary research to high school
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish our goals, two objectives have been
established. First, we will determine how the physical characteristics of our
cellular-scale force probes influence measurements in a model system of tissue
formation. This includes the size, stiffness, and chemical coating of the
probes. Second, we will investigate how local mechanical forces change over time
as cartilage-like and tendon/ligament-like neotissues form and mature. These
studies will provide completely new insight on the relevance of forces in cell-
dense biological structures, benefiting fields as diverse as developmental
biology and tissue engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
