Dr. R. P. Sinha of Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina will carry
out the necessary planning activities to develop a high quality formal proposal
for submission to the regular Teacher Enhancement competition. The project will
address in-service need of area teachers in the earth sciences. In the final
project 25 teachers will participate. Planning activities include meeting with
various coordinating units to develop the detailed outline of the project,
travel to and meeting with teachers who are representative of the target
audience (especially minority teachers), meeting with Local Education Agency
science supervisors and administrators, meeting with representatives of
geological agencies such as U.S. Geological Survey, and documenting all aspects
of the formal proposal. This planning work will be done during the summer of
1989 and into the 1989-90 academic year. A comparison of this planning proposal
and its reviews with the resulting formal proposal and its reviews will provide
data regarding the validity of the assumption that "planning grants to
institutions which are poorly represented (Historical Black Colleges and
Universities) in the regular Teacher Enhancement competition and awards will
result in high quality formal proposals which can compete successfully." There
is no cost sharing.
