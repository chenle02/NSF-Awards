The undergraduate seismic laboratories will be improved with the addition of two
model shaker stations. This will give architectural engineering students first
hand experience in the use of modern seismic testing equipment to verify the
fundamental concepts of structural behavior. The two shaker stations will be
equipped with Acoustic Power Systems Electro-seis horizontal shakers, VIPAC
vibration testing workstations for test control, data acquisition and processing
and a Hewlett Packard spectrum analyzer and plotter. The stations will allow
senior architectural engineering students to experimentally investigate not only
fundamental dynamic properties and response of small-scale building structures
but also the relationship between structural stiffness and corresponding natural
frequencies.
