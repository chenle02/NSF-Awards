9407341 Smith This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural
anthropology student from the University of California-Davis. The student will
do a case study of one Native American community museum, study a conference of
museum professionals, study the dominant national institution (the Smithsonian
Institution), and conduct a survey of Native American museums, in order to study
how Native Americans defend their own definition of "ethnicity" and culture
against national influences. The questions to be asked have to do with whether
Native American museums can play dynamic roles in relation to living culture of
Native American communities, or whether they treat their culture as historic
relics not relevant to contemporary life. This research is important because the
tension between local minority cultures and the national majority culture is a
fact of life relevant to all nation states. Increased understanding of how local
cultures defend their own interests and maintain their cultural distinctiveness
while at the same time interacting with national political institutions will
help planners design programs which can productively satisfy both local and
national cultural and political concerns.
