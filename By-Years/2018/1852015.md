This REU site award to the University of Texas at Austin, located in Austin, TX,
supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of
2019-2021. This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership
with the NSF REU program and the Division of Chemistry. Participants engage in
research projects encompassing materials chemistry. Participants are mentored in
research groups that discover, design, develop and characterize new biomaterials
and energy materials. This program emphasizes laboratory safety, development of
scientific communication skills, and inclusivity. Participants are exposed to
career opportunities and broader applications of materials chemistry via an
interdisciplinary seminar series, with speakers from industry and academia. The
principles of lab safety are showcased by training participants to be Student
Safety Officers, engagement in a peer-to-peer lab safety assessment program, and
creation of safety videos. The overarching theme of inclusivity aims to develop
a strong sense of community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants' research
projects include development of new biomaterials by combining self-assembly,
templating and nanotechnology; design and development of energy materials such
as photovoltaic, energy storing, or catalytic materials; and development of new
spectroscopic and microscopy strategies for materials analysis. This program
targets underrepresented minorities and rising sophomore students in chemistry
and chemical engineering. By targeting early career students, this program's
intensive training instills a passion for discovery that accelerates success in
college and retention of students in science and engineering
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
