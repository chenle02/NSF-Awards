In this collaborative project, the PI's will use spectroscopy and photometry to
measure the abundances of Li and other elements for hundreds of stars in seven
open clusters, in order to constrain models of interior stellar structure. The
collaborative component of the project will bring together photometry and
spectroscopy expertise so that the investigators can address the mystery of
anomalous Li abundances, which may indicate that additional, as yet unknown,
physical mechanisms act in stars. Both PI?s have institutional access to
appropriate observatories (WIYN and Mt. Laguna). The work will have broader
impacts to Galactic evolution and cosmology, and the PI?s will train
undergraduate and graduate students in research at two universities.
