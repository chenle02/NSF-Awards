ABSTRACT This grant will provide opportunities for five undergraduate students
per year for two years to participate in meaningful ways in six different
research projects being undertaken by faculty members of the University of Texas
at El Paso. The projects are ones which have been selected to be particularly
suitable for students of Hispanic descent. Minority students, including
Hispanics, are severely underrepresented in the scientific community in the
U.S., and in the graduate education in science which is the preparatory source
of that community. The premise underlying this effort is that significant
participation in scientific research at the undergraduate level will lead larger
numbers of such students to consider research careers as potential options for
them.
