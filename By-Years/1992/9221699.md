The validity of fluid equations as approximation to kinetic equations depends on
whether there is a sufficiently accurate closure of the hierarchy of velocity
moments of the kinetic equations. We propose to use satellite measurements of
particle distribution functions to look for closure relations in the
magnetosheath and magnetopause, thereby providing observational evidence for
deciding when a fluid plasma model is appropriate for those regions. Those
regions are of particular interest because it is known that they are highly
turbulent, more turbulent than the solar wind, and it is by no means clear that
a turbulent plasma will obey a closed set of fluid equations. Moreover,
turbulence in the magnetosheath is a topic of great interest in the space
community and it is largely not understood. The plasma there may exhibit several
differing turbulent states and it is very important to find out which of these,
if any at all, can be described as a fluid.
