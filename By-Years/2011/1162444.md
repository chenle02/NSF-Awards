More and more applications in entertainment, commerce, and government need to
process continuous streams of data, and handle ever increasing data volumes at
that. For instance, Netflix video streams account for almost 30% of internet
traffic during peak hours in North America. High-frequency trading systems
already execute over 50% of all trades in the United Sates. And New York City is
networking 3,000 video cameras and an unspecified number of license plate
readers and radiological detectors to prevent terrorist attacks. But building
and running such streaming applications with existing software tools is hard;
they only support some applications or do not meet performance requirements.
This research is developing reusable software artifacts that make it possible to
more easily build and run high-performance streaming applications in general.
Thereby, it is directly addressing critical data processing needs of our
society.

More technically, this research is exploring how to componentize monolithic
streaming systems by decoupling streaming languages, in which applications are
written; streaming optimizations, which maximize performance and scalability;
and streaming runtimes, which manage the low-level aspects of application
execution. (1) The investigator is developing an intermediate language for
stream processing that serves as the glue for composing language, optimization,
and runtime components with each other. (2) The investigator is exploring how to
refactor language front-ends and optimizations and then building a library of
reusable front-end and optimization components. (3) The investigator is
designing a common runtime API and then developing implementations for both
multi-processors and clusters, thereby enabling the seamless scaling of
streaming systems. If successful, the three research thrusts result in a stream
processing platform that simplifies the development of state-of-the-art
streaming applications while also facilitating future innovation in stream
processing.
