The University of Rhode Island will host the Summer Undergraduate Research
Fellowships in Oceanography (SURFO) program at the Graduate School of
Oceanography (GSO)in Narragansett, RI for 10 weeks each summer. SURFO will
engage 12 undergraduates in a cutting-edge, authentic oceanographic research and
educational experience primarily focused on quantitative aspects of oceanography
(e.g., physical oceanography, geophysical fluid dynamics, marine geophysics,
population genetics and biodiversity, biogeochemical cycling, and quantitative
ecology). Each student works with a research advisor and a graduate student to
develop/conduct a hands-on research project in an area of oceanography
appropriate to each student's background and interests. The program recruits
undergraduates with a strong background in mathematics, physics, biology,
chemistry, computer science, or engineering. The intended outcome is to develop
interest in ocean science research, and prepare students for careers and/or
graduate studies in the field. Students also benefit from a SURFO-tailored
seminar series and workshops chosen to help them better integrate into research
environments, critically analyze and develop science knowledge, safely maneuver
in the laboratory and field, improve their writing and oral communication
skills, and nurture ethical behavior.
