Nitrate reductase (NR) is the enzyme that reduces soil nitrate to nitrite, a key
step in the utilization of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer by plants. This
proposal is aimed at elucidating the structure and mechanism of action of NR,
which has been purified to homogeneity using affinity chromatography and
monoclonal antibody columns. The NR gene from squash has been cloned. Efforts
will be made to express this gene in a suitable host so that NR can be obtained
in quantity for crystallization studies. The enzyme will be subjected to limited
proteolysis and the fragments sequenced in order to identify the active sites.
The results will enhance our understanding of how NR works, and may eventually
enable plants to utilize nitrogen fertilizer more efficiently.
