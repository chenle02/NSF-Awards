This project involves research in the area of computability theory, both
classical computability theory on the set of integers, and applications to other
fields of mathematics, in particular algebra and logic. The focus is on
questions of decidability of the first-order theory of structures; the
characterization of finite substructures; the existence of nontrivial
automorphisms versus definable properties; and the classification of undecidable
problems in algebra. Computability theory predates the existence of modern
computers, starting with the ground-breaking work of Goedel in the 1930's. It
investigates the theoretical bounds of computation (neglecting restrictions on
memory space and run time), thus providing the theoretical framework for many
applications in computer science. Classical computability theory focuses on the
integers (thought of as coding natural problems from many areas of mathematics)
and tries to classify sets of integers by their complexity. Applied
computability theory tries to apply these methods to natural problems in many
areas of mathematics and computer science.
