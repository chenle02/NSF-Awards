An award is made to The University of Texas at El Paso to acquire a Fluorescence
Activated Cell Sorter (FACS), a shared instrument to facilitate education and
research in the region. The FACS instrument will support a diverse range of
research and teaching applications across multiple disciplines in the natural
sciences. The FACS instrument will be used to identify, isolate and purify
multiple cell types and cell components. These FACS-purified samples will
further the research programs of at least 23 faculty that seek to understand
plant and animal development, microbial infectivity, environmental microbial
metabolism as well as the mechanisms behind immune and cancer cell function and
development, mechanisms of disease progression, ecological communities, and
subcellular components ultimately benefiting our region and the public in
general.

This instrument will provide access to state-of-the-art FACS instrumentation to
the next generation of scientists through incorporation into science curriculum
and new course development. Experiments using FACS will be employed in
undergraduate teaching laboratories, bringing this advanced technology to ~400
students annually in the fields of cell biology, microbiology and molecular
genetics. FACS techniques will also be introduced to graduate students for
incorporation into their research projects. Placement of the FACS instrument in
the Cytometry, Screening and Imaging Core Facility will facilitate management of
use by multiple faculty and students. Cell sorting capabilities will facilitate
recruitment, cancer development retention, collaboration, and training of both
students and research faculty in the STEM disciplines and introduce this
sophisticated technology to the region.
