9402131 Stroud Theoretical and computational studies will be done in two areas
of materials research. The first area involves studies of two types of weakly
coupled superconducting systems: (i) Josephson arrays and (ii) layered
superconductors. The bulk of the Josephson array work will involve their dynamic
properties by solving the coupled Josephson equations for overdamped and
underdamped arrays. In layered superconductors studies will be made of flux
lattice melting in highly anisotropic superconductors. The second area of
research will be "classical" nonlinear properties of granular materials, in
particular, nonlinear optical properties. %%% Research will be done on the
properties of granular materials. In particular, work will be done on granular
superconductors and on granular optical materials. Both classes of materials
have unusual properties which need to be understood on a fundamental level and
which could have important technological applications. ***
