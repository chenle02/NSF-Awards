Geanakoplos Zuck This research is funded under the Special Initiative on
Coordination Theory and Collaboration Technology. This is one of eleven winners
under that competition. How to make decisions in the face of uncertainty is a
core problem in many computer science and economic modelling problems. However,
there are a number of weaknesses in the traditional approaches to modelling
knowledge. Among them are assumption that there are perfect reasoners and that
inferences can be based on arbitrarily deep levels of knowledge. This research
on coordination theory is to develop a new notion of practical knowledge upon
which to base coordinated decision making. Practical knowledge will take account
of several factors which limit a reasoner's deductive ability such as
computational resources available to the reasoner, imperfections in the
reasoner's ability to carry out correct deductions, and faultiness and
incompleteness in the data available to the reasoner. Many of these factors have
been studied previously in isolation. This research extends and unifies such
work in order to come up with a comprehensive theory of sound reasoning in a
practical multi-agent environment.
