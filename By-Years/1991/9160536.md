The ability to produce high performance electronic devices by metalorganic
chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is critically dependent on reagent purity and
deposition chemistry. MOCVD based metallization processes are also strongly
affected by reagent cost. The ideal aluminum MOCVD reagent would meet the
demands of high purity and chemical compatibility required for electronic film
growth yet be economically attractive for metallization applications.
Alane:trimethylamine (AlH3:N(CH3)3) is a promising aluminum reagent both for
MOCVD of aluminum gallium arsenide films and metallization. Widespread adoption
of this reagent has been hindered by concerns about purity and cost.
Alane:trimethylamine is currently purified by sublimation, a time-consuming
process difficult to scale up. In Phase I, alane:trimethylamine will be purified
using supercritical fluid (SCF) extraction/recrystallization. A high pressure
synthesis of alane:trimethylamine in the same SCF medium used for extraction
will also be performed to demonstrate feasibility of combining high pressure
synthesis with SCF extraction. In Phase II, production scale methodology will be
developed and this novel combination of techniques will be profilerated to a
broad range of semiconductor grade reagents. Supercritical fluid technology may
provide a means of coupling the synthesis and purification of
alane:trimethylamine in one process. This process could supply higher purity,
lower cost, alane:trimethylamine for the electronics industry.
