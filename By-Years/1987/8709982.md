Most current theories of hunger predict that glucose should be satiating. None
would predict that glucose or other simple sugars could act as hunger or
appetite stimulants, yet the hunger- and appetite-producing effects of simple
sugars have been demonstrated experimentally. For example, Dr. Geiselman has
shown that, when glucose was slowly infused into the duodenum, rabbits decreased
their subsequent food intake, as would be expected. However, when glucose was
rapidly infused into the duodenum, the rabbits nearly doubled their food intake.
Dr. Geiselman's research is attempting to determine why glucose sometimes is
satiating and at other times acts to produce hunger. She will carry out
experiments designed to determine the hormonal and metabolic mechanisms that
produce satiety in response to slow infusions of glucose into the duodenum and
hunger in response to fast infusions of glucose into the duodenum. Dr.
Geiselman's research will provide insight into the basic physiological
mechanisms that control food intake and, more specifically, that relate sugar
intake to hunger motivation. Dr. Geiselman hypothesizes: (1) that glucose is
satiating when it is followed by a moderate rise in insulin level that is
insufficient to produce hypoglycemia, (2) that glucose stimulates further hunger
when it is followed by a great elevation in insulin level that is sufficient to
produce hypoglycemia, and (3) that the hunger-stimulating effect of glucose
occurs when glucose is readily converted to fat.
