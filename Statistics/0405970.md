ABSTRACT PI: Jonathan Taylor proposal: 0405970

The focus of this proposal is the study hitting probabilities for smooth vector-
valued random fields with independent, identically distributed Gaussian
processes as components. These models can be used to build a variety of non-
Gaussian real-valued processes, though they are closely related to Gaussian
processes. The smoothness of the processes allows many tools from point
processes to be used in studying these hitting probabilities. These point
processes, based on critical points of the process yield an explicit
representation for the hitting probability as well as an accurate approximation,
the so-called expected Euler characteristic approximation. The proposal seeks to
extend recent work of the investigator and collaborators on real-valued Gaussian
processes to these non-Gaussian models. Insight gained from these models should
prove useful in studying other non-Gaussian models.

The practical motivation for this proposal is in its application to estimating
the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) in neuroimaging activation studies. This FWER
is important in determining which areas in a neuroimaging study are associated
with a given experimental task. In these studies, psychologists are able to
collect space-time recordings of activation in the human brain (more precisely,
they can record something associated with activation known as the BOLD signal).
They are then able to study which areas are activated by their task, which might
be a visual task, an auditory task, etc. Having collected the data, the
psychologists are faced with the task of determining which perceived activations
are true activations. The results of this proposal help psychologists in this
decision, by allowing the psychologists to only accept results with a
prespecified FWER. The proposal builds on earlier results in the literature, and
extends them to more complicated models of activation.
