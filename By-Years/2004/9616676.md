Thistle and Eckman Despite its conceptual importance, predation as an
organizing force in deep-sea communities is essentially unstudied. Although a
variety of species are known to be predators in the deep sea, the large, motile
epifauna are the focus of this study because they should be important predators
and some species appear to be susceptible to experimental manipulations with
cages. The research consists of two parts. The present proposal requests support
to investigate cage performance in the deep sea. With the knowledge gained, we
will propose a follow-up investigation of predator effects by conducting
experiments sufficiency free of cage. The results of these investigations should
be widely applicable because large, motile epifauna occur in most deep-sea
communities.
