Design and analysis of integrated systems (microprocessors, SoCs, ASICs,
memories, MEMS, etc.) is increasingly difficult due to the extreme variations
that exist both in the fabrication process and the operating environment. As a
result, it is no longer viable to simply perform worst-case analysis during
design. Instead, the distribution of designs resulting from these variations
must be efficiently and accurately modeled. Compounding this need is the
increasing scale of integration. With larger on-chip memories, growing use of
diverse computing and communication blocks, and increasing heterogeneity, it is
imperative that these systems be well characterized and "statistically" designed
up to and even beyond "six sigma". &lt;br/&gt;The Center for Silicon System
Implementation (CSSI) at Carnegie Mellon is focused on all aspects of
statistical design and analysis that spans from system-level architectures to
analog/digital circuits, to the physics and modeling of the complexities found
in semiconductor manufacturing. Using the shared compute infrastructure acquired
with support from the NSF Computing Research Infrastructure (CRI) program, CSSI
is developing various statistical design and analysis methodologies that enable
continued use of scaled-CMOS technology. CSSI faculty lead over 70 different
research projects in various areas related to integrated system design and
manufacturing, and instruct over 20 different graduate/senior-level courses that
cover these same areas. The ability to develop and validate new methodologies
for statistical design, and train the next-generation of integrated systems
researchers and practitioners is being significantly enhanced by the computer
infrastructure acquired through support of the NSF CRI program.
