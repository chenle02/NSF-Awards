In 2018, as part of NSF’s 10 Big Ideas, a workshop (also known as an Ideas lab)
on ‘Building a Synthetic Cell’ was held to identify projects at the frontiers of
science and engineering that would use synthetic approaches to build cells from
first principals. Seven such projects were identified and funded and the meeting
funded through this proposal will serve to bring the successful groups together
to discuss their progress in the year since funding began. Pursuing the goal of
building living cells from inanimate chemistry provides significant
opportunities to advance US bio-manufacturing in biotechnology, biomedicine and
materials research as well as providing a unique educational and training
opportunity for students and post-docs involved in the
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will provide a forum for US
scientists and bio-engineers to outline their most recent work on creating cells
comprised of molecules with opposite chirality, building artificial neurons and
constructing cells without lipids among other cutting edge synthetic biology
projects. The meeting will allow time for the exchange of research ideas between
scientific groups and networking opportunities for both junior and senior
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
