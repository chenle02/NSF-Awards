The research objective of this award is to investigate fundamental relationships
between force transmission in neurons and the neuronal cytoskeleton, an
interconnected filamentous structural network that plays a key role in
determining neuronal morphology and stability. In particular, the role of
tensile loading (stretch) on the regional deformation of the cytoskeleton will
be investigated. The study will involve a multidisciplinary approach,
integrating cell biomechanics, high-resolution imaging, and image processing.
Key outcomes include the definition of spatial and temporal distributions of
tension within unstretched and stretched axons, the characterization of spatial
and temporal changes in cytoskeletal mobility and stability in response to
tension, and the elaboration of a role for cytoskeletal filaments and
crosslinking molecular motor proteins in guiding cytoskeletal
remodeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this work will have significant
implications for understanding structure-function relationships in the
developing and mature peripheral nervous system, including potential biological
and chemical signaling pathways triggered by local deformation. In the long-
term, this work holds the potential to provide a mechanistic basis for the
progression of neurological conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, or
enhancing nerve repair. It is also expected that general principles identified
from work in neurons will facilitate the understanding of cytoskeletal
plasticity in non-neuronal cells. The educational and outreach plans focus on
the integration of research results into two bioengineering courses based on
cell physiology, as well as providing multidisciplinary research training
opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from backgrounds in both
engineering and biological sciences. Additionally, a summer outreach program
will expose middle and high school students from backgrounds underrepresented in
science and engineering to career options in bioengineering, introduce them to
research methodology and scientific writing, and provide them with access to
state-of-the-art laboratory facilities.
