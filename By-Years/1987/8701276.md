Economic theory, whether we like it or not, affects the way individuals,
businesses, local and state governments, and nations behave. Improvement in
economic knowledge will help to ameliorate human welfare and help to control and
reliably predict the economic consequences of economic, political and social
changes. Given the increasing importance of economics, it becomes increasingly
necessary as well that we should more closely examine the philosophical
foundations of economics, that is, such issues as testability, progress,
unrealistic assumptions, ideal models and the nature of rationality. In 1976,
Dr. Rosenberg published what has been called a "watershed" study of these
issues. In the ensuing 10 years, Dr. Rosenberg has immersed himself in these
issues and has in fact led the criticism of several of the views originally
defended in that study. Under this grant, Dr. Rosenberg will further study the
ballooning literature in the philosophical foundations of economics and
developments in economic theory itself in order to synthesize his own work and
to assess and incorporate the important contributions of others to this subject.
The resulting study on the nature of economic theory will examine alternate
approaches to the philosophy of economics, especially the rhetorical approach,
examine what the nature of progress is in economics, the function of economic
theory, the meaning and uses of the explanatory variables "expectation" and
"preference," economic theory as applied mathematics, neoclassical "dissidents"
and their assumptions, and adaptationalism in economics. These studies promise
to be most provocative and of great interest to economics and philosophy of
science alike.
