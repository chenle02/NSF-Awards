Abstract of the project: Research on Wave Equations and Scattering Theory on
Manifolds

In the first part of this project, the investigator will seek an improvement of
the currently known lower bounds for the counting function of resonance for
arbitrary second order self-adjoint perturbations of the Laplacian in Euclidean
space. The second part consists of studying scattering theory in asymptotically
hyperbolic manifolds. Establishing upper, and possibly lower, bounds for the
counting function of resonance in these spaces, and also giving a dynamical
definition of the scattering matrix in terms of the radiation fields. The latter
part is also expected to be possible in the asymptotically Euclidean case. The
third part consists of studying problems of recovering information about an
asymptotically hyperbolic, or asymptotically Euclidean, manifold, and its
Riemannian structure, from the scattering matrix. It is expected that the
dynamical definition of the scattering matrix will also play an important role
in this part.

This project concerns the investigation of how waves propagate in a medium, and
reciprocally, what type of information about a medium can be extracted from a
certain knowledge on the propagation of waves in it. For example, how a certain
perturbation of a known medium, like an obstacle in space, affects the
propagation of waves, and, vice-versa, determine properties of the obstacle from
information obtained from waves reflected by it. It also concerns the study of
the wave equation on spaces that are geometrically different from the usual
Euclidean space, e.g., spaces that resemble the hyperbolic space at infinity.
