Formal methods are becoming more widely used to ensure correctness, safety, and
security of the hardware and software systems we rely on in our daily lives.
Many modern verification tools depend on reasoning engines that can
automatically and effectively reason about system properties at the level of
machine arithmetic. These reasoning engines, called satisfiability modulo
theories (SMT) solvers, can prove that the property is always true, or provide a
counter-example if this is not the case. Most SMT solvers do not reason directly
at the word-level but, instead, compile the problem into its bit-level Boolean
representation (bit-blasting) and then delegate it to a satisfiability (SAT)
solver. The scalability of this approach is limited and, moreover, the
compilation to SAT eliminates the high-level structure of the initial problem,
which makes obtaining concise and useful reasoning artifacts very difficult.
These artifacts are crucial for scalability of modern verification methods, and
the lack of support for obtaining them hinders progress in bit-precise
verification.

Based on recent advances in model-based reasoning this project develops novel
decision procedures for the theory of bit-vectors that are effective in
practice, take advantage of word-level reasoning, and provide native word-level
support for interpolation and generalization. The new procedures are orthogonal
to existing techniques, and explores these key novel ideas: (1) model-based
reasoning that does not rely on bit-blasting; (2) support for interpolation that
does not rely on proof generation; and (3) support for generalization that does
not rely on quantifier elimination.
