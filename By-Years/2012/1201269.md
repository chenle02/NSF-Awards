Embeddings of discrete metric spaces into Banach spaces is by now a well-
established tool in Theoretical Computer Science and Topology. In Theoretical
Computer Science embeddings are used to construct, sometimes the best known,
approximation algorithms. In Topology embeddings are used to prove special cases
of the Novikov conjecture and the Baum-Connes conjecture. Nevertheless, some of
the important problems on embeddings remain open. The main purpose of the
project is to achieve progress on problems of the following types. Determine to
what extent presence of expander-like structures is the only obstruction to
coarse embeddings of spaces with bounded geometry into a Hilbert space.
Determine to what extent expanders and graphs with large girth resist
nontrivially good embeddings. Determine to what extent the Hilbert space is the
most difficult space to embed into. Find characterizations of well-known classes
of Banach spaces in terms of embeddings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis of large
sets of data is important in many contexts. Usually data is endowed with a
natural distance (degree of dissimilarity) of its elements. One of the useful
approaches to analysis of such sets of data is to use some low-distortion
embeddings of the set into a space whose structure is well-known, for example
into a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. After that one can use many
algorithms available in computational geometry and many tools from such
classical parts of mathematics as Calculus. In some cases one can even visualize
the structure of the set, for example, see its clusters. Unfortunately the
existence of a low-distortion embedding into a plane is rather rare in
applications. In many contexts much weaker (than low-distortion) types of
embeddings are still useful, and even embeddings into high-dimensional or
infinite-dimensional generalizations of the three-dimensional space lead to
important results. Constructions and analysis of such embeddings is the main
goal of the proposal.
