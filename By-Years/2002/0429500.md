Control-Flow Processors&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An
architecture is presented that unifies fine-grain control-flow and data-flow
dependences in the context of contemporary superscalar processors, preserving
highly streamlined mechanisms of superscalar processors while endowing them with
dataflow properties. Future independent instructions are fetched, executed, and
locally finalized, their results propagated and corresponding resources freed,
and their cumulative effects sustained regardless of prior unresolved branch
mispredictions. Branch mispredictions no longer serialize execution, leaving
exceptions and finite resources as the only remaining serializing constraints in
the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the domain of high-performance
microprocessors (which power supercomputers, personal computers, laptops, and
even cell phones), there remain a few dogged bottlenecks that fundamentally
constrain performance, making it difficult to translate the potential of
additional transistors into effective performance gains. The project's broader
significance is an approach that aims to overcome one of the remaining grand-
challenge problems in scaling microprocessor performance.&lt;br/&gt;
