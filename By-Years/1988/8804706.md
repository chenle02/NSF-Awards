The goal of this award is to develop the tools which will allow a systematic
exploration of the amino acid residues in the purine nucleotide binding sites of
proteins. Such sites will be affinity labeled using reagents which contain
alkylating groups capable of reacting covalently with the protein. The purine
nucleotide moiety will thus provide the specifity for chemical modification of
the proteins within the binding sites. The effects of these reagents will be
examined on three proteins, pyruvate kinase, a membrane-bound ADP receptor
protein from human platelets and cAMP phosphodiesterase. The results of the
research should enhance our understanding of the structure and architecture of
the active sites of proteins, and how these biomacromolecules catalyze or
regulate the myriad reactions that occur in living systems.
