This award supports the research of Peter Haskell (joint with Jeffrey Fox of
the University of Colorado) on equivariant KK-theory. Equivariant K-theory and
the K-theory of crossed product algebras have played an important role in the
solution of geometric and topological problems associated with group actions and
with fundamental groups of manifolds. Examples of such problems include many
cases of the Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture on the existence of metrics with
positive scalar curvature and many cases of the Novikov conjecture on the
homotopy invariance of higher signatures. Kasparov's representation ring
KK(G)(C,C) and its distinguished idempotent have played a fundamental role in
this program. This research will apply the Kasparov representation theory with
the intention for contributing to the geometric understanding of the K-theory of
crossed product C(*)-algebras. This work in 'modern analysis' blends
sophisticated research in algebra, geometry, and analysis to examine the
underlying theory of manifolds or surfaces. This analysis is by way of the
action of the transformation groups of a space on a surface or geometric object
in that space.
