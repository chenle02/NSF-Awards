Chemistry (12) This project aims to introduce mass spectrometry (MS) into all
levels of the undergraduate chemistry and biochemistry curriculum at Arizona
State University. A major objective of the project is to use MS as a means for
developing "molecular thinking" in students. Acquisition of Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption
Ionization - Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometers are enabling students
to perform experiments using mass spectrometry in course-related laboratory work
and independent student research. A number of experiments, with increasing
complexity, are being adapted from the current scientific literature for
instructional purposes at various levels of the curriculum including general
chemistry, organic chemistry, instrumental analysis and biochemistry. Assessment
of the outcomes of the project is being accomplished through a variety of
methods including ongoing evaluation of students, TAs and faculty, as well as
exit interviews and tests designed to measure how well the methods help students
learn key mass spectrometry and chemistry concepts.&lt;br/&gt;
