CBET 1438052/1437275&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use theory,
numerical simulation, and experiments to study the motion that is induced by
instabilities in stratified liquid systems. For example, when fresh water from a
river enters the ocean, concentration gradients of sediment and salt form
simultaneously. Under certain conditions that can be predicted theoretically,
the presence of these gradients leads to an unstable situation that induces
convective motion of the sediment-laden water. Preliminary results show that
this motion strongly affects the settling velocity and transport of the
sediment. This project will develop a framework for analyzing motions induced by
such instabilities in a variety of situations pertaining to river estuaries.
However, the framework will be more broadly applicable to problems in
environmental, geophysical, astrophysical, and engineering
flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This collaborative project will use theoretical,
computational, and experimental tools to explore the linear and nonlinear
dynamics of double diffusive sedimentation under a wide range of conditions.
Linear stability theory, direct numerical simulation, and laboratory experiments
will be conducted for four basic configurations: a) a layer of sediment-laden
fresh water above saline water; b) a layer of sediment-laden fresh water below
saline water; c) linear concentration gradients with sediment being unstably
stratified; d) linear concentration gradients with sediment being stably
stratified. Effects of shear flow in the water, which is appropriate for river
estuaries, will be included. The research will address a range of interesting
phenomena observed in these systems including fingering instabilities,
horizontal intrusions, and staircases formed in particulate systems. The
proposed research will identify dominant instability mechanisms in various
parameter regimes, and will provide quantitative scaling laws for double
diffusive sedimentation in each case.
