Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the upgrade of our Varian continuous
wave 60 MHz NMR spectrometer to an efficient multinuclear FT-NMR spectrometer
equipped with 2-D capabilities using technology developed by Anasazi Inc., we
are incorporating modern NMR techniques across our chemistry laboratory
curriculum at Florida Institute of Technology. We introduce routine Proton and
Carbon-13 analyses into lower division labs, reinforcing identification
techniques taught in the lecture. More sophisticated experiments such as 2D and
multinuclear analyses, kinetics and equilibrium studies of reactions, Quantum
Mechanics applied to NMR analysis, and Dynamic NMR Spectroscopy are being
adapted into upper division labs. Most of the experiments are taken form the
chemical education literature such as the J. Chem. Educ. We anticipate the
progressive integration of the experiments into our curriculum to continue. We
are also using this instrument in ongoing undergraduate research projects.
Students independently run samples using the upgraded FT-NMR instrument without
any operational difficulties and the hardware/software operation is durable and
reliable enough that requires only moderate supervision during student usage. We
are involving the Science Education Department at Florida Tech in the evaluation
of the project and plan to present the results of this project at regional and
national professional meetings. In addition, we will submit articles describing
any new NMR experiment and/or resulting curriculum improvement to the Journal of
Chem. Educ. or the web-based The Chemical Educator for publication. &lt;br/&gt;
