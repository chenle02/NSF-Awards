This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposes to develop a
miniature remote tracking system with the capability to provide position
location, data collection, and a data link that relays biological sensor
information from migratory wildlife, such as ducks, geese, big horn sheep, and
moose to wildlife researchers. This project will incorporate newly developed
Radio Frequency products intended for the PCN frequency bands as well as a
digital data recorder and a position location system. The objective of this
project is to define the data link requirements and to design the system
hardware and software, including a miniature, light weight, battery powered data
recorder, Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, RF transceiver, base station
transceiver, and a base station computer. Current wildlife data collection
methods are labor intensive and yield incomplete information. The animals are
observed for many hours continuously or are tracked using radio beacons. A
remote tracking system would increase the types and completeness of biological
information recorded, and allow many more animals to be studied. With the
proposed wildlife tracking system, the researcher need only be located in the
vicinity of the studied animals to download a week month, or year's worth of
data into the base station computer, without having to observe or disturb the
animals. Phase I consists of the system engineering required to: define
interfaces and protocols, perform a RF link analysis for the remote system,
select candidate hardware for both ends of the remote link and the data logger,
generate a prime power budget, define software requirements, and estimate total
system performance.
