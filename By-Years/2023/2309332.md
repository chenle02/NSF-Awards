Current gravitational-wave searches for signals from merging black holes and
neutron stars have been extraordinarily successful, allowing us to probe new
astrophysics and test strong-field gravity. However, these searches have not yet
begun to access the full, rich discovery space of gravitational-wave signals. In
particular, if binary black holes have large, misaligned spins and asymmetric
masses, then the binaryâ€™s orbit will precess. The resulting gravitational waves
can have significant amplitude and phase modulations, causing the signals to be
missed entirely by current searches. However, measurement of these modulations
would allow us to disentangle various binary parameters, enabling more accurate
probes of fundamental physics in the strong-gravity regime than are possible
with current detections. This award supports the development of tools needed to
search for and potentially detect this important class of precessing signals.
Additionally, this work will provide data-analysis skill training for
undergraduates participating in this research with the PI, particularly through
the ACCOMPLISH program at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth which seeks
to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high achieving undergraduates.

The work supported by this award will access the interesting class of precessing
binary black holes using a two-pronged approach. The PI and a PhD student will
design and perform a gravitational-wave search for moderately-precessing binary
systems using a two-harmonic approximation to the precessing waveform, enabling
the exploitation of the well-behaved morphology of the separate harmonics.
Additionally, the group will design and perform a gravitational-wave search for
highly-precessing binary systems using a generalization of the matched-filter
statistic over a constrained region of parameter space. These searches will be
deployed over archival gravitational-wave data, potentially making a detection
of a precessing gravitational-wave signal or setting meaningful upper limits on
the rates of mergers of such systems. The development work enabled by this award
will inform future directions for more complex searches in general, particularly
as we move to the third generation of gravitational-wave detectors.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
