9400873 Gross Professor Gross will study elliptic threefolds and Calabi-Yau
threefolds. In particular he will study deformation classes of Calabi-Yau
threefolds with a view to obtaining classification theorems. He also intends to
further study the recently discovered phenomenon of mirror symmetry. This is
research in the field of algebraic geometry, yet it directly connects to two of
the great advances in theoretical physics in this century--quantum mechanics and
general relativity. Algebraic geometry itself is one of the oldest parts of
modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes
use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics,
theoretical computer science, and robotics.
