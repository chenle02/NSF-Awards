The goal of this project is to support teacher retention and renewal through
professional development institutes for two cohorts of rural teachers over 42
months. The first cadre will consist of 56 teachers, 28 from North Carolina and
28 from Illinois, constituting 7 teams in each state. The second cadre will
consist of 104 middle and high school mathematics and science teachers from
North Carolina and Illinois, 52 from each of the two states. Thus there are 13
teams from North Carolina and 13 teams from Illinois in each cadre. The
following workshops and institutes will be conducted: Summer Institutes
2002-2005; Fall Workshops, 2004-2005; and Spring Workshops, 2003-2006.

The project addresses four interrelated elements for the revitalization of rural
communities: 1) building and sustaining a community of master teachers who
support novice teachers through mentoring programs; 2) providing resources and
training to develop teachers' use of visualization technologies and content
expertise to create pedagogically sound conceptual models for student learning;
3) enhancing standards-based curricula through the use of visualization
technologies to encourage student engagement; and 4) developing a sustainable
and scalable model that continues to assist teachers to become effective leaders
and agents of change.
