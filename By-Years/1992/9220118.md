This award provides one-half the funding necessary for the acquisition of a
triaxial testing device to be installed and operated in the Department of Earth,
Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. MIT is committed to providing the remaining funds needed.
Understanding the physical properties of fluid-saturated rocks at high pressures
and temperatures (such as acoustic wave velocity, permeability to fluids,
electrical resistivity, and mechanical strength) will be made possible with the
new generation testing device.
