This two year fellowship for postdoctoral study will allow Dr. Widner the
opportunity to obtain training in cognitive psychology at the University of
Texas at Austin. Dr. Widner's research interests have centered around the
processes underlying memory retention. He now wishes to refocus his interests to
identifying the processes responsible for retrieval failures. During his
postdoctoral tenure he will (1) study the processes and types of information
incorporated into memory assessments and memory predictions; and (2) develop
techniques that will result in more accurate memory assessments and predictions.
Research findings reveal that the ability to assess the contents of our memories
and to predict our memory performance is relatively poor. Inaccurate memory
assessments can have serious consequences in decision-making behavior, learning,
and reading performance. It is important that the mechanisms underlying such
inadequate performance be identified and techniques developed to increase the
accuracy of such processes.
