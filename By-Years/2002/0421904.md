Observations indicate that the western Arctic halocline is ventilated from
(replenished by) waters that originate on the shelf. This ventilation process is
of fundamental importance to the physical, biological, and chemical systems in
the Arctic Ocean. Little is known about where this ventilation takes place in
the western Arctic, what controls its magnitude, how it occurs, or how it might
vary in a changing climate. Funds are provided to better understand this
ventilation process in the southern Canada Basin using a regional, high
resolution ocean-ice model. The model calculations will allow for a detailed
examination of the boundary - interior exchange, relate the onshore flux to
specific dynamical processes and regions of the Chukchi and southern Beaufort
Seas, and provide a basis for testing of theoretical constraints on this
exchange. The model design, evaluation, and analysis will be closely coupled to
the data being collected as part of the western Arctic Shelf-Basin Interactions
program. This will provide a valuable test of the model fields, as well as
motivate the model analysis to address aspects of the ventilation process that
cannot be resolved with the data alone.
