This work, funded by a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, explores a new
statistical tool called the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST). This algorithm is
capable of identifying filamentary structures as well as sheet-like structures
and cell walls in astronomical positional data. It will be used as a tool to
quantify galaxy distributions in sky catalogs and red-shift surveys, as well as
models and simulations of the clustering process. The Principle Investigator has
pioneered in the application of this technique to astronomical distributions. If
successful, this research will open new avenues toward identifying, quantifying,
and constraining the physics of galaxy clustering.
