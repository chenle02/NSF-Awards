Funds are provided for NYI award to Emily Klein of Duke University whose
research projects range from global correlation of ocean- ridge basalt chemistry
with crustal thickness and bathymetry, identification of mantle convection cell
boundaries (e.g., Australian-Antarctic Discordance) using isotopes to chile
ridge subduction and its bearing on melt focussing problem at MORs. Her research
projects are all n general geared toward a unifying theme of understanding
mantle melting processes and the creation of the oceanic lithosphere. Klein has
received several awards and serves on the editorial board of a journal. She has
been teaching both basic and advanced Undergraduate and Graduate courses in
Geology and Geochemistry at Duke University for the past three years. Klein has
also received a Lilly Foundation award to develop a new advanced level
undergraduate course in Geology. Klein has several collaborative projects and
intends to develop analytical techniques for routine analysis of Pb in basaltic
rocks.
