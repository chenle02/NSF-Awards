This award supports a cooperative research project between Professor Theodore
R. Tauchert, Department of Engineering Mechanics, University of Kentucky, and
Professors V. E. Verijenko and S. Adali, Department of Mechanical Engineering,
University of Natal, Durban, South Africa. The investigators will study the
development and application of an improved and generalized `higher-order` theory
for the structural analysis of laminated plates and shells, one that accounts
for nonlinear material characteristics, thermal and piezoelectric behaviors, and
large deformations and dynamic effects. The anticipated results will help ensure
the safe operation of modern laminated structures, including `smart` structural
systems of the future. The research project is the result of a planning visit
undertaken by the PI in 1995. Costs for the South African portion of the
research are being borne by the South Africa Foundation for Research
Development. The PI plans to take a graduate student or postdoctoral fellow with
him to South Africa. During the course of the project, eight graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows from South Africa will participate in the research.
