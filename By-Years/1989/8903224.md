In this project, the investigator is conducting research on the survivability of
the human immunodeficiency virus, Type 1 (HIV-1) in domestic wastewater and
environmental waters into which untreated and treated domestic wastes can be
placed. In this research, the investigator plans to conduct laboratory work
involving the incubation of domestic wastes and environmental waters that have
been contaminated with HIV-1 isolates to determine the survival characteristics
of this virus when subjected to this environmental stress. The viability of
recovered virus will be determined by co- cultivation with treated normal human
lymphocytes using antigen capture and reverse-transcriptase assays as viral
growth determinants. This proposal was submitted under conditions outlined in
NSF 87-90, Expedited Awards for Novel Research. Results of this exploratory
project are expected to provide the basis for any further research that is
warranted on determination of the nature of the potential impact of the HIV-1
virus on environmental resources and to provide insights into the impact of the
results on environmental engineering design of processes and control systems to
deal with this potential environmental contaminant.
