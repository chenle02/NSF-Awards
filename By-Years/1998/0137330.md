0137330 Alleman Wastewater nitrification is considered to be a highly sensitive
biological process given the metabolic nature of the involved bacteria (e.g.,
low growth rate, etc.) and correspondingly low cell population. Furthermore, the
daily loss of these nitrifiers within a reactor's necessary waste sludge stream
creates a pragmatic limitation on the permissible amount of nitrifiers that can
be maintained. This proposed research focuses on an innovative means to
beneficially increase the population of nitrifiers beyond that of conventional
systems by selectively detaching and recovering these valuable nitrifiers from
the waste sludge such that they can then be recycled back into use. As compared
to heterotrophic cells whose chemical-based attachment (via an adhesive
exocellular polymer) and flocculation behavior does not afford this flexibility,
we believe that attached nitrifying cells can be prompted to detach and
deflocculate within a suitably motivating environment. The underlying mechanism
would subsequently be that of a controlled chemical, physical, and/or electrical
effect which induces attached nitrifying cells contained within the waste sludge
to detach and deflocculate, at which point these discrete nitrifiers can then be
separated from the remaining waste sludge for subsequent reuse. As such, this
capability would then facilitate a means of controlling (and beneficially
raising) the nitrifier solids retention time (SRT) in a fashion that is
independent from that of the remaining mixed-culture SRT. ***
