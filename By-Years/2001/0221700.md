This is a three year project to continue the investigations of emissions in the
terrestrial atmosphere using data obtained with the 10-m W. H. Keck telescope on
Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Much of the data to be used have already been collected and
have been used in a co-added form to provide dramatic advances in the
spectroscopy of the MLT region. However, some aspects of these data have not yet
been tapped, and much new information is potentially available from 50-min data
sets on oxygen, nitrogen and sodium emissions. The Physical Sciences Division at
SRI International makes a substantial contribution to developing human resources
over a range of educational levels, from undergraduate to postdoctoral training.
The Molecular Physics Laboratory has been particularly active in the NSF REU
(Research Experience for Undergraduates) Program.
