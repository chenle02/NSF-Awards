Wesleyan University is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
The program will support at least 7 students for the summer of 1987, of which
almost half will be recruited from other institutions. Research activities will
include the following: o Theoretical Physical Chemistry and Biochemistry o Far
Infrared Spectroscopy, Analytical and Enviromental Chemistry o Organic
Electrochemistry and Computer Applications o Synthesis of Natural Products
