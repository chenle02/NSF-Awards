This award will partially support the participation of approximately 20
participants in the 2019 Theory Winter School at the National High Magnetic
Field Laboratory in Tallahassee Florida, which will take place from January 7th
to January 11th. Preference will be given to supporting graduate students,
postdoc, and junior faculty participants. The winter school will feature
lectures from leading scientists, and will address current challenges in
theoretical and experimental condensed matter physics, discussing new ideas and
future research directions, and will enable networking and future collaborations
among the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
