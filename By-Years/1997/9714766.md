9714766 Moody This is an equipment grant to the University of Virginia's
Department of Environmental Sciences, an interdisciplinary program concerned
with the interaction of processes that shape the natural environment, offers
undergraduate and graduate curriculum with four core components: atmospheric
science, ecology, geology and hydrology. The computational and atmospheric data
ingest capacities will be upgraded and the department's facility for atmospheric
data acquisition and display for use in environmental research projects will be
enhanced. The facility will also contribute to classroom instruction in addition
to research applications and hands-on laboratory activities using real-time
meteorological data. While many universities already provide a distribution of
real-time and archived weather information and forecasts via the internet, the
goal is not to duplicate these kinds of community service efforts to make
processed data available. Rather, the goal is to make real-time and archived
weather information and data display tools available to this interdisciplinary
community of researchers who are focused on a wide range of issues in which
knowledge of atmospheric conditions, past, present and future often plays a
role.
