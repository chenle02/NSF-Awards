The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovak research project between Dr.
Thomas Jech of the Pennsylvania State University and Dr. Bohuslav Balcar of the
Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences' Mathematical Institute is to examine
mathematical problems in set theory and Boolean algebras. Specifically the
questions examined will deal with measures and ultrafilters on Boolean algebras,
filters over uncountable cardinals, and properties of singular cardinals. Large
cardinals, forcing, and dynamical systems will also be studied. The researchers
expect to use their complementary expertise to extend measure theory as related
to combinatorial properties of cardinals. This project in mathematics fulfills
the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents
and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
