This project will focus on three complementary issues in the study of galaxy
formation in the universe through nonlinear gravitational collapse. First, the
Lagrangian fluid method based on the velocity gradient and gravity gradient
tensors will be used to analytically study the nonlinear evolution of density
perturbations in several models including the effects of shears and tides during
the collapse. Second, N-body simulation codes will be used to test the
approximation schemes used in the analytical studies and to extend the above
analytical Langrangian fluid method to more realistic systems. Third, the
theoretical understandings gained concerning gravitational collapse including
the effects of shears and tides will be combined with current observational data
to constrain or exclude competing models of dark matter in the universe.
Interactive activities include: teaching a graduate special topics course in
astrophysics; guest lecturing on aspects of particle astrophysics in
introductory and advanced physics courses at the undergraduate level; hosting
regular lunches to promote informal interaction and develop a sense of community
among women faculty and women physics major; and meeting informally with a
campus group interested in space exploration.
