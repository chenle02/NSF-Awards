This project examines the use of titanium-aluminum carbides as a possible
reinforcement in titanium- and nickel-matrix composites. The process of
producing limited amounts of the fibers was demonstrated previously in a Phase I
project. The fiber is a titanium/aluminum carbide, Ti3AlC, formed from plasma-
assisted chemical vapor deposition (PACVD) onto a graphite fiber tow. In the
Phase II program the PACVD process is optimized using a laboratory scale
continuous system to produce Ti3AlC multifilament tows and Ti3AlC deposits on
substrates other than graphite. Attention is directed towards matching
coefficient of thermal expansions of the fiber and matrix. The properties of the
fiber and its performance in metal composites is examined. High strength, stable
fibers are important for reinforcing metal matrix composites. Application of the
fibers under development here could include composites for structural and engine
components in aerospace systems and energy conversion devices.
