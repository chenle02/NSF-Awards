9455998 Douglas A consortium of colleges and universities on Long Island in
conjunction with the State University of New York seeks funds to plan a
comprehensive proposal for the new NSF EHR initiative, Mathematical Sciences and
Their Application Throughout the Curriculum. The State University of New York at
Stony Brook is the lead member in this consortium which includes public and
private, 2-year, 4-year and doctoral institutions. The proposal's goals are to:
(i) change the culture among quantitative departments to produce cooperation and
improved instruction in mathematical aspects of their curriculum; and (ii)
create new courses and curricular materials that integrate mathematical sciences
instruction with topics from mathematically based disciplines. The change will
start in Long Island institutions, then move to SUNY-wide implementation (64
institutions), and then be disseminated to other institutions inside and outside
New York. The City University of New York will also be involved. The SUNY
Central Administration has committed $20,000 for a workshop at Stony Brook in
fall 1994 to lay the groundwork for this initiative in SUNY. SUNY is developing
plans to sustain and institutionalize this initiative within SUNY after the end
of NSF funding.
