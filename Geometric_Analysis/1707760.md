This award is to support U.S. participants in the International Collaborative
Research Group Conference on Geometric Analysis, to be held at the Pacific
Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS), University of British Columbia,
Canada from July 24 to July 28, 2017. Generally speaking, geometric analysis
involves using analytic methods to solve problems in differential geometry and
general relativity. This workshop will bring together mathematicians, including
top experts in the field, to communicate recent progress and to promote
interaction and collaboration among the participants. In particular, the goals
of the conference are to disseminate new advances in geometric analysis, to
contribute to the training of graduate students, and to bring a large group of
mathematicians to exchange and to incubate new mathematical ideas. To realize
these goals, junior researchers (including postdoctoral fellows and graduate
students) and researchers from various under-represented groups are especially
encouraged to apply and will be given priority for financial support from the
organizing committee.

The workshop will bring leading experts from all over the world to present the
new results and/or surveys of current progresses in geometric analysis, in
particular, from the following subfields: (1) Analysis of geometric PDE
including curvature flows (e.g., power of Gauss curvature flow, Ricci flow,
gradient Ricci solitons, and manifolds with lower Ricci curvature bound); (2)
Kahler-Einstein metrics and the Kahler-Ricci flow (e.g., singular Kahler
metrics, the Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Kahler manifolds, the regularity and
weak solutions of Kahler-Ricci flow, and Kahler-Ricci solitons); (3) Minimal
submanifolds and mean curvature flow (e.g., special Lagrangian submanifolds in
mirror symmetry, min-max theory from the proof of Willmore conjecture, and the
formation of singularities of mean curvature flow); and (4) Mathematical general
relativity (e.g., space-like hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature, the
center of mass, and the nonlinear gluing approach). Since 2010 PIMS Workshop on
Geometric Analysis, there are many exciting new results and new techniques in
these fields, and the conference will have about 25 speakers discussing these
advances. The abstract of talks and videos from the workshop will be posted on
the conference webpage http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/170724-ccga
