Observations of cloud droplets and raindrops indicate that the drop
concentration, regarded as a random variable, may have a probability
distribution that deviates from the Poisson distribution, which would be
expected if the drops had equal probability of being located anywhere and were
independent of each other. Drops therefore are said to have a tendency to
cluster. At any given time, some regions of space may have greater
concentrations than expected for a Poisson distribution and other regions less.
The deviations may be characterized quantitatively by the pair-correlation
function, which in turn is related to the spatial autocorrelation function of
drop concentration. Building on the theory of correlated stochastic processes,
this project has three objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Advance the
understanding of the fine-scale structure of clouds and rain by analyzing data
from cloud probes and disdrometers; assess the implications for droplet growth
by collisions and coalescence.&lt;br/&gt;2. Determine whether clustering can
give rise to a coherent scattering component in radar signals from clouds and
precipitation; devise methods to recognize this component.&lt;br/&gt;3. Study
the effects of clustering on radiative transfer; in particular, determine
whether clustering can explain deviations from the Beer-Lambert law of
extinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work contributes to the foundations of
cloud physics by providing a more complete description of the random variability
of drop populations. It may lead to improved understanding of rain formation by
coalescence of cloud droplets and to a refinement of methods of cloud remote
sensing.
