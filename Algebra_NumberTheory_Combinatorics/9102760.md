This award supports the research of Professor M. Wachs to work in
combinatorics. She intends to study problems in enumerative and algebraic
combinatorics. She will focus on the study of generating functions for certain
statistics on combinatorial configurations which include permutations, words and
labeled partially ordered sets. The research is in the general area of
combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how
discrete collections of objects can be organized. It is extremely important to
modern communications, for example the design of large networks as in telephone
systems. It is also fundamental for the design of new algorithms in computer
science.
