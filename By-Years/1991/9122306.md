This project has two parts. The first deals with innovation, the second with
human capital accumulation of a conventional sort. Growth in the most advanced
economies is fueled by the development of new products and processes, and growth
in the developing world by successful adoption of existing technologies. The
first part of the research is a more systematic examination of the factors that
determine the aggregate level of innovative activity in each setting. Chief
among these are the degree of substitutability among products and the nature of
competition in the product market. A key question is under what circumstances a
less developed economy will tend to catch up to a more advanced one. During the
1980's real wages in the U.S. rose for professional workers and stagnated or
fell for other groups. The second part of the research is directed toward
explaining the dynamics of the relative wages of skilled and unskilled labor as
an economy develops. Trade between economies with different mixes of skilled and
unskilled labor, and the incentives for skilled and unskilled labor to migrate
from less to more developed economies will also be examined.
