9526262 Morse The proposed research will clarify the melting behavior and early
crystallization history of the Kiglapait layered intrusion with specific
interest in the existence of troctolitic liquids, the thermal evolution of the
Kiglapait magma, the depth and nature of the magma source, the liquid line of
decent, plagioclase/liquid fractionation, and olivine/liquid fractionation.
Chilled marginal rocks from the intrusion will be melted and crystallized in
graphite and Au-Pd capsules at pressure to find the liquid compositions in
equilibrium with the saturating phases and to determine the mineral/liquid
element partitioning. Upper Border Zone rocks will also be studied to evaluate
the liquid line of descent toward augite saturation. Compositional mapping of
experimental charges will be done using electron and proton microprobes. The
result will also be relevant to more general aspects of quantitative igneous
petrology and the origin of Proterozoic anorthositic rocks.
