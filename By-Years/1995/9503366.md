Comparisons and Applications of Local and Global Search This is first year
finding for a three year continuing grant. Scientists and engineers seeking
practical ways to solve difficult combinatorial optimization problems are
increasingly turning to local search and genetic algorithms. In addition, the
past five years has seen a dramatic increase in researchers proposing new
variants on these techniques, especially genetic algorithms. Recent work on
genetic algorithms has strongly suggested the best algorithms interweave local
search and genetic search techniques. This research has four main objectives: 1)
produce a suite of local search methods and stochastic hill-climbing algorithms
to test the difficulty of optimization problems, 2) produce a new test suite of
complex problems which are resistant to local search and stochastic hill-
climbing, 3) produce new hybridized genetic algorithms that can be sued to
produce state-of-the-art results for applications in computer vision and
geophysics, 4) conduct comparative studies of the major genetic algorithm search
paradigms, including hybrids which utilize local search. In pursuit of this
fourth objective, it will be necessary to compare different genetic algorithms,
local search algorithms, and hybrids on both the controlled test suite of
problems as well as large problems of practical importance.
