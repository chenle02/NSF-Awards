The goal of BEST (Bering Sea Ecosystem Study), a large NSF-supported research
effort, is to identify and quantify mechanistic links between climate and the
ecosystem response. An ecosystem responds to changes in climate forcing by
altering the abundance, biomass and species composition of its constituent
populations. Without information on lower trophic level populations forming the
base of the food web, it is impossible to determine the state of the system,
estimate the direction or magnitude of change, if any, to validate or refute
hypotheses or to adequately validate or parameterize lower trophic level models.
In order to contribute to the assessment of the state and variability of the
species composition, abundance and biomass of the populations forming the
ecosystem of the Eastern Bering Sea Shelf during BEST and to estimate population
trends, funds are provided to collect and process approximately 260 zooplankton
samples from the eastern Bering Sea during each of two cruises per year and to
analyze the resultant data.
