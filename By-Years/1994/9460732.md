This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop advanced
vaccine technology for aquaculture to increase production efficiency.
Aquaculture is the fastest growing agricultural industry in the USA and is a
$29.4 billion industry world-wide. Due to the accelerating decline in global
fisheries, efforts to increase U.S. aquaculture production have recently been
intensified. In eight years, between 1984 and 1991, production of farmed fish
and shellfish has doubled to a total of 13 million metric tons. The
intensification of farming and increased densities involve substantial stress
which, as in other captive food animals, has resulted in major outbreaks of
disease and related mortalities. Conventional vaccination of fish by immersion
or injection have provided limited disease protection due to the method of
administration and the primitive immune memory of aquatic animals; the chemical
treatment of fish may pose risks to the environment and the food supply. The
objective of this Phase I proposal is to show the feasibility of a novel
polymer-based, controlled-release delivery system for fish protective antigens
(vaccines). AquaPharm will compare the level and duration of the immune response
of fish injected with conventional vaccines and a novel controlled release
vaccine during the proposal period. When administered to the fish, this polymer
system will deliver the vaccines in a sustained manner, thereby maintaining
specific and long-term immune response.
