The objective of this project is to provide support for remote sensing
activities. Project research will be directed toward developing cost effective
methods for monitoring and assessing environmental variables controlling
agriculture systems of the Nile Delta and associated areas. In addition, studies
will consider significant environmental phenomena and potential natural
resources contributing to economic development, food security, and demography of
Egypt. This award will be complemented by major support from the Government of
Egypt, which will cover all costs of hardware, software, operational expenses
and local staff salary. The project will provide the direction and management of
the update of the Remote Sensing Center (RSC) to a modern remote sensing
facility in the developing world.
