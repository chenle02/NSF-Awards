Myers: The award to the Temple University School of Medicine will renovate and
significantly improve the animal care facility for pathogen-free mice needed in
Developmental Biology research activities. The 30-year old, 5,000 square foot
conventional animal facility will be reconfigured and upgraded into a state-of-
the-art barrier facility and will support a gene transfer and targeting center
for research and research training to support embryonic stem cell work and
transgenic mice. Currently, inadequate configuration which defeats the
clean/dirty corridor system, obsolete instrumentation which affects
environmental monitoring, and corrosion of metallic surfaces impede good animal
care, good science, and the validation of research results. The modernized
facility will provide research service, research training, and an AAALAC-
accredited animal resource for transgenic, breeding colonies of mice with
compromised immune systems and for specialized research equipment to conduct
studies. The graduate research training program, which has grown dramatically
over the past several years, will be centered in this facility, and in excess of
ten faculty researchers will benefit from this renovation effort.
