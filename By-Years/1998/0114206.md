This symposium will bring together US, Icelandic, European, and Japanese
investigators who have been working in Iceland. The symposium will synthesize
the present state of knowledge regarding the Iceland plume and its mantle
structure and melting process, its crustal structure and volcanism, and its
interaction with adjacent spreading centers. It will also identify the
outstanding scientific problems that remain to be addressed and recommend future
research to solve these problems. The symposium will be supported by the
National Science Foundation, the Icelandic Research Council, and the Svartsengi
Geothermal Power Plant of Iceland. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
