Nonlinear dispersive waves form and propagate as packets of rapidly oscillating
wavetrains. Modulation equations which describe this evolution, for conservative
systems with exact solutions, were first derived, via an averaging method, by
Whitham. Lax and Levermore placed this work in an analytically well-posed
context by relating it to the zero dispersion limit of KdV. Recently, interest
in dispersive waves has been renewed by the simultaneous development of many new
ideas and methods. This grant is to enable some young researchers to attend and
participate in a NATO Advanced Research Workshop to be held in France in July,
1991. They will have the opportunity to interact with the world's leading
researchers in this area as they share their diverse approaches and chart new
directions and problems of importance in this subject.
