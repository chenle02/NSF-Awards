Abstract for GRAPH-THEORETIC APPROXIMATION ALGORITHMS (NSF
#0105548)&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ramamoorthi Ravi, Carnegie Mellon
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increasing size of communication and
information networks has motivated&lt;br/&gt;several new problems in the design
of networks with low cost and high&lt;br/&gt;resilience; Many of these problems
are known to be prohibitively expensive&lt;br/&gt;in terms of computing power to
solve to full accuracy. Yet these problem&lt;br/&gt;abstractions capture models
from a variety of application areas such as&lt;br/&gt;communication network
routing, multicasting messages in large&lt;br/&gt;networks, VLSI layout, and
transportation networks with economies of scale.&lt;br/&gt;The research in this
proposal aims to advance our fundamental knowledge of&lt;br/&gt;the structure of
good solutions to such inherently intractable computational&lt;br/&gt;problems
involving networks. The investigators will develop
approximation&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for these problems -- these are heuristic
methods that trade off&lt;br/&gt;some accuracy in the solution in return for
lowered computational resources,&lt;br/&gt;in a quantifiable way. The research
will involve the application of and new&lt;br/&gt;discovery of results in the
theory of graphs to guide the design of these&lt;br/&gt;heuristic
solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the investigators will design
polynomial-time approximation&lt;br/&gt;algorithms with improved performance
ratios for many basic graph-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;problems including the problem
of augmenting a tree to make it&lt;br/&gt;two-connected, buy-at-bulk network
design problems and the minimum $k$-cut&lt;br/&gt;problem. The investigators
will continue their ongoing study of bicriteria&lt;br/&gt;network design
problems (problems that involve two objective functions to
be&lt;br/&gt;optimized simultaneously) to design improved bicriteria
approximation&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for many spanning tree problems arising in
practice; These&lt;br/&gt;problems involve a combination of commonly studied
objectives such as the&lt;br/&gt;maximum node degree, diameter and total cost of
the tree. The research&lt;br/&gt;effort will focus on the theme of studying
natural mathematical programming&lt;br/&gt;formulations for these NP-hard
problems and attempt to derive improved&lt;br/&gt;approximation guarantees via
rounding algorithms that will also establish&lt;br/&gt;the integrality gap of
these basic formulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
