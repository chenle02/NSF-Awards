9612860 Steele Continuing support via the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
will allow U.S. ocean scientists, in the academic research community, to
participate in activities of the International Council for the Exploration of
the Sea (ICES) and the Scientific Committee for Oceanic Research (SCOR), which
are of particular interest to the ocean sciences community, to the National
Science Foundation and other Federal agencies, and to ICES as well. ICES is an
intergovernmental organization designed to coordinate scientific research,
management of fisheries, environmental concerns, and oceanographic matters of
common interest to countries bordering the North Atlantic. SCOR serves primarily
as an organization to facilitate international collaboration of ocean research
through the formation of working groups on various marine topics. Under this
award U.S. academic research scientists will participate in selected ICES and
SCOR activities in 1996-1997.
