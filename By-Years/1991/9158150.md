This project is supported through the Presidential Young Investigators Award
program. The studies conducted during the next five years will concentrate on
the development and analysis of the occurrence and duration of droughts using
stochastic differential equations to model continental water and heat balance.
The statistical distribution of drought durations for several climatic case
examples will be developed. The persistent and long-range dependence
characteristics for this model will be derived and related to climatic forcing
factors. Through the model for hydroclimatology of continental- type climates,
the importance of hydrologic land surface-atmosphere interactions in the
dynamics of drought will be illustrated. The benefits of this research will be
to better understand the stochastic perturbations and year-to-year random
variations in large scale atmospheric flow features which occasionally trigger
drought conditions that persist and impact human society and the natural
environment. With a better understanding mitigation of drought consequences
could be achieved.
