Abstract Putinar

The project is aimed at sponsoring the travel of a number of young researchers
and mathematicians belonging to under represented minorities from US to the
Fields Institute, to attend the meeting "Multivariate Operator Theory", for the
duration of a week in August 2009. Multivariate operator theory is a very
dynamic branch of modern analysis which has emerged in to a full area of
research in the last two decades with contributions from classical operator
theory, differential geometry, complex analysis of several complex variables,
Lie group representations, global analysis and local commutative algebra. Its
fundamental interdisciplinary structure makes imperative that the various groups
of experts meet regularly and exchange their latest ideas and contributions. The
conference will have a modest schedule with significant breaks to allow
collaboration, discussion of new problems and informal interaction. The young
participants will have a unique opportunity to have an overview of the field of
multivariate operator theory, to grasp its present challenges and meet experts
in contingent areas of mathematics.

The impact of the meeting beyond operator theory, to areas of differential
geometry, complex analytic geometry, function theory, index theory and group
representations will be significant. The well established existing links between
these fields (for instance via K-theory, or via topological cohomology) offer a
solid framework for sustaining the interdisciplinary component of the meeting.
