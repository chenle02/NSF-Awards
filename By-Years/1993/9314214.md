9314214 Sagues This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research workshop in
connection with the 1st Mexican Symposium/ 2nd International Workshop on
Corrosion. Organized by Professor Alberto Sagues of the University of South
Florida and Professor Luis Maldonado Lopez of the Centro de Investigacion y de
Estudios Avanzados del IPN (CINVESTAV-Merida), the workshop aims to present and
discuss the most recent advances in corrosion science and engineering,
including, for example, advances in cathodic protection, coatings, and
electrochemical impedance. By getting together experts in high temperature
corrosion and corrosion of reinforcing steel, this workshop will address topics
of importance to both the U.S. and Mexico. Through short courses, lectures, and
personal interactions, the workshop will offer participants the opportunity to
establish new international collaborations. ***
