Effects of plant functional identity on ecosystem nitrogen retention following
fire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent warming trends and increased human activities
have led to documented increases in fire occurrence in North American boreal
forests. Forest productivity in the boreal biome is generally limited by the
availability of nitrogen (N), and increased fire frequency causes increased
opportunity for N to be lost from the ecosystem via combustion and post-fire
losses to the atmosphere and water. Understanding controls over these N losses
following fire is important for predicting the long-term consequences of
increased fire frequency for forest productivity and carbon cycling. In this
proposal, the investigators hypothesize that the functional traits of the plant
species that initially colonize burned ecosystems will control the ability of
the ecosystem to accumulate carbon and thus retain N following fire. The
researchers will test this hypothesis with a study of N loss in a boreal black
spruce forest that burned in June 1999. The research approach will entail an
ecosystem-scale addition of a stable N isotope that can be tracked, combined
with experimental manipulation of plant colonization.&lt;br/&gt;
