by a group at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute in collaboration with other
NSF, DOE and foreign supported scientists. The group will continue their studies
of inelastic electron scattering at the DESY accelerator in Hamburg, Germany.
They will also continue development and testing of new phototube high voltage
designs and other electronics for use at the Superconducting Super Collider in
Texas. ***
