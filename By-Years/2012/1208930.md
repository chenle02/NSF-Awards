This award provides funding to implement and evaluate ultrafast optics and fiber
laser frequency comb advanced laboratories at Bethel University and the College
of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona. Fiber laser frequency combs
based on a proven, cost-efficient carbon nanotube design will be built and
utilized at the University of Arizona in its graduate-level optics lab and at
Bethel University in its upper-level physics courses. Bethel is a primarily
undergraduate institution (18 graduates per year averaged over the last five
years) with a strong history of open-ended advanced lab projects. The growing
number of applications of a fiber laser frequency comb (e.g. precision length
measurement and molecular spectroscopy) will serve to enhance the creativity and
novelty of Bethel University's advanced lab context. The ultrafast laser and
fiber laser frequency comb labs will educate and train graduate and
undergraduate students in laser science, linear and non-linear optics,
engineering and ultrafast measurement.
