This research is focussed on the possible function of an enzyme found in the
oligodendrocytes, the most common type of cells in the brain of vertebrates. The
function of the enzyme is not known, but there is some circumstantial evidence
that it may be important in the formation of multilamellar structure such as
myelin. The enzyme is an extremely active phosphodiesterase but it is not known
which nucleotides are cleaved by it. The binding of the native enzyme to
radioactive cyclic nucleotides will be tested, in an attempt to determine which
of these nucleotides binds specifically. In addition, the specific association
of this enzyme with some cells constituents, such as microtubules and ribosomes
will studied. Thus, these studies should provide accurate information on the
specific substrate of the enzyme as well as on its localization, and therefore
shed light on its function.
