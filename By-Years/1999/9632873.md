*** 9632873 Tubbesing This award provides funding for the fifth in a series of
joint conferences convened by the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute and
the Japan Institute of Social Safety Sciences. The workshop will be held in Los
Angeles, California on January 15-17, 1997, accelerating the traditional four
year time frame between workshops to take advantage of lessons emerging in the
aftermath of the Northridge and Kobe earthquakes. It will capitalize on
increasing research collaboration between the U.S and Japan and strengthen ties
between members of the professional communities and policy makers from the two
countries. It is expected that papers and working group records, issued as
proceedings, will have substantial utility for those interested in post disaster
recovery and reconstruction in the U.S. and Japan.***
