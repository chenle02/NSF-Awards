The researh project by Dr. Robin McCarley of Louisiana State University entitled
"Stabilized Molecular Assemblies" is supported by the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program. The goal of the research is to control the 2-dimensional
polymerization of dendrimer assemblies and then to utilize the macromolecule as
a container for specific guest molecules, which can be released through
electron-transfer chemistry. The investigator will study the macromolecule
formation as well as, the trapping and release properties of the oligomers. A
key objective is the development of selective traps with reversible release
properties. This research represents an extension of the investigator's prior
work, while also branching out into new fields of
exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to control the isolation, storage
and release of small molecules has many potential applications with potential
for societal impact. These polymerized dendrimers may have utility for the
preconcentration of specific target molecules, as nanoscopic sensors, as new
materials and for drug delivery. A thorough and fundamental study of the
chemistry and performance of these materials is significant.
