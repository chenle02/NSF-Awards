Slow granular flows where lasting contacts are common play an important role in
industries ranging from food to paper to pharmaceuticals to ceramics. Despite
the fact that the companion case of conduction in (micro-structurally static)
porous materials has been well studied, heat transfer in even the simplest slow
particle flows is poorly understood. While it is clear that the conductivity
depends strongly on the micro-structure of the bulk material, in these slow
flows, the micro-structure changes with time so that the contact duration
becomes critical and the role of particle mixing/segregation (i.e., "convective"
heat transfer) quickly comes to the fore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work uses
simple experiments and Thermal Particle Dynamics (TPD) to examine heat flow in
two prototypical slow granular flows: a simple shear cell and (to a limited
extent) a tumbler. TPD is a recently introduced computational technique that has
been shown to be capable of capturing both thermal and mechanical behavior of
particles from a Lagrangian viewpoint in static beds. In this work, we extend
this technique to slowly flowing granular beds in order to addresses the
fundamental issue of how particle-particle contacts/collisions affect both the
uniformity and magnitude of the conductance in macroscopic particulate systems.
The primary intellectual merit of the proposal lies in addressing the
fundamental issue of the competition between conduction and convection in
granular systems, as well as the industrial relevance of examining heat transfer
rates in specific devices.&lt;br/&gt;
