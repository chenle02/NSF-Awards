The purpose of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussion of current
directions in dialog research, specifically to assess the current state of the
art in the area of dialogue processing and to identify key themes and directions
that are driving research in the field. Progress in research often relies on a
common infrastructure that includes tools and corpora, evaluation techniques, as
well as some consensus on effective research paradigms. Thus one of the outcomes
of the workshop will be a set of recommendations for developing and supporting
infrastructure and encouraging sharable research paradigms and evaluation
methodologies. The motivation to hold a workshop at this time is the need to
establish the role of dialog as a core element in human-human and human-computer
communication and to identify the resources that are needed to support research
in the area.
