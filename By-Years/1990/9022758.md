This project consists of two parts. The first involves the extension of previous
research on the foundations of monetary economics. This research will formally
address the issues of how exchange takes place and which objects come to play
the role of money, or a medium of exchange. Much progress has been made towards
understanding the development of both commodity and fiat money in abstract
economic models. Further work includes the resolution of some technical issues
concerning the theoretical models and even, more importantly, the development of
simplified versions of the framework that can be used to address substantive
issues, including policy issues in monetary economics. The second part of the
study is to investigate some implications of explicitly incorporating a
household production sector in models of macroeconomic activity. Some
preliminary analysis indicates household production can have an important
qualitative and quantitative impact in an otherwise standard model of the
business cycle. Future work includes the analysis of these business cycle
implications, and the investigation of the impact of household production in
theories of unemployment, economic growth, and public finance.
