Laboratory research has contributed greatly to our understanding of
reproductive physiology and how it is regulated by external environmental
factors such as day length, nutrition, exercise and interactions with
conspecifics. However, in these studies, each variable is considered
independently and under controlled conditions. This is clearly not the case in
the natural habitat where social and ecological factors are intertwined to
influence behavior and its physiological underpinnings. To study physiology
under field conditions requires animal capture and blood-drawing which are
expensive and risky procedures that are traumatic for both biologists and
animals. To overcome this major obstacle, Dr. Gudermuth will develop and
validate the use of fecal steroid analyses to characterize gonadal function in
both domestic and wild canine species. This non-capture, non-invasive
methodology provides a means to collect and process vital information concerning
the reproductive physiology of animals living in their natural habitat which
would not have previously been possible. Moreover, this assay will have an
enormous impact on field research, wildlife conservation and management, and
practical aspects of veterinary care of dogs.
