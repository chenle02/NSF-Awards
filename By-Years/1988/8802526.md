Instability saves and transition to turbulence are to be experimentally
investigated for flows confined between rotating disks. Both conventional and
non-Newtonian fluids (through polymer addition) will be utilized to explore
unsteady flow modes and characteristics, using flow visualization techniques
(flake suspensions) and quantitative velocity measurements from LDV (Laser-
Doppler Velocimeter). The flows to be investigated are of fundamental interest
regarding centrifugal effects and curvature, and are also relevant to
lubrication and viscometers used to determine Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid
properties.
