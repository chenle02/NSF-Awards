In this project the PI will work with Trinity undergraduates to employ the
laser-induced-grating experimental technique, forced Rayleigh scattering (FRS),
for measurements of molecular-tracer diffusion coefficients within E. coli baths
to see if the diffusion coefficients on micron length scales increase with the
bacterial concentration. The PI will also show using simple Fourier concepts
that FRS can be uniquely employed to directly measure and quantify Lévy
deviations from Gaussian diffusion if the tracer molecules are indeed driven
into Lévy flights by the swimmers. This work on molecular transport at the very
small Reynolds number will help significantly in a complete comprehension of
swimmer-driven small-molecule flux over ranges of swimmer length scales and
Reynolds numbers that describe all marine organisms. The PI will also
collaborate with a Trinity microbiologist to develop an undergraduate laboratory
experiment in which students investigate the manner in which E. coli have
evolved so that they outrun molecular diffusion during chemotaxis.
