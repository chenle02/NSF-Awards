Many animals communicate with members of their own species using specific
sounds. These sounds are behaviorally relevant to the animals because they
facilitate important behaviors such as maintaining a territory or finding
offspring on return from foraging. When an animal hears one of these
behaviorally relevant sounds, it must make an appropriate response based on the
information in the sound. To do this, the auditory system must detect,
discriminate and categorize each of the sounds. The goal of the current project
is to understand the strategies and mechanisms that the auditory system utilizes
to achieve these tasks. Electrophysiological techniques will be used to
determine how individual neurons in the auditory midbrain of mice encode
behaviorally relevant sounds. Sounds emitted by mice during different behaviors
(such as establishing dominance and aggressive interactions) will be used as
stimuli to evoke responses from individual neurons. Differences in the rate and
timing of individual neural responses to different sounds will be used to
determine the strategies that the auditory midbrain uses to encode behaviorally
relevant sounds. The importance of this research is in understanding how the
brain has evolved to optimally encode behaviorally relevant sounds. This
research will increase the understanding of how sound perception helps animals
survive. A variety of training opportunities will be provided during this
project. Post-doctoral, graduate, undergraduate and high school students will be
trained in neurophysiological techniques. Students will also gain training in
quantitative techniques through active collaborations with mathematicians. This
project will engage minority students in science through research opportunities,
and research and teaching activities will be integrated in undergraduate
classes. Presentations will be given to schools and community groups to
illustrate the importance of science.
