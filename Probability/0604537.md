This project involves the study of mathematical problems associated with the
control and analysis of stochastic networks. Examples of application domains for
these stochastic models include manufacturing, the service industry,
telecommunications, computer systems and biochemical reactions. Some of the
problems being studied involve the development of general theory for broad
classes of stochastic networks, while others focus on mathematical questions
directly motivated by specific applications. The following five topics are
considered: (i) dynamic scheduling for stochastic processing networks, (ii)
analysis of processor sharing networks, (iii) congestion control for data
networks, (iv) input-queued switches, and (v) biochemical reaction networks. The
stochastic network models associated with these topics are considerably more
general than conventional multiclass queueing networks operating under a head-
of-the-line (HL) service discipline. Although there is a fairly well developed
theory of stability and heavy traffic diffusion approximation for the latter,
there are many challenging open problems associated with the control and
analysis of more general stochastic networks. Some stochastic process aspects of
this project include the study of singular diffusion control problems, the use
of measure-valued processes to keep track of residual job sizes, foundational
questions for reflected Levy processes, and the use of an infinite server queue
to model biochemical reactions with non-exponential reaction times.

This grant funds research on mathematical problems motivated by applications in
the disciplines of operations research, computer science, electrical engineering
and biochemistry. The specific problems being studied concern the control and
analysis of stochastic networks which are models for complex systems involving
dynamic interactions subject to uncertainty. Two fundamental problems for such
networks are (a) to understand the behavior of these systems under natural
control policies, and (b) to design 'good' controllers for these systems. The
networks under study are substantially more general than those that have been
rigorously studied to date. Through their complexity and heterogeneity, these
networks present challenging mathematical problems. The project involves the
development of new theory for stochastic processes and uses techniques from a
variety of mathematical disciplines. Collaborations with researchers familiar
with areas of application, the training of graduate student researchers, and the
dissemination of research results through publication in peer reviewed journals
and presentations at cross-disciplinary research conferences are integral parts
of the project.
