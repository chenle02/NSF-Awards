9350090, PI-Holmes: The New Orleans Public Schools (NOPS) proposes a two step
Urban Systemic Initiatives planning process. NOPS will determine the present
state of K 12 Science, Mathematics and Technology (SMT) education in the
district and then develop a reform plan, informed by the self study data, to
implement a K 12 system which will provide a high quality SMT education for all
students. The planning process will be led by an Executive Committee (EC)
chaired by the Superintendent and composed of NOPS representatives and other key
stakeholders. The EC will supervise the development of the implementation plan
and recommend necessary changes in district policies and procedures. The plan
will be produced by an Advisory Board (AB) composed of members of the EC and the
chairs of six review committees (RC). The RCs, each charged with examining
specific elements of the SMT education system, will collect, organize, and
analyze data and submit recommendations to the AB.
