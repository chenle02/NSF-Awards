The National Science Foundation has awarded San Jos√© State University (SJSU)
funds to develop a proteomics facility. The goal of this project is to transform
and expand the molecular life sciences research capabilities at SJSU. This is a
collaborative effort between faculty in the Departments of Chemistry and Biology
to foster institutional linkages between the two departments in addition to the
one-on-one linkages that currently exist. This goal will be accomplished through
the establishment of the PROTEIN Lab at SJSU, developing faculty expertise in
molecular life science research, and training SJSU students in proteomics
research. This program will enable a variety of scientific advances, including
identification of novel proteins in biological signal transduction pathways,
characterization of novel proteins from diverse biological sources such as
uncultivable bacteria to humans, purification of proteins for biophysical
studies of protein crowding and hydration effects, and characterization of small
molecules. This program will enhance the research capabilities in the
Departments of Biology and Chemistry, stimulate collaboration amongst
researchers who use the PROTEIN facility, and prepare graduate and undergraduate
students for transition to graduate/professional programs or the biotechnology
work force in the Bay Area. Results from the research projects will be published
in peer-reviewed journals, and disseminated through presentations by students
and faculty at regional or national meetings.
