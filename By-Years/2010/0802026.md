This award enables a study of the status of nanotechnology commercialization.
The objectives of the cross-industry are (1) to track industry growth and
significant changes, (2) to document commercialization trends and best practices
and (3) to identify key barriers and issues to nanotechnology commercialization.
The study will encompass approximately 1,000 U.S. manufacturing companies,
including nanotechnology start-up companies. The study will take place in three
phases, (1) survey design and data acquisition, (2) analysis of responses and
data and (3) reporting and dissemination of results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
study will serve as a realistic measure of the activity levels of key
organizations directly involved with nanotechnology innovation and the transfer
of nanotechnology to new manufacturing applications. It will provide a basis for
rational decision making with respect to nanomanufacturing strategies, policies,
incentives, collaborations and investments.
