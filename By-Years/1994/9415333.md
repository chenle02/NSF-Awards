Support is sought to acquire computer equipment to enable the Department of
Meteorology at Northern Illinois University (NIU) to migrate from OS/2-based
McIDAS software to UNIX stations and software. This conversion to UNIX allows
the Department of Meteorology to expand the accessibility and number of products
available from UNIDATA for both teaching and research. The proposal requests
will enhance the cooperation with the existing program in Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) in the Department of Geography. Two UNIX workstations are
requested. Presently, only one workstation serves the entire department.
