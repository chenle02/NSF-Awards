This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at Ohio State University for the summers of 2004-2006. The program
director is Jonathon R. Parquette. Eight students will participate in a ten-week
program. Students will be recruited from colleges and universities throughout
the U.S. Minority students who participated in research as high school students
at Ohio State, or attended local high schools, will be targeted for
participation. The REU students will work on a project in the department of
chemistry that is interdisciplinary at the interface of chemistry and biology.
Workshops on library use, scientific computing, and NMR will be held. Seminars
and weekly lunch meetings will introduce students to ongoing research and
careers. Participants will write a research report, present a poster at a
department poster session and provide evaluation information.
