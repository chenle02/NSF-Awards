Collaborative activities with the Institute of Ionosphere and Terrestrial
Magnetism (IZMARIN), and the Institute of Space Research of the Russian Academy
of Sciences (IKI) will be carried out through joint projects and student
exchanges. The joint activities will address, (1) the relationship between
interplanetary shock parameters and their geoeffectiveness, (2) the effect of
sharp solar wind pressure pulses upon the Earth's magnetosphere, (3) the
refinement of a neural network prediction scheme to determine how well a solar
wind monitor will predict plasma flux and velocity and magnetic fields at Earth,
and (4) comparisons between the time integral of the z-component of the
interplanetary magnetic field observed at the L1 Lagrange point and other
spacecraft.
