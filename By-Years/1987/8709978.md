On August 21, 1986 Lake Nyos in Cameroon erupted a cloud of carbon dioxide gas
which killed over 1,700 people. Immediately thereafter scientific teams from
several countries including the U.S. visited the scene to assist the Cameroon
government in determining the scientific causes for this disaster. At that time,
the American team took baseline measurements of Lake Nyos and some other lakes
in the area, collected samples and learned as much as they could about the
general geology. At present, however, it is not clear whether the carbon dioxide
resided in the lake for some time or simply passed through on its way from a
volcanic source; the mechanism of eruption is not yet clear. In order to fully
understand these issues, measurements over time are necessary and this award
will allow members of the American team to take additional measurements in the
Spring of 1987. John Lockwood, the co-leader of the American team will spend an
additional two weeks in the field following a meeting called by the Cameroon
government in March, to which his way will be paid. George Kling and William
Evans will go to Cameroon a month later to do follow- up measurements on Lake
Nyos and several similar volcanic lakes.
