ABSTRACT

PI: Eduardo E. Wolf Institution: University of Notre Dame Proposal Number:
0224435

Research:

The short term objective of this work is to study the direct partial oxidation
of propane to acrolein, a chemical intermediary, using a dual membrane reactor.
This reactor has unique characteristics that can increase product yield, which
is typically low for the propane to acrolein reaction when carried out in a
conventional fixed bed reactor. The use of alkanes, such as propane, for the
direct conversion by partial oxidation to acrolein is more attractive than the
current process that uses propylene, a more expensive feedstock.

The long term objective is to study, evaluate and optimize the capabilities of
the dual bed membrane reactor. The reactor consists of an inert membrane, placed
concentrically to the reactor tube wall. Catalyst is located between the
membrane and the reactor wall and the membrane acts as a barrier between the
oxidant (air/oxygen) and the reducing feed (propane) thus reducing the danger of
flammability encountered in reactors with premixed feeds. What makes the dual
bed membrane reactor unique is that it has two catalyst beds fed separately so
that reaction conditions can be independently controlled in each bed. This is
different from two reactors in series in that in the dual bed membrane reactor
the two catalyst beds are connected. The gas phase intermediates emerging from
the first bed are utilized in the second bed. It thus allows the independent
control of temperature, catalysts, gas phase intermediates, and residence time
in a single reactor.

Impact:

If the results are successful, the technology could be extended to other alkane
functionalization reactions to provide a less energy intensive technology for
the environmentally clean production of oxygenate intermediates for the chemical
industry. The project will integrate research and teaching both at the graduate
and undergraduate level.
