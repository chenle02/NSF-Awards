A three-dimensional primitive-equation numerical model will be used to examine
the generation and propagation of internal tides. The model will be applied to
the Strait of Gibraltar where an extensive field program had previously
collected data which can be used for verification of the results and detailed
examination of the important physical mechanisms. Comparisons will be made with
less extensive data from the Celtic Sea.
