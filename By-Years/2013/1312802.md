This award supports science and operations of the Expanded Owens Valley Solar
Array (EOVSA) as a community facility. EOVSA is a solar-dedicated radio
interferometer array, located at Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO), and is
under construction for completion in 2013. EOVSA will provide the community open
access to the most comprehensive, physics-based radio spectral measurements of
solar and space-weather phenomena to date, together with a strong program of
night-time science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EOVSA opens a new era in astrophysics
research, while providing a stepping stone to the future Frequency Agile Solar
Radiotelescope (FASR). As a university-based, solar-dedicated instrument, the
array provides opportunities for young scientists and engineers to obtain hands-
on experience in constructing and operating hardware, which when combined with
traditional data analysis skills creates better, more capable researchers.
