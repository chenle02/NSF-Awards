GER-9554506 Tom The goal of our proposed training program is to produce
scientists with unique and timely skills for making significant contributions to
the nation's environmental problems. We believe an interdisciplinary PhD
training program in environmental physics which combines a foundation in soil
and environmental sciences with recently developed experimental and mathematical
techniques of physics can fulfill this goal. The proposed program will include
specialized training in: 1) the application of nonlinear optical and other
surface physics techniques to understand microscopic processes at the
soil/water, air/water and oil/water interfaces; 2) the use of molecular
dynamics, percolation theory and other mathematical techniques to model water
flow, contaminant reaction, and transport in soil and ground water systems.
