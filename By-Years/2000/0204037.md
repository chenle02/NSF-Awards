In the modeling of controlled distributed parameter systems "additive" boundary
and internal locally distributed controls are typically used. (Examples of such
controls can be a source in a heat/mass-transfer process or a piezoceramic
actuator placed on a beam.) In terms of applications it appears that such
controls can adequately model only those controlled processes that do not change
their principal physical characteristics due to the control actions. They rather
describe the effect of various externally added "alien" sources and/or forces on
the process at hand. This limitation, however, excludes a vast array of new and
not quite new technologies, such as, for example, "smart materials" and numerous
biomedical, chemical and nuclear chain reactions, which are able to change their
principal parameters under certain purposefully induced conditions
("catalysts").

The intent of this proposal is to address the just-outlined issues in the
context of global controllability of semilinear partial differential equations
(PDEs) through the introduction and study of multiplicative (or "bilinear")
controls. These controls enter the system equations as coefficients. Accordingly
they can change at least some of the principal parameters of the process at
hand, such as, for example, the natural frequency response of a beam or the rate
of a chemical reaction. (In the former case this can be caused, e.g., by the
embedded "smart" alloys and, in the latter case, by various catalysts and/or by
the speed at which the reaction ingredients are mechanically mixed.) The focus
of this proposal is on the development of a new methodology for the study of
global controllability of the semilinear reaction-diffusion-convection equation
and of the wave and beam equations in the framework of bilinear controls. We are
particularly interested in the effect such multiplicative controls may have on
the issue of controllability of highly nonlinear PDEs, in which case the
classical additive controls often appear to be inadequate.
