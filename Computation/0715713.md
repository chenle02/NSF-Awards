Computational methods, in particular, those for partial differential equations,
have experienced major developments over the past thirty years in both
algorithmic advances and applications to other fields. Computational simulation
of physical phenomena has now fully joined engineering experimentation and
theoretical/analytical analysis as the third method of scientific investigation.
As the application problems become ever complicate and challenging, it becomes
more and more difficult or even impossible to solve these problems by isolated
individuals. The magnitude and complexity of the problems often require various
expertise (such as field data acquisition, modeling, mathematical analysis,
computational methods, computer programming and visualization, and data
analysis), hence, their solutions require persistent collective effort of
international scientific communities of various disciplines. Also, because face
to face interaction is important to effective exchange of ideas and
collaborations, it is vital to bring together researchers with similar research
interests to conferences of various scales. To meet the need and to facilitate
such an interaction, the principal investigator (PI), together with colleagues
from U.S., China, and Korea, will organize the ``International Workshop on
Computational Methods in Geosciences", which will be held from July 5-7, 2007 at
Xi'an Jiaotong University, China. The requested funding will be used to support
U.S. researchers, in particular, graduate students and postdocs, to attend the
workshop.

The anticipated international workshop is expected to contribute to promoting,
enhancing, and stimulating the cross-continental research interactions and
collaborations in mathematical sciences. Such community-wise research activities
often serve the purpose of enhancing and promoting collaborations between U.S.
and international researchers in mathematical and applied sciences, which in
turn contributes critically to the course of solving challenging scientific
problems such as flow and transport in porous media, weather prediction, nano-
materials design, genome sequencing and analysis. In addition, organizing such a
workshop in China will bring prominent researchers from U.S. and Europe working
in such an active scientific research area to Asia, consequently, the
anticipated workshop will do a good service to and have a positive impact on the
international applied and computational mathematics community.
