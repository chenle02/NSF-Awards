Dr. Rose Ann Clark has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Clark received her doctoral degree from North Carolina State
University under the supervision of Professor Edmond Bowden. Dr. Clark will
continue research at Pennsylvania State University under the sponsorship of
Professor Andrew Ewing. Her postdoctoral research will target the development of
electroanalytical tools to probe the microenvironment of mammalian nerve cells.
The goal is to utilize voltammetry and amperometry to monitor release at single
mammalian synapses in culture. The research will involve construction and
utilization of microelectrodes of submicrometer dimensions. Through the
monitoring of neurotransmitter release along axons, at single synapses, or in
artificial synapses, the research will contribute to our understanding of the
neurotransmission process. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry
Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden
the knowledge and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful
careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
