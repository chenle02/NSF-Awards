This project aims at developing a survivability framework called PROMISE, which
includes procedures for fault recovery for mission critical applications. The
idea behind this framework is to divide an active path into several, possibly
overlapping active segments, and then protect each active segment with a detour
called backup segment. Thus the basic survivability concept is to provide local
protection against faults impacting localized segments of the active path. The
following research activities will be particularly pursued. First, the project
team will investigate how to find the optimal (e.g. most band-width-efficient)
active path segments and how to reduce the time complexity of the new
survivability algorithms within the framework. For that purpose, new ILP
formulations for solving the problems will be used to provide reference data,
and a comprehensive study comparing the proposed approaches with other existing
protection/restoration approaches will be conducted. Second, the proposed
research will include the investigation of the methods to support differentiated
services within the framework, such as partially survivable, unprotected or
preemptable connections. Finally, the project will elaborate on survivability
issues specific to optical networks based on WDM (Wavelength Division
Multiplexing) and IP under the Generalized Multi-protocol Label Switched
(G-MPLS) framework, where new algorithms and simulation tools PROMISE are
expected to be developed. The project will bring together networking research
and theoretic computer science research, and in addition, by incorporating
research into educational and training activities will create awareness and
interest among students on the issues related to survivability in next-
generation communication networks.
