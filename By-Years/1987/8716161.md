This proposal requests funds to obtain a calorimeter system which will allow the
investigators to study metabolic rates and the partitioning of those rates
between aerobic and anaerobic components. The instrumentation requested will
support at least five major projects. (1) Metabolic studies of marine
invertebrates exposed to environmental changes in oxygen content (2) metabolic
studies of marine organisms which are widely tolerant of oxygen variation and
others which are intolerant of oxygen (species dwelling in oxygen-poor
sediments) (3) the effects of toxic metabolites on mineralization processes in
marine sediments (4) metabolism by larval invertebrates during embryonic
development (5) anaerobic metabolism in genetically different strains of
embryonic fish. The instrumentation will permit studies not feasible by other
methods.
