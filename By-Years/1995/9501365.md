Commodity software differs in fundamental ways from the workloads typically
used in academic research to measure hardware and software behavior in computer
systems research. In this project the behavior of commodity software systems
will be studied. The project will develop tools for measuring behavior in
commodity software, then apply them tools to important problems in computer
systems design.
