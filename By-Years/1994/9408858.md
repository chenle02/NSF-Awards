The PI will investigate an ongoing innovation project at Xerox Corporation's
Palo Alto Research Center. The innovation is "Workspace," which integrates
computers, monitors, cameras, and other media. This innovation allows ad hoc
groups to be formed even if the members of the group are situated in different
geographical locations. The research program will concern factors that may
inhibit or facilitate innovation. First, what organizational forms are conducive
to innovation? Second, is there a benefit of organizational forms that allow
individuals to address issues that concern social and ethical values? The PIs
will use a variety of data sources in order to test their hypotheses concerning
the innovation process. These sources include company documentation,
ethnographic data, and a "field stimulation" approach in which discussions are
used to examine participants' reactions to various aspects of the innovation
process. / / ! ! F / / ( Times New Roman Symbol &amp; Arial ` " h e e A abstract
