This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
biological oceanography between Lisa Campbell of the University of Hawaii and
Daniel Vaulot of the University of Paris VI. The objective of their research is
to develop useful probes for identification and enumeration of important
picoeukaryotic algae. Picoeukaryotic algae are the very smallest eukaryotic
phytoplankton and contribute a large percentage of primary production in
tropical and subtropic oceans. The investigators will develop and apply
oligonucleotide probes and immunochemical probes to cell surface antigens.
Mutual benefits of this project include obtaining the best available probes to
date and devising the best strategy to address the overall objectives. It is
expected that results from this project will advance our knowledge of the
composition and community structure of picoeukaryotic algae.
