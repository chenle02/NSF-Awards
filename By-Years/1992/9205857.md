Most of what we know about the Earth's interior is based on inferences from
seismological observations. Seismology places direct constraints on the
isotropic elastic properties of the Earth's mantle. The comparison of laboratory
data with seismic models of the Earth has led to much conjecture about the
composition of the mantle. Typically, the laboratory data on minerals is
constrained to the bulk modulus and the density, while measurements of the shear
modulus remain very sparse, particularly at high pressures. The PI will measure
the compressional wave velocities of several silicates in polycrystalline form,
using Brillouin scattering and the diamond anvil cell. From this data and a
knowledge of the bulk modulus and density of the material the shear moduli at
high pressures can be calculated using elementary thermodynamics. These data
will allow us to take advantage of the seismological information that is
currently under-utilized, and hopefully will place tighter constraints on the
composition of the Earth's mantle.
