8900244 Conlon This project is concerned with some problems in statistical
mechanics. The basic aim of statistical mechanics is to obtain the large scale
thermodynamic behavior of a many particle system from a knowledge of the
microscopic interaction between the particles. The thermodynamic behavior is
described as a function of a few parameters such as temperature and destiny. The
principal investigator will study a classical gas with short range interaction
at high temperature. He plans to show that at a sufficiently high temperature
there is no phase transition. The main task is to study the high density system
and show that it is approximately gaussian. He will also study ground state
energies of systems with long range Coulomb interaction. These systems are
particularly important since the electromagnetic Coulomb force is ubiquitous in
nature. For a system of charged Bosons in a jellium background, he wants to show
that the thermodynamic limit of the ground state energy per particle is, at high
densities, given precisely by a formula of Foldy. This would show that the
Bogoliubov ansatz, which is widely used in heuristic theories of superfluidity
and superconductivity, is valid in a certain case.
