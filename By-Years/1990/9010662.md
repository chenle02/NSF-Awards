This proposal is to conduct theoretical studies on two physical oceanographic
topics: salt fingers, and ocean circulation. Salt fingers occur in the ocean due
to the differing magnitudes of salt and heat diffusion. They have been observed
frequently, and this study will address models of the physics. In addition,
models of the ocean circulation, particularly western boundary currents will be
investigated. Current models attempt to account for non-linear and inertial
effects, but have difficulty obtaining consistent results. This study will
address layered models of the circulation.
