NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components
to prepare young scientists for careers in emerging areas where biology
intersects with other scientific disciplines, in this case with mathematics and
physical sciences. The Fellows are expected to lead the nation's scientific
workforce of the future. This fellowship to Sarah Collins examines how local and
regional factors interact to influence lake nutrient chemistry. The host
institution is Michigan State University, and the sponsoring scientists are
Patricia Soranno and Pang-Ning Tan. Lake ecosystems provide many valuable
services to society including commercial navigation and water for drinking,
irrigation, and recreation as well as economically and recreationally important
fisheries. Understanding how human activities alter these important ecosystems
is complex and requires consideration of processes that occur at multiple
scales. One common driver of environmental change is human alteration of
nutrient cycles, known to have profoundly affected ecosystems around the globe.
The research investigates how regional patterns in atmospheric nitrogen
deposition influence nutrient limitation in lake ecosystems and uses a recently
assembled, uniquely extensive database that includes water chemistry records for
over 60,000 lakes, data on nitrogen deposition, and local variables, including
watershed land use and connectivity between aquatic systems. The extensive
nature of the database makes possible an explanation of how specific local
drivers mediate the regional effects of nitrogen deposition on nutrient
chemistry in lakes. Training goals for the Fellow include mathematical analysis
techniques, data mining, statistical modeling, and the use of large databases to
study nutrient pollution across spatial and temporal scales as well as teaching
a limnology course to undergraduates in an innovative, interactive classroom
setting.
