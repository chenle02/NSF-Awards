Funds are provided for the purchase of the equipment that will comprise a basic
facility for carrying out a variety of projects, including membrane oxygenation
of an immobilized cell bioreactor, process control of mammalian cell sultures,
control of cell adhesion, improved red cell metabolism for blood storage, and
the on-line extraction of monclonal antibodies. The common focus of these
projects is the growth and cultivation of mammalian cells with emphasis on the
practical problems associated with large-scale cultivation and production.
