This project builds upon previous research by the investigator regarding the
coupling between polar climate at millennial time scales and the bi-polar origin
of Heinrich events (i.e., the polar synchronization hypothesis). The researcher
will pursue a number of research questions, among the most important being: (1)
How and when did polar synchronization start, and how did it evolve? and (2)
What is the nature of the information being exchanged since coupling implies
communication or exchange of information? These scientific questions are
currently unanswered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary Broader Impacts involve
greater scientific understanding of polar climate and inter-hemispheric
communication of climate forcing. The project also involves undergraduate
students in the discovery and understanding of paleoclimate dynamics.
