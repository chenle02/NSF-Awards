ABSTRACT A four-week workshop on properties of feature organization, will be
held concurrently with the 1991 Linguistic Institute at the University of
California at Santa Cruz. The objective is to explore some of the important
issues in the theory of segment- internal structure. In particular, the workshop
will address (i) the motivation for feature groupings and their formal
expression, and (ii) the central role of the strictly local relations of
dependency and sisterhood between segment components. The four- week workshop
(July 8 through August 2) will be a closed working group of approximately
fifteen participants, representing different backgrounds and orientations but
who have all contributed to the investigation of segment-internal feature
representation. The one-day conference will be open to the whole Institute
community, and an edited collection of papers from the workshop and conference
will be published.
