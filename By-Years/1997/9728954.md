This project involves the dissertation research of a student from Stanford
University, studying how a grassroots indigenous development organization in
Guatemala uses ethnic cultural practices to transform the goals and effects of
development. Based in the municipality of Totonicapan, the project will examine
a large development project, the `Cooperation for Western Rural Development`, to
assess how local ethnic identities are reflected in the design and practice of
development activities. The methods will include intensive participant
observation in the development organization as well as a census of eight local
communities to assess their involvement in development projects, more intensive
studies in two communities, one where projects are established and one where
they are just being institutionalized. This research is important because most
development projects implicitly or explicitly assume that local ethnicity will
give way towards more Western, European, middle-class values and practices. Yet
new development organizations are contesting that model, forging new approaches
to join the best of local ethnic identity with developed institutions. This
project will advance our knowledge of this new approach as well as contribute to
the training of a young social scientist.
