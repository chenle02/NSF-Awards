This project will study a selected city planning program in which seismic and
non-seismic geologic information has been used extensively. The research team
will investigate the types of information used, ways in which this information
has been included in local plans, and types of planning regulations developed to
utilize geologic information. Experiences of other cities will then be
investigated and compared. A major result of the study will be a set of
implementing a planning program which will bring about improved seismic safety.
The report in which the results of the study and the guidelines will appear will
be a major addition to the limited literature on this topic in the hazard
mitigation field.
