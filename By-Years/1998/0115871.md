With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Kalamazoo College will acquire a nanosecond laser
system. The research activities will involve measurement of vector correlations
in the photodissociation of volatile organometallic nitrosyls, especially the
correlations between angular momentum and velocity and between the transition
dipole and velocity. The results obtained in these experiments will reveal the
role of Jahn-Teller distortions in excited organometallic nitrosyl compounds and
may reveal the timescale for metal-NO dissociation. These results can be
extended into understanding chemical vapor deposition and NO-metal interactions
in biological systems. Student researchers at this primarily undergraduate
institution will participate in these studies.

A nanosecond laser provides ultrafast pulses of coherent visible or infrared
light, which enables researchers to obtain important information about fast
occurring chemical reactions. Its use may enable breakthroughs in our
understanding of the properties of reactive and nonreactive molecules. These
studies will have an impact in materials chemistry and biochemistry.
