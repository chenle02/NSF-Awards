The Department of Chemistry will acquire an electron-impact, thermospray mass
spectrometer interfaced to a High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) for
use in undergraduate education. The new instrument will provide experience in
separations and mass spectrometry for students in both the American Chemical
Society accredited Bachelor of Science program and the Bachelor of Arts program
in chemistry. A set of new experiments has been designed which will incorporate
LC-MS into the analytical instrumental courses. The new instrument will
complement chromatographic systems recently acquired through Hughes Foundation
funds.
