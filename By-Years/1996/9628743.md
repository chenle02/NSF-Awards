The objective of this proposal is to examine the role of nutrient levels in
determining the distribution and abundance of salt marsh plants species.
Preliminary experiments indicate that nutrient levels influence the competitive
ability of marsh plants by changing the focus of competition from belowground to
aboveground. This suggests that differences in marsh vegetation patterns are the
result of tradeoffs between above and belowground competition as nutrient levels
change. The investigators will experimentally investigate the mechanisms
responsible for the linkage between nutrients and competitive ability and the
relationship between nutrient supplies and marsh vegetation patterns. The
variables that contribute to the distribution patterns of species along
environmental gradients are of interest to resource managers. Results from this
study will provide an important tool in helping ecologists predict the
consequences of anthropogenic nutrient additions on native plant communities.
