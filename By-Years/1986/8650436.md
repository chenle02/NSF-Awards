Over the past two years, the Department of Electrical Engineering at Gonzaga
University has established a program in thick film hybrid microelectronics. The
curriculum has been modified to provide an adequate basis for the program, and a
laboratory has been developed. The Department has developed a three-phased plan
to upgrade the existing laboratory so that students may gain practical
experience in high level computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) of hybrid
microcircuits. The current phase, implemented through this project, allows the
incorporation of an infrared zone furnace and an automated hybrid assembly unit.
These pieces of equipment will enhance the educational, research, and
development capabilities of the institution's existing hybrid microelectronics
program.
