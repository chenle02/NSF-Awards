The project is providing opportunities for Missouri undergraduate mathematics
faculty to review and consider the implications of emerging secondary and
undergraduate curriculum reform/materials. Four conferences serve as the forum
in which faculty can learn about and discuss reform. In two of these
conferences, teams of high school mathematics teachers and college faculty are
participating to further systemic efforts at mathematics reform across multiple
levels. Significant follow-up activities are taking place to encourage and
support reform efforts across the state that will help faculty and teachers
develop and implement curriculum changes in both new and existing courses. The
specific objectives of the project are facilitation of: 1. College/university
mathematics faculty in their review of NSF-sponsored undergraduate curriculum
materials and the development of related instructional materials for courses
they teach. 2. Discussion and study of undergraduate curriculum-related issues
including new mathematics content, new instructional approaches, and emerging
technologies. 3. College/university mathematics and high school mathematics
faculty and teachers in their review of NSF-sponsored secondary curriculum
materials and the development of related instructional materials for courses
they teach. 4. Discussion and study of secondary curriculum and examination and
revision of Missouri mathematics teacher preparation programs. Monographs
generated from each conference are being provided for each participant and each
mathematics department chair in the state of Missouri.
