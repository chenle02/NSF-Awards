Low-level pointer-manipulating programs form the backbone of our digital
infrastructure: web browsers, operating systems, and cryptographic libraries are
all implemented in low-level languages like C. These programs are both expensive
to develop and susceptible to memory-safety bugs, which lead to crashes and
security vulnerabilities, such as the infamous Heartbleed bug. This project's
impact is to address both the cost and the safety issue at the same time, by
generating low-level code automatically from high-level specifications in a way
that guarantees absence of memory-safety bugs. This project's novelty is to
advance the state of the art in program synthesis by developing a new synthesis
technique that is both efficient and capable of generating memory-safe pointer-
manipulating code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pointer-manipulating programs have been
largely beyond the capabilities of the state-of-the-art program synthesizers due
to the difficulty of reasoning automatically about their behavior and lack of
structural constraints, such as strict typing, that are traditionally used to
prune the search space the synthesizer has to explore. To enable efficient
synthesis of safe pointer-manipulating programs, the investigators combine
state-of-the-art program verification techniques based on separation logic with
deductive program synthesis, a method for deriving provably correct programs
directly from their specifications. This research addresses both challenges
outlined above: (1) separation logic enables automatic reasoning about pointer-
manipulating programs, and (2) deductive synthesis leverages the specification
to preemptively prune unsafe programs from the search space. This approach is
implemented in the SafeSpace synthesis framework, which accepts separation logic
specifications as input, and produces C programs as
output.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
