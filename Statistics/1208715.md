The investigator explores and develops new principles for the design of
statistical software to take advantage of modern computing power. Particular
emphasis is placed on exploring the effective use of parallel computing and
compilation. Pilot implementations are incorporated in open source statistical
software systems.

Effective statistical methodology made available through statistical software is
critical to the ability of researchers to make maximal use of experimental and
observational data, and for the ability of instructors to teach good research
practices. The design principles developed by this research lead to software
that improves the ability of researchers, instructors, and other users of
statistical methodology to apply this methodology more effectively in scientific
research and teaching and to take full advantage of modern high-performance
computational resources. These principles also lead to software frameworks that
can be used to more rapidly deliver new statistical methodology to end users.
Applications in a range of areas serve as testbeds for methods and principles
developed in this research.
