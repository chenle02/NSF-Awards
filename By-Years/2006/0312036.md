This grant supports the participation of Dr. Twohy in the AIRS II project
(second Alliance Icing Research Study), a collaboration of American, Canadian,
and European agencies and institutions motivated by the important practical
problem of aircraft icing. The AIRS field program is scheduled for the winter of
2003-2004 and based at Mirabel Airport, north of Montreal, Canada, where a
surface observing network and ground-based remote-sensing equipment will be
located. Dr. Twohy and her colleagues will be responsible for cloud
microphysical observations aboard the NSF C-130 aircraft operating out of
Cleveland, Ohio. The main scientific objective is to explain the circumstances
by which regions of supercooled drops can form and continue to exist in clouds
that may also contain ice crystals. The C-130 will be equipped for measuring the
water content and ice content of clouds; the concentration, size, habit, and
density of ice crystals; the concentration of ice-forming nuclei; the activity
spectrum of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN); and the concentration and
characteristics of aerosol particles both within the project area and in the air
upstream of where the clouds of interest form. Dr. Twohy will be in charge of
two instruments, a counterflow virtual impactor (CVI) and a cloud spectrometer
and impactor (CSI). The CVI is a fuselage-mounted instrument that samples and
sizes cloud droplets and ice crystals between about 8 and 50 micrometers in
diameter and evaporates the water, leaving residual particles that can be
analyzed to determine the size and composition of the nuclei on which the
droplets and crystals formed. The CSI is a new, wing-mounted instrument that
measures the mass of condensed water per unit volume of cloud, the droplet-size
distribution, and the particle residue. The data provided by these instruments,
when compared with the aerosols and CCN measured just outside the cloud, will
indicate which of the aerosols participated in cloud formation, the extent to
which they were mixed into the cloud, and the degree to which theory enables the
prediction of the drop-size distribution on the basis of the CCN activity
spectrum. Special attention will be given to large supercooled drops, because
these are a major cause of aircraft icing. The research contributes not only to
the fundamental understanding of the microphysical structure of supercooled
clouds but also to the advancement of aviation safety.
