The objective of this work is the measurement of the absorption of solar
radiation by continental stratiform clouds. If anomalous absorption is due to
cloud interstitial aerosol or "dirty" cloud water, it is most likely to be
observed in these clouds. The analysis of airborne data collected in FIRE during
coordinated flights with the United Kingdom Meteorological Office's C-130 and
the NASA ER-2 aircraft will continue. These data will help to establish the
reliability of the various measurements and the capability of multispectral
radiometers to measure cloud properties by remote sensing. The analysis of
simultaneous airborne and satellite observations of "ship-tracks" in clouds will
be completed. //
