Recent technological advances allow for an increase in the amount of sensitive
human participants data that can be safely shared. Institutional Review Boards'
(IRBs) traditional reluctance to allow the sharing of such data unnecessarily
constrains their long-term reuse. This project seeks to close the gap between
modern options for safely sharing sensitive data and IRB practices by
establishing socio-technical infrastructure to support a sustained dialogue and
productive partnerships between data repositories and IRBs with the objective to
pilot new consensus guidance, protocols, and templates on the sharing and long-
term re-use of sensitive data generated through research with human
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the National
Science Foundation Public Access Initiative which is managed by the NSF Office
of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure on behalf of the
Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
