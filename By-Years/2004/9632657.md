9632657 Kelly This proposal is on research to examine both basic and applied
issues of enzymes from two model hyperthermophiles, the archaeon Pyrococcus
furiosus (Tmax 105 C) and the bacterium Thermotoga maritima (Tmax 90 C). This
will be done using sequence information on the entire genomes of both organisms
which will be available during the course of the project. Also, the diversity of
hyperthermophiles in both deep sea and continental geothermal sites will be
examined, and the types of enzymes they contain will be studied for their
physiological significance, thermmostability/thermoactivity and/or
biotechnological potential. Emphasis will be placed on hydrolytic and redox
enzymes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and peptides.
Characterization of the diversity and biochemical features of this enzyme group
will be investigated by both recombinant and biochemical techniques to change
patterns of substrate specificity. Mechanisms of thermostabilization and
chemical stabilization of hyperthermophilic enzymes will also be addressed.
Also, the use of both existing and new enzymes will be evaluated in a variety of
biotechnological applications in conjunction with an industrial collaboration.
