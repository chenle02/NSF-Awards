Dr. Levinson and two graduate students will study methods of augmenting or
replacing search with subpattern recognition, associative recall, and machine
learning. A general adaptive prediction model has been tested in standard search
domains for which analytic and performance results are known. This system will
now be extended to a more complex domain of a self-learning, pattern-oriented
chess program, to be trained against published games and available deep-
searching chess programs. The goal is to develop problem-solving strategies
resembling those used by intuitive humans experts.
