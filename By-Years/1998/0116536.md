0116536 Koepfler This award to Coastal Carolina University in South Carolina
will provide support for acquisition of instrumentation for research on
microbial ecology. It supports strong, ongoing efforts in integration of
research and education at CCU, which has a large marine studies program and
active programs involving undergraduates in research in environmental sciences.
Specific instrumentation supported here includes a compound microscope with
image analyzer, a data logging multiprobe, a multi-channel respirometer and
incubators. The university will provide additional instrumentation under this
project, including electrophoresis apparatus, gel documentation system,
additional incubators, fluorometers, peristaltic pumps and computers for data
logging and analysis. CCU is a non-Ph.D.-granting university; the university
will contribute about 22% of the total cost of this project from non-federal
funds. ***
