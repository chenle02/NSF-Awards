SciGirls, produced by Twin Cities Public Television, is a new PBS 13-part half-
hour television series with accompanying Web and outreach activities targeted to
girls ages 8 - 13-year olds. The intended impacts are to 1) to foster a greater
interest in STEM among girls ages 8 to 13 and their parents, with girls from
diverse communities the highest priority; 2) connect girls to existing, quality
STEM education opportunities in their communities; and 3) contribute to the
growing body of research to deepen understanding of the most effective ways to
engage girls in STEM activities and encourage them to pursue STEM careers. The
project?s two strategic partners are the National Girls Collaborative Project
(NGCP) in Seattle, and The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. The NGCP will
link SciGirls TV with its network of 500 community-based science programs for
girls, and The Franklin Institute will help form an affiliate network of science
museums to implement SciGirls TV outreach activities. In addition to the
broadcasts on PBS Plus, the videos will be distributed via online streaming and
DVD?s, as well as via versions that can be downloaded to portable video players.
The most significant web component will be a social networking feature that will
allow girls interested in science to connect with others across the nation.
Barbara Flagg of Multimedia Research will conduct formative evaluation of the
first rough cuts, and a subsequent summative evaluation of the completed
programs and of the social networking web site.
