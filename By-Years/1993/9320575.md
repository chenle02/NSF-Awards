9320575 Mikic The investigators will study the physical properties of active-
regions in the sun's corona from the topology of the magnetic field. In a prior
grant, the investigators developed a technique to determine the coronal magnetic
field configuration from vector magnetograph measurements of the photospheric
magnetic field. Vector magnetographs measure the Zeeman splitting of
magnetically sensitive spectral lines. The investigators will study a numer of
different properties of coronal magnetic fields. They will compare the topology
of active-region coronal fields to observational features believed to trace
field lines. They will also relate the morphology of flare phenomena to the
structure of the coronal magnetic fields. They will study the evolution of the
coronal field above an active region using a sequence of magnetograms and
develop realistic models of active region magnetic fields. ***
