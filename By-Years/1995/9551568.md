The objective of this project is to establish a Real-Time Software Development
Laboratory (RTSDL) to provide undergraduate computer science students with
hands-on experience in computer interfacing, hardware links, and the utilization
of operating system resources in time-critical application software development.
Progress in computer applications has widened the gap between real-world
software development needs and most computer science programs, with an emphasis
on theoretical foundations and programming skills. Industrial applications
require knowledge of the software development lifecycle for time-critical and
reactive applications and the ability to utilize operating system resources,
including interrupts, concurrence and scheduling, memory management, non-
standard input and output devices, interfacing different systems, and
programming platforms.
