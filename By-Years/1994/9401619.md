Orientation and migration are behaviors that exploit a variety of sensory cues
from the environment, many of which still are very poorly understood. The
discovery that the electroreceptive systems of sharks may allow the swimming
fish to detect aspects of magnetic fields has opened a controversial area for
geomagnetic behavior. There are field data that suggest hammerhead sharks may
use local geomagnetic variation of the seafloor for cues in homing behavior
after extensive foraging trips. This project uses a laboratory setting to train
juvenile sharks to orient to an artificial magnetic ridge that can be changed in
its topography. A related field study will test whether sharks relocated during
their return homing trips will follow a predicted path given the local magnetic
environment. These results will have an impact in the controversy about
geomagnetic behavior, and be important for sensory neuroscience. It also may
have practical application in the location and capture of important commercial
species of fish.
