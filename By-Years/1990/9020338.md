This award will permit an anthropology graduate student to study the
circumstances surrounding the recruitment of Mexican peasants to a Mexican
millenarian Catholic community. The circumstances surrounding recruitment of
peasants from different socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds will be studied to
try to explain variations in their attraction to the group. Using ethnographic
methods of life history interviews, studies of personal networks and religious
experiences, a control group of similar peasants who did not join the
millenarian group will be compared to the joiners. This research is important
because religious sects are a vital fact of life in many countries of the world.
Understanding the conditions which facilitate joining, or resisting, these
groups helps understand how alternative religious groups survive.
