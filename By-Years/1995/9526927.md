9526927 Bukowinski This project will develop a self consistent set of ab initio
models for the response of deformable ions to crystal environments using density
functional theory. The models will be used to examine the static and dynamic
properties of transition zone and lmwer mantle minerals composed of SiO2, MgO,
FeO, CaO and Al2O3, including perovskites, MgSiO3 Majorite, and other garnets
and phases containing tetrahedral coordination polyhedra. Monte Carlo, molecular
dynamics, simulated annealing techniques will be used to explore mineral
structures at intermediate to very high pressures and temperatures, and to
estimate thermal parameters needed to model mineral assemblages that may account
for the observed seismic properties of the mantle. This will lead to a better
understanding of possible sources of radial discontinuities deep in the lower
mantle, and of thermal, structural and chemical effects on seismic velocities
and the geochemical evolution of the earth.
