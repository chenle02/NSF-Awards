This is planning and preparation funding for the Third International Workshop on
Multistrategy Learning, which seeks to further explore the implications of the
multistrategy approach to machine learning. This workshop will provide a forum
for a group of researchers to present and discuss the progress and most recent
results in the area of multistrategy learning and its practical applications,
and hopefully, to serve as an aid in planning further research in the area.
