This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will investigate
production of an exciting new material CuWRAM (Copper Waste Recovery from
Aqueous Media). Evaluation of these pilot procedures will support the design of
full scale manufacturing facilities. A processing system utilizing the patented
ISEP separations hardware obtained from Calgon Carbon Corp. and CuWRAM as the
extractant material for copper extraction and separation from iron (III) will be
produced. Extensive testing will provide information to: (1) establish the
effectiveness of the CuWRAM - ISEP system on real samples; (2) establish the
economic feasibility of this system under various conditions; and (3) develop a
targeted marketing strategy based on the first two items. Results from the Phase
I project have generated excitement throughout the mining community. Initial
testing on actual mining solutions will be conducted with one of the largest
copper producers in the U.S.

Commercial applications for a CuWRAM copper extraction include use in the
primary extraction circuit of copper mining operations, recovery of copper for
reuse in copper plating processes and recovery of copper from remediation
projects.
