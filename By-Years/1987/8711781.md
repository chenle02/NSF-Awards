When individuals in a group have incentives to hoard information, the group may
be less effective in achieving its goals. Mixed motives both to communicate and
accumulate information create a "social dilemma" in which group and individual
goals are in conflict. This project consists of a series of laboratory
experiments designed to examine the ways in which communication patterns in
networks are distorted by incentives to save information. The experiments will
test the hypothesis that the vulnerability of communication networks to this
type of conflict is a function of the distribution of information. Networks
should be more vulnerable when they have potentially competing centers and less
vulnerable when there is either one clearly central position or the network is
widely decentralized. The contribution of the work will be to unite social
psychological approaches to social dilemmas with sociological work on social
networks.
