This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an
innovative and versatile low-pressure injection molding (LPIM) process for the
fabrication of net-shape ceramic components. LPIM has been recently recognized
as an attractive process for the fabrication of high-precision, complex-geometry
ceramic parts. However, one major factor that limits the use of injection
molding process for production is the lack of reliability and throughput. Thus,
there is an immediate need for technologies that can substantially improve the
LPIM process. This project will utilize a low-pressure injection molding
approach for the net-shape forming of high performance ceramics reliably and at
low cost. Specific innovations include: utilizing an environmentally-safe
solvent extraction debinder technique, improving the thermal conductivity of the
current binder system, and demonstrating an improved fabrication versatility
that is relatively insensitive to material and size constraints.

The commercial benefits will be to alumina ceramic based cross-flow particulate
filtration systems for liquid waste streams; mullite based filters for hot gas
streams; NZP based engine liners; and alumina based element holders for
furnaces.
