The investigator studies arithmetical group quotients of bounded Hermitian
domains of exceptional types with the goal to find their geometric
interpretation as the moduli spaces of some special Calabi-Yau manifolds. The
cohomology of such varieties should carry additional special structures related
to representation theory of Lie groups of exceptional type. Calabi-Yau manifolds
have recently become notorious because of their important role in physics. New
ten dimensional models of the space-time proposed in the string theory contain a
Calabi-Yau manifold as an additional part to the usual four dimensional space-
time. The special Calabi-Yau manifolds sought by the investigator may appear as
the right candidates for the choice of the model of the space-time.
