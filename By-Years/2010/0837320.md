Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops innovative
learning materials for undergraduate courses in&lt;br/&gt;different domain
areas, namely, i) security in general computing applications, ii) information
security and the underlying enabling technology of cryptography, iii) hardening
of operating systems, system vulnerabilities and safe system administration, and
iv) security and intrusion detection in networks and the Internet. The project
uses WebCT, Tegrity (for capturing, storing and indexing class presentations),
and the Florida Engineering Education Delivery System (for distance learning) to
provide "Any Time, Any Place" education to students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project is developed using a modular curriculum with spiral feedback. The
learning materials are designed in a flexible way so that they can be
synthesized suitably to be used in the four courses at various levels of detail
and for students of different backgrounds. The learning materials include a rich
set of laboratory exercises and projects to enhance the subject matter of the
four courses and to assist students in learning the emerging set of new security
techniques and skills needed in today's workforce. The subject modules are
accompanied by a pool of questions to support active learning assignments and an
extensive set of acronyms and a glossary to facilitate student learning. The
development of the learning materials is enhanced by using and refining methods
derived from the existing knowledge base on undergraduate security education and
from the resources available from public course repositories.
