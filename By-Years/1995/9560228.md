This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the applicability of a novel approach to produce low cost, high conductivity,
and ultralight bipolar plates for fuel cell applications. An innovative approach
to produce conductive polymers will provide conductivities comparable to
currently used graphite bipolar plates. The fabrication technology of such a
conductive polymer will be investigated to produce net shape bipolar plates,
thus eliminating the exceedingly expensive machining of graphite plates. The
conductive polymer bipolar plates will be fully characterized and evaluated in
single cell configurations for electrochemical stability, resistivity, and gas
diffusion. The overall concept will be assessed for both technical performance
and cost for possible further development in Phase II. Conductive polymers could
offer a significant performance and cost advantage to fuel cell technologies,
such as may be required in the electric-car Next Generation Vehicle. Net shape
conductive polymer bipolar plates could be produced for this and many other
commercial fuel cell applications.
