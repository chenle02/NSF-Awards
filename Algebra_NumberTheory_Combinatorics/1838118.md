This project concerns research in number theory, which studies properties of the
whole numbers and is at the core of modern cryptography. One central theme in
number theory is to study the relationship between algebraic and geometric
objects and special values of L-functions (generalizations of the Riemann zeta
function introduced by Euler in the eighteenth century and studied extensively
by Riemann in the nineteenth century). A motivating example is the conjecture of
Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, which relates rational points on elliptic curves (one
of the simplest classes of polynomial equations) to the analytic property of
L-functions. This research project explores several topics in number theory and
aims to deepen understanding of these relationships.

The project aims to study the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and its high
dimensional generalizations, one of which is the arithmetic Gan-Gross-Prasad
conjecture for unitary Shimura varieties. The investigator previously discovered
a relative trace formula approach to study the first derivative of certain
automorphic L-functions and intersection numbers on Shimura varieties, and
recent work of the investigator and collaborator extends the idea to higher
derivatives for L-functions for the general linear group of rank two over
function fields. This research project aims to extend the relative trace formula
approach to more general settings, for instance, to L-functions for the general
linear groups of higher rank.
