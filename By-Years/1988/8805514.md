This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences. It is
for the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required by
several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for one project
alone. Support from the National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts
and contributions from manufacturers, and with substantial cost-sharing from the
institution submitting the proposal. This is an instance of university,
industrial, and government cooperation in the support of basic research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment in this project will be used in the
following research projects: (1) Calculations relating the eta invariant to
bordism and K-theory; (2) Ricci flow, spacetime smoothing, and ambitwistorial
representation of solutions of Einstein's equations; (3) Group-theoretic
algorithms and lattices over number fields and associated finite geometries; (4)
Dimensions of irreducible modules in the representation theory of simple Lie
algebras and algebraic groups; (5) Computation of the homology and cohomology of
the complexification of the Lie algebra of a real reductive Lie group with
respect to the nilpotent radical of a parabolic subalgebra; (6) Unipotent
classes of reductive algebraic groups and nilpotent orbits in their Lie
algebras; and (7) Dual geometries and their applications to generalized linear
models.
