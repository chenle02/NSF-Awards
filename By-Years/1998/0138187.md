Alfven waves and the field-aligned electric currents associated with them form
the primary basis for the electromagnetic coupling between the magnetosphere and
the ionosphere. This project will use a particle-in-cell (PIC) computer code to
perform kinetic simulations of the interaction of Alfven waves with gradients
and structures in the ionosphere. The topics to be studied include the
interaction with pre-existing density cavities, nonlinear reflections from
boundaries, modulations produced by double-layers, the generation of high-
frequency noise and the effects of cross-field plasma flows.
