The performance of an integrated circuit depends on the designers' choices and
the process engineers' decisions during the manufacture of the device. Typically
the choices and decisions are independent of each other with little awareness of
the interplay of the two engineering domains. This research develops methods for
raising the designers' awareness of the effects of circuit implementation
parameters and to sensitize process engineers to the impact of processing
decisions on the performance of the final circuit. A statistical model is
developed to correlate device and process parameters, primarily to establish
circuit performance variations on spatial and process dependencies in replicated
circuits. Circuit simulators are used to solve the resultant (huge) set of
nollinear differential equations. JUSTIFICATION
