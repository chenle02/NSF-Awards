The objective of this research is to develop a theory of ?ActionWebs?, that is,
networked embedded sensor-rich systems, which are taskable for coordination of
multiple decision-makers. The approach is to first identify models of ActionWebs
using stochastic hybrid systems, an interlinking of continuous dynamical
physical models with discrete state representations of interconnection and
computation. Second, algorithms will be designed for tasking individual sensors,
based on information objectives for the entire system. Third, algorithms for
ActionWebs will be developed using multi-objective control methods for meeting
safety and efficiency objectives. Two grand challenge applications for this
research are in Intelligent Buildings for optimal heating, ventilation, air
conditioning, and lighting based on occupant behavior and external environment;
and Air Traffic Control for mobile vehicle platforms with sensor suites for
environmental sensing to enable safe, convenient, and energy efficient routing.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research stems from a
conceptual shift of ActionWebs away from passive information gathering to an
action-orientation. This involves: modeling of ActionWebs using stochastic
hybrid systems; taskable, multi-modal, and mobile sensor webs; and multi-scale
action-perception hierarchies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the
research is in two grand challenge national problems: energy efficient air
transportation, and energy efficient, high productivity buildings, and will
tackle social, privacy, economic, and usability issues. Integrated with the
research is a program of coursework development in networked embedded systems,
across stove pipes in EECS, Aero-Astro, Civil, and Mechanical Engineering
departments. Outreach objectives include new course design at San Jose State
University, and recruiting more women researchers. &lt;br/&gt;
