Embedded systems currently rely on local and often insecure state retention for
process control and subsequent forensic analysis. As critical embedded control
systems (e.g., smart grids, SCADA) generate increasing amounts of data and
become ever more connected to other systems, secure retention and management of
that data is required. Attacks such as Stuxnet show that SCADA and other systems
comprising critical infrastructure are vulnerable to the compromise of
controllers and sensing devices, as well as falsification of data to circumvent
anomaly detection mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops
techniques and architectures for securely storing and monitoring embedded system
state in critical infrastructure. We are examining vulnerabilities relating to
generating and storing data in critical embedded systems, which are often
resource-constrained environments. We propose the design and deployment of
'autonomously secure storage devices' that act as resilient storage for embedded
devices. We are designing logging, audit, and management architectures for
resiliently storing system data and provenance in the face of malicious and
compromised devices. Additionally, we explore how this data may be disseminated
to other systems and to environments such as the cloud and aim to protect data
through privacy-preserving communication and querying interfaces, and attempt to
make data-driven inferences about system operation to detect anomalous behavior.
Through these active protections to generated data and metadata, we aim to
provide a new baseline for producing and storing data generated within critical
infrastructures.
