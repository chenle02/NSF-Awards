The objectives of this study are to examine the role that state instructional
policies play in shaping school learning environments. The PI we use a multi-
level random effects model to evaluate differences in state mathematics
instructional policy, including content standards, curriculum frameworks, and
teacher professional learning, with particular emphasis on the implications for
low income children. Examine how differences in state mathematics instructional
policy are associated with school learning environment, especially in high
poverty schools. The PI will also examine how school learning environment is
associated with classroom instructional practices. And finally, the PI will
identify the relationships between family income, parental investment, school
learning environment, and classroom instructional practices on growth in
mathematical proficiencies through the third grade.
