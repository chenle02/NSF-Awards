9406083 Vernon-Gerstenfeld This is an award to support a project to address the
emergence, current and future role of plastics in environmental engineering
practice. In addition to identifying further research needs, the investigator
plans on considering the potential role that a museum exhibit could have in
increasing public awareness of the role played by synthetic materials in
fabricating water supply, distribution, storm and sanitary drainage components
of the urban infrastructure. Special emphasis in this project is on those
components of the urban infrastructure that impact directly on environmental and
public health in contrast those that concentrate on structures such as roads,
bridges and buildings. Results of this project are expected to assist in
providing a basis for determination of research needs and thus be useful for
program planning purposes. The undergraduate student who will assist the
Principal Investigator on this project is Amy L. Fetzner. ***
