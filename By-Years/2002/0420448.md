Buffalo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: ITWF: Women and Cyber Security: Gendered
Tasks and Inequitable Outcomes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ITWF project examines
the entry, retention, and advancement of women in cyber security information
technology careers. The project involves studies on undergraduates and graduates
recipients of Department of Defense scholarships, current cyber security
professions who hold professional certification, and a group of women who are
chief information security officers in American companies. The goals are to
determine possible trends of task differentiation by gender and to determine
possible institutional interventions that can promote gender equity in the
critical field of cyber security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of
this project lies in the theoretical foundations built on existing research in
broader information technology fields and the potential to bring new insights to
the nationally important field of cybersecurity. The focus on gender differences
within the cyber security field is a largely unexplored area. This project could
produce new insights that clearly illustrate the differences in the trends and
practices in cyber security related to gender equity from those in other
information technology sub disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
of the project lie with the potential of the results to inform curriculum and
program design with colleges and universities to promote enhanced participation
of women in cyber security. The multi-faceted dissemination plan should reach
many different populations and thus provide a broad audience of potential
beneficiaries of the results. The project includes partnership with Buffalo
State College to pilot outreach activities targeted at girls in middle and high
school, thus widening the pool of females who may then actively pursue careers
that combine IT and cyber security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
