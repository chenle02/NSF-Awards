This three-year project provides astrometry of water masers in the Andromeda
Galaxy (M31), the large companion spiral galaxy to the Milky Way in the Local
Group of galaxies. The proper motion of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds
(LMC, and SMC) and M33 are already known with more or less adequate accuracy,
but the proper motion of M31 and its many dwarf companions and stellar streams
is the missing piece in the puzzle. The proper motion measurement of M31 is
necessary to get a better understanding of the dark matter distribution and
kinematics of the Local Group. The measurements can be expected to have a larger
impact on galactic research because they constrain models of the formation and
history, but also future evolution, of the Local Group of galaxies. The
observations use new capabilities of the Very Long Baseline Array, Expanded Very
Large Array, and High Sensitivity Array. The broader impacts of this work
further include training new observers to use NSF-supported facilities. The PI
integrates results from his research into the classroom and works on tools and
techniques aimed to transform astronomy courses at all levels of instruction.
This program will transform three courses spanning the range of instruction
level from traditional lectures into question-discussion-tutorial sessions.
