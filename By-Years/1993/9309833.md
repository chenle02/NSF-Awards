9309833 Sethna I propose to investigate the dynamics and pattern formation of
yield and failure in two specific sets of models, one describing fracture and
slip in elastic media, and another addressing phase slip in sliding charge
density wave conductors. In the former, I propose to study models which
incorporate both nonlinear dynamical processes and disorder. Both dynamics and
disorder are no doubt important in determining the complex structure and
response of stressed materials, but most approaches to date typically treat one
or the other. In the second class of models describing charge density wave (CDW)
conductors, I propose to study models which allow the CDW to "tear" via phase
slip processes. Theoretical and experimental evidence suggest that the noise
spectra observed experimentally in CDW's arises from such processes. Both these
problems represent sizable computational tasks, but I expect that they can be
simulated effectively in parallel architectures.
