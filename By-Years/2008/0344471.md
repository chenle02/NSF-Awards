In order for a cell to proliferate it must duplicate its genome, separate the
two sets of chromosomes at mitosis, and then distribute one set into each of the
two daughter cells. In eukaryotic cells the genome is separated from the rest of
the cell by the nuclear envelope. In animal cells the nuclear envelope is
degraded at mitosis and then reformed around each of the two sets of
chromosomes. This orderly breakdown and re-assembly of the nuclear envelope at
every mitosis depends on the nuclear lamins, which form a meshwork of
intermediate filaments that is anchored to the inner nuclear envelope by means
of integral membrane proteins. In contrast, the yeast nuclear envelope remains
intact throughout the cell cycle. As the intra-nuclear mitotic spindle
elongates, the nucleus of the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, changes
from round to oblong to dumbbell-shaped before separating into two individual
nuclei, each of which contains a full complement of chromosomes. It is not known
how the shape or structure of the yeast nucleus is maintained or how nuclear
division is accomplished. In the fully sequenced genomes of budding or fission
yeast, there are no genes that encode lamin-like proteins. The goal of this
project is to identify and characterize the proteins that are required for
nuclear structure and function in the fission yeast, S. pombe. This will be
accomplished using two complementary strategies: genetic screens to identify
proteins that are required for proper nuclear division and a genomic/proteomic
approach in which candidate proteins that localize to the nuclear envelope and
are required for nuclear division will be characterized. These studies will
answer long-standing questions regarding the structural organization of yeast
nuclei and differences between cells that break down their nuclear envelope at
mitosis and those that do not. This work will have more general applications for
understanding how membranes change shape and topology. In these respects,
nuclear division in yeast has similarities to vesicle budding from membrane-
bound organelles and to the process by which many types of cells and organelles
divide. The project will provide research training at three levels:
undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral.
