Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 120 chemists from academia and
business, chemistry education researchers, cognitive psychologists, and other
researchers in education will be attending the 9th Gordon Research Conference
(GRC) on Chemistry Education Research and Practice (CERP). The goal of the
GRC/CERP is to bring together researchers who carry out research both within and
related to chemistry education, in order to benefit the learning and teaching of
all students in chemistry courses in colleges and universities. The specific
objectives of this conference are to (a) exchange the latest research findings
and classroom results, (b) critique innovations in the methodological design of
chemistry education research (CER) studies, and (c) debate a research agenda for
CER that identifies the most critical of problems to be investigated in the next
decade. NSF support ensures the continued attendance of scholars who might not
otherwise be present at the conference. These include community college faculty,
faculty from institutions that serve predominantly underrepresented or
disadvantaged students, and young, first-time attendees such as post-doctoral
researchers and graduate students in the field of CER (Chemical Education
Research). The conference's success in achieving its goals depends upon active
participation of these scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
