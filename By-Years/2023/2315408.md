This award funds research that uses economic theory and on the economic and
environmental consequences of “non-traditional” environmental policies designed
to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. While most economic studies of carbon
reduction policies have focused on taxing fossil fuels, this research project
focuses on policies that subsidies for the production of renewable energy and
mandates for the use of clean energy. The research will use theoretical
modelling, a large data set, and innovative empirical methods to investigate how
subsidies and mandates can be designed to reduce emissions at the lowest cost to
economic growth and efficiency compared to other forms of fuels. In addition,
the project will estimate the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act as well as
the impact of the Clean Power Plan on both carbon emissions and economic growth.
The results of this research project will provide major inputs into policies to
reduce carbon emissions, while spurring economic growth and establish the US as
a global leader in carbon reduction policies.

This award funds a research agenda to study the efficiency of carbon reduction
policies other than those that tax fossil fuels. The project will develop and
estimate a quantitative, dynamic model of the macroeconomy and the environment
to test the efficiency of “second best” carbon policies. The model extends the
standard modeling framework in two ways: first, it will allow the price
elasticity of energy demand to differ in the short-, medium- and long-run
because of the differential effects of carbon and subsidies for renewables on
the price of energy; in addition, the model will incorporate the value of public
funds raised from carbon taxes. The researchers will use a large data set and
different econometric methods to estimate the model and compare it to the
results from emission tax policies. The estimates will then be used to analyze
recent policy proposals such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the Clean Power
Plan. The results of this research project will provide major inputs into
policies to reduce carbon emissions, while spurring economic growth and
establish the US as a global leader in carbon reduction policies.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
