This five year project, sponsored by Grand Valley State University, provides
support each year for 20 teacher interns to work in local businesses and
industry in science and technology positions. Based upon this experience the
teachers are expected to design mathematics and science activities for their
students which reflect the themes of (1) relevant science, mathematics and
technology, (2) problem solving, (3) teamwork, (4) communication and (5)
motivation and quality. The teacher interns will also team up with
administrators from their school system to explore these same five themes in
regular industry training sessions at industry sites. Drawing upon this
experience the teacher/administrator teams will design appropriate inservice
activities for other educators in their own school. The teachers are expected to
carryout outreach activities and recruit their colleagues to the project. These
workshops will be run jointly by teacher interns and their industry partners and
will introduce educators to the world of industry through the eyes of industrial
science and math professionals and the experience of teachers who have
participated in summer internships. NSF funds are being matched by funds from
the University, local schools and local business and industry. The amount of
matching funds exceeds 124% of the NSF grant.
