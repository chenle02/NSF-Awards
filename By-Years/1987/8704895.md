Funding is provided for the acquisition of a 32-bit superminicomputer needed to
perform the extensive computations associated with a laboratory measurements of
the vortical structure of turbulent flows. This addition will introduce more
flexibility in data storage, and transfer via a local area network connection.
Networking capability and additional desk storage will also be implemented on
the data acquisition system to improve its versitility during experiments. The
system will also be used to implement for digital image processing techniques
and flow visualization measurements.
