9724823 Grossman This Americas Program award will support a cooperative research
project on the modeling and solution of nonlinear optimization problems that
involve discrete and continuous variables. Collaborators are Dr. Ignacio
Grossman, Carnegie Mellon University, and Dr. Jaime Cerda, Universidad Nacional
de Litoral, Argentina. The major goal of the project is to investigate a new
modeling and solution approach that is based on the idea of representing these
optimization problems through the use of logic propositions and disjunctions
involving Boolean and continuous variables. The specific objectives include
theoretical characterization of these problems, development of algorithms for
disjunctions with multiple terms, implementation in the software package LOGMIP,
and numerical testing as well as comparison with algebraic mixed-integer. The
project should yield new and powerful tools for non- linear discrete
optimization, and advance the state of the art in non-linear modeling and
optimization methodologies for Process Systems Engineering. It will benefit the
technical process industry of both the US and Argentina. ***
