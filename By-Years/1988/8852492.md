This project will enhance new experimental laboratory courses in inorganic-
organic and physical chemistry. Starting with the basics, the program begins
with C,H,N analysis, extends beyond the first year level with work on organic
synthesis and inorganic synthesis using controlled atmospheric techniques, and
utilizes spectroscopic techniques such as UV-visible and IR spectroscopy.
Physical chemistry experiments involving microwave spectroscopy and a molecular
beam apparatus are at the heart of modern physical chemistry. This ILI award
from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Chicago to acquire a CHN Aanalyzer, a glove box,
IR, UV and microwave instrumentation, HPLC equipment, and equipment for a time-
of-flight apparatus. This instrumentation will be used to enhance undergraduate
laboratory instruction and to further chemistry curriculum development.
