The 1970s saw the first sustained and systematic studies of engineering ethics
in the U.S., the first efforts to encourage engineers to collaborate with
scholars from the social sciences and humanitis in such studies, and the first
efforts to educate engineering students about ethical issues. This project will
break new ground by planning and developing an Engineering Ethics Training
Seminar. Faculty from the humanities and engineering will develop a two-day
seminar designed to introduce engineers to moral reasoning, moral theories and
concepts, and alternative models of professional responsibility of engineers.
The seminar will be tested with four groups of practicing engineers in Missouri.
It will continue to be offered after the project period, and a plan for
identifying and involving national societies in undertaking similar programs for
their members will be developed. Project faculty will develop and distribute
seminar materials to participants prior to the seminar. The first day will
concentrate on moral theories and their application to case studies; the second
day will discuss models of engineering responsibility and their application to a
major case. Preseminar and seminar materials will be packaged and distributed to
teachers and researchers in engineering ethics. This project provides a model
for future efforts in ethics education for engineers. The investigators are
extremely well qualified; institutional support and cost-sharing are excellent.
Results are likely to be widely distributed and advance the field substantially.
Support in the amount of $31,386 is recommended.
