9353232 Hall This planning grant will aid Delaware in writing a teacher
enhancement proposal to address their middle school science needs. A process has
been described that includes Delaware's SSI project; outside consultants, and
Middle school teachers in defining the needs and direction for middle school
science. Specifically, meetings will be held, survey tools will be developed to
evaluate the current status of science in middle schools, and teachers will hold
community meetings to explain the need for science education reform and obtain
input on the proposed direction for middle school science. The planning grant
will involve at least 30 middle school science teachers. The project duration is
12 months beginning June 1993 and ending June 1994. There is no cost share for
this project.
