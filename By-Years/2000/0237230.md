A grant has been awarded to Dr. Virginia Weis of Oregon State University and
Dr. Douglas Green of the La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology to examine
programmed cell death, or apoptosis, in the beneficial symbiosis between a sea
anemone, a cnidarian, and its singled-celled algae resident within its tissues.
Apoptosis is a fundamental life process and has been well-characterized in
higher animals but relatively poorly studied in more primitive groups such as
cnidarians and algae. Weis and Green will describe apoptosis at the molecular
and biochemical levels in the anemone/algae symbiosis. They will identify and
characterize genes in these primitive organisms that are closely related to
those found in higher animals, including humans. Finally, new state-of-the-art
genetic techniques will be used to block the correct functioning of apoptosis
gene products. This approach will help determine the role that apoptosis genes
play in the regulation and maintenance of coral/algal symbioses. Apoptosis plays
an important role throughout the lives of all animals. Numerous signals trigger
the activation of a complex cascade of events that results in the rapid and
orderly death of cells. Interest in apoptosis in the last decade has led to an
explosion of information on the critical role of apoptosis in animal (including
humans) development, aging, stress, and disease. To date, however, few
investigators have focused on apoptosis in primitive animals. Understanding the
evolutionary origin of apoptosis will provide valuable insight into the
complexities of this process in vertebrates and humans. The sea anemone/algae
symbiosis is closely related to the symbiotic relationship that comprises reef-
building corals, and is an ideal model for the study of threatened corals.
Corals form the trophic and structural foundation of the entire reef ecosystem
and are therefore of fundamental ecological importance globally. Coral reefs are
disappearing at an alarming rate worldwide, due in large part to the phenomenon
of coral bleaching, which results from the breakdown of the coral/algal
symbiosis. The cellular and molecular nature of bleaching is only beginning to
be explored and apoptosis has been implicated as one possible mechanism of
bleaching. The investigation of apoptosis in a cnidarian/algal symbiosis will be
a first step towards a achieving a long-term goal of determining the role of
apoptosis in coral bleaching.
