The authors proposed objective is to prepare small (less than 10 nm)
nanoparticles of well-ordered (chemical order parameter, S, greater than 0.9)
intermetallic magnetic materials to demonstrate that the extension of
nanotechnology to these types of materials is possible and to generate further
research interest in nanoparticles of intermetallic materials in general. The
intellectual merit of this proposal would be a significant advancement of
nanoscale science by the preparation of well-ordered, small nanoparticles of
intermetallic phase materials, specifically both ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic materials, which could be widely used as a basis for further
research by others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current authors expect that their
nanoparticle processing approach will eliminate the known difficulties
encountered by others. However, the exploratory nature of the proposed research
is fully realized when it is considered that the desired ordering may simply not
be thermodynamically favored for the smaller
nanoparticles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed work are
several. The potential of small, well-ordered L10 intermetallic (FePt or CoPt)
nanoparticles to benefit the magnetic storage industry has already motivated a
significant research field, in spite of the lack of success noted above. A
feasibility demonstration of well-ordered small nanoparticles having nearly bulk
phase magneto-crystalline anisotropy and the expected high ( 10 T) coercivity
would provide a renewed impetus to the field and potentially contribute to the
societal benefit of high-density magnetic data storage. Both graduate and
undergraduate student participation at the primary academic research site, and
more limited student participation at a storage industry research site are
expected to have an educational benefit.&lt;br/&gt;
