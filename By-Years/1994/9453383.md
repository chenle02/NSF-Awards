This research concerns the design and implementation of autonomous agents, that
is, of computer programs that have sustained interactions with a dynamic,
incompletely predictable environment, examples being mobile robots, factory
control programs, and programs for database consistency management. To
facilitate the design and construction of very sophisticated autonomous agents,
it is important to develop appropriate program specification techniques,
planning algorithms, and learning methods, and these tasks have formed the focus
of the researcher's previous work. Areas to be emphasized in the continuing
research are the integration of learning methods with pre-programmed strategies
and the integration of low-level, reactive methods with higher-level planning
approaches. In addition, some technical problems of reinforcement learning will
be studied. One of these will be the effect of preprogrammed knowledge and
structure on the learning process. Another will be efficient learning where
relevant aspects of the environment are inaccessible to the agent's sensory
systems. Planning in stochastic domains will also be explored.
