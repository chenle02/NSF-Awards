This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants,
especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the
international conference "Frontiers in Complex Dynamics" that will be held from
February 21-25, 2011, in Banff, Alberta, Canada.

This conference will focus primarily on topics in the theory of holomorphic
dynamics in one and several variables (e.g., dynamics and parameter spaces for
higher dimensional holomorphic dynamics; renormalization, local connectivity,
and area of Julia sets; iterated monodromy groups and laminations) but will also
include talks on related areas. The unifying theme of the conference is the
impressive body of work that John Milnor has contributed to the field, helping
to make it one of the richest, most beautiful, and most active research areas in
analysis. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample
opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference
activities.
