Tong A research program on the use of single stuck-at-fault test sets (SSFTS) to
detect multiple faults and their combinations in CMOS VLSI circuits is being
planned. Preliminary results are being simulated and extended to more complex
fault conditions. Also, circuits under consideration are being expanded from
combinational to sequential circuits, both synchronous and asynchronous. A fault
model that permits use of both voltage and current in detecting faults is being
formulated.
