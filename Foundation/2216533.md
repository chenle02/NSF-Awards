The project lies at the interface of logic and analysis, more specifically, of
descriptive set theory, measured group theory, graph theory, ergodic theory,
probability theory, and operator algebras. In recent years, mathematicians in
these fields have come to realize that problems concerning algebraic, dynamical,
and descriptive structural complexity of countable group and equivalence
relations can be fruitfully studied via descriptive combinatorial and graph
theoretic means. The principal investigator and collaborators have employed this
combinatorial perspective to create new tools used to answer several open
problems in these fields. This research project aims to generate more new
general tools and to promote fruitful interactions among these fields.

The PI proposes to study problems around descriptive set theory and its
specific interactions with orbit equivalence relations, cocycle superrigidity,
treeability, inner amenability, weak equivalence and weak containment, and
rigidity/anti-rigidity. The PI's research in these areas has already prompted a
wealth of interesting and fundamental questions which intersect a variety of
fields including descriptive set theory, measured group theory, graph theory,
ergodic theory, probability theory, and operator algebras. Research into these
questions will reveal further surprising connections between these fields.
