This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop mid-
infrared (IR) quantum cascade lasers based on type-II indium arsenide/gallium
anitmonide/aluminum antimonide (InAs/GaSb/AlSb) quantum well structures. These
lasers emit radiation in the mid-IR region, enabling commercial products in
fields including chemical sensing, medical diagnostics, and industrial process
controls. The wavelength of Sb-based quantum cascade lasers can be tailored over
a wide spectral range due to the large conduction band-offset between InAs and
AlSb. In addition, because of the band-gap blocking in type-II quantum well
structures, electron injection efficiencies near 100% can be achieved without
requiring Bragg reflector layers. Another advantage of this material system is
the small electron effective mass in InAs, contributing to reduced phonon
scattering rates. Hence, the inter-sub-band quantum cascade lasers based on
type-II InAs/GaSb/AlSb quantum well structures are excellent candidates for
compact, reliable, efficient mid-infrared light sources operating at room
temperature. Phase I will involve the design, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
growth, characterization, and optimization of InAs/GaInSb/AlSb quantum cascade
lasers to demonstrate their feasibility of operation at low threshold current
and at ambient temperatures (or at temperatures accessible with a thermoelectric
cooler). High performance mid-IR quantum cascade lasers would be developed in
Phase II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first mid-IR semiconductor lasers are
expected to operate under continuous wave (cw) conditions at ambient
temperatures. This would enable commercial products in several fields including
chemical sensing. One example is detection, at the parts per billion (ppb)
level, of formaldehyde and related compounds for medical diagnosis purposes.
These laser sources will potentially find other commercial and defense
applications.&lt;br/&gt;
