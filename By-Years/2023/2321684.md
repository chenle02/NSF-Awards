This project facilitates new regional collaborations in middle Tennessee
centered on artificial intelligence (AI) for imaging. A primary goal of these
planning and coordination project is to facilitate connections between research-
focused institutions and minority serving institutions by hosting community
events, training and tutorial workshops for students, and sharing computational
resources for both pedagogy and research activities. Through the Mid-TN AI for
Interdisciplinary Imaging Interpretation Alliance (AI4A), the project
identifies, characterizes, and enables drivers of imaging AI science and the
capacity for such science across the AI4A.

A critical component of this project is the development of human infrastructure
and interconnections. AI4A hosts summer faculty fellowships to seed
collaborations, and summer student opportunities to engage with pre-doctoral
trainees in collaboration with existing REU programs such as the Fisk Bridge NSF
REU. AI4A develops training materials for the technical skills required in AI-
imaging, including GPU computing, deep learning concepts and practice, and
current computing environments for high performance computing. AI4A also
provides access to these devices and environments to support research
collaborations and to provide practical experience for students in the
development and validation of large models. The project facilitates the
emergence of de novo research directions, but based on the current research foci
of participants, and based around imaging problems in radiology, neurology and
neuroscience, cell microscopy, ecology and remote sensing, transportation,
materials engineering, archeology, digital anthropology, and deep networks.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
