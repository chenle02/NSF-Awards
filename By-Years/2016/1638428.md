Some studies have shown that high levels of stress hormones in animals are
linked to lower reproductive success and survival ("fitness"). Other studies
have found that higher stress hormone levels may be beneficial. In wild animal
populations it is often hard to measure fitness and correct for other factors
that affect hormone levels. This RAPID project will support immediate collection
of stress and survival data for several capuchin monkey groups in Costa Rica.
These monkeys are currently experiencing the environmental effects of a strong
El Niño climate pattern. The opportunity to study a well-monitored monkey
population during a stress event (El Niño) that affects all individuals is rare.
The project will provide new data on how an individual's past and present
hormone levels relate to their fitness. The researchers support graduate
training of individuals from underrepresented groups in the STEM sciences. The
project also includes science outreach activities in Costa Rica and the United
States, and primate conservation efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
test the cort-fitness hypothesis, which suggests that higher glucocorticoid
hormone levels will be associated with reduced fitness. Currently, a very strong
El Niño event is causing unprecedented mortality among a habituated, well-known
population of white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus) at Lomas Barbudal
in Costa Rica. This event presents the opportunity to test whether elevated
glucocorticoids increase or decrease survival in wild capuchin monkeys subjected
to a catastrophic stressor that affects all individuals. Longitudinal behavioral
and fitness data and fecal measures of glucocorticoids will allow for an
individual-level approach, correction for several other variables known to
affect glucocorticoids in wild primates, consideration of past and present
hormone levels for the same individual and in comparison with others, and
assessment of infant mortality and maternal hormone levels.
