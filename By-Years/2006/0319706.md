This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
Speech Gesture Interface for Interventional Procedures (SGIIP). The sterile
environment found in interventional radiology and cardiology suites presents
unique challenges for motion control. Spoken words and hand gestures potentially
provide a very intuitive way to control devices in this environment. The
proposed work will leverage the team's past experience in speech/gesture
interfaces and medical devices. In the Phase I project, Domain experts in
radiology and cardiology will aid in the design of an experimental test-bed for
interventional cardiology. In the follow on Phase II project, this test-bed will
be refined and integrated with commercial interventional systems.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of biomedical devices
and instrumentation. The proposed SGIIP system, when commercially deployed, will
significantly impact the way radiologists and cardiologists interact with the
interventional devices, leading to improvements in safety and efficiency.
