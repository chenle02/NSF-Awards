0245397&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will go
in three different directions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1] Methods of the theory of
dynamical systems for the analysis of solutions of equations of hydrodynamics:
The existence problem for the 3D-Navier-Stokes system remains a challenge. The
theory of dynamical systems can help to find new directions for
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2] (3x+1) - problem and other number-theoretic
dynamical systems: These&lt;br/&gt;are long-standing and easily formulated
problems. The goal is to find hidden structures which can help to get a progress
in the analysis of typical orbits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3] Problem of adiabatic
piston: It is one of popular problems in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
Methods from ergodic theory and probability theory can be
useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory if dynamical systems is an
interdisciplinary branch of mathematics which has many applications in physics,
engineering, biology, etc. It is assumed that it will be applied to some
problems in hydrodynamics, number theory and non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics. In all cases I intend to work on several central problems in each of
these cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
