Rutgers University, in cooperation with Princeton University, AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories (Bell Labs), and Bell Communications Research (Bellcore) has
established a Science and Technology Center for Discrete Mathematics and
Theoretical Computer Science. The Director of the Center is Professor Daniel
Gorenstein of Rutgers University. The Center in Discrete Mathematics and
Theoretical Computer Science strengthens the development of these two
overlapping areas by focussing research activity in a continuing series of year-
long research programs, workshops and conferences. Approximately on hundred
researchers from the four collaborating conferences. Approximately one hundred
researchers from the four collaborating institutions provide the background
coherence and direction for this activity. The core of the research activity is
carried out by a vigorous program of visitors (both senior and junior) from
other institutions (academic, industrial, government laboratory). Postdoctoral
fellows and graduate students are affiliated with the Center for varying lengths
of time. Each year, the Center designates specific areas for special attention,
inviting leading experts in the designated fields to organize a research program
in those areas of concentration. These areas are chosen to take advantage of the
expertise of the participating personnel from the collaborating institutions
while addressing questions of demonstrable interest to researchers in both the
discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science communities. Within these
general guidelines, there are several avenues of potential emphasis that involve
both serious theoretical inquiry and relevant application. For example, our
modern "information society" depends on clear, efficiently designed and reliable
telecommunications and communications systems. These are easily described by
network theory and can be modeled using linear programming techniques.
Transportation problems require similar techniques; and optimization and linear
programming, possibly enhanced by parallel computations, are critical in VLSI
design and manufacture. Discrete and computational geometry are foundational
disciplines for computer graphics and robotics. As the geometries required for
the applications become increasingly more complex, research in computational
geometry becomes ever more important. Yet there are fundamental questions in
discrete and computational geometry that must be addressed before the
applications can be realized.
