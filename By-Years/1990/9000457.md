This dissertation will investigate information-seeking behavior by newcomers to
organizations. Five primary tasks must be accomplished before a newcomer can
become an insider--task mastery, role clarification, acculturation, and social
integration. Information is essential for accomplishing these tasks. It is
argued that newcomers who initiate the exchange of information will adjust more
rapidly and more effectively than those who passively wait for information to be
delivered. In this study, 250 newly hired auditors in five large accounting
firms will complete written surveys assessing information seeking and various
facets of socialization at three time points. The results will contribute to
understanding the newcomer in socialization processes. Socialization research
has traditionally focused on organizational activities, and newcomers have been
portryed as fairly passive recipients of organizations' influence. This
dissertation will make an important theoretical contribution by focusing on the
role of information, and information transmission, in the socialization process.
Further, it will enhance our understanding of information seeking, particularly
the different forms of seeking and the implications that this activity has for
the seeker.
