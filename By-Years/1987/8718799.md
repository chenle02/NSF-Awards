This project is designed to investigate the symbiotic relationship between
chemoautotrophic bacteria and their marine invertebrate hosts. Experiments will
be designed to study the metabolic capabilities and genetic make up of the
bacteria symbionts and to determine the evolutionary relationships of the
symbionts to known autotrophic bacteria. Attempts will also be made to determine
whether the bacteria-like organisms found within the invertebrate, Solemya
velum, are capable of autonomous existence. This study should contribute to our
understanding of the mechanisms where by animals live autotrophically in
sulfide- rich habitats.
