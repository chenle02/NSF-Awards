Title: February Fourier Talks 2012&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
support for the seventh meeting in the February Fourier&lt;br/&gt;Talks (FFT)
series. The 2012 FFT will be held February 16-17, 2012, at
the&lt;br/&gt;University of Maryland, College Park. The FFT is a high-level
forum for&lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysts to bring their work to scientists from
industry and&lt;br/&gt;government agencies. In addition it allows experts in
applied and pure&lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysis to get familiar with the latest
problems in need of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical formulation and solution. Finally, it
introduces young&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and scientists to applied and pure
harmonic analysis. More&lt;br/&gt;information, including a list of speakers and
abstracts, registration&lt;br/&gt;information, and an archive of past
conferences, can be found at the&lt;br/&gt;conference webpage:
www.fft2012.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The February Fourier Talks directly
encourage dialogue and collaboration&lt;br/&gt;between mathematicians and
scientists working in industry and government.&lt;br/&gt;The structure of the
conference consists of three main lectures and sixteen&lt;br/&gt;30 minute
invited talks. The conference encourages and financially
supports&lt;br/&gt;participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and
members of groups &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented in mathematics.
