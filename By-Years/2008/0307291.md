AST-0307291 Haiman This project will develop observational diagnostics that,
when applied to future data, will lead to an understanding of how and when the
first generation of stars and quasar black holes emerged in the universe, and
what impact these sources had on the proto-galactic gas between redshifts six
and thirty. There are three main thrusts, all at the frontiers of current
research: 1) what physical processes determine the nature of the first sources
of light, 2) how did the earliest massive black holes form, and 3) when and how
was the Universe reionized. The results of this research, from semi-analytical
and numerical techniques, concentrating on observational tests capable of
distinguishing between competing theoretical models, will be indispensable in
the interpretation of the results from a wide array of current and planned
ground-based and space-based instruments.

Much of the work will be carried out by a graduate student from an under-
represented group, and the project will strengthen ties between the
geographically separated institutions involved in the collaboration. Research
results will also be incorporated in the many and varied public outreach
programs of the Hayden Planetarium. ***
