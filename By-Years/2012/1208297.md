This project provides funding to support the participation of US researchers in
the two-week long research school Senegal Workshop on Geometric Structures and
Control Theory that will be held at the University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar
(Senegal) from May 7 to May 18, 2012. The workshop will explore recent advances
in symplectic geometry, contact geometry, sub-Riemannian geometry, as well as
hyperbolic geometry, with a special emphasis on the interplay between all these
aspects of geometry and applications to control theory. More information about
the program can be found at the website: http://cimpadakar2012.ucad.sn/

The purpose of the meeting is to bring together experts and young researchers
working in geometry and control theory. The workshop introduces graduate
students and young researchers to current research topics in geometry and
control theory. In addition, it provides an opportunity for international
collaboration between researchers and encourage cross fertilization between
different relevant topics.
