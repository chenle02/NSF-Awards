The goal of this research is to develop new algorithms for allocation and
control of network resources. The proposal focuses on three topics: 1. Rate
based flow control. The research will concentrate on the class of algorithms,
the researchers call switch-point adjustment, in which the switching elements in
the network take note of the flow currently passing through them, assign a
maximum rate to each flow, and pass that information back to the end- points. 2.
Congestion constraints. Emphasis will be placed on developing specific
congestion controlling techniques that place agreed upon constraints on either
the network or the nodes or both. 3. Buffer management within the network.
Research will include the study of the architectural alternative of large
buffers within the network, and exploration of a possible fairness algorithm and
transport protocol suitable for sending short transmissions that can be
constrained rather than controlled.
