The Integrated Photonics Research Topical Meeting will be held April 13-15,
1992, New Orleans, Louisiana. The Integrated Photonics Research meeting, held
for the first time in March 1990, is an annual topical meeting covering the
subject areas of the previous topical meetings on Integrated and Guided-Wave
Optics, Nonlinear Guided-Wave Phenomena: Physics and Applications, and Numerical
Simulation and Analysis in Guided-Wave Optics and Optoelectronics. The
Integrated Photonics Research meeting will cover all aspects of research in
integrated and/or guided- wave photonics. Topic areas include: Photonics Devices
and Circuits; Nonlinear Guided-Wave Phenomena Modeling, Numerical Simulation,
and Theory; and Physics, Materials, Technology, and Characterization. Each of
these areas will be represented by a subcommittee of the program committee.
