Crystal and the Crystal Run-time System will make the use of large-scale
multiprocessors practical for real-world problems. Crystal is a very-high-level
language in which a user program resembles a concise, formal mathematical
description. Crystal is easy to use yet has the modularity and freedom from side
effects that is critical for the automatic detection of parallelism. Messages
need not be passed explicitly, and the Crystal compiler automatically does task
decomposition. When the pattern of computations in a section of the program is
known at compile time, a direct mapping of the algorithm in question may be
performed. When the pattern of computations is fully determined only at runtime,
the compiler constructs a symbolic representation of the data dependencies. The
runtime system will use this symbolic representation to aggregate the required
computations. When enough regularity is present it will create a parameterized
mapping scheme. Using knowledge of target machine characteristics, the runtime
system will choose the appropriate instance of the mapping scheme and
dynamically map the computations onto the target architecture.
