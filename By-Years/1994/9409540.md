Statistics and econometrics are mainly concerned with the quantitative
measurement and analysis of real world phenomena. Typically, it is assumed that
the data for the variables of interest are available and are measured
accurately. In reality, errors of measurement are common because of reporting
errors or because behavioral responses are in part determined by unobserved
characteristics of agents; thus the variables of interest are latent or
unobservable. This project is concerned with developing an analytical framework
to extract information from data that is subject to either random or systematic
measurement errors. The objective is to refine the methodology to establish
empirically valid inferences from imperfectly measured data. In particular, we
shall study issues of (i) random measurement errors in time series data that
contain (stochastic) trends; (ii) systematic errors due to biased or exaggerated
responses of sample respondents or grouping of individual observations into
categories for the sake of confidentiality or convenience of collecting data;
(iii) extracting information on the implicit market for characteristics (or
attributes) from the "hedonic" approach developed by economists to simplify the
analysis of differentiated products and quality changes over time; and (iv)
modeling unobserved individual characteristics in panel data analysis which
directs its focus on individual outcomes.
