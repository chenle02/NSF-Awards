This project deals with the use of a group of antibodies called anti-idiotypes.
These antibodies recognize specific receptors, which are the mechanism by which
hormones and transmitters recognize and stimulate specific cells. The receptors
involved in this study are ones which recognize the brain hormones vasopressin
and corticotropin releasing factor. The major work to be done involves
demonstrating various characteristics of these antibodies including specificity,
binding ability, and the methods needed to apply them in histological sections.
Receptors are an extremely important group of proteins in the body; the
successful use of anti-idiotype antibodies to study their structure and function
represents a significant advance in biological sciences.
