Although ocean margins cover only 5% of the ocean surface, they play a
disproportionate role in ocean productivity. Of particular interest is the
14,500 km2 of estuarine wetlands that border the Gulf of Mexico, about 2/3 of
which are intertidal salt marshes. Very little is known about the magnitude and
fate of organic matter that originates in coastal marshes and enters the coastal
ocean. While "outwelling," or flux of organic carbon from land to sea, of
significant amounts of organic carbon was hypothesized over 25 years ago, little
progress has been made in quantifying this potentially significant source. In
this study, researchers at Florida A&M University will continue their research
to combine discrete biogeochemical and hydrologic measurements together with
modeling to quantify salt marsh derived dissolved organic carbon flux to
offshore Gulf of Mexico waters. Results from this study will provide the first
quantitative estimates of dissolved organic carbon outwelling fluxes from salt
marshes, resulting in a better understanding of the coupled terrestrial and
oceanic carbon cycle.

Broader Impacts: As intertidal environments have declined rapidly over the past
century due to human pressures, ever-smaller quantities of terrestrial organic
matter are available for the formation and export of dissolved organic carbon to
the ocean. Results from this research will provide the data to accurately
evaluate the importance of these intertidal ecosystems, and help to inform
policy on conserving these habitats. In addition, this project will provide a
broad range of interdisciplinary learning opportunities for a diversity of
students in middle through graduate school. The researchers will collaborate
with COSEE-Florida, COSEE-New England, and Watershed-Integrated Sciences
Partnership (GK12) programs to conduct outreach to the community.
