PI: Guasto, Jeffrey &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1554095
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER proposal is focused on the investigation of
how the material properties of viscous fluids affect the motion of cells. The
goal is to contribute insights into the broad field of cell transport, and to
understand how different physical processes affecting the swimming of cells can
regulate a host of diverse biological functions. The results of this research
could have an impact on multiple fields, including public health, ecology,
engineering and medicine. Phenomena that are important to the treatment of
fertility and the mechanisms of spreading of disease will be
investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most prior work in this area has been
focused on cases of swimming in Newtonian fluids (aquatic environments mainly),
and ideally shaped swimmers, this is a proposal to investigate the swimming of
real bacteria cells and in non-Newtonian fluids, like cervical mucus. The
development of a novel nano-scale experimental technique, based on high speed
imaging, for the monitoring of the motion of each individual cell is also
proposed. In addition to graduate and undergraduate student training, a new
outreach program (STOMP) will be developed in collaboration with Tufts Center
for Engineering Education and Outreach that will be based on using high-speed
imaging.
