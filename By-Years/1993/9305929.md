Crystal equilibrium and growth problems involving anisotropic surface energy
and/or mobility will be investigated, with and without diffusion. New
theoretical frameworks for considering such problems will be developed, as will
new algorithms and computer programs for computing their solutions. In
particular, the crystalline approach will be further developed and applied to
new problems. In this context, variational problems often become finite
dimensional, and parabolic partial differential equations for surface motion
become systems of ordinary differential equations. The general context for this
work is geometric measure theory.
