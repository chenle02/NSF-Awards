9505332 KELLEY Global change research has highlighted the need for integrated
analyses of the complex interactions among different human and natural systems.
In order to examine these interactions and to relate fundamental studies to the
concept of global sustainability, an intensive summer study will be undertaken
in 1996 by the Pacific Basin Study Center of San Francisco State University. The
study will bring together international experts in the social and natural
sciences as well as policy makers from a number of nations. It will focus on the
concept of sustainability, seeking to clarify the nature of interactions among
different systems, through an evaluation of rice production. In addition to
examining social and economic aspects of rice production, related natural
systems like soils and water will be studies. This study will receive major
support from the Environmental Protection Agency. This award provides modest
support from NSF to assist in planning efforts. This study should provide new
insights into the complex dynamics of rice production in the Pacific Basin,
thereby advancing understanding of the ways through which environmental and
economic sustainability might simultaneously be pursued. This project also
provides a mechanism to enhance cooperation between NSF and EPA in the joint
pursuit of mutual goals.
