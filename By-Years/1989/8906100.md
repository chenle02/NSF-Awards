This award will enable Prof. Gerald W. Feigenson of Cornell University to
collaborate with Prof. Kazuhiko Kinoshita at Keio University in Yokohama, Japan
for a period of one year. They will continue investigations of membrane
properties that are influenced by doubly- ionized calcium, and in particular the
role of doubly ionized calcium in bridging biomembranes prior to fusion.
Experiments will be performed on sea urchin eggs, which are readily available
and easily stimulated to produce the processes to be studied. Low-light
fluorescence microscopy will be used to measure the time dependence of the
formation and breakdown of the calcium-ion-induced gel phase at membrane contact
regions. The purpose of this research is to clarify the role of the calcium ion
in cell movement, cell division, metabolism, and other cell- interaction
processes. While it is known that changes in cytoplasmic calcium ion
concentration can greatly affect these phenomena, the mechanisms of the effects
are unknown. This work has major impli- cations for the understanding of organic
chemical reaction dynamics. Dr. Kinoshita's expertise and the equipment at his
disposal will be assets to Dr. Feigensn's proposed collaboration.
