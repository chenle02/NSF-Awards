ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;ITWF Program - FY04&lt;br/&gt;CNS 0451269 PI Eileen Trauth,
Pennsylvania State U.&lt;br/&gt;Title ITWF/EWF PI Conference
2004&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pennsylvania State University has received an ITWF
award to organize an ITWF and ITR/EWF Principal Investigators' Workshop to be
held in Philadelphia in October, 2004. The workshop will foster intellectual
discussion on the under-representation of women and minorities in the
information technology (IT) workforce and in IT education.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the workshop is provided by
incorporating throughout the planned program, presentations and discussions on
the under-representation of women and minorities in the IT workforce and in IT
education. There are numerous opportunities for PIs and Co-PIs studying these
and related areas to meet, discuss and work together on these important topics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A goal of the ITWF program is to encourage
multidisciplinary work on the under-representation issue. The broader impact of
this workshop lies in the opportunities for a significant number of scientists
from IT disciplines, the social sciences and education, to share information on
multiple projects related to this goal, which in turn will help spread this
information among more groups of researchers. In addition, a conference
proceedings, including summaries of each of the participants' projects will be
made available to workshop participants and also as a PDF file on the Web for
broader dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;
