This research is aimed at investigating the applicability of magnetic resonance
imaging techniques to resolve micron sized surface flaws produced in ceramics
materials during the finishing operation of diamond grinding. Flaws in the size
range from 5-20 microns are currently not resolvable by existing nondestructive
methods. The impact of this research, if successful, could be the development of
a quality assurance method for use in the production of mechanically reliable
ceramic components, as well as a useful characterization tool for gaining better
fundamental understanding of ceramic grinding processes.
