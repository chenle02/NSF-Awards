This work by the University of Illinois Chicago particle physics group is
focused on improving our understanding of the Universe at the smallest scales,
allowing us to probe nature?s basic symmetries and their relation to our
fundamental understanding of mass. By precisely measuring the properties of the
newly discovered Higgs boson with the CMS detector at the LHC, key insights will
emerge into how electroweak symmetry is broken and the fundamental property of
mass. Other topics that this research will explore include searches for
manifestations of supersymmetry and exotic new phenomena beyond the Standard
Model involving strong dynamics. Enabling tools and methods for this research
include their work on hardware and software development for CMS. The group also
has an established Quarknet outreach activity in Chicago-area high schools.
