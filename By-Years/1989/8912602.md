An effort to develop standardized seismic testing procedures for steel
structural components is made in this project. Because of the variations in
loading histories for past experiments, there is no valid measure of performance
existing which is applicable for analysis and design purposes. The procedures
developed by Professor H. Krawinkler of Stanford University will be reviewed and
guided by an expert panel in this project to determine their applicability in
seismic testing and design.
