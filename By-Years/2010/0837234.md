Engineering Mechanical - (56)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GENIUS Innovation
laboratory project is working to increase the engineering design and build skill
sets of Mechanical Engineering students in the College of Engineering,
Architecture, and Computer Sciences at Howard University. This project
integrates additional design-build experiences into the curriculum. The benefit
of increased exposure to design-build activities has been demonstrated
successfully by several consortiums of universities including the MEEP
consortium (Learning Factory model), and the CDIO Initiative started by MIT.
This project supports the purchase of Rapid Prototyping (RP) equipment and the
integration of this equipment into core courses, particularly within the
Mechanical Engineering curriculum. The Innovation Lab combines established
facilities such as the PACE Computer Aided Design Lab, the Mechanical
Engineering Machine Shop, the Fine Arts Model Shop, and the newly formed Design
and Manufacturing Studio. Establishment of the GENIUS Innovation laboratory at
Howard University allows the integration of practice-based curricular activities
that have been successfully implemented at Penn State University, University of
Washington, and others using the Learning Factory model.
