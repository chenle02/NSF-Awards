9319994 Berliant The location of consumers, producers and marketplaces is in a
state of transition. We need tools, models and conceptual frameworks to address
the most important questions concerning the economic role of cities. Why do
cities form where they do? What are the driving forces behind the formation and
growth of cities? The answers to these questions are clearly relevant to urban
policy decisions, but before these applications can be made, relevant theories
that answer these basic questions must be developed. This research attempts to
fill part of this need by extending two basic models of location to the point of
obtaining a conceptual framework for analysis and then using this framework to
answer some of the critical questions.The analysis treats prices and quantities
of goods produced and consumed as endogenously determined. The endogenous
location of consumers, producers, and especially marketplaces will be
highlighted. After obtaining existence of a stable (equilibrium) state of the
system and studying its efficiency properties for each model, the work is
extended to analyse the effects of changes in policy variables. The empirical
part of the study uses simulation exercises to find equilibrium for special
cases. ***
