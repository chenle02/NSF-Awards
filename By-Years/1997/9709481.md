Project Abstract Adaptive sampling is a sampling design in which the selection
of units in the sample may depend on the values of the variable of interest
observed during the survey. The sampling intensity may be increased in the
vicinity of high observed abundance with an adaptive sampling method. The method
provides an efficient way of sampling when the population has a clustered
structure and is also applicable to clumped or aggregated distributionsas as are
often found in sampling plants, animals pollution sites and certain problems in
epidemiology. Without making specific assumptions about the distribution of the
population, various estimators had been proposed for adaptive cluster sampling.
(In adaptive cluster sampling, an initial sample of units is selected and
whenever the value of the variable of interest satisfies a specified condition,
the neighbouring units are added to the sample.) These estimators are unbiased
and can be used in very general settings. However, in those cases where we do
have existing prior information about the population of interest, it may be
possible to derive more efficient estimators using a Bayesian analysis. Also, a
Bayesian analysis yields one distribution (the posterior distribution) for the
unknown parameters, and from this distribution a large number of questions can
be answered simultaneously. For instance, one can obtain accuracy measures for
the estimates with little extra effort. In this project, we are going to use a
Bayesian approach for estimating the population total, which is an important
practical problem.
