The PI will open and pursue several new areas of research in random walks on
graphs. Among them are expected time for a random walk or Brownian particle to
cover all the edges of a network; coupling of random walks in order to avoid
collisions; strategies for searching and patrolling graphs; and some new ideas
on "mixing time," that is, the time required for a random walk to reach a random
state.

The random walk on a graph has been a fundamental construction in discrete
probability. The concept has numerous applications in computer science and
statistical physics, and a strong connection to the theory of electrical
networks. The proposed work has additional possible applications to disparate
fields such as software design and policing; it brings game theory, as well as
combinatorics and probability, into the random walk picture.
