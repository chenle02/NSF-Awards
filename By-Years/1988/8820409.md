Dr. J. David Robertson and his colleagues are investigating the physiological
processes underlying learning and memory, using the common octopus as an
experimental subject. This animal is an ideal choice for a simple model system,
since it has the most highly developed brain of all known invertebrates. It is
likely that the basic principles found to operate here will also be applicable
to higher (vertebrate) species as well. The basic approach is to study the
morphological effects of tactile learning on the octopus brain by the use of
electron microscopy (EM), comparing brains of trained and untrained animals.
Naive animals are taught a touch learning paradigm, e.g., to accept a grooved
and reject a smooth rod. It is assumed that small cellular changes occur with
learning, and that these changes can be detected by EM techniques. In
particular, Dr. Robertson believes that new synapses are formed with learning,
and that the first step in this synapse-formation process is an extension of
minute finger-like projections (filopodia) of neurons, resembling those extended
by neurons in tissue culture. The extension of growth cone filopodia depends on
the polymerization of the protein molecule, actin (rather than upon protein
synthesis). The drugs cytochalasin-B and -D can both reversibly interfere with
actin polymerization. If Dr. Robertson's theory is correct, these drugs should
also cause a reversible loss of learning ability without altering previously
established memories. The three main goals of the present project are: 1) to
demonstrate that this treatment does indeed cause a reversible block of learning
without interfering with previously-established memories, 2) to show that the
numbers of filopodia increase during learning and decrease during periods of
quiescence, and 3) most importantly, to reveal that the numbers of filopodia are
significantly decreased in brains that have been injected with the cytochalasin
drugs. Ultimatedly Dr. Robertson will attempt experiments with other drugs, such
as nerve growth factors (that are known to promote filopodial extension in
growth cones), and be able to show that this treatment increases learning
ability. The general principles discovered should help in understanding ways to
improve learning and memory ability in humans, and perhaps have implications for
the alleviation of memory impairments such as those seen in afflictions such as
Alzheimer's disease.
