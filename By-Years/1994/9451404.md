9451404 Wing This proposal describes current revisions being made in the
laboratory portion of Biol 322 Genetics. The Genetics course is required for all
Biology majors. The enrollment in the Genetics course has, over the past six
years, been approximately 50% women while our graduates over the same time
period have been only 45% women. The revisions being made in the Genetics lab
are designed to promote cooperative learning experiences which are frequently
more positive educational experiences for women than traditional pedagogical
methods. It is hoped that the combination of cooperative and investigative lab
experiences provided in the Genetics lab will encourage more women to stay in
the discipline of Biology. In order to give students the opportunity of working
on projects related to the area of molecular genetics, equipment in addition to
what is currently available in the department is required. Thus, this proposal
requests matching funds for the purchase of six horizontal electrophoretic
systems, six vertical electrophoretic systems with appropriate power supplies,
densitometer, and transluminator. Also requested are three microcentrifuges,
pipets, incubators, water baths, and vortex mixers needed for the isolation and
preparation of samples for electrophoresis.
