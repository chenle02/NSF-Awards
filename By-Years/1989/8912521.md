This project focuses on research in multibody dynamics, and addresses
computational issues therein. It is directed toward improving computational
procedures in three ways: 1) by developing more efficient and more accurate
analysis procedures and algorithms; 2) by developing consistent approximation
procedures; and 3) by developing improved methods for applying the technology.
The research is motivated by a desire to address problems in robotics,
biosystems, flexible structures, cable dynamics, and colliding system dynamics.
Despite rapid advances in multibody dynamics, there remains a great deal to be
done. Disagreements exist regarding the best method for obtaining the governing
dynamical equations, how redundant and constrained multibody systems are to be
studied, how to incorporate flexibility effects into the analyses, and how to
use supercomputers and parallel processing in multibody analysis. Kane's
equations of dynamics will be used in this project. They are amenable to
efficient automatic generation of the dynamical equations, and useful in
studying constrained and redundant systems. They also have advantages for
systems with flexible members. This research proceeds on five fronts including
the use of absolute angular velocity components as generalized speeds, automated
modelling, impact analysis, subcomponent analysis of small mass portions of the
system, the use of orthogonal complement and projection methods, development of
Class VI computer procedures, and the use of animated computer graphics.
