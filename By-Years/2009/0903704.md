The primary focus of this project is to strengthen the Science Department and
implement an associate level degree that would provide an educational foundation
for students wishing to pursue careers in environmentally sustainable
industries. This is not enough as many students entering the college struggle in
STEM courses. Therefore we must target the local school systems through a
variety of outreach programs to address weakness in these areas. Math literacy
is perhaps the greatest problem and will receive special consideration at all
levels.&lt;br/&gt;Student preparedness is not only depended on be taught high
quality classes, but also requires students to take advance courses in math and
science. As these courses are typically electives this project addresses this
situation, in addition to increasing the overall interest in STEM.
