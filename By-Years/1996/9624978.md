9624978 Pruitt The broad objective of this CAREER development award is to
develop a strong, well-integrated research and educational program focused at
the understanding of structure-property relationships in advanced engineering
materials with special emphasis on advanced polymers. The focus will be on
ultra- high molecular weight polyethelene, because of its importance in
biological applications, and the evolution of its structure and mechanical
integrity as a result of post- sterilization aging. The educational plan will
integrate the research into curriculum development and undergraduate research
opportunities leading to a strong multidisciplinary curriculum in the area of
mechanical behavior of advanced materials, including the implementation of new
courses in polymer engineering and biomaterials. ***
