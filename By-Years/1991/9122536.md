This research aims to prepare and characterize rigid carbon clusters known as
"Fullerenes". These new compounds will be hollow molecular spheres consisting of
pi-conjugated carbon atoms attached to various functional groups and a large
variety of elements to yield novel molecular solids. Due to the high symmetry,
electronic character and functional design of these clusters, it is expected
that these molecular solid-state materials will exhibit unprecedented condensed
matter properties.
