The "Strategic Plan to Enhance STEM Education and Research at AAMU" is an
innovative, comprehensive, and focused approach to strengthening STEM education
at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (AAMU). We will implement the
STEM Education and Research program by enhancing the quality of education,
mentoring students to improve graduation rates of STEM undergraduates, improving
the Fundamental Engineering Exam passing rates for engineering graduates,
increasing the recruitment and retention of STEM students, expanding research
opportunities for faculty and students, enhancing existing STEM curricula for
undergraduate STEM students, and providing professional development for STEM
faculty.&lt;br/&gt;To achieve our goals, we propose to develop a tutoring
program for engineering students to strengthen students' basic skills in STEM
areas and prepare them for the Professional Engineering License exam, develop a
STEM-SI Peer Tutoring (Supplemental Instruction) program, develop a Summer
Bridge Program to prepare incoming STEM students, develop a Summer Sophomore
Mathematics Program for STEM Gatekeeper courses, enhance STEM curricula by
creating a series of advanced interdisciplinary courses, expand undergraduate
research in all STEM related disciplines, organize a set of faculty development
workshops on the integration of cyberinfrastucture resources such as video
podcasts and facebook groups, and provide STEM related seminars with prominent
scholars from institutions of higher education and industry.&lt;br/&gt;We are
aiming for a reduction of attrition in lower level undergraduate gate-keeping
courses, an increase in the number of under-represented minority students
matriculating in and graduating from STEM fields, an increase in student
participation in interactive discovery based undergraduate research, and an
increase in the passing rate of the Professional Engineering License exam.
