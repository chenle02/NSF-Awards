0967646&lt;br/&gt;McMahon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the
Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program supports work to use
a systems biology framework to understand the behavior of an engineered
ecosystem. The ecosystem is a wastewater treatment process designed to
biologically remove phosphorus from sewage in order to protect surface waters
from excessive nutrient inputs. The organisms responsible for phosphorus removal
(called Accumulibacter) use a unique and complex metabolism that is poorly
understood. In this project, we will use novel techniques based in meta-omics to
study gene expression at the level of the entire bacterial community in a
laboratory scale wastewater treatment system. The integrative and holistic
approach provided by systems biology will allow us to understand how different
species of Accumulibacter regulate their biochemical pathways to maximize
phosphorus removal from water. Finally, we will construct a computational model
that can predict how the Accumulibacter metabolism functions under normal and
perturbed conditions. This understanding will improve our ability to predict
when and why wastewater treatment systems fail, but it will also serve as a
powerful case study in the application of systems biology tools to bacterial
communities that are engineered using ecological principles.
