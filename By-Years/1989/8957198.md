This research is concerned with control theory and its applications. It focuses
on two areas of current theoretical interest including vibrational and robust
periodic feedback control theory for systems governed by functional and partial
differential equations, and adaptation criteria and adaptive control algorithms
for such systems. The first topic addresses systems characterized by the
transport of matter and/or energy or the transformation of information. Models
of such systems typically involve space derivatives and time delays. This class
of systems include plasmas, nuclear and chemical reactors, transmission lines,
mechanical systems with fluids, and combustion systems. For such systems,
conventional time invariant feedback and feedforward control laws cannot
guarantee the desired control performance. The concept of vibrational and
periodic feedback offers some hope of improved control for these systems. For
the second topic, the use of asymptotic and geometric techniques for reduction
of system complexity, and the use of knowledge based rules will aid in the
design of finite dimensional adaptive controllers of systems described above.
The theory developed in both of these studies will be tested in an advanced
control laboratory.
