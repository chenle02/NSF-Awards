This award supports travel for participants in the "Conference on Hyperbolic
Conservation Laws and Continuum Mechanics," held 12-14 May 2011 at Brown
University. The workshop brings together leading theorists in conservation laws
and in continuum mechanics, and aims to stimulate work at the interface between
these fields and to inform young researchers about recent developments in the
area.

The workshop will enhance communication among junior and senior researchers in
conservation laws and continuum mechanics. Conference proceedings will be
published in the Quarterly of Applied Mathematics of the American Mathematical
Society. The conference encourages and supports participation by graduate
students, junior researchers, and members of under-represented groups.
