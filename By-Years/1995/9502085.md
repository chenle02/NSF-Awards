9502085 Hautala The deep water mass exchange between the South and North Pacific
through the Samoan passage will be quantified by conducting an hydrographic line
between Fiji and Tahiti across the Samoan passage and the Pehring basin. Water
temperature, salinity, nutrients and dissolved oxygen will be extracted from
water samples collected every 30 nautical miles. This experiment is a component
of the one-time hydrographic survey of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE).
