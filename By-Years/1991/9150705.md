The goals of this project are to provide non-scientists with a deeper
understanding and richer insight of biology, as well as provide the skills
necessary to better assess and apply science in their lives. Knowledgeability,
skills, and enjoyment of students enrolled in the course are promoted by placing
biological principles within a more relevant context that complements the needs,
experiences, and learning styles of the non-science majors. Novel laboratory
experiments and in-class discussions are utilized to develop problem solving,
higher order thinking, communication, and collaborative skills. To facilitate
this process, innovative approaches utilizing active and cooperative learning,
and new delivery systems (videodisc, videomicroscopy, and computers) are
incorporated as part of the instructional strategy. The changes in course
context, approach, and delivery are accompanied by ongoing assessment and
training of teachers.
