Baruch College is developing experiments in wave phenomena, with emphasis on the
acoustics of speech signals. The rapid development, low cost and ease of
operating data acquisition equipment makes it feasible for students to use this
technology at the introductory level. The instrumentation consists of personal
computers, data acquisition boards, microphones and signal processing software.
The versatility of the human vocal tract as a broad band generator of complex
acoustic wave is the focus of most of these experiments. Students who take the
courses in which these experiments are done are mostly business majors or majors
in other areas. The college will match the award with an equal amount of
funds.//
