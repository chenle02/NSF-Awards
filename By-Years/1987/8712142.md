The goal of this project is to produce a mathematical model of the urban
segregation process that incorporates both residential mobility behavior at the
micro-level and urban structural factors at the macro-level. The model will be
calibrated and evaluated using residential mobility and housing data from
Dusseldorf, West Germany. When the model has been calibrated, the effects of
policy interventions designed to affect segregation patterns will be simulated.
Professor Huff's research will yield increased understanding of the ways
residential segregation is created and maintained through social, economic, and
geographic mechanisms that influence the ethnic mix of households moving into
and out of small areas within cities.
