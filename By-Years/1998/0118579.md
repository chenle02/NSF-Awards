This project focuses on characterizing the water-insoluble component of size-
segregated atmospheric aerosols. This can be a significant fraction of the
aerosol and consists primarily of carbonaceous material or minerals (dust). The
insoluble fraction could affect human health, can influence the
hygroscopic/cloud nucleating properties of the aerosol, and can deposit on
leaves and thus decrease the amount of radiation available to the plants for
photosynthesis and thus crop production. A novel technique will be developed to
measure the number concentration of the insoluble aerosol in real time. In
addition, aerosol samples will be collected on micro-orifice impactors, the
filters rinsed, and the mass of the insoluble component determined for each size
fraction. The trace metal composition of the insoluble fraction will be
measured, and the elemental and organic carbon fractions (EC/OC) quantified.
Field measurement data will be used to study the impact of insoluble aerosol on
plant photosynthesis due to the scattering and absorption of solar radiation by
insoluble aerosols deposited onto leaves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
