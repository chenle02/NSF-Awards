CTS-9424392 Przybycien RPI A Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer will
be acquired and used for several projects dealing with interactions of proteins
with surfaces. The projects dealing with interactions of proteins with surfaces.
The projects include membrane separations, biofouling, chromatography and drug-
delivery systems. In particular, the equipment will provide information on the
surface properties of bulk materials including films and particulates, the
surface chemistry of coatings and polymeric materials, and the behavior of
adsorbed macromolecules such as proteins and polysaccharides. Additional
projects involve sol-gel surfaces and combustion products. The equipment will
benefit a variety of on-going projects related to biotechnology.
