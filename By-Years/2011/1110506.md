This doctoral dissertation improvement project will study how climate warming
affects the movement of carbon dioxide from soils in boreal forests to the
atmosphere. In particular, it will test whether warming affects the
decomposition of decay resistant organic matter more than that of easily
decomposed organic matter. This work will provide a more complete understanding
of the processes by which organic carbon is sequestered in or released from
boreal forest soils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased movement of carbon dioxide
from terrestrial soils to the atmosphere in response to climate warming
represents a potentially important feedback to climate change. Understanding the
fate of soil carbon and how it is affected by warming temperatures is important
for improving models of greenhouse gas inputs to the atmosphere.
