The objective of this study is to develop an in situ wear measurement system
which monitors the gamma rays escaping from a previously activated surface
layer. Phase I of the research has identified several feasible methods for
producing activation depths which would allow an accurate and precise wear
measurement scheme. The purpose of the Phase II research is to determine the
most feasible technique and to address the issues of reproducibility, the actual
accuracy of the measurement, and calibration.
