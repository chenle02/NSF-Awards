This project supports the procurement of equipment needed to enhance research
on the active control of structural vibrations. The equipment comprises a real
time feedback control system and a vibration test data acquisition system. It
supports two research projects. The first is an experimental investigation of
controller design for regulating space structure vibration with specific focus
on the precision pointing of spacecraft in which structural vibrations dominate
the attitude dynamics. The research tests the hypothesis that high performance
structural controllers must come from iteratively linking modeling and control
design. The second project experimentally tests a new optimization theory of
actively controlled aircraft wing design associated with lightweight highly
maneuverable aircraft. Scale model wings designed with embedded actuators and
sensors will be controlled to deform to produce lift in novel way which does not
depend on conventional aileron actuators.
