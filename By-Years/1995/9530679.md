9530679 Bose The periodic analysis of the security of a power system is done to
ensure the ability of the power system to withstand contingencies. Such on-line
analysis requires, in principle, the checking of the effects of hundreds of
disturbances on the power system. The checking of the post-disturbance steady
state of the power system for these contingencies requires only the handling of
algebraic equations (albeit in large numbers and with nonlinearities), and such
static security analysis (SSA) is now routinely done on-line. However, checking
for instabilities during the disturbance itself requires the handling of
nonlinear differential equations in addition to the algebraic equations, and the
computation required for this dynamic security analysis (DSA) is about three
magnitudes higher than that for the SSA. Thus, on-line DSA is still in its
development stage although experimental prototypes have been implemented. This
proposal is for examing the important aspects of this problem and developing new
approaches for its solution. ***
