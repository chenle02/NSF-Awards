Ethics and Values Studies joins with the Anthropology Program in supporting this
project that examines value dimensions in the interactions of technology and
society. It is commonly believed in the United States that the quality of life
in rural and small towns is preferable to that found in large urban areas. The
objective of this research is to compare the quality of life for individuals who
work in small machine-tool companies located in rural, semi-rural, and urban
areas of western Pennsylvania, and to ascertain what factors contribute to the
degree of satisfaction that these individuals have with their lives. An in-depth
ethnography of the small machine-tool companies in the region will be developed,
including a survey of workers' satisfaction with their jobs, leisure,
communities, and lives in general. Research methods will include traditonal
anthropological field techniques, including observation, interviews, and the use
of key informants, as well as the experience sampling method, local and regional
surveys, and the use of written and physical stimulus materials in sorting and
ranking tasks. Results will include presentations at professional society
meetings, book chapters, and articles in a wide variety of journals. This
research will further knowledge of quality of rural and urban life,
technological development in rural and urban areas, the influence of automation
on work and worker satisfaction, and the relationships among work, leisure,
community, and life satisfaction of employees of these shops. The investigators
are very well qualified; and the research design and methods of collection and
analysis are very sophisticated. Results will be of interest to a broad
audiences of policymakers as well as academics. Support is highly recommended.
