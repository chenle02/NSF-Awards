The purpose of this interagency agreement is to provide funds for the
participation of NASA's ER-2 research aircraft and the requisite personnel for
the Central Equatorial Pacific Experiment (CEPEX). This experiment is scheduled
to take place in March 1993 in the tropical Pacific. The ER-2 will fly at
approximately 60,000 feet (above the clouds) and will serve as the observational
platform for a suite of instruments that will obtain measurements of radiation,
moisture, ozone, and various cloud thickness.
