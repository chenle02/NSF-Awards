The goal of this proposal is to design, test, and deploy a "pilot" web site that
is a hybrid web portal/virtual community to increase communication among members
of the PAESMEM community and make their work more accessible to the general
public. It is intended to enhance the periodic PAESMEM awardees' meetings by
providing a forum for continued interaction and to serve as a repository of the
meetings' products.
