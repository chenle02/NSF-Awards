This study explores the conjecture that students can develop STEM understanding
and interest in STEM using computational tools to participate in professional
practice. The investigator hypothesizes a chain of reasoning in which a)
computational tools make it possible for students to engage in meaningful
projects; b) such projects connect students to the norms, activities and
patterns of interaction in communities of professional practice; c) the
resulting processes of reflective practice develop students' understanding of
fundamental STEM concepts and skills; and d) this process, in turn, creates
progressively larger and more stable islands of STEM expertise. The project will
use design research to test these hypothesis. Students will use the Digital Zoo
to model the practice of biomechanical engineering to learn physics and biology
by designing virtual creatures. Ecology 2020 would be used to solve urban
planning problems. The education plan consists of working with high school
students in an after school program; developing undergraduate and graduate
courses and working with graduate students in the research.
