The Institute of Statistics and Decision Sciences at Duke University (ISDS) will
purchase four high-performance graphics workstations with double buffered 3-D
accelerated graphics, one file server with 26Gb ultra/wide scsi hard disk, and a
high-performance 100Mbps Fast Ethernet switch. The equipment will be dedicated
to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. It will be used for
several research projects in spatio-temporal statistical modeling including:
Dependent spatial point-process models; Interactive design of experiments for
spatial/temporal data; Statistical models for automated image understanding; and
Multivariate dynamic models in complex stochastic systems.
