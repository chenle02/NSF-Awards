Mital This is a follow-up workshop on the role of ergonomics and humans in the
design for manufacture and the operation of advanced manufacturing technology
systems. The first workshop was held on November, 1993, at the University of
Cincinnati, Ohio. At that conference, a number of objectives were pursued,
including the exploration of the role of humans in advanced manufacturing, the
identification of research issues relevant to human performance and efficiency
in a hybrid manufacturing systems, and the prioritization of research needs
identified. Another key objective was to use the results of the workshop to
prepare a report which NSF can use as a guide to focus and prioritize on
research funding needs in the area of design of hybrid manufacturing systems and
design for manufacture. The objective of the current workshop is to complete
some unfinished work at the first meeting. Specifically, the aim is to convert
the research issues identified in the earlier workshop into specific problem
statements that can be disseminated to researchers in the field. The effective
use of humans in the operations of high technology, high investment
manufacturing systems is critical to maintaining the up times of such systems
and consequently, improve their economic viability and competitiveness. The
workshop will help provide some insights on what the critical problems are in
man-machine systems, It will also provide a better understanding of the research
obstacles that must be overcome to see notable progress in the area.
