Deployment of an uplooking infrared radiometer aboard the USCGS Polar Star
"Cruise of Opportunity" in June-July 1997 is proposed. The field objective is to
record downwelling longwave radiances from the arctic sky using a high-
resolution interferometer. Temperature-controlled blackbody sources coupled to
the interferometer provide absolute calibration of the downwelling radiance
(Watts m-2 cm Sr-1). Spectra will be recorded at several zenith angles in order
to assess the vertical distribution of trace gases, temperature, and water vapor
of the boundary layer. The specific analysis goals are to extract (i) cloud
microphysical proprieties (cloud emissivity and equivalent particle size), (ii)
total column concentrations of infrared-active trace gases, and (iii)boundary
layer vertical profiles of temperature and water vapor concentration. These data
will later be analyzed for information relevant to the radiative balance and
chemistry of the arctic atmosphere.
