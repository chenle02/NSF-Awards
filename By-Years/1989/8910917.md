Random graphs are encountered in a number of disciplines: pure and applied
mathematics, biology, computer science, engineering, etc. Several models have
been considered and a number of questions have been answered for each model.
This research investigates establishment of a unifying framework within which
all these models can be treated. The framework proposed is that of Generalized
Euclidean Random Graphs in which a link's probability of existence is a function
of the Euclidean distance between the nodes which the link connects. The
research considers a number of questions related to the probabilistic behavior
of such graphs, such as connectivity, network diameter, Euclidean length of
links, length of minimum path lengths, etc. Whenever possible, analytical
methods are used to find exact solutions. When analysis falls short, bounding
and/or approximation techniques is used, verified by computer simulations, to
obtain bounds and/or approximate answers. The impact of this research should be
significant. As the vast literature on graph theory suggests, graph theory has
penetrated a large number of scientific and engineering disciplines. We are only
now beginning to understand the behavior of random graphs. The additional
structure that the distance imposes will allow an entire collection of new
problems to be modeled by these graphs. Therefore, besides the theoretical
interest, this research promises to be of great interest to a very diverse set
of scientists and engineers that will be able to use the results of the
research, as well as stimulate new areas of research.
