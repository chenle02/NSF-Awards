This Ethics Education in Science and Engineering project will articulate an
ethical foundation for sustainability and develop materials for delivery to
graduate students in engineering, the sciences, and the design professions.
Because sustainability ultimately rests on ethics, this is a crucial link in
extending sustainability from a mere intellectual exercise to a much wider
incorporation into virtually every sector and field of endeavor. The first year
of the project will involve a full development of an ethics of sustainability
that will be based on a framework of nine principles proposed by the PI. The
second year will involve the design of a dissemination system and three delivery
systems for use by any institution. These three delivery systems will be tested
and refined at the University of Florida as part of a Masters Degree program in
Sustainable Construction and as part of the Continuing Education delivery system
at the University of Florida. It is expected that four graduate students will be
engaged in the concept development in the first year and four graduate students
will be involved in the design of the three delivery systems. The results of the
research will be tested at the University of Florida via several delivery
systems, addressed to both graduate students and professional development, and
disseminated to other universities for use in their technical education
curricula.
