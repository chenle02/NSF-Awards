ABSTRACT NARRATIVE Description: This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr.
David Pines, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Dr. Ali Alpar, the
Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK). Project funding
will allow Dr. Alpar three six-week visits to Dr. Pines' laboratory and one two-
week visit by Dr. Pines to Dr. Alpar's laboratory. This collaborative research
effort is for theoretical study of the internal structure and dynamics of
neutron stars. Scope: This proposal will bring together research scientists from
the universities of two countries working in the area of neutron star dynamics.
The further refinement and re-evaluation of theories concerning the rotational
behavior of neutron stars is the primary objective of this US-Turkey scientific
collaboration. It is anticipated that a review article on superfluidity in
neutron stars will result from this effort. This proposal fulfils objectives of
the Science in Developing Countries Program in its exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.
