The problem of model uncertainty has recently received widespread attention in
financial mathematics. On the application side, this is due to the recent
financial crisis where overconfidence in models played an important role. On the
mathematical side, the reason is that an abundance of interesting connections to
other areas have emerged; in particular, optimal transport, stochastic analysis,
nonlinear partial differential equations, Skorokhod embeddings, nonlinear
expectations, decision theory, and quasi-sure analysis. In this project, the
investigator studies how model uncertainty influences the fundamental tasks of
pricing, hedging and investment in financial markets. Students are included in
the work of the project.

The first part of this project is concerned with the pricing and hedging of
financial derivatives under model uncertainty. If both the underlying security
and liquid options are used as hedging instruments, the superreplication
principle yields sharp and robust bounds for derivatives prices that are
consistent with the market data, without making excessively strong assumptions
about model dynamics. Moreover, this approach yields a robust hedging strategy
to manage the associated risk. In a mild idealization where a continuum of call
options can be traded, superreplication is intimately linked to a Monge-
Kantorovich optimal transport problem, namely, a transport between the marginal
laws of the security. The no-arbitrage principle of finance imposes a
probabilistic structure on this transport, which leads to the so-called
martingale optimal transport problem that is studied vigorously in this project.
The investigation leads to the computation of worst-case scenarios and hedging
strategies, and is also of great interest to probability theory and analysis. A
second part of the project is dedicated to understanding the impact of model
uncertainty on the optimal portfolio choice for an investor such as a retirement
fund. A third part, again related to the pricing of derivatives, studies a
problem of financial engineering: How does one algorithmically construct market
models that are consistent with quoted option prices as observed in financial
markets? More precisely, the project shows how to build a risk-neutral model
that is calibrated to a given set of liquidly traded instruments, not
necessarily of plain vanilla type. Students are included in the work of the
project.
