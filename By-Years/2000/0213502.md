The PI proposes to use functionalized, fluorinated allenes to develop new
fluorinated ring construction methodologies. They will first prepare a number of
mono and difluoroallenes. The metallation, alkylation and substitution reactions
of these compounds will be investigated followed by a study of their use in
cyclization reactions to prepare both fluorinated heterocycles and carbocycles.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Gerald B. Hammond of the University of
Massachusetts at Dartmouth. Dr. Hammond and his student co-workers will study
the preparation and reaction chemistry of a number of organofluorine molecules
known as fluorinated allenes. Many pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals are
organofluorine containing molecules and this group will be devloping new
synthetic groutes to these types of molecules. Students trained during the
course of this work will gain experience in synthetic organofluorine chemistry
and be acquiring skills needed by the pharmaceutical and agrochemical
industries. &lt;br/&gt;
