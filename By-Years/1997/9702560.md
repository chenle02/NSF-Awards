9702560 Karbhari This research is aimed at the integrated investigation of the
effects of interphase formation through fiber sizings and finishes on the
processing of composite, in particular, in the fabrication of large structural
components such as in civil infrastructure. The outcome of this study could
develop a fundamental science base for advanced microstructural control of
composites through interphase tailoring. The activities of this project will be
balanced by an education plan to improve the quality of graduate and
undergraduate education at the University of California-San Diego.
