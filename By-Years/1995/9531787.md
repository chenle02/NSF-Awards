9531787 Mavrovouniotis This project is aimed at the development and
implementation of systematic techniques for the thermodynamic analysis of
biochemical reactions and pathways. This proposal has three components: (1)
determination of the standard (biological) Gibbs energy of formation of any
biochemical compound from its structure, based on contributions of groups; (2)
determination of the standard (biological) Gibbs energy change and the
equilibrium constant of a biotransformation, from groups that occur in the
metabolites involved; and (3) a technique that translates thermodynamic
limitations to limitations on bioreaction rates, allowing the interpretation of
the potential effect of thrmodynamics on observable parameters. ***
