A workshop will be convened to discuss infrastructure needs over the coming 5-10
years in support of Earth surface processes research. Understanding how Earth's
terrestrial surface functions and evolves in response to changes in climate, sea
level, vegetation, uplift/subsidence, and human influence is of broad
importance, not least because this is where humans live. Research in this realm
is underpinned by a range of infrastructure that includes instrumentation,
experimental facilities, analytical capabilities, data and modeling resources,
computing capacity, and more. Infrastructure needs evolve over time as new
capabilities and new pressing questions emerge.

The workshop will bring together a diverse group of experts that spans the
breadth of surface processes science to assess how the research community's
needs will evolve in the coming decade. The workshop will draw on recent NRC and
other prominent community documents to highlight the Grand Challenge science
topics that would rely on this research infrastructure. The workshop outcomes
will be discussed at major science meetings and a white paper and article will
be produced to broadly disseminate the ideas.
