Relaxations and diffusion play important roles in many branches of science,
technology and engineering. Relaxation phenomena occur in physics, biophysics,
chemistry, materials science, metallurgy, rheology, glass sciences, polymer
(biopolymer) physics and engineering, fiber optics, opto-electronics and
electronics. It is the primary concern in basic physics as well as in very
practical applications. The 6th International Discussion Meeting on Relaxations
in Complex Systems (IDMRCS) is the premier international meeting dealing with
the above subjects. The funding provided in this grant by NSF will support U.S.
Ph.D. students, post-doctoral fellows and junior faculty to attend the meeting
and to participate through oral and poster presentations. The IDMRCS forum
provides these young researchers with the opportunity to interact with
internationally known researchers, which is important for career development. In
addition, benefits to all supported participants can be expected from cross-
field fertilisation among the multiple disciplines represented at the 6th
IDMRCS.
