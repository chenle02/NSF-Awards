This project takes advantage of the metabolic quiescence of hibernating arctic
ground squirrels to study how nutritional needs are translated into neural
signals. The overall research plan is aimed at deciphering how the biochemical
pathways that convert food to cellular building blocks converge with those that
lead to the synthesis of neural signaling molecules, specifically, the
neurotransmitter glutamate. Aside from its direct aims, the project outcomes
will have significant relevance to our understanding of the impact that climate
change and nutrient availability have on a vulnerable Arctic species and to our
understanding of nutritional responses and metabolic balance in many organisms.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will involve Alaska Native students and
outreach activities for the local community. As well, new and advanced
technologies and instrumentation will be introduced into training and research
programs at this EPSCOR state University. All data generated from this project
will be made publicly available in a data repository at ftp://www.brains-
hibernation.iab.alaska.edu.
