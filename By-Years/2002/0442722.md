NSTA requests funding for a conference to be held in Seattle, Washington on
November 17, 2004, to disseminate current NSF-funded programs and research
findings on the integration of literacy in K-8 science teaching and learning.
The conference would feature several NSF-funded projects presenting their recent
findings on implementation designs, research and effective professional
development practices to an audience of teachers, principals, supervisors and
professional development providers. The conference goals include 1) providing
practitioners and policy makers with scientifically-based research on
appropriate and effective integration of literacy in the K-8 science curriculum,
2) exploring the multiple roles of literacy in science instruction, 3)
illustrating effective strategies for preparing teachers to link science and
literacy and 4) highlighting examples of best practice in science-literacy
integration. The program would include plenary sessions and three-hour
workshops. Several publications featuring articles by key conference presenters
and a summary of research data will be released by NSTA following the
conference.&lt;br/&gt;
