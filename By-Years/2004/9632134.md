9632134 Traniello Termites are among the most abundant and important insects in
many ecosystems, owing to their ability to digest cellulose and recycle the
nutrients that are found in leaf litter, humus and dead wood. And because of
their wood-eating habits, termites have great economic impact as they are
responsible for over $600 million dollars structural damage annually in the
united States alone. In spite of their great ecological and economic
significance, the biology of termites is poorly understood. There are two
features of termite behavior and ecology that appear to have been pivotal in
their evolutionary history and thus critical to understanding their biology.
First, they are social, forming colonies of potentially millions of individuals.
Second, they nest in soil and decaying wood. Their nest environments are rich in
microbes such as fungi and bacteria, some of which may be agents of disease and
mortality. Indeed, termites appear to be highly susceptible to many pathogens.
We believe that these two elements of termite biology - social life and disease
susceptibility - may be linked. Research into the ecology of disease, along with
research on the evolution of physiological and biochemical mechanisms that allow
termites to resist infection at both the individual and colony level, will
provide important insights into termite social evolution. As a consequence of
this research we will understand more about the nature of termite pathogens,
their transmission within a colony and the ways termites cope with disease. This
will in turn allow us to identify the natural vulnerabilities of termites that
might be exploited to control them and thus limit their destructive potential.
Moreover, studying termite pathogens and disease resistance may result in the
development of novel, environmentally safe methods of termite control, as well
as the isolation and chemical characterization of natural antibiotics that could
have medicinal value.
