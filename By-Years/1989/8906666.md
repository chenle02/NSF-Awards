The objectives of the proposed research is to use polymerase chain reaction
amplification of DNA (pcr) in conjunction with base sequencing to identify
ectomycorrhizal fungi competing for colonization sites on the root systems of
white pine seedlings. At present, only two or three ectomycorrhizal fungi can be
identified on the basis of ectomycorrhiza morphology since the taxonomy of these
fungi is based on characteristics of the reproductive structures, e.g.,
mushrooms, truffles. A reliable means of identifying fungi from ectomycorrhizae
and hyphae is needed if the importance of fungi in major ecosystem processes,
e.g. decomposition, nutrient absorption of trees, alteration of community
composition by pathogenic fungi, etc., is to be determined. Although the fungi
to be studied are native to the area and not genetically engineered, the results
of introducing a known fungus into the soil and verifying recovery of the same
fungus by DNA fingerprinting will be directly applicable to experiments
introducing genetically engineered microbes.
