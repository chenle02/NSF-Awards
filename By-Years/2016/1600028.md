This research project studies a class of partial differential equations that
describe physical phenomena including water waves, plasmas, and gravitation. The
complicated nature of the solutions to such equations often precludes complete
mathematical analysis, and applications rely on numerical approximations. This
project studies the solutions of these equations rigorously and recovers
quantitative and qualitative information about their behavior as mathematical
theorems. The project involves graduate students and postdoctoral associates in
the research and fosters collaborations with researchers in related fields,
including physics and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies
the solutions of several quasilinear dispersive partial differential equations,
including water-wave models in two and three spatial dimensions, the more
general case of two-fluid interfaces, and the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations of
general relativity. The main problems under study concern the global stability
of the equilibrium solutions of these equations and the construction of
solutions that become singular in finite time. The project aims to contribute
new methods and tools to this dynamic field.
