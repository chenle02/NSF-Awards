The 9th International Symposium on Affinity Chromatography and Biological
Recognition will meet in Yokohama, Japan in October, 1991. This symposium, now
in its 18th year, is the biennial meeting of investigators in the areas of
affinity chromatography and the many fields related to it. Affinity
chromatography is an exceptionally important area at the present time, due
chiefly to its significant relationship to recombinant DNA and related areas of
biotechnology. This meeting allows leaders of the field to exchange information
with one another in both formal and informal settings and, more importantly,
permits new investigators, who have just entered this area, to interact with
established investigators and with each other in formulating new and exciting
lines of investigation. The results of this meeting will be published in a
symposium issue of the Journal of Chromatography.
