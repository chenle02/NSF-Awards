DNA is constantly subjected to mutations, and understanding how these mutations
arise and are repaired is a critical step in cell and organismal survival. The
replication and repair enzymes that control DNA damage are found in every
organism, but their efficiency vary greatly across known life. In this project,
high-fidelity replication enzymes that have evolved under natural conditions
will be transferred into other organisms with low-fidelity replication enzymes.
Furthermore, the project will investigate how varying replication fidelity can
influence the survival of an organism as well as shape the structure of the
genome. By reprogramming replication fidelity, the project seeks to reduce
cellular mutation rates and increase cellular longevity and cellular health.
This work will be performed by K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students, and
include bi-yearly genetic engineering workshops that will increase scientific
participation and promote the careers of minorities in STEM
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of this project is to study
and manipulate the enzymes that drive DNA replication fidelity by 1)
reprogramming yeast DNA replication using naturally existing, extremely high-
fidelity DNA replication enzymes found in Paramecium tetraurelia, 2) use
droplet-digital PCR to model the distribution of fitness effects in an effort to
investigate how selection operates to refine replication fidelity based on
deleterious load, 3) investigate how replication fidelity influences
spatiotemporal mutation-rate variation in alphaproteobacteria with multiple
chromosomes, 4) improve STEM education for K-12 students through the NC-MSEN
pre-college program, and 5) promote minority and disadvantaged undergraduate,
graduate, and postdoctoral researchers in STEM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
