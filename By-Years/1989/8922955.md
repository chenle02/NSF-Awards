The Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Carl R. Johnson
in the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University. Studies designed to
advance the applications of enzymes as catalysts in key steps of the synthesis
of complex organic molecules will be the focus of the project. The proposed meso
substrates for the enzymes, easily produced from starting materials such as
cycloheptatriene, are densely funtionalized cyclic compounds. The enzymatic
reactions will serve to unveil multiple chiral centers and result in compounds
that should be useful building blocks for futher synthetic manipulation. Target
molecules will include pancrastistatin, tetrahydrolipstatin and compounds
related to amphotericin B. In order to recycle many of the enzymes of interest,
an integral part of the study will involve the development of new general
technology for the immobilization of enzymes based on a new polymer containing
azlactone groups.
