ABSTRACT The investigators will continue the development of a computa- tional
model of phonetic structure, begun with earlier NSF support. The model is based
on a particular dynamical systems approach called "task dynamics", which
abstractly characterizes speech gestures in terms of coordinated patterns of
articulator movements during speech production. The relative timing and
parameterization of the gestures comprising a given utterance are specified by a
"gestural score" that is generated by the model's linguistic gestural component.
Articulatory measurements obtained from speakers of English, Italian, and
Japanese will be analyzed to derive values for the relations between vowel and
consonant gestures as well as for the parameters of the individual gestures in
the gestural score. Because the model is based on such articulatory evidence, it
is particularly appropriate as a phonetic framework for use with recent non-
linear phonologies that emphasize the phonological relevance of articulatory
features. Further, because the model is couched within a dynamical systems
approach, it provides a concise and principled account of much variability,
including historical change, in terms of spatial and temporal overlap among
speech gestures.
