This project will use state-of-the-art measurement methods to investigate
photolysis reactions that are important in the atmosphere. Specifically, the
team will develop a new methodology for quantum yield measurements of complex
molecules using chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS). Initial efforts
will focus on investigating reactions which arise from radiation interacting
with ketones in the upper troposphere. The research team will use the results to
better understand the concentrations of reaction species in the upper
troposphere. The project will also support training of a graduate study and a
postdoctoral researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will use CIMS to
detect radical reaction products from the photolysis of acetone and other
ketones as a function of wavelength, O2, pressure, and temperature. Data will
provide experimental constraints which will contribute to our understanding of
the upper tropospheric HOx and PAN budgets. Additionally, this new method for
measuring quantum yields has the potentially to be used in numerous future
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
