9720424 Hauser The purpose of this award is to provide funds for the Engineering
Research Center at North Carolina State University on Advanced Microelectronic
Devices to collaborate with Rutgers University, International Business Machines,
and Lucent Technologies to add expertise in the area of advanced
characterization of electronic materials and device performance. Rutgers
University is a center of excellence in ion beam and x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and IBM and Lucent Technologies add expertise in characterization
of device performance. The Engineering Research Center has succeeded in
producing thin film nitrided stacked gate electronic device structures that have
the potential for application in commercial markets. This collaborative effort
will provide understanding of the chemical and physical structure of these
structures at the mono-atomic layer level. This understanding is necessary if
the devices are to be accepted by the industry. The research consists of three
tasks: 1) materials synthesis (NC State), 2) ion beam and x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (Rutgers University), and 3) definition of materials specifications
at the monolayer level for advanced device structures (IBM and Lucent). One of
the main goals is to transfer knowledge gained in this research to industry.
