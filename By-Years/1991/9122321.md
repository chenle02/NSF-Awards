Recent developments in politics and economics focus attention on how outcomes
are determined by the interaction between institutional structure and individual
preferences. The projects will endogenize the institutional structure by
considering the case in which multiple institutions compete for members.
Examples include the interaction between the membership and platforms of
political parties and the interaction between towns' inhabitants and their
provision of local public goods. At an abstract level, institutions take
positions based on their membership, while individuals join institutions based
on their preferences. There is a fundamental interaction between individual
preferences, institutional decision-making processes, memberships, and outcomes.
In a political economic equilibrium, no individual wants to change institutional
affiliation and each institution's position is consistent with its membership.
This research begins with the question of whether an equilibrium exists. To
answer this apparently simple question requires highly sophisticated reasoning.
Conditions for existence will be derived and the potential for non- existence
will be shown. The goal of the research is to improve our understanding of the
influence of mobility among competing institutions in determining political and
economic outcomes.
