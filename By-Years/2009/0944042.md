The importance of gelatinous zooplankton in marine systems worldwide is
increasing. In Southern Ocean, increasing salp densities could have a
detrimental effect on higher predators, including penguins, fur seals, and
baleen whales. The proposed research is a methods-develoment project that will
improve the capability to indirectly assess abundances and distributions of
salps in the Southern Ocean through acoustic surveys. Hydrographic, net tow, and
acoustic backscatter data will be collected in the waters surrounding the South
Shetland Islands and the Antarctic peninsula, where both krill and salps are
found and compete for food. Shipboard experimental manipulations and
measurements will lead to improved techniques for assessment of salp biomass
acoustically. Experiments will focus on material properties (density and sound
speed), size and shape of salps, as well as how these physical properties will
vary with the salp's environment, feeding rate, and reproductive status. In the
field, volume backscattering data from an acoustic echosounder will be collected
at the same locations as the net tows to enable comparison of net and acoustic
estimates of salp abundance. A physics-based scattering model for salps will be
developed and validated, to determine if multiple acoustic frequencies can be
used to discriminate between scattering associated with krill swarms and that
from salp blooms. During the same period as the Antarctic field work, a parallel
outreach and education study will be undertaken in Long Island, New York
examining local gelatinous zooplankton. This study will enable project
participants to learn and practice research procedures and methods before
traveling to Antarctica; provide a comparison time-series that will be used for
educational purposes; and include many more students and teachers in the
research project than would be able to participate in the Antarctic field
component.
