9724486 Klein The University of Pennsylvania will acquire a confocal microscope
workstation for three-dimensional imaging and micromanipulation of soft
materials. The instrument will support research in the areas of colloid
engineering, including colloidal crystals and particle epitaxy, vesicles and
membranes, emulsions, molecular elasticity, and flow in porous media. The
instrument will be part of a Center for Advanced Imaging and Micromanipulation
housed in the University's Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter
(LRSM). %%% Acquisition of this instrumentation will impact the research and
research training of over 40 students and postdoctoral fellows associated with
the soft materials group at the LRSM. The instrument will also be utilized by
the 25 undergraduates, half of them from other colleges and universities,
participating in the LRSM summer Research Experience for Undergraduates program.
