This proposal requests funds to establish a core plant growth chamber facility
at UNR. Plant growth chambers are important pieces of equipment for plant
biology research. They provide scientists with the capacity to produce plants
conditions. Control of temperature, photoperiod, light intensity and humidity
are necessary for research projects ranging from investigations of plant-
environment interactions to production of transgenic plants. Development of
research programs in plant biology has been an important focus within the
College of Agriculture at the University of Nevada-Reno. The development of such
a core facility is an essential component in both the successful development of
the research programs of many of these new plant biology faculty and the
continued research productivity of our more established faculty members. This
plant growth chamber facility will initially support the research programs of
six faculty members from three departments within the College os agencies.
