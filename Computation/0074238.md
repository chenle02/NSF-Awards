The investigator and his colleague study ways to break intractability of
algorithms for high-dimensional problems. They focus on high-dimensional
integration, explore breaking intractability either by settling for a stochastic
assurance of small error or by using additional domain knowledge, and further
develop FinDer, a software package for high-dimensional integration. The
computational complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of work the
algorithm must perform to produce a solution for given inputs. Usually the
complexity is measured in the size of the problem being solved. For example,
finding the solution of a linear matrix equation in N unknowns --- an
N-dimsional problem --- generally takes on the order of N times N times N
arithmetic operations; the computational complexity of such an algorithm is N
cubed. There is huge interest in solving high-dimensional problems. Many
applications involve functions of hundreds, thousands, and even an infinite
number of variables. Examples occur in physics, chemistry, mathematical science,
and economics. These problems must usually be solved numerically and one has to
settle for an approximate numerical solution to within an error epsilon. If a
worst case deterministic assurance of an epsilon approximation is desired, then
the computational complexity usually depends exponentially on the number of
variables; the problem is said to be intractible. The investigators study
breaking intractability either by settling for a stochastic assurance of small
error or by using additional domain knowledge. The use of formalizing additional
domain knowledge is a powerful new idea. In particular, the investigators study
under what conditions a double win is achievable for the important problem of
high-dimensional integration: when does an algorithm to compute the value of a
high-dimensional integral both converge faster than a Monte Carlo algorithm and
do so with a worst case deterministic assurance? They apply the theoretical
results to improve the FinDer software system for computing high-dimensional
integrals. This new paradigm is applied to other problems of computational
mathematics.
