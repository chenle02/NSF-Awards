The objective is to create a computer model of the electrical activity, both
nervous control and neuromusculor interactions, of the lower urinary tract,
especially the bladder and the urethra. The research begins by obtaining or
building a physical model of the bladder, urethra, and their neural
innervations, perhaps two: male and female. The model is to have the ability to
reproduce some electrical activity of the system, the neuromuscular interactions
and the physical muscular activity. It is planned to develop the model for a
popular personal computer. The model is to be able to simulate the detrusor
muscle's response to stimulation through a graphical depiction of it. The
program plans to take into account pharmacological considerations. It is also to
be gender-specific. This project is one supported under the Creativity Awards
for Undergraduate Engineering Students.
