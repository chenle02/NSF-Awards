The aim of this project is to describe the mechanism of regeneration of a cut
peripheral nerve bundle across the transected region. The approach is to design
a family of highly porous, resorbable implants based on collagen-
glycosaminoglycan polymers and to insert them between the cut ends of transected
sciatic nerve in the rat. Regrowth will take place through a silicone rubber
tube which is sutured to the perineurial tissue. The adhesive preferences of
regenerating peripheral axons will be studied along with the long term recovery
of motor function.
