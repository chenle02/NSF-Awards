This one year award will support participation of a graduate student in a
U.S.-U.K. cooperative research project between Mary A. Bisson of the State
University of New York, Buffalo, and A. D. Tomas at the University of Wales.
They will study salt tolerance and stress in plants using charophytes, a complex
macrophytic algae closely related to the line which gave rise to higher plants.
The objective of their research is to test toxicity due to the accumulation of
sodium in the plant's cytoplasm. The U.S. investigator brings to this
collaboration expertise in plant systems and homeostasis. This is complemented
by the Welsh investigator's expertise in ultramicroanalysis, an important new
technique for measuring sodium tolerance and stress. These studies will advance
our knowledge about salinity in plants and how it determines natural plant
distribution and limitations on plant productivity.
