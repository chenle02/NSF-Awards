The objective of this project is to learn how enzymes evolve to recognize new
substrates. A better understanding of adaptive evolution will explain how the
complex molecular machinery of life arose, and enable the artificial selection
of novel catalysts for industrial or medical applications. Enzymes could
theoretically adapt to new substrates by the following ordered mechanism: 1)
mutations that destabilize the conformation of the active-site initially broaden
substrate specificity; 2) active-site flexibility enables the occurrence of
mutations that introduce novel interactions with the new substrate; 3) mutations
that stabilize the new productive active-site conformation further improve
catalytic activity. This hypothesis will be tested by directing the evolution of
a model enzyme called beta-glucuronidase (GUS). The gene encoding GUS will be
randomly mutated. The resulting library will be expressed in populations of
Escherichia coli, and screened for variant enzymes exhibiting increased
catalytic activity in reactions with a novel substrate analogue. The
corresponding alleles will be isolated and randomly mutated for another round of
screening. After three rounds of evolution, the beta- galactosidase activity of
GUS has already increased 500-fold, with a 52,000,000-fold inversion of
specificity. The process will be continued until the catalytic efficiency and
specificity of the wild-type lacZ beta-galactosidase has been matched. The
entire evolutionary process will also be repeated with different substrate
analogues. The structural and functional changes that occur along each
evolutionary pathway will be studied and compared, and the rules governing
adaptation will be inferred. &lt;br/&gt;
