Discrete geometry deals with objects that have corners and ridges, such as cubes
or surfaces sewn out of triangles. Objects of this type are called polytopal
complexes and provide a general approach to the study of other fields of
mathematics, such as differential geometry and algebraic topology. The main
advantage of discretizing is the possibility to leverage computational tools.
Simple questions on the structure of polytopes, such as the Hirsch conjecture,
have foundational importance in optimization. Meanwhile discrete Morse theory, a
reduction tool to simplify a given polytopal complex, is employed both in pure
mathematics and in big data analysis, to understand high-dimensional shapes. The
project builds on these tools and expands their application. Further tools arise
from the study of networks, which are polytopal complexes of dimension one. A
plan is to integrate in this line of work new random models, with the goal of
revealing fundamental properties of intersection patterns of algebraic
varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enumerative aspects on the number of polytopes
and spheres with given number of facets have importance beyond pure mathematics,
in Regge calculus and simplicial quantum gravity. Techniques from metric
geometry can provide desired exponential upper bounds. Another problem with
importance in applied mathematics is the polynomial Hirsch conjecture, which was
recently proven with metric methods for flag polytopes. Techniques ranging from
knot theory to differential and hyperbolic geometry may be applied to better
understand obstructions and constructions in Discrete Morse Theory, thereby
revealing when and how we can simplify a given shape. A new perspective in this
project is to connect discrete Morse theory with the notion of embeddability. A
further goal is to lift the classical theory of polytope graphs (for example
Balinski's theorem or the Hirsch conjecture) into a more general theory of
intersection patterns of algebraic varieties, where algebraic tools such as
liaison theory and local cohomology can be employed. Integrating this theory
with the study of random simplicial complexes may provide some new random models
in commutative algebra.
