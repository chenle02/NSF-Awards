"IDEAS" is a three year program targeted at increasing retention of women
engineering students during the Freshman to Junior years at the Milwaukee School
of Engineering. It is part of a vigorous effort to significantly increase the
percentage of graduating women engineers by the year 2000. The five phases -
Innovation, Discovery, Experience, Assimilation and Stretching cover the
Prefreshman through Sophomore years. Bonding, technological literacy, strong
faculty/staff support, professional/work contacts and positive role models are
being emphasized during this period of study for the students. All women
engineering students will participate in IDEAS, not only as students, but also
as mentors. IDEAS is being developed and managed by women faculty and staff of
the institution.
