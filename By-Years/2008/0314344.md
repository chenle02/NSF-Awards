The focus of this research is continuation of a successfully-developing cross-
disciplinary program in synthetic organic chemistry, molecular recognition and
supramolecular photochemistry. The research aims to develop an efficient modular
synthetic approach to a variety of elaborate multi-unit nanoscale objects
assembled with the aid of photolabile molecular linkers and, therefore, capable
of photoinduced disassembly. At the core is the recently developed photo
electron transfer-induced cleavage in substituted alpha-hydroxyalkyl dithiane
and a family of related compounds. Secondly, utilizing these photo-latches this
group will develop novel photolabile nanoscale objects equipped with elements of
molecular recognition that can be used in biological applications. Specifically,
the second goal will encompass the following two general directions: (i) self-
assembled photolabile cages and capsules, (ii) photochemical amplification in
externally sensitized photocleavable linkers for solid support combinatorial
screening.

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Andrei G. Kutateladze of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Denver, Denver. Professor
Kutateladze will focus his research on the development of new materials
containing photo-cleavable nanoparticles. This could have important
ramifications in the fundamental understanding of the principles governing
supramolecular organic photochemistry and molecular recognition, the results of
this research will also have broader implications for applied biomedical
sciences, including drug discovery and drug delivery.
