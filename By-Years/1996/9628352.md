9628352 Fisher The kinematic history of collisions between island arcs and
continental margins is of considerable importance in attempts to interpret
ancient deformation. Taiwan is an active obliquely colliding island arc onto the
asian margin, and therefore offers a spatial analog for the sequence of
kinematic responses developed during a collisional episode. This project will
study a series of transects from north to south across the retrowedge of Taiwan
that represents late and early stages respectively, kinematic indicators and
fabrics will be studied and results incorporated in testing a number of
theoretical models for wedge mechanics, kinematics and thermal structures that
have been proposed for Taiwan. Results are expected to be applicable to other
oblique orogenic belts.
