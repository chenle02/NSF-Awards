The Principal Investigator proposes to design and implement linear algebra
library for a wide range of currently used supercomputers. The library is
intended to provide a uniform set of subroutines to solve the most common linear
algebra problems and to run efficiently on a range of architectures. This
library, which will be freely accessible via computer network, not only will
ease code development, make codes more portable among machines of different
architectures, and increase efficiency, but also will provide tools for
evaluating supercomputer performance. The library will be based on the well-
known and widely used LINPACK and EISPACK packages for linear equation solving,
eigenvalue problems, and linear least squares. LINPACK and EISPACK have provided
an important infrastructure for scientific computing on serial machines, but
they are not designed to exploit the profusion of parallel and vector
architectures now becoming available. We propose to rewrite the algorithms in
terms of calls to a small number of Extended Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines
each of which implements a basic operation such as matrix multiplication, rank-k
matrix updates, and solving triangular systems. These operations can be
optimized for each architecture, but the underlying numerical algorithms will be
the same for all machines.
