Developed with NSF funds through the "TIMS (Teaching Integrated Mathematics and
Science)" project, "Math Trailblazers" is a K-5 mathematics curriculum
integrating a significant science component. This five-year project will
undertake a study of the use of "Trailblazers" as well as a revision of the
curriculum. The study will involve researchers from five universities (U. of
Illinois, Chicago; U. of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; U. of Minnesota; St. Xavier
U. and Kansas State U.). It will investigate student achievement, video study of
lessons, and an investigation of the school and community contexts of
implementation. The revision will involve updating problem-solving contexts, a
review of assessment strategies, an update on the use of technology and the
rewriting of several lessons. New classroom materials will be field tested.
Other materials to be developed are a revision of the teacher enhancement
modules and a parents' guide. Evaluation will be conducted as part of the
research component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reviews of the orginal proposal and
the IMD budget could not support the work plan first proposed. After some
negotiation the proposers submitted a revised work plan and timetable which are
documented in the jacket.
