The controlled aggregation of fine particles into flocs is important to several
different materials processing activities. In this study, floc properties for
particles of a number of ceramic materials will be determined as functions of
hydrodynamic conditions and polymer addition. Floc density and shear strength
will be measured and fractal dimensions of the flocs used to characterize flocs
formed under various conditions. The effects of primary process parameters will
be studied.
