The investigator develops numerical methods for determining the qualitative
dynamical behavior of solutions to ordinary differential equations. For these
methods, input requires only a system of differential equations, a region of the
phase space, and no a priori knowledge of the dynamics. The output is a Morse
decomposition of the invariant set into regions containing nontrivial dynamics.
Information about the behavior in these regions is given in terms of the Conley
index, and connecting orbits between Morse sets can be detected. Such an
algorithm is beneficial as a first step in the study of systems of differential
equations for which little information is known, particularly in higher
dimensions where visualization of numerically simulated solutions is difficult.
The type of computation envisioned here provides a somewhat coarse, qualitative
description of a dynamical system. However, the Conley index, a tool from
dynamical systems theory, is an algebraic topological index, which also allows
for the development of algorithms for rigorously proving the existence of
specific dynamical behavior. Therefore, a reliable algorithm can be used both as
a tool for analyzing unfamiliar systems and as a tool for obtaining computer-
assisted proofs of specific dynamics; both would have a wide variety of
applications. The algorithms developed here also have potential applications in
computational topology, in particular the computation of the homology of
cellular complexes, and connections to mesh generation and Delaunay
triangulations.

Differential equations are used to model many phenomena in the physical
sciences: mechanical systems, chemical reactions, and biological systems.
Understanding the dynamics of such inherently nonlinear systems is a problem in
global analysis. When the underlying space has dimension higher than three, the
study of such systems is often beyond the scope of current analytic techniques.
Computers are capable of performing many calculations of solutions to such
equations, but most current numerical methods are not well suited for extracting
asymptotic dynamical behavior from systems in higher dimensions. One problem is
that computers can generate a large quantity of data that is difficult to
analyze; often a graphical analysis is performed, which is impractical in higher
dimensions and can miss unstable objects. The purpose of this project is to
design and implement algorithms to study the asymptotic dynamics of differential
equations in higher dimensions. The output of the algorithm is an algebraic
index (designed by C. Conley) that could be thought of as a tool for extracting
the essential dynamical information (including unstable objects) from
computational data and that does not require visualization to be understood.
