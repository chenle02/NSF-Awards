We have discovered that for most practical magnetic materials, a combination of
third-harmonic and fundamental flux can reduce the excitation current and core
losses significantly below the levels found with the fundamental flux alone. The
third harmonic can result naturally or can be applied. This effect is greater
under more saturated conditions. Before applying this phenomenon fully to
improve the performance of electromagnetic apparatus--primarily transformers and
rotating machines--by either reducing losses and improving efficiency under
rated conditions or increasing the rating, a thorough understanding of how
materials will perform under the influence of third-harmonic flux is absolutely
needed. As an immediate goal, a theoretical and experimental investigation in
the following form is proposed: 1) mathematical models to describe with useful
engineering accuracy how core losses and excitation current vary with varying
amounts and relative phases of fundamental and third-harmonic flux; 2) useful
mathematical circuit models for devices (transformer and rotating machines) that
accurately represent coupling caused by core material nonlinearity between
fundamental and harmonic circuits; 3) experimental studies related to the
mathematical models; and 4) evaluation of potential improvements and their cost
effectiveness. This fundamental knowledge will enable further improvement of the
performance of electrical machines and transformers.
