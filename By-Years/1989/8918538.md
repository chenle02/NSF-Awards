The Fish Collection of the American Museum of Natural History is one of the
largest in North America, comprising more than 200,000 specimen lots, more than
a million individual specimens, and more than 1200 type specimens. Dr. Gareth
Nelson, Curator of the collection, proposes an expansion of the collection
through incorporation of marine larval fishes from the Gulf of Mexico and the
Atlantic Ocean off the U.S. coast. Dr. Nelson also plans to complete the
conversion of the spirit collection fluids from isopropanol to ethanol, assuring
better preservation of tissue and coloration patterns. Systematic collections in
natural history museums are the primary data resources with which biologists
analyze the results of evolution. Ecologists, biogeographers, and evolutionary
systematists are completely dependent on these repositories of biological
diversity for the basic materials for study. Proper curation and steady growth
of these collections are essential for the long-term study of biodiversity and
evolution.
