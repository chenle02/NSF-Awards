This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This award will support the development of a new and unique device, at the
National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State
University, to capture short-lived isotopes produced in nuclear reactions that
will facilitate a wide range of new nuclear science. The NSCL is the forefront
facility in the US for nuclear science using fast projectile fragments (GeV
kinetic energies) and is the world leader in the thermalization and precision
mass measurements of these projectile fragments. Nearly a fifth of the chemical
elements have been thermalized and measured at the NSCL in the last four years.
The NSCL is currently building on this success by expanding its experimental
arena for precision studies with thermalized projectile fragments to include
laser spectroscopy and, in a major step forward, to low-energy nuclear
reactions.

Funds from this award will be used to develop a robust gas-stopping concept for
projectile fragments, particularly for light-ion and high intensity beams that
will be difficult to produce with existing technology. The new gas stopper will
slow down and thermalize very high-energy projectile fragments in a large gas
filled chamber inside a cyclotron-type magnet. Such a gas-filled cyclotron
stopper will be able to provide thermalized ions without regard to their
chemical nature, with half-lives as short as tens of milliseconds, and at high
incident rates. The development of a novel technique to slow down, capture, and
extract these difficult beams using a gas-filled reverse-cyclotron will thus
have broad impact by: (1) providing the wide range of beams required for the
next generation of precision mass measurements and laser spectroscopy at the
NSCL, and (2) allowing unique studies of low-energy nuclear reactions with
intense beams of short-lived isotopes that are not available anywhere else in
the world.

The proposed work will be performed by a collaboration of researchers at MSU,
RIKEN (in Japan) and GSI (in Germany) and includes the creation of a break-
through device on a three-year timescale. This collaboration has significant
expertise in all aspects of the work and the project will foster the technical
and scientific exchange among these laboratories. The cyclotron-stopper will be
constructed at the NSCL and installed on a dedicated beam line for full-scale
testing and subsequent connection to the low-energy arena and re-accelerator.

This instrumentation will be a critical component of the NSCL-based research
program of many students and postdoctoral scholars.
