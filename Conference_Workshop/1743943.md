This National Science Foundation award provides support for the CBMS Conference:
Elastic Functional and Shape Data Analysis (EFSDA), which will be held in July
16-20, 2018 at The Ohio State University in Columbus, OH. The primary lecturer
is Professor Anuj Srivastava from the Department of Statistics at Florida State
University. The conference will feature a lecture series on elastic methods for
statistical analysis of functional and shape data, using tools from Riemannian
geometry, Hilbert space methods, and computational science. The main focus of
this conference will be on geometric approaches, especially on using elastic
Riemannian metrics with desired invariance properties, and square-root
representations of shape that have proven to simplify computations. These
approaches enable joint registration and statistical analysis of functional
data, and are termed elastic for that reason. The statistical goals include
comparisons, summarization, clustering, modeling, and testing of functional and
shape data objects. The proposed tools for statistical analysis of functional
and shape data have broad applications in almost all branches of science. Any
promotion of education, training, and collaboration in this cutting-edge
research area will have a strong impact on the community. The audience for this
workshop will include early career researchers from statistics, applied
mathematics, engineering, computer science and biological sciences. By training
and educating researchers in an important STEM area, this effort will facilitate
future interdisciplinary collaborations amongst participants. Recent years have
seen a tremendous advancement in the use of Riemannian geometry in statistical
data analysis, especially in shape analysis. EFSDA brings together tools from
diverse disciplines, such as geometry, statistics, functional data analysis,
computational science, and application domains, to develop a broad and
comprehensive package of solutions. On one hand, it poses fundamental
mathematical questions, including existence and uniqueness of optimal functional
matching, and on the other, it provides efficient computational implementations
for problems dealing with alignment, dimension reduction, and statistical
modeling of functional and shape data. Given the proliferation of functional
data in all scientific disciplines, these tools will help address important and
urgent data analysis needs. The classroom-style lectures will be enhanced by
multiple discussion sessions. For the conference webpage, please see
