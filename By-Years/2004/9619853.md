The goal of this project is to accelerate the rendering of three dimensional
surface models using multiresolution modeling techniques. Multiresolution
modeling is the description of shape at multiple levels of detail. In
conventional image synthesis, an object is rendered from the same geometric
model independent of its screen size, but this is unnecessarily slow for small
and distant objects. With multiresolution models, nearby objects are rendered
using a detailed model, while distant objects are rendered using a coarse model
employing many fewer polygons. To date, the creation of multiresolution models
has been largely manual. New algorithms will be developed to adaptively simplify
polygonal surface models, attempting to find an accurate approximation to the
surface using as few polygons as possible, and to do this as quickly as
possible. Methods for smoothing the transitions between levels of detail will be
developed. The resulting image should be indistinguishable from a scene rendered
from a fully detailed model. Multiresolution models can speed up a number of
applications, including flight and driving simulation, computer aided design,
visualization, video games, virtual reality, and computer animation. They can
allow scenes of great complexity to be rendered in real time.
