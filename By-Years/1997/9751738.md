In the mid-eighties, mathematics and science programs were discontinued at
William Woods University (until recently a women's college) and students were to
sent to the neighboring Westminster College (formerly all male) for these
classes. Enrollment in these classes suffered significantly. In the past six
years, tremendous efforts have been made to bring science and mathematics back
to the WWU campus. As a result of these efforts mathematics and biology majors
are now offered on campus. This program is bringing physics programs to WWU
campus. The objectives that are being addressed are (1) offering an introductory
calculus based 2-semester physics sequence, (2) setting up the undergraduate
physics laboratory, (3) exposing students to role-models, (4) conducting a
summer workshop for teachers, (5) developing an interdisciplinary upper-division
physics course, and (6) setting up a student support system. The introductory
courses and accompanying laboratories are being conducted in an investigative,
hands-on approach, integrating technology and current research, providing
students with the opportunity of constructing their own knowledge in an active
fashion. Cooperative learning is an inherent part of everyday activities and the
emphasis will be on critical thinking and deep understanding. Self-directed
student research and presentations by students locally and at meetings is
strongly encouraged. *
