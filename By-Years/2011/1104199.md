The project teaches next generation manufacturing strategies to students by
building on the successful Fab Lab concept. Fab Labs are off-the-shelf,
industrial-grade fabrication and electronics tools combined with open source
software. Fab Labs allow students to create or invent, then build their
creations.

The act of creation and building motivates students to study STEM. To measure
this effect, the project is assessing how well the Fab Labs develop deep and
long term connections between students and STEM study. The project is then using
these assessments to formulate a model for attracting and sustaining students in
the study of STEM fields.

Using Fab Labs, the project is developing a Learning Community to help drive
technician education nation-wide. The project builds the Learning Community by
collaborating with four ATE Centers spanning 20 schools and organizations. The
collaboration is implementing Fab Labs as they share problems, solutions and
expertise and further integrates existing resources into new course offerings.

Using webinars, workshops, mentoring, web portals and a national symposium, the
program's materials and resources are being widely disseminated to encourage
others to use the resources being developed.
