State University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award continues funding of a Center
to conduct research and education on the environmental impacts of nanomaterials.
The Center goals are to advance discovery of general principles that determine
the movement and transformation of nanomaterials in the environment and their
effects on organisms and ecosystems. The Center further aims to translate this
knowledge into the language of risk assessment to guide nanotechnology in ways
that minimize harm to the environment. This Center engages a highly
interdisciplinary, multi-institutional team in integrated research to establish
a theoretical understanding of how the physics and surface chemistry of
nanomaterials determine their interactions with the environment, from the
molecular level to that of entire ecosystems. The Center will develop new
methods for detection and tracking of natural and manufactured nanomaterials in
the environment. Information on nanomaterial properties and environmental
impacts will be synthesized into models that can be used to predict
environmental risk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology holds great promise
both to the nation's economic growth and to enhance our ability to live in more
sustainable ways. However, the responsible implementation of this technology is
hampered by uncertainty over the environmental impacts of nanomaterials. There
is an urgent societal need to understand this risk, while at the same time
providing guidelines for safe design to prevent environmental harm. This Center
will conduct the fundamental research necessary to reduce uncertainty in the
environmental impacts of nanotechnology. It will contribute uniquely to a
network of nanotechnology centers that serve the national needs. The Center will
also promote interdisciplinary training of the next generation of nanoscale
scientists and engineers in ways that broaden participation in the newly
emerging field of environmental nanoscience. In collaboration with national
laboratories, non-governmental organizations, and industry, the Center will
further research and education goals and engage in outreach that informs both
experts and the public at large about the safety issues surrounding
nanotechnology
