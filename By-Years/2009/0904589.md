The aim of this project is to further develop and apply the various Floer
homology theories of knots and three-manifolds that arise from gauge theories.
In particular, the Principal Investigator will further develop a Floer homology
theory for knots, arising from instantons with codimension-2 singularities, and
will investigate its relationship to Khovanov homology. A spectral sequence will
be established relating the two homology theories. He will investigate whether
one can prove the non-triviality of the Floer theory arising from singular
instantons, with a view towards showing that Khovanov homology detects the
unknot. The instanton homology theory of sutured manifolds, recently developed
by the PI and Mrowka, will be further explored. It will be proved that the
resulting Floer homology of links recovers the multi-variable Alexander
polynomial. In a similar spirit, the instanton homology of closed 3-manifolds
will be shown to recover the Reidemeister torsion. The PI will define invariants
of transverse links: links transverse to the standard contact structure in the
three-sphere or other 3-manifolds. These invariants will reside in the link
Floer homology groups arising from the instanton theory on sutured manifolds.

Topology is the qualitative study of space and its connectedness. Its importance
was recognized at the turn of the last century by the French mathematician
Poincare, during his investigation of the laws of motion that govern the
movement of a three-body system such as the Earth, Moon and Sun moving according
to Newton's laws. In the past twenty years, topology has seen applications in
questions such as the knotting of proteins and DNA, and in modern theories of
high-energy physics. The topology of three-dimensional spaces, as opposed to
those of higher dimension, is of particular subtlety. In recent years, a wealth
of new techniques have been introduced to study the phenomena that arise in
dimension three. This project will further develop these new techniques, and
will explore the mysterious relationships between them. In so doing, the project
will deepen our understanding of topology and its interaction with other areas
of mathematics and science. At the same time, the project will train graduate
students and disseminate results to researchers in the area.
