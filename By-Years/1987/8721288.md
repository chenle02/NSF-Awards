The role which tropical-extratropical interaction plays in the irregular
oscillations of the large scale circulation remains controversial. There is
synoptic evidence that a characteristic sequence of tropical and extratropical
events accompanies both quasi-regular intraseasonal oscillations of the
circulation and the development of persistent circulation regimes. This research
will investigate the nature of some known composite relationships between
tropical convection and the mid- latitude jets through 1) analyzing the annual
cycle of these features in detail with high temporal resolution and 2) using a
case study approach to the intraseasonal and interannual variability of these
connections. Multi-level, twice daily National Meteorological Center (NMC) data
from July 1976 to July 1987 will be used to define the circulation and its
fluctuations. Outgoing longwave radiation data will be used to infer tropical
convection fluctuations. The quality of the divergence field in the NMC data
will be evaluated through correlations with the OLR data at different time and
space scales. Primary emphasis will be placed on the relationship between 1) the
jet stream and its associated ageostrophic flow and 2) tropical convection and
its associated divergent flow. This research is important because in order to
make useful predictions of weather and climate feature over the US weeks to
seasons in advance the processes studied here, that is the interactions between
tropical and extra-tropical circulations, must be better understood.
