This research examines phenolic metabolism in disease development in corn. Hosts
will provide genetically differential resistance and susceptibility to the
fungus Helminthosporium maydis, race O. Changes in phenolic metabolism after
infection include a significant increase in hydroxycinnamic acid: CoA ligase
activity, and resistant and susceptible interactions are distinguishable by the
CoA ligase isozyme response after infection. The goals of this study are to: (1)
characterize these isozymes, (2) define the isozyme response in resistant and
susceptible interactions, (3) purify the enzyme for polyclonal antiserum
production, (4) clone and characterize the CoA ligase genes, and (5)
characterize antisera for CoA ligase specificity. Symptoms of resistance suggest
the involvement of phenols in response to infection in plants. Blocking phenolic
synthesis at the level of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (an enzyme of
phenylpropanoid metabolism) changes a normally resistant interaction into one of
susceptibility. Significant changes in phenols are detected throughout the
infection and disease development processes, and the changes in resistance
differ from those in susceptibility. This research will examine expression and
regulation of phenolic metabolism in the fungal pathogen, Helminthosporium
maydis. This research will provide important information about the infection
response processes in corn as well as new insights into disease resistance in
general.
