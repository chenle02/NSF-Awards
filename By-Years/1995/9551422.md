Understanding the environment and the many factors that must, of necessity,
contribute to decisions regarding the management of the environment, depend on
one's ability to access stored data. The most effective way to make sense of
this type of data is with the system called Geographic Information Systems
(GIS). GIS is an essential tool in the management of spacially distributed
information. The students of today are the managers of tomorrow; they must,
therefore, be familiar with GIS. This project funds the software and
instrumentation necessary for students to learn the GIS applications. In order
to learn how to use a data management system, students need to connect the
learning with a real-life application. This project introduces students to the
GIS system in three introductory geology courses. The courses have a steady high
enrollment, they are populated by students within the geology major and well as
from other majors, and they are popular choices to fulfill the college's general
education science requirements.
