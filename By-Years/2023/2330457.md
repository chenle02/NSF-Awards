NSF CAREER awards support early career faculty who integrate their research and
educational efforts, investing in their development as leading scholar-teachers
in their fields. Building on the success of past Division of Molecular and
Cellular Biosciences CAREER Awardee Conferences since 2019, the 2023 meeting
will bring together a diverse cohort of awardees to foster cross-disciplinary
interactions and build a community to advance molecular and cellular scale
understanding of complex biological systems.

The goals of the conference are to facilitate knowledge sharing and catalyze
collaborations among early-career faculty who span a broad range of research and
educational expertise, and to provide input to the NSF on new research frontiers
in molecular and cellular biosciences.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
