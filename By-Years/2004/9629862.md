9629862 Mauzerall The recently developed method of pulsed, wide-band, time
resolved photoacoustics will be used to determine the thermodynamic properties
of transient species in photosynthesis and photoinitiated electron transfer
reactions. This method determines the enthalpy and volume changes in these
reactions. Given that the free energy of many of these reactions are known, the
entropy can be calculated. The charge seperation in the initial photoreactions
causes volume changes dominated by electrostriction, which is directly related
to the dielectric response of the system. This is a critical parameter in
electron transfer reactions. The measured enthalpy also provides a direct
measure of the thermodynamic efficiency of the system. A longer term objective
is to determine the enthalpy and volume changes of the individual steps in the
cycle of oxygen formation. %%% Photosynthesis is an efficient system that
converts sunlight into chemical energy which supports life on earth. The
understanding of this system is a major goal of much research. To achieve this
goal it is necessary to have detailed knowledge of both the kinetics, i.e. how
fast do the steps in the process happen, and the thermodynamics, i.e., what are
their energetics or efficiencies. The past decades have produced major progress
in the first area. This work is aimed at producing the required progress in the
energetics area using the new photoacoustic methodology. A practical application
of this research will be development of rapid unambiguous assays of
photosynthetic efficiency. Calculations of oceanic productivity depend
critically on photosynthetic efficiency. It is also possible that the
photoacoustic methodology could be used in the field to determine photosynthetic
efficiency and water content of leaves. ***
