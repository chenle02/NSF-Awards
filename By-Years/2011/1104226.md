A team of researchers and practitioners from the University of Wisconsin,
Madison and four 2-year colleges (Fox Valley Technical College, Moraine Park
Technical College, Northcentral Technical College, and Waukesha County Technical
College)is developing activities to increase student success and retention in
Manufacturing Engineering Technologist and Technician Education (METTE) Programs
and examining key factors associated with these activities. The project examines
the influence of student participation in coursework that is part of
articulation agreements between secondary and post-secondary institutions and
the influence of post-secondary factors (e.g., the availability of financial aid
and participation in academic and student support activities) on student
performance and retention in METTE. The study examines the link between
participation in dual-credit programs in high school with student outcomes, such
as likelihood of earning a diploma, persistence to the second semester of
college, higher Grade Point Average on year after high school graduation,
persistence in college 2 years after high school graduation, transfer from
2-year to 4-year program, and post-graduation labor market success. The study
also examines post-secondary factors on performance and retention in METTE, such
as student engagement in institutional support activities, academic experiences
and enrollment in remedial courses, and external demands such as employment and
family responsibilities. In addition, Local Leadership Teams (LLT) at the 2-year
colleges are engaged in campus-level action research studies to examine locally
or regionally important issues associated with strengthening student success
and/or improving their METTE programs to meet the workforce development needs of
the locale or region. Findings will be disseminated through publications and
national and local presentations.
