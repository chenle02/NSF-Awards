There is no known efficient algorithm to test whether two matrices have the same
linear dependencies among their columns. One of the goals of this proposal is to
construct a polynomial-time algorithm for this, provided the entries of the
matrices are from a finite field. Techniques pioneered in the Matroid Minor
Structure Theory by Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle are expected to be crucial
components. A second problem is: given a fixed matrix, how many other matrices
can have the same set of dependencies? Again, we wish to establish an algorithm
to count (and construct) these matrices over a finite field. The proposed
approach involves the notion of a stabilizer by Whittle, techniques from a paper
by Pendavingh and Van Zwam, and a new notion of connectivity. A third line of
research relates to excluded-minor characterizations of matroid classes (similar
to Kuratowski's Theorem for planar graphs). We will focus especially on finding
the excluded minors of subclasses of the quinary matroids. This third line will
have a significant computational component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A collection of
measurements, a stream of digital information, a set of constraints to an
optimization problem: many things can be modeled mathematically by a set of
points in some space. Often the absolute positions of these points are not
important, but their positions relative to each other are. The mathematical
notion of a matroid captures this information. However, sometimes too many point
configurations map to the same abstract matroid, which is a major obstacle in
the study of these point configurations. The main aim of this proposal is a
better understanding of this phenomenon. Additionally, a part of this project is
concerned with the development of reliable, versatile software for matroid
computation, with the intent of integrating this with the open-source Sage
Mathematics Software system. Computers can help with finding patterns and
structure within a class of matroids, or with finding counterexamples to
conjectures.
