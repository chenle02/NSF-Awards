The research will be directed at basic principles and methods for the design,
planning, and implementation of automated construction processes as related to
excavation. The research will develop in three major areas: (1) manipulation
that reasons on force as well as geometry (using mechanical hardware, controls,
sensing, models, and reflexes) to perform force intensive movement through an
inhomogeneous medium where conventional object models do not apply; (2) host
architecture that supports symbolic interpretation, modeling, tactical planning,
and communications to imbue the robot with capabilities to perform as a
harnessed free agent; and (3) planning that supports goal-directed, dynamic
decision making at the strategic level including cognition, design,
optimization, and scheduling.
