9224686 Thummel The focus of this research is the demonstration that carefully
designed receptor systems, based on simple bridged azabiaryls and their
transition metal complexes, can be employed to accomplish useful chemistry.
Pyridazine based bridging ligands offer the opportunity to complex two metals
such that substrate molecules in the coordination sphere of the metal can
interact with one another and provide structural access to the photoredox
catalyzed generation of oxygen from water. Simple and very accessible host
molecules, which have been shown to be excellent urea binders, will be used to
immobilize carbonic and carbamic acids to render them useful as synthetic
intermediates. Carefully tailored hosts will be prepared as a urease mimic to
catalyze the hydrolysis of urea and for the formation of ureaphanes. Finally,
the ferrocene nucleus will be employed as a "variable hinge" in which the
relative orientation of substituents on the two cyclopentadienyl rings can be
controlled. %%% With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Randolph P. Thummel of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Houston. Professor Thummel will focus his work on demonstrating
that carefully designed receptor systems can be employed to accomplish useful
chemistry. Azabiaryl ligands and their transition metal complexes will be used
to catalyze the photoredox generation of oxygen from water, to immobilize
carbonic and carbamic acids to render them useful as synthetic intermediates,
and to be a urease mimic to hydrolyze urea. ***
