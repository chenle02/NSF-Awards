The Board on Mathematical Sciences (BMS), National Research Council (NRC),
through its Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS) will
establish a panel to produce a report spotlighting problem areas in software
engineering to which the application of modern statistical methodology can be
fruitfully applied. The report will both emphasize the relevance of employing
rigorous statistical and probabilistic techniques in software engineering
contexts, and delineate opportunities for further research in this direction. It
will address education and training of software engineers in statistical
methodology, and of statisticians interested in software engineering. The panel
will be composed of software engineers (including human factors specialists),
applied probabilists, and statisticians. The report will influence software
engineering by exhibiting methods for assessing software productivity, quality,
reliability, risk, safety, and management of software development process. It
will outline a program of research in the statistical sciences and their
applications to software engineering. As a subsidiary benefit, this report will
influence other closely related disciplines, e.g., applied mathematics,
operations research, computer science, systems engineering, industrial
engineering, and quality control.
