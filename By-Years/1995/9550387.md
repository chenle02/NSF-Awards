This research focuses on activation of the trans geometry in platinum antitumor
complexes, first studying the reactions of trans- PtCl2(NH3)(quinoline) with
various nucleobases and nucleotides. Platinum (IV) analogs will be prepared and
a careful comparison of platinum (II) and platinum (IV) reactivity with
oligonucleotides will be undertaken using two dimensional and multinuclear
nuclear magnetic resonance. Dr. Roat will also spend a summer research period in
the Netherlands at Leiden University's Gorlaeus laboratories to continue
research collaboration with Jane Rudijik. She will be accompanied by a graduate
student from Virginia Commonwealth University and an undergraduate from
Washington College. Interactive activities include: teaching an
undergraduate/graduate level course in Bioinorganic Chemistry; organizing
seminars for undergraduates, targeting women and minorities, devoted to putting
together competitive applications for undergraduate and graduate research and
academic scholarships and fellowships; and implementing a summer research
exchange between host and home institution students with Leiden University, the
Netherlands where Dr. Roat has extensive collaborative research contacts.
