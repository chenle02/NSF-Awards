The project will investigate the impact of global climate change on future water
availability. The research is motivated, in part, by water management issues,
e.g., the potential of substituted crops/vegetation in mitigating regional
hydrologic change. The NCAR Community Climate System Model (CCSM) will be used
to investigate the interactions between radiative and hydrologic processes. The
impact of different radiative forcing due to anthropogenic carbon dioxide
increases and land-use change scenarios on the water cycle and regional water
availability will be modeled. Dr. Molders will integrate the state-of-the-art
CCSM model for several decades, each time with different land-use and radiative
forcing configurations, and extract answers from careful analysis of the model
runs. In addition to providing insights into sustainability
issues,&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Molders' analysis will provide a rather unique assessment
of the hydrologic potential of this national modeling resource. The project
findings will lead to improved characterization of the regional impacts of
global climate change over Alaska. Given the fragility of the Alaskan ecosystem,
the research is societally relevant. The project is supported as part of NSF's
Water Cycle Research effort
