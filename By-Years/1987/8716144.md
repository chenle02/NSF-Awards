This grant will support the continuation of the analysis of data obtained from
auroral x-ray detectors that were flown on a series of balloons that were flown
from the South Pole Station, Antarctica during the austral summer of 1985-86.
The experiment was done in conjunction with the University of Houston. The
x-rays that were detected were produced by energetic electrons that were
precipitated into the upper atmosphere from the magnetosphere. The data will be
analyzed in conjunction with electric field data measured on the same balloons
by the University of Houston group as well as with data from a number of ground
based instruments such as the University of Maryland riometers, the Bell Labs
and University of New Hampshire magnetometers and the conjugate radars at Goose
Bay, Labrador and Sondrestrom, Greenland. In addition the data will be compared
with the available spacecraft data to determine the conditions under which
energetic auroral electron precipitation occurs. The University of Maryland and
the proposers are well equipped to carry out this research.
