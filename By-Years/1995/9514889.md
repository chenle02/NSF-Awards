9514889 Mulloney The exploration of the neuronal bases for animal movements is
one of the most challenging tasks that faces the neuroscientist. This task is
made feasible through the study of simpler model systems, which are found among
invertebrate animals. Dr. Mulloney has shown through his previous NSF support
that in the crayfish small neural circuits in each body segment genepate the
basic rhythmic movements, and that a separate neuronal coordinating system
organizes the local movements into a coordinated pattern. With this additional
funding, he will explore in more detail the specific means by which the
reciprocally inhibitory interactions among identified neurons generate the basic
oscillatory patterns of the local circuits. Mathematical simulation of the
physiologically defined interactions by Dr. Mulloney will test the progress of
the neurophysiological description and guide the conduct of further
experimentation. The results from these studies will enhance our understanding
of the neuronal bases for movements in all animals and have broad applications
in the design of robotic locomotion systems.
