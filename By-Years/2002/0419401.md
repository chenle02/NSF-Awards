This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on vapor-
selective membranes that are stabilized through the addition of nanoscale
fillers. Vapor-selective membranes, which preferentially permeate the larger
molecules in a gas mixture, are used in industrial separation applications such
as organic monomer recovery in polyolefin production and natural gas dew point
adjustment. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a membrane material with modest
selectivity, is typically used in separations of this type. Polymers with
superior selectivity properties have been identified, but these materials suffer
performance degradation over time due to physical aging. Recently, we have
discovered that the addition of certain nanoscale fillers stabilizes these
highly-selective polymers. In the proposed project, such fillers will be added
to high-performance, vapor-selective polymers to yield novel, stable
nanocomposite membranes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful development of the
proposed membranes would allow the recovery of hydrogen from refinery streams
that cannot be cost-effectively separated with conventional technologies,
including currently available membranes. Flaring of these off-gas streams
results in an estimated annual loss of $300 million to U.S. refineries.
