This proposal requests funds to support a study of the mechanisms that regulate
the concentration of the intracellular osmolyte, glycine betaine, in response to
hyperosmotic stress. Glycine betaine is an extremely common and important
osmolyte in a wide variety of species ranging from bacteria to plants and
animals. Although a great deal is known about the salinity induced regulation of
glycine betaine in bacteria, far less is known about its regulation in plants
and even less in animals. We have found that oysters (Cassostrea virginica) from
the Atlantic coast utilize substantial amounts of glycine betaine to regulate
intracellular osmotic concentrations following hyperosmotic stress. Conspecific
oysters from the Chesapeake Bay have much smaller levels of glycine betaine that
do not change following high salinity stress, and the Bay oysters are not as
salinity tolerant. Since the mitochondrion is usually the site of glycine
betaine synthesis, these results suggest that these two populations of oysters
differ at the mitochondrial level. This proposal contains experiments designed
to test that possibility by comparing several aspects of the mechanism of
salinity induced glycine betaine synthesis between the Bay and Atlantic oysters.
The results will contribute a great deal to the understanding of glycine betaine
regulation and, in addition, should resolve whether the differences between the
oyster populations are genetic or environmentally founded.
