The 21st International Conference on Random Structures & Algorithms will take
place at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, June 12 - 16, 2023. The
conference will feature 8 plenary lectures by leading researchers in the field
as well as contributed talks.

This is a biennial meeting, initiated in 1983 by the Faculty of Mathematics,
Adam Mickiewicz University, in Poznan, Poland. The aims of these conferences are
to present recent research results and to identify and explore directions for
further research in random discrete structures, randomized algorithms, and broad
areas of application of probabilistic methods in discrete mathematics, computer
science, and related fields. For more information see the conference web page:
