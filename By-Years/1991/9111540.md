Research is proposed by an interdisciplinary group of researchers at the
University of Texas who will attempt breakthroughs in Computational Fluid
Dynamics by exploiting advances in computer architectures, algorithms, data
structures and computing strategies in a unified and fully coordinated way so
that each component of the overall computing process can be optimized. Advances
are expected in adaptive algorithms, parallel computational models and parallel
programming systems, parallel/ adaptive data structures, and new applications of
these in CFD.
