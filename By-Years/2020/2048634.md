This dissertation project will investigate how resident communities, working
with professional planners and non-governmental design experts, develop novel
infrastructural visions and capacities for new public housing. Exploring urban
design initiatives that involve under-served neighborhoods in the creation of
future housing designs and policy strategies, it analyzes their efficacy in
responding to inequalities as well as ecological disruptions (such as fires,
flooding and droughts). In addition to providing funding for the training of a
graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical, scientific data
collection and analysis, the project will enhance the scientific understanding
of contemporary urban housing needs by communicating its findings in visual
presentations, workshops, and reports to stakeholder communities and experts.
The results will also be shared with planning officials and design professionals
as they formulate the next generation of housing designs and policies
assessments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will assess and interpret the
values, visions, and potential advantages of housing infrastructure that is
incrementally built and upgraded through citizenâ€™s participation in the design,
building, and maintenance over time. By analyzing how planners and designers
introduce new scalable housing solutions, this research will examine the
economic, social, and affective investments of both residents and professionals.
Through twelve months of extended ethnographic research, including participant
observation, semi-structured interviews, archival work, spatial mapping and with
a collaborative analytic, this research will investigate how the strategies
utilized by resident communities, design and planning professionals, and
government initiatives, may be creating innovative responses to continuous
socio-economic inequality, dispossessions, and ecological hazards. The research
results will address concerns regarding how people cope with and react to the
rise of housing demands and new infrastructure requirements in an era of
ecological hazards, scarce urban land, and continuous socio-spatial
segregations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
