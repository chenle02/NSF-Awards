This project will make theoretical and numerical investigations of the nonlinear
partial differential equations that describe structured models of cell
population dynamics. Individual cells are distinguished by structure variables
corresponding to size, age, or other physical characteristics. The populations
are divided into population subclasses that interact through nonlinear
transition rates. The main objective will be to understand the qualitative
behavior of the populations, the on- set of oscillatory phenomena, and the
response to external periodic loss functions. The main methods will apply the
theory of semigroups of positive linear and nonlinear operators in Banach
lattices. The main applications will be to tumor cell populations with
proliferating and quiescent classes and to multi-level blood cell production
systems. The goal in the tumor cell population studies will be to understand the
role of quiescence in tumor growth and tumor therapy. The goal in the blood cell
population studies will be to understand the regulation processes in normal and
abnormal systems.
