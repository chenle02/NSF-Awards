The study will analyze a unique set of seismic data from the Endeavor segment
of Juan de Fuca Ridge collected 1991 to determine patterns of seismicity, its
correlation to vent activity and to test the hypothesis of two types of
earthquake systems on this part of the Ridge. This study will help lead to an
understanding of time scales of ridge processes and help plan the future long-
term RIDGE observatory in the area to be deployed in 1994-95.
