It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made
up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program
supported by this award is to measure the quark structure of light particles
called mesons. The proposed research will support the research infrastructure by
commissioning new equipment to produce linearly a beam of high-energy photons
from scattered electrons produced by the accelerator at the Thomas Jefferson
National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). The research will also include
computer simulations of the particle detector in Hall D at Jefferson Lab.
Participation of students in the research effort is a central component of this
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental program proposed here embodies
one of Jefferson Lab's priorities: to elucidate the underlying structure of
protons, neutrons, and mesons. The particles of interest here are called hybrid
mesons, which are identified as having quantum numbers not allowed in the
constituent quark model, due to extra degrees of freedom provided by gluons,
which are the force-carriers of the strong force. The discovery of hybrid mesons
would be a triumph of modern theoretical models based on the theory of quantum
chromodynamics (QCD). This award will also provide support for personnel to
commission the linearly polarized photon beam and the electron tagger as part of
the GlueX experiment In Hall D of Jefferson Lab.
