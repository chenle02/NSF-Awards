93-61464 Flaming The advent of highly fluorescent cation specific probes coupled
with video imaging technologies has led to a sure of interest in photometric
measurement of ion distributions in single living cells. Of particular interest
has been the quantitation of cytosolic fee calcium concentrations ( Ca2+ i)
utilizing the fluorescent dye Fura-2 and dual wavelength ratio imaging. One of
the current technical difficulties encountered, but an important goal for Ca2+ i
ratio imaging, is the ability to perform real- time imaging (i.e. video frame
rates of 30 frames per second). When using Fura-2, the ability to follow fast
changes in Ca2+ i can be limited by the rate at which the excitation wavelengths
are chopped. If ratioing is to be done in real time, the requirement if that the
excitation wavelength be switched within the vertical blanking period of a video
signal (1200). The intent of this project is to develop a high speed UV-
wavelength switching (excitation) system for real time optical imaging of the
nervous system. This Phase I proposal will specifically address the feasibility
of utilizing a dual scanning galvanometer system to switch between multiple
interference filters. ***
