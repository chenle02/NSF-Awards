*** 9711325 Blackwell REC 9711325 (SGER) Institution: U.S. Space and Rocket
Center Proposer: Tommie R. Blackwell Title: "Collaborative Research for Spatial
Technology Applications and Training" Amount: $100,000 This is an SGER proposal
for exploratory research on the educational applications of spatial technologies
with the specific purpose of creating a model of teaching,learning, and
outreach.This model is intended to assist the proposer in developing a future
(not included in this proposal) educational demonstration project in spatial
technologies. The project will be overseen by the proposing institution in
conjunction with Auburn University, NASA Marshall, NASA Global Hydrology and
Climate Center, and the Huntsville Botanical Gardens. SRI International has been
subcontracted to perform much of the exploratory research encompassed in this
stage of the project.
