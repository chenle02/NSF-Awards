The Microelectronics Facility at Brown University requires funds to upgrade
clean-rooms. One thousand square feet of facility space will be upgraded to
class-1000, or better, clean-room grade. In addition, some obsolete and broken
equipment will be replaced. It is proposed that the funds be used to purchase
rapid thermal processors and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition
equipment. Replacements or upgrades will be made to rf- sputtering systems,
furnaces and vacuum equipment.
