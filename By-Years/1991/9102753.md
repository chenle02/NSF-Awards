Recent developments in meta-logics and logical frameworks have lead to a new
notion of syntax appropriate for specifying computations on such data structures
as programs, formulas, proofs, types, and lambda- terms. New meta-programming
languages and computer systems have already been designed around these new
approaches to syntax. Semantics of meta programs seem to be best explained using
combinations of proof theoretic concepts, Kripke models, realizability, and
logical relations. This award supports further research into intuitutionistic,
constructive, and linear logics. Much of this research is inspired by topics in
computational logic, logic programming, and meta-programming. Theoretical
results of this work will be applied to issues of programming language design so
that logical principles of syntax can be made directly accessible to programmers
and system builders and to keep a practical and experimental focus to this
proposed research.
