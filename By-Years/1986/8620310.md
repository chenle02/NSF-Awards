Branch will further analyze the optical spectra of young supernovae, "young"
referring to a time when one observes an "atmosphere" reminiscent of a star. The
atmosphere is analyzed by a computer program for synthetic spectra. One goal is
to determine the shells of various chemical abundances in the progenitor star by
analysing the ejected distributions. A second topic concerns radio observations
of historically observed supernovae. Second-epoch observations are already
becoming feasible. Some aging stars are shattered by a giant explosion that we
observe as a supernova. The explosion generates most of the elements of which
the Earth and life is made. Observation of supernovae can inform us of the
structure of the star that exploded and more generally about the evolution of
stars and of our astronomical surroundings. Branch will continue two lines of
investigating supernovae. Mainly, he will analyse the radiation spectrum emitted
when a supernova is still young and bright. His work is very timely in view of
the newly observed supernova. Branch will also investigate the radio emissions
of slightly older supernovae to show how the newly exploding supernovae are
transformed into the still older nebular supernova remnants of which the Crab
Nebula is a famous example.
