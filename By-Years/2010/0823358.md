This research seeks to determine how reticulospinal neurons mediate sensorimotor
behavior. Sensorimotor behavior is any motor action that is guided by a sensory
stimulus, for example, an itch guiding the hand to the correct spot to scratch.
This requires three general steps in the nervous system. In the first step, the
brain receives information about the stimulus through sensory nerves. In the
last step, neurons in the brain send outputs to the spinal cord that specify
muscle contractions. The middle step, which is the focus of this research, is
the transformation of sensory signals into the appropriate motor signals.
Hindbrain reticulospinal neurons receive sensory input and project axons to the
spinal cord, but their function is not well understood. A detailed map of the
synaptic inputs and outputs of reticulospinal neurons will be generated with the
goal of answering two specific questions: 1. Do different reticulospinal neurons
process information about different parts of the body?, and 2. Do specific
reticulospinal neurons always connect to the same types of spinal neurons?
Zebrafish larvae offer unique technical advantages for these studies, and since
reticulospinal neurons have similar features across all vertebrates, what is
learned in zebrafish may be applicable to other animals. The methods used will
include neuroanatomy, neurophysiological recording, analysis of behavior, and
computational modeling of neural circuits. Obtaining a detailed map of
reticulospinal synaptic connections would not be feasible in other vertebrates,
so this research has the potential to reveal new principles of reticulospinal
sensorimotor function. This project will also have many positive impacts on
education and student training at Humboldt State University. These include
providing four students each semester with paid research assistantships,
instituting a new course in cellular neuroscience, and making a confocal
microscope system available to other faculty researchers.
