The 19th Particles and Nuclei International Conference (PANIC) will be held at
MIT in Cambridge, MA, on July 24-29, 2011. This major triennial international
conference showcases the most significant developments of interest to both the
nuclear and particle physics communities and is expected to attract about 600
attendees. In addition, 2011 will be the centennial of the discovery of the
atomic nucleus by Rutherford and it is planned to make the celebration of this
seminal event a major theme of the meeting.

This award will enable extended participation to interested people who would not
otherwise be able to attend, through 1) video recording and online distribution
of the plenary sessions so that scientists from all over the world can
participate, 2) video recording and website access of the pedagogical lecture
session on the Sunday before the official conference begins, aimed at advanced
undergraduates and graduate students just beginning their research, 3) video
recording and online distribution of the public lectures by Profs. Brian
Cathcart and Jerome Friedman, and 4) providing support for an MIT Undergraduate
Research Opportunities student to help with a limited program to high school
physics teachers and students.
