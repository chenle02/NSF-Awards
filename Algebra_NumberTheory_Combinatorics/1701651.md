The study of the abstract properties of numbers and their relations has appeared
at an early stage in the history of every civilization, and reflection on the
problems of number theory is consistently found at the root of most of the ideas
that characterize contemporary life, from timekeeping, to the symmetry concepts
of modern physics, to the logic of computers. Numbers can be studied in two
different ways that are nearly independent: they can be used for measurement and
they can be used to do arithmetic. The interaction between these two properties
has always been the basis of number theory. The second half of the twentieth
century saw the formulation of several ambitious research programs that aimed at
obtaining a systematic understanding of these interactions by studying numbers
and their relations with the help of symmetry. The branch of mathematics
concerned with their geometric symmetries is called arithmetic geometry; the
branch concerned with their dynamical symmetries is called automorphic forms.
The Langlands program aims to unify these two branches by showing how each kind
of symmetry encodes the other. Contemporary theoretical physics has introduced
the concept of higher order symmetries, based on new notions of space that
themselves owe a great deal to earlier developments in number theory; more
recently, higher order symmetries have been of increasing importance in the
Langlands program. This project explores the role of higher order symmetries in
connection with several specific questions in the Langlands program, with the
ultimate aim of contributing to the understanding of solutions of equations in
whole numbers.

The project is a contribution to the arithmetic theory of automorphic forms, in
the setting of the Langlands program, with special attention to the arithmetic
of motives and their associated Galois representations, directly or by
application of congruence methods. The specific goals of the project are the
study of the local Langlands parametrizations for general groups, using trace
formula methods; the proof of Deligne's conjecture on special values of
L-functions, especially tensor product L-functions; the verification of
Venkatesh's conjecture on derived Hecke algebras for modular forms of weight 1,
using an unexpected relation with p-adic L-functions; and the development of a
character theory for mod p representations of p-adic groups. The methods
involved in the present project combine standard techniques from arithmetic
geometry and automorphic forms, an approach to cohomological automorphic forms
based on differential geometry and representation theory, categorical
representation theory, as well as new methods.
