This conference will bring together leading American and Israeli experts to
discuss recent developments and directions of future research in various applied
aspects of the constructive theory of approximation. Agenda topics include
multivariate splines, computer aided design, finite elements, and digital
filters. Approximation theory provides an important bridge between Mathematical
Analysis and Applied Mathematics, and has applications to certain geological
problems, signal processing, and numerical analysis.
