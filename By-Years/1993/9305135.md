This award will support the continued development of the Nucleic Acid Database,
a database of three-dimensional structures of nucleic acids and their
intermolecular complexes. The goal is to devise an easily accessible and user
friendly resource that serves a broad group of nucleic acid researchers. It is
anticipated that the users of the database will include not only structural
analysts such as crystallographers, theorists, and NMR spectroscopists, but also
physical chemists who study macroscopic phenomena and molecular biologists who
focus on the biological properties of these molecules. Substantial progress has
been made in meeting the goal set three years ago in establishing the database;
the available crystallographic data have been assembled, software has been
developed to process and access the data, and the information is distributed
electronically. The focus now is to make the database into a powerful research
tool by providing methods for structure validation and structure prediction
while at the same time making the primary and derivative data available to the
scientific community.
