9618728 Fisk Substantial evidence supports the view that microorganisms can
affect geochemical change in the atmosphere, hydrosphere and sediments. Little
is known , however, about microbial influence on chemical change in the
lithosphere. Recently, new evidence has indicated that the alteration of basalts
may be affected by the presence of microbial life which influence the rate of
alteration and the composition of products. The objective of this award is to
test for microbes in basalts and to determine the distribution and identity of
these communities. Initially basalts from existing collections will be screened
for carbon, nucleic acids, and textures that have been reported as evidence of
endolithic microorganisms. DNA or RNA will then be extracted to further identify
the organisms present. ***
