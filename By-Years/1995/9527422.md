Abstract EEC-9527422 This award provides funding to Harvard University for
support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development Program entitled,
"Analysis, Control and Optimization of Discrete Event Dynamic Systems." The CRCD
program emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting research advances in
important technology areas into the upper level undergraduate and graduate
engineering curricula and stimulates faculty researchers to place renewed, equal
value on quality education and curriculum development. This three year program,
involving faculty from Harvard University, Boston University and the University
of Massachusetts at Amherst will develop a curriculum in the multidisciplinary
area of Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS) based on research accomplishments
and consisting of new courses and a novel laboratory setting for the study of
these large, complex, and expensive engineering systems. *** ??
