0116765&lt;br/&gt;Lowe&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to acquire equipment to be
used in the development of a field instrument for the identification and
quantitation of microorganisms in environmental samples. The instrument involves
nucleic acid hybridizations on the surface of microscopic, fluorescent,
polystyrene beads in order to identify specific DNA sequences in heterogeneous
mixtures of sequences. Specific objectives include: (1) the development of
hardware specifications for the instrument, (2) specification of the
calibrations which must be conducted in order to make quantitatively accurate
measurements of several microorganisms, and (3) develop the software and
statistical analysis procedure for analyzing the data. &lt;br/&gt;
