This project addresses the nature of cellular processes by which eukaryotic
chromosomes generate and maintain heritable variation in gene control without
altering DNA sequence. These processes are experimentally simple to study when
they operate on, or nearby, genes affecting the production of colorful pigments.
Paramutation is a term used to describe one such process in which interactions
between parental chromosomes lead to heritable alterations in gene regulation.
Examples of paramutation in both plants and animals appear to violate Mendel's
first law of genetics that genes remain unchanged following sexual transmission.
The paramutation process thus challenges fundamental assumptions of modern
biology and presents novel concepts regarding the genesis and maintenance of
'genetic' variation. This project will employ biochemistry, molecular biology,
mutational and pedigree analyses to identify specific genomic sequences and
associated molecular changes responsible for these dynamic behaviors occurring
at the purple plant 1 (pl1) locus in corn. Mutations that functionally define
these regions at the pl1 gene as well as mutations that identify at least nine
other integral components of the paramutation mechanism will be used to achieve
these aims. This research will clarify the types of genome sequences that
moderate these dynamic behaviors and reveal the types of chromosome
modifications responsible for transmitting heritable, non-DNA encoded,
regulatory information. Identification of genomic regions susceptible to
paramutation will aid in deciphering important regulatory information of
sequenced eukaryotic genomes. Further broader impacts of the project include
providing educational and research training outreach in the areas of plant
biology, genetics, and chromosome structure/function relationships for both
graduate students, underrepresented minority undergraduates and high school
students. Understanding this particular mechanism of eukaryotic genetics
promises impacts to current research related to fundamental issues of
agriculture.
