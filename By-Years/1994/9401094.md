9401094 Cifelli This is a proposal to collect mammals and small vertebrates from
the Cedar Mountain formation of Utah, a site known to date from the Early
Cretaceous period. This time period is not well represented by fossils in
existing collections, and the Cedar Mountain fossil fauna is known to be rich.
The project will yield data to great interest for studies of paleoecology and
biogeography because dramatic changes have occurred in the faunas of the Late
Jurassic and Late Cretaceous, the periods preceding and following that
represented by the Cedar Mountain fauna. These changes are presumed to be a
result of the origin of flowering plants during this span. The collections will
provide a basis for evaluation of contrasting hypotheses on the origin,
paleobiogeography, and phylogeny of mammals and other microvertebrates. The
fauna of the Cedar Mountain Formation will also complement a relatively complete
sequence of assemblages from the Late Cretaceous of Utah for documenting long-
term taxonomic, morphologic, and compositional changes in the terrestrial biota
during a critical phase of its history.
