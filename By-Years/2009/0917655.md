ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;06 July 2009&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0917655&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution&lt;br/&gt;PI: A. Suchy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests
five Shipboard Scientific Support items for Woods Hole as well as other vessels
in the academic fleet; namely up-graded deck structure aboard the R/V ATLANTIS
to support ROPOS, a group purchase of six (6) additional Fleet Broadband
satellite communications systems including expanded satellite time to continue
the 2008 pilot project, a new autopilot for R/V OCEANUS, and additional design
work for and purchase of a portable A-frame to support the GEOTRACES cruise
aboard the global class vessels. All items will either enhance safety or provide
greatly improved support capabilities to science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: Woods Hole vessels support federally funded scientific research
throughout the world?s oceans and routinely expose graduate and undergraduate
students to seagoing oceanography. All told, the KNORR, ATLANTIS, and OCEANUS
are scheduled to complete over 550 NSF sponsored days in 2009. &lt;br/&gt;
