High rates of organic matter degradation near the sediment- water interface
together with slow CaCO3 dissolution are expected to result in pore waters that
are undersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate to depths exceeding 57cm in
heimpelagic sediments. This hypothesis will be tested by determining the
effective in situ CaCO3 dissolution rate constant and estimating integrated
rates of organic carbon and CaCO3 regeneration at three stations that underlie
the California Current westward of Point Conception, California. In the first
year, the thrust will be to further develop, calibrate and test PCO2 and pH
micro- electrodes. Field work will be conducted both at the end of the first and
the second year.
