In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Paul Barbara of the University of Texas at Austin will
conduct research with his student and postdoctoral colleagues on the development
of Fluorescence-Voltage Single Molecule Spectroscopy (F-V SMS) as a powerful
tool for probing the molecular level properties and processes of nanomaterials
and nanomaterials-based devices. The specific techniques, methods and
theoretical models developed in this research will provide a powerful new tool
for the investigation of technologically-important materials to be used in
future electronics applications, including OLEDs, medical sensors and solar
cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the broader scientific impact of the
research, the research will result in the training of two female postdoctoral
researchers in the Prof. Barbara's laboratory, as well as the training of
graduate students. Prof. Barbara and his postdoctoral and graduate student
colleagues will also be participating in the "Nano at the Border" program, which
provides research and educational opportunities to disadvantaged Hispanic
students. This program was co-founded by Prof. Barbara in 2002.&lt;br/&gt;
