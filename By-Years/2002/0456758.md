In recent years great strides have been made in lattice quantum chromodynamics
(LQCD) from tadpole improvement and improved discretizations1 to simulations
that include up to three flavors of dynamical quarks. It is possible to use
coarser lattices than previously thought, decreasing the cost of simulations by
as much as a factor of 10. In addition to a decrease in the cost of simulations,
the time required for lattice simulations has also significantly decreased, the
simplest calculations can now be done on a personal computer. Most importantly,
it is now possible to perform high precision LQCD calculations, often with
errors on the order of 1% or less, that can be used to test QCD and to predict
experimental results. The implications of these new techniques are of particular
importance to heavy quark physics. This project focuses on precision LQCD
calculations of experimentally measurable quantities and to extending to higher
order in powers of v/c knowledge of the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) Lagrangian
that can be used in other calculations. The project involves collaboration with
members of the high precision quantum chromodynamics (HPQCD) and United Kingdom
quantum chromodynamics (UKQCD) collaborations and will focus on NRQCD
calculations of heavy quark bound states, in particular, on the fine structure
of the Upsilon meson which is a bound state of a bottom quark and a bottom anti-
quark &lt;br/&gt;
