This award will partially fund the travel expenses for invited participants for
a workshop on "Biotechnology Applications in Biomaterials". The workshop will be
held on April 28, 1993 in conjunction with the Society for Biomaterials 1993
Annual Meeting in Birmingham, Alabama. The workshop will have sessions on
Biomolecular Materials, Self-Assembly Systems and Tissue Engineering. This
conference is important since it will cover topics related to two Federal
Coordinating Committees on Science, Engineering and Technology (FCCSET)
initiatives. Also, the workshop should define areas of research that will be
needed to advance the bioengineering field of biomaterials.
