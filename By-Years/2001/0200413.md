This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Diversity of fungi within living
leaves: molecular insights into ecology and evolution of endophytic fungi in
leaves of tropical trees." Fungal endophytes, fungi inhabiting plants without
causing disease, are highly diverse in tropical trees, yet are poorly known.
This research assesses tropical endophyte diversity using (a) traditional
isolations and multilocus sequencing and (b) direct amplification of endophyte
DNA from leaves. Its overall goal is to integrate endophytes into the broader
fungal phylogeny and explore the evolution of fungus-photobiont associations.
