9412708 Shankar This summer faculty internship permits the investigators to work
with industrial designs, evolve their own realistic design examples, incorporate
such experiences into the Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) courses taught at
the university and develop video tutorials useful for both the students and the
industry engineers. This project uses a commercial package for top-down design
and simulation and a commercial suite of custom VLSI tools for bottom- up
design. This project's materials is targeted to two junior undergraduate courses
in computer architecture and VLSI.
