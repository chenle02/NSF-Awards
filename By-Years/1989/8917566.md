In this project, the PI will develop a model of the RD Instruments (RDI)
Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler system, in order to evaluate the performance
of the system under a variety of simulated conditions, and to obtain estimates
of the errors in the velocities measured by the profilers. Model results will be
used to improve the performance and enhance the analysis of the data being
obtained from these general purpose instruments.
