Earth is surrounded by electrons and ions that create beautiful auroral displays
but are also a hazard for satellites. These particles collect on satellite
surfaces causing the satellite to charge to high levels. A sudden discharge can
cause a damaging surge in electronic components and cause the satellite to
behave in unexpected ways or completely stop responding. The SCOPULI project
will investigate the physical mechanisms that produce this hazardous charged
particle environment, educate society about the causes and effects of these
charging events, and build tools to help government and industry prevent
damaging impacts to our satellite infrastructure. SCOPULI is a collaborative
project between the University of California Los Angeles, the University of
Colorado Boulder, Space Hazards Applications, and Space Weather Solutions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop physics- and machine-learning
based models that span the solar wind and magnetosphere, and provide estimates
of energetic (eV to keV) electron flux to predict spacecraft surface charging
hazards. Models of electron population and of electric and magnetic fields, in
combination with injection events with existing data products via data
assimilation and machine learning, will be leveraged to develop a charging
environment prediction capability. The models will allow users to provide their
own satellite specifics, thus allowing for new or non-standard designs to be
tested and provided charging predictions. The team will develop curriculum
materials and interactive simulations with science teachers (grades 6-12), as
well as industry-ready tools for real-time specification of space weather. A
postdoc and graduate students will be involved in all aspects of the project.
ANSWERS projects advance the nationâ€™s STEM expertise and societal resilience to
space weather hazards by filling key knowledge gaps regarding the coupled Sun-
Earth system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
