This research is to systematically determine temporal source properties of deep
earthquakes including the source spectrum, seismic energies, stress drops, rise
times, and durations from teleseismic broadband waveforms. Recently available
broadband digital seismograms from the Global Digital Seismic Network (GDSN)
supported by NSF provide a valuable data set of waveforms from deep earthquakes.
Preliminary results show no systematic change in stress drop with depth or
moment for events from 10 to 670 km deep within subducting oceanic slabs,
although the scatter is large. Rise times, however, become shorter for events
deeper that about 550 km. Below 100 to 200 km depth, pressure and temperature in
the subducting slab inhibit the brittle failure that causes earthquakes at
shallower depths. The goal of this research is to determine the physical process
that allows deep earthquakes to occur, one of the outstanding problems in solid
earth geophysics.
