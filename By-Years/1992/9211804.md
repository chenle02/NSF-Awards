This project is a program for sponsoring electrical engineering student travel
to the 1992 Power Engineering Society's Summer Meeting in Seattle, WA. Students
will be invited to participate in a variety of activities such as a luncheon,
panel discussions, technical tours, and tutorial sessions. These activities are
designed to broaden the student's understanding of technical issues as well as
the rapidly changing electric power industry. The program will support the
attendance of upper level undergraduate or master's level students. While the
NSF portion of this project will support 20 students, industrial matching funds
will be requested in order to increase the number of participants.
