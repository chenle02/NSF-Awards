The Visitor Studies Association (VSA) will plan a Continuing Education Program
for Mid-Career (Practicing) Professionals in informal learning research and
evaluation. VSA is in a position to expand its traditional in-depth workshop
program to a more comprehensive and systematic, non-formal, continuing education
program. The planning activity will take place in conjunction with the 2005 VSA
annual conference. During the planning meeting, content and process will be
examined and the end result will be a plan that includes recommended content,
competence and a flexible, creative delivery mechanism. The project will
directly addresse the informal learning infrastructure as the need for
understanding the processes and products of informal learning, and as outcome-
based evaluation becomes increasingly important due to the ever growing interest
in program accountability. Once this program is in place it will serve those
mid-career professionals who recognize visitor studies as a profession with its
own body of knowledge, principles and ongoing research. It will serve those who
are interested in research in informal learning and evaluation regardless of how
they came to be in the field or how their job relates to evaluation.
