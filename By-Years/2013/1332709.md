This award will support a Writing Workshop for Junior Researchers, which will be
held at the Joint Statistical Meetings, August 3-8, 2013, in Montreal, Canada.
The workshop will train junior researchers in effective technical writing. The
goal is to help new researchers in the statistical sciences who seek to publish
their research or to present their research plans in the form of grant proposals
for federal funding. Researchers, especially new researchers, often have
difficulty disseminating their research results not because of the quality of
the research but rather because of inappropriate choices of publication venues
for the particular research and/or because of poor presentation of technical
material to the chosen audience. The National Institute of Statistical Sciences
and the American Statistical Association will manage the Workshop.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will open with tutorial sessions on the
organization of material for a technical article or grant application, on
technical writing techniques and on the specific missions and audiences of key
journals in the statistical sciences. Then each participating new researcher
will work individually with an experienced journal editor as mentor to address
these issues on an individualized basis for draft of the new researcher's work
in progress. Revisions following this guidance will be critiqued by the mentor
to assure that the new researcher's implementation of writing techniques has
been successful before the article or the grant proposal is submitted for
review.
