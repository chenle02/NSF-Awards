Studies using mitochondria from spf ash mice, which are severely deficient in
ornithine transcarbamylase, will clarify the mechanism of the specific
requirement for ornithine of carbamyl phosphate synthetase (ammonia) in situ.
Experiments using liver mitochondria from normal, spf, and spf ash mice will
establish the effects of interactions of carbamyl phosphate synthetase (ammonia)
and ornithine transcarbamylase with the inner membrane on their catalytic
properties, and the effect that the mutations have on the channelling
extramitochondrial ornithine to ornithine transcarbamylase. The relative
contribution of this enzyme and of carbamyl phosphate synthetase (ammonia) to
the control of citrulline synthesis will be analyzed. Experiments using rat and
mouse liver mitochondria will be done to obtain quantitative information on the
role of matrix carbonic anhydrase in the supply of HCO3- to carbamyl phosphate
synthetase (ammonia) and to pyruvate carboxylase, and to determine the Km values
of these enzymes in situ for HCO3-. The significance of this work lies in the
information it will yield on the properties of proteins under the conditions
which prevail in cells, and on how enzymes and metabolic pathways function in
situ. In their normal environment, many enzymes appear to have kinetic
properties different from those they exhibit in solution. Examples are several
of the enzymes of the pathway of urea synthesis, two of which (carbamyl
phosphate synthetase (ammonia) and ornithine transcarbamylase) are in the
mitochondrial matrix, and the remaining three in the cytoplasm. Work to date
shows that, although these enzymes are soluble, several of their substrates are
channelled between cell compartments or enzymes, suggesting that the enzymes are
organized within the cell. In addition, these studies show that some kinetic
characteristics of the two mitochondrial enzymes in situ differ from those they
exhibit in solution.***//
