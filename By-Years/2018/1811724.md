Networks play a fundamental role in many areas of science, such as the network
of friendships in sociology and protein-protein interaction networks in biology.
At the heart of problems in these areas is a need to understand underlying
structures in the relevant network, such as geometric structure and community
structure. Many networks evolve and grow over time and this leaves a mark on
their underlying structure. The broad goal of this project is to understand how
the growth of a network interacts with other underlying structures such as
community structure. The project focuses on a mathematical understanding of
fundamental network models that are common to many applications. Developing such
a mathematical theory can lead to fundamental insights that can be applied
across multiple disciplines, as well as to connections between disciplines that
can lead to further cross-disciplinary explorations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project studies a wide range of problems involving probabilistic models of
dynamic networks. The project aims to build novel probabilistic theory to
analyze and provide insight into such models, as well as to build and analyze
novel models that shed light on new phenomena. A main focus is on models of
growing networks, which are abundant in the social sciences, economics, and
biology. In particular, the project will investigate the influence of the seed
graph in growing random graph models. In doing so, the award will develop novel
probabilistic tools to obtain quantitative results on the limits of branching
processes, which are of independent interest more widely in probability theory
and related fields. A second theme of the project will be the study of community
detection in growing networks by introducing probabilistic models of growing
networks with community structure. This perspective lends itself to relevant new
questions, such as detecting communities from networks observed at multiple time
points. Finally, the award will also study stochastic processes on networks,
resulting in enhanced understanding of how information spreads on
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
