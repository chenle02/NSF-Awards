Microwave discharges have been developed and applied to a number of
applications ranging from electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma and ion
sources for semiconductor etching and deposition to plasma-assisted CVD sources
for diamond film. This research is directed toward the improved understanding of
electromagnetic coupling and heating processes that take place in these
physically bounded, high-density microwave discharges. The approach will combine
experimental data which is obtained from carefully constructed experiments, with
the analogous data front theoretical/numerical models, which are formulated to
match the actual experiment. It is expected that results from this research will
not only be the improved understanding of the fundamentals of microwave coupling
and heating in bounded high-densitv discharges, but will also be the improved
design and process controllability of these plasma sources. Theoretical modeling
will also be performed at a more detailed numerical simulation level. The
modeling effort will develop numerical simulation models for the behavior of
microwave plasma sources which are capable of understanding and predicting
source outputs, non-linearity, hysteresis and multiple steady states. Such an
understanding of the external circuit control and the energy coupling (i.e.,
electromagnetic field structure, coupling, and plasma heating) within the plasma
source is key to understanding source stability, process controllability and
further to microwave plasma source scaling and uniformity design issues in the
future.
