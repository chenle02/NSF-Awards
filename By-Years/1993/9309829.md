9309829 Woodward We propose to develop a high-order Godunov code or 2-D and 3-D
ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) problems. We will implement this code on a
variety of high performance computers, with particular emphasis on massively
parallel sustems like the 544-node CM-5 Connection Machine available to us at
the University of Minnesota. The major ingredients for this new code are already
in place. The work which remains is to build these elements into an efficient
code suitable for solving grand challenge problems of both a basic research and
of a practical nature.
