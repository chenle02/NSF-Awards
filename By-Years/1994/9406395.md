9306395 Ashley This workshop will help clarify the utilization of sedimentary
geology and paleontology (SG&P) in understanding and resolving environmental and
resource challenges in the early 21st century. Goals are: 1) identify future
applications of SG&P in terms of careers and needed skills; 2) identify research
advances needed to facilitate the use of SG&P, and formulate a strategy for
fostering these advances; 3) provide advice to the (higher and continuing)
education communities on anticipated needs in curricula and facilities; 4)
develop a strategy for demonstrating the value of SG&P to potential users.
