This research will construct an historical case study of the model organism,
Caenorhabditis elegans, in order to illuminate general philosophical and
historical issues at the foundations of the biomedical sciences. Although there
is a developing historical literature on factors governing organismal choice
based on important case studies, little work has been done to trace historical
and scientific factors surrounding the choice and development of the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans as a so-called model organism despite the prominence it
has achieved as the focus of a highly successful research program. Further,
biologists' use of the term `model organism` and its historical development and
epistemological basis in biological practice has not been extensively explored.
This project will examine the goals, motivations, and development of the `worm
project` and the use of C. elegans as a model organism. Using this case study, a
philosophical framework within which the epistemological dimensions of the use
of model organisms in biology and medicine can be better understood will be
developed.
