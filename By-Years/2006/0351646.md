Under this funding, the PI will use in situ analyses of minerals from both
extrusive and intrusive rocks (collected from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near the
Kane Transform Fault and the Southwest Indian Ridge near the Atlantis II
Fracture zone) to understand magmatic construction processes. Data will be
collected using Laser-Ablation Inductively-Coupled-Plasma Mass- Spectrometry (LA
ICPMS). This study will provide insight into the magmatic system over three
different spatial scales and will test a number of ideas regarding the
petrogenesis of deep crustal rocks, how they were emplaced, how they
crystallized, and under what physical conditions.
