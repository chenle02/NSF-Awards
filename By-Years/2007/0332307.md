The TIME-GCM model is used in a series of steps to investigate the mechanism for
creation of a four-cell density pattern in the disturbed high latitude
ionosphere-thermosphere system. The central hypothesis is that dynamical
breakdown of the quiescent two-cell pattern, caused by fluid sheer during strong
electrodynamic forcing events (storms), produces the four-cell pattern. The
research examines the hypothesis by first isolating the physical mechanisms
generating the two-cell pattern and their variations of a solar cycle, then
examines correlation between four-cell generation and solar and magnetic
activity indices. The morphology of cell development is also indexed to wind and
temperature variations accompanying the cell structures, and is separated from
the effects of tides and gravity waves.
