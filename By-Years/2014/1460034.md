The U.S. and China both suffer great life and property losses due to landslide
hazards. The proposed International Research Experiences for Students (IRES)
program will support 18 U.S. students (two graduates and four undergraduates per
year) to conduct advanced landslide research in the Three Gorges area in China
during the summer of 2016, 2017, and 2018. The IRES students will attend a two-
week intensive Chinese language and cultural course at the main campus of CUG
and then conduct a five-week field investigation in the Three Gorges Reservoir
area. The field investigations will be supervised by the PI and three professors
at CUG, Drs. Huiming Tang, Hanwen Zhou, and Changqian Ma from the China
University of Geosciences (CUG) in Wuhan. The eight-week-long collaborative
project is designed to expose U.S. students to the international landslide
research community at an early stage of their careers. The IRES project will
increase the visibility of U.S. students in China through their activities in
the CUG campus and in the Three Gorges Reservoir area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
IRES project will provide U.S. students with hands-on field research experience
in landslide surveying, mapping, monitoring, and early-warning. The main
research objectives are to (1) develop a GPS based real-time landslide
monitoring and early-warning system at the Huangtupo landslide site, (2) develop
a rapid landslide mapping method using high-accuracy GPS and LiDAR integrated
technologies, and (3) study the correlation of landslide movements with
fluctuation of the water level within the Three Gorges Reservoir. The methods
developed through this project can be modified to serve other regions prone to
landslides. The knowledge and skills that students learn from this project will
better prepare them for their professional careers.
