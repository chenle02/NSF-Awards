This conference award to the University of Delaware is made by the Advanced
Materials Program in the Chemistry Division and the Solid State Chemistry
Program in the Division of Materials Research in support of the 9th-11th
Materials Chemistry Workshops. The goals of the Workshops are to bring together
scientists from diverse disciplines including inorganic, organic, physical,
biological, polymer and analytical chemistry as well as other science and
engineering backgrounds for discussion of ongoing and emerging areas of research
and education in materials chemistry. In addition, the Workshops are to promote
dialog between industry, government and academic scientists in their endeavor to
identify and investigate fundamental and technological issues. Workshops will be
held on the third week in October with up to thirty participants selected by a
competitively reviewed application process. Special efforts will be made to
encourage industrial, government, minority, women and young material chemists to
apply for the Workshops. Specific workshop sites will be determined by the
Workshop Chairpersons and are expected to be in Delaware, Wisconsin and
Michigan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Materials Chemistry Workshops will provide a
forum conducive to the development of ideas, help bridge gaps among the
materials chemistry constituencies in academia, industry and government
laboratories, lead to new collaborations and define the frontiers of materials
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
