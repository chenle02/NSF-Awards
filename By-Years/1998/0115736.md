With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Carleton College will acquire an aerosol time-of-
flight mass spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including a) the study of the chemical content and source origin of
aerosol particles found in the Carleton College area; b) the exploration of wet
deposition of particles through both rain and snow washout; and c) the study of
the emissions from diesel engines as a function of various operating parameters.

A deeper understanding of aerosol particles in the atmosphere is crucial to
understanding the environment and health effects. This project will provide
opportunities for Carleton College undergraduates, in collaboration with
undergraduates and graduate students from the University of Wisconsin - Madison,
and senior scientists from both institutions to work together.
