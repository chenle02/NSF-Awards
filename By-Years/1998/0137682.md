This project involves revising the Middle Grades MATH Thematics curriculum, a
comprehensive grades 6-8 mathematics curriculum developed with NSF funding from
1992 through 1997. Revisions will be informed by data collected from various
stakeholders, including MATH Thematics teachers, research mathematicians and
mathematics educators. Revised student materials will take advantage of new
technologies and will be field tested in diverse middle-school settings. The
professional development component of the curriculum will be greatly expanded.
Materials for parents and administrators that are tailored to MATH Thematics
will be developed. New materials will be designed that can be used with special
learners, and existing multicultural materials will be evaluated and revised.
Formative and summative evaluation of the project will be conducted. Cost
sharing includes substantial contributions from the University of Montana and
the publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
