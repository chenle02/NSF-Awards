This award supports the participation of Dr. Osmund Holm-Hansen of Scripps
Institution of Oceanography and several other U.S. marine scientists in an
international workshop on Polar Marine Ecology to be held in Trondheim, Norway.
The workshop has been designed specifically to bring together the scientists who
were actively involved in the "Norwegian Research Program for Marine Arctic
Ecology" (PRO MARE). The convener of the workshop and director of the subject
research program is Professor Egil Sakshaug of the University of Trondheim. PRO
MARE was an intensive five year ecological study of the Barents Sea sponsored by
Norway, which invited many investigators from other countries (primarily the
U.S.) to participate in the multidisciplinary research cruises. The emphasis of
the research was to quantify the processes affecting food web dynamics, and
evaluate how these rates are affected by physical, chemical and optical
parameters. The workshop offers an opportunity to discuss and begin to
synthesize the broad range of data acquired during PRO MARE into an ecosystem
analysis of the Barents Sea, as well as examining their relevance to general
polar oceanography. The Barents Sea has some oceanographic features which make
it an excellent "model" system to study biological problems which have world
wide significance. These include the development and importance of frontal
systems for enhanced primary production, the relationship between phytoplankton
productivity and depth of vertical mixing as influenced by meteorological
conditions, and the biological and physical importance of the melting of the
annual sea ice. All six U.S. researchers whose travel will be supported by this
grant have had much personal involvement with the PRO MARE program; they will
have much to contribute and learn during the multidisciplinary discussions.
