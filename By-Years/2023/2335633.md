Generative large language models (LLMs) are transforming the field of security
with their ability to provide fast and comprehensive insights and information.
LLMs are now being applied to several important security tasks, including
platform-specific incident response, secure programming, binary analysis, and
penetration testing. With automation changing the practice of security as we
know it, this project seeks to refresh security education in order to better
align what we teach students to how security is now practiced. The project's
novelties include creating a new curriculum that embraces the use of LLMs
throughout a student's cybersecurity education in a way that prepares them to
meet the demands of future security workforce. In doing so, the project's
broader significance and importance will be to enable a broader pipeline of
students who can leverage the use of modern tools such as LLMs to solve
cybersecurity problems, including those with less technical backgrounds and
those from underrepresented groups.

The project's approach for redesigning security curricula centers around the
planned restructuring of security curricula around LLMs. The new curriculum
addresses different aspects of applying LLMs to solving security problems: what
to ask for, which model to ask, how to ask for it, whether to task for it, and
whether the result is trustworthy. By weaving this into traditional security
courses in computer, network, web, and cloud security, students will gain
important insight and practical skills that they can then use to contribute to
the modern security workforce. To ensure the results of this project are broadly
accessible, all curricula and lab exercises will be made available via public
repositories.
