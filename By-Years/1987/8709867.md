Avirulence (avr) genes occur in plant pathogenic microorganisms and modulate
recognitional specificities which permit plant hosts to detect the pathogen and
invoke an active defense mechanism. The long range goal of the research is to
understand the molecular basis underlying this recognition system and the plant
defense mechanism that it modulates. Dr. Keen has cloned and sequenced several
avr genes from members of the >Pseudomonas> >syringae> group of pathogens and
recently observed that one of them is inducibly expressed when bacteria are
inoculated into soybean plants. This plant inducible expression of a bacterial
avirulence gene constitutes an important lead in the as yet unanswered question
of the biochemical function of the avirulence gene protein products. Dr. Keen
will further investigate the bacterial avr genes and how they are involved in
plant recognition of the pathogen. He will complete the sequencing and
expression of several additional avr genes. He will study inducibility of the
>avrC> and other avirulence genes, and the relationship of avr genes to
bacterial elicitors which initiate the plant defense reaction.
