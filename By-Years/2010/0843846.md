The Board on Science Education (BOSE) of the NRC is a standing committee of the
National Academies. This proposal requests core support for BOSE so that it can
continue to provide national leadership in science education. Specifically, BOSE
(1) improves the knowledge base for science education; (2) identifies critical
issues in science education policy and practice; (3) translates research and
disseminates evidence-based information; and (4) builds an interdisciplinary
community of scholars to bring knowledge to bear on important issues in science
education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To carry out its mandate, BOSE conducts
studies, sponsors workshop and works with government representatives to surface
emerging policy issues. The Board has identified the following priorities for
the next few years:&lt;br/&gt;? Intersection on research on learning and science
education&lt;br/&gt;? Cyber-enabled learning and teaching&lt;br/&gt;? Analysis
of the Education System to enable implementation and scale-up&lt;br/&gt;?
Reaching diverse populations&lt;br/&gt;? Intersection of science and science
education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core support enables two two-day Board
meetings each year, coordination with DBASSE and other units of the Academy, and
regular meetings between NSF and the Academies.&lt;br/&gt;
