Computational techniques are being developed for discovering elusive
combinatorial configurations, specifically: t-designs and Ramsey numbers. The
search algorithms being employed in the two cases are similar as are the
computational techniques and theoretical tools. In recent work the PIs have
found a notable special design as well as a new family of designs. They are now
refining the techniques used, developing new implementations, and constructing
new algorithms to continue their computations. In their recent work on Ramsey
graphs several new lower bounds were discovered for Ramsey numbers. The PIs are
now exploring several new approaches for making further improvements in lower
and upper bounds. It is hoped that they will compute the exact value of one or
more of the small Ramsey numbers. The proposed work will continue the valuable
work that the PIs started during their previous RUI grant which was for a period
of only 12 months. The results of the previous grant have been highly rated and
further results along the same line are anticipated. The proposed work provides
very appropriate experience for the students involved.
