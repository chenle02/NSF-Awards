Research on this project involves the use of algebraic, geometric and
combinatorial methods to attack fundamental questions involving enumeration in
convex polytopes and certain graded partially ordered sets. Questions considered
involve enumerative properties of general polytopes and arrangements of
hyperplanes, properties of related families of partially ordered sets, and
connections of all of these structures to fundamental algebraic structures
involving permutations. Recent connections between subalgebras of quasisymmetric
functions and enumerative properties of families of partially ordered sets have
made it likely that significant progress can be achieved on these questions. A
major focus is to move closer to a characterization of the numbers of faces and
chains of faces in polytopes and arrangements. In addition, the investigator and
his colleagues will continue their work on the study of the geometry of the
space of phylogenetic trees. An initial goal will be to determine an efficient
scheme to compute distances between trees in this space.

The type of enumerative information being sought here is of use in the design of
geometric algorithms for problems in robotics and motion planning, and recently
has come into play in the analysis of randomization schemes for the management
of data. The associated permutation questions relate to questions arising when
one studies efficient schemes for sorting large amounts of data. The questions
involving phylogenetic trees bear on the development of statistical methods to
deal with trees derived from DNA data. Such methods are of great interest to
biologists studying the genetic relationship between different species or
different diseases.
