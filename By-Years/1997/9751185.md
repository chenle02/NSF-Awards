Electronic measuring and data collection has been used in manufacturing to
increase productivity, ensure quality control, and reduce manufacturing costs.
In order to compete for jobs, graduates in Machine Tool Technology, Engineering
Design Graphics, and Mechanical Engineering Technology programs must become
proficient in the use of these measuring tools and gain an understanding of how
the data are used in the manufacturing process. Through the development of a
Model Dimensional Measurement Laboratory, the college is able to integrate
measuring technology throughout the various technology programs. This project is
designed to incorporate state-of-the-art dimensional measuring instruments into
the technology programs at the college. Through the use of both mechanical and
digital dimensional measuring instruments, students have more exposure to
advanced instrumentation that is used by industry leaders, come to understand
the metric system of measuring and its purpose in the manufacturing and
engineering community, learn theory and application of data collection equipment
as applied to Statistical Process Control in manufacturing, and include the
development of a laboratory manual that utilizes the instruments in the
Dimensional Measurement Laboratory and provides experiences for students with
using metric measuring techniques. *
