Language permeates human existence; it mediates our interactions, influences our
patterns of thought, frames our experiences, and is a key mechanism for
transmitting knowledge to one another and from generation to generation. Despite
the clear and far-reaching significance of language, there are still many things
we do not understand about its nature, about how it emerges, and about how it
develops. Since the early 1960s, signed languages have offered a new lens for
viewing the core properties of language. As a result of this work, linguists
have increasingly come to see language as an abstract cognitive system, which
can be expressed and perceived through a visual-gestural channel just as it can
be expressed and perceived through an oral-aural channel. This insight helps us
understand one of the most powerful characteristics of language: its unique
flexibility, which allows it to be adapted to different circumstances,
populations, and conditions of transmission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
builds on the past sixty years of sign language research by examining a
restructuring of language as it is transferred from a visual-gestural modality
to a tactile-proprioceptive modality. The investigators are conducting this
research in&amp;#8232;a historically unprecedented moment, when, for the first
time, a large, socially organized &amp;#8232;and politically engaged network of
DeafBlind language-users are communicating directly with&amp;#8232;one another
via reciprocal, tactile and proprioceptive channels. DeafBlind people refer to
these communication practices as "protactile" (PT). In preliminary research, it
has been observed that PT communication practices seem to be leading to
systematic changes in the phonological structure of protactile-ASL. In order to
analyze these changes, the investigators have developed hypotheses, which will
be tested over a five-year period among three groups: PT DeafBlind signers, non-
PT DeafBlind signers, and non-PT Deaf signers. Comparing these groups will allow
emergent phonological patterns to be distinguished from on-the-fly compensation
for sensory loss. The emergence and development of protactile-ASL offers a
unique opportunity to understand how human language can be adapted to radically
different conditions of transmission and interaction.
