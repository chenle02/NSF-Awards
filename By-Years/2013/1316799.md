This exploratory proposal is researching and developing professional learning
activities to help high school teachers use available and emerging social media
to teach scientific argumentation. The project responds to the growing emphasis
on scientific argumentation in new standards. Participants include a team of
ninth and tenth grade Life Science teachers collaborating as co-researchers with
project staff in a design study to develop one socially mediated science unit.
It also produces strategies, tools and on-line materials to support teachers'
development of the pedagogical, content, and technological knowledge needed to
integrate emerging technologies into science instruction. This project focuses
on the flexible social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram that
students frequently use in their everyday lives. Research questions explore the
technology of social media and the pedagogy needed to support student engagement
in scientific argumentation. The Year Three pilot analyses provide data on the
professional learning model. The project provides a basis for scale-up with this
instructional and professional learning model to other core science content,
cross-cutting themes, and STEM practices.
