Engineering Other -(59)&lt;br/&gt;Microfluidics is a branch of physics and
biotechnology that studies the behavior of fluids at the microscale and the
design of Micro-Electronic Mechanical Systems (MEMS) that takes advantage of
such behavior. Fluids on these small scales behave differently than do fluids at
the macro-level because factors such as surface tension, energy dissipation,
inertia, and electrokinetics begin to predominate. The objective of this project
is to adapt and implement an undergraduate course on microfluidics at partnering
institutions. The course consists of inquiry-based modules supplemented with
lectures and reading materials employing educational uses of technology
exploring the latest research in microfluidics. The courses will be offered in a
variety of engineering programs including the electrical, mechanical, and
biomedical disciplines. Students are collaborating on a group project that
follows the full-cycle microfluidic system design approach. The course materials
are being compiled to produce a textbook on microfluidic theory and practice
that is suitable for undergraduate instruction. In addition to the textbook, the
results from this project will be disseminated through several engineering
education venues.
