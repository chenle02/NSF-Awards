The aim of this research is to investigate the time dependent behavior of a
class of stochastic processes that arises in the evaluation of the cost of
product warranties. The underlying process is a point process for which the
distribution of the intervals is time dependent. An appropriate reward function
is introduced to evaluate product warranty. The aim of this research is to
investigate a class of stochastic processes that arises in the evaluation of the
cost of product warranty. It is expected that this research can yield better
understanding of how to determine warrantee periods.
