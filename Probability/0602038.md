0307295 Yau The dynamics of a quantum particle in a random media is governed by
a random Schrodinger equation. In the kinetic limit, the phase space
distribution of a solution to this equation converges to a linear Boltzmann
equation. Beyond the kinetic scale, one expects that the Boltzmann equation is
still correct in dimension three or higher provided that the diffusivity is
renormalized. The first project aims to study this renormalization for time
scales longer than the kinetic scale. The second project concerns the viscosity
of the lattice gas models. Recently the PI has established the divergence rate
for the diffusion coefficient for the asymmetric simple exclusion process in
dimension two. The goal of this project is to extend this result to the
dimension one case and to the lattice gas models with the Navier-Stokes equation
as the formal limit. The fundamental question regarding the conductivity of
electrons in semiconductors is how conduction occurs. As the technology is
reaching the stage that the semi-classical theory no longer applies, the quantum
effect will dominate and a mathematical rigorous theory is of fundamental
importance. The first project aims to establish the quantum corrections of the
standard semi-classical theory based on the Boltzmann equation. This will
provide the first rigorous understanding of these quantum dynamical effects. The
second project investigates the validity of the lattice gas models for fluids.
These models, besides being widely used to simulate the Navier-Stokes equations,
are important models for non-equilibrium statistical physics. The goal here is
to establish the divergence rate of the viscosity for these models. This will
give the first clue concerning how well the Navier-Stokes equation models the
two-dimensional fluid.
