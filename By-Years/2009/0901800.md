This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to
develop functional integrated wireless structures using phononic crystals. To
achieve this goal, a combined theoretical and experimental effort in phononic
crystals including the following high-level research tasks is planned: 1) the
development of low-loss, high quality fundamental components (waveguides and
cavities) in PC slabs with the possibility of full dispersion and mode
engineering, 2) the development of a systematic method for dispersion
engineering in PC waveguides and cavities and combining these devices to form
functional integrated wireless structures, and 3) the development of an optimum
procedure for fabricating PC structures for operation in the state-of-the-art
wireless frequency range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phononic crystal structures have
the prospect of being a transformational technology for on-chip signal
conditioning and processing for wireless systems. This technology could pave the
way towards new systems such as ultra-compact single-chip spectral analyzers. It
also has the prospect of creating adaptive filters for reconfiguring the radio
for different protocols as well as different bands. This would lay the
foundation for flexible radio which would be somewhat analogous to the
microprocessor. In addition, the proposed phononic crystal structures can be
employed in several applications of acoustic waves (e.g., biological and
chemical sensing). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research provides
significant educational benefits for the society. Two Ph.D. students and several
undergraduate students (especially underrepresented minority students through
the summer undergraduate research in engineering/science (SURE) program) will be
trained in a multi-disciplinary environment. It also provides summer research
for one high school student and one high school teacher.
