Instrumentation and equipment will be used to establish a laboratory to study
chemical structure, molecular weight, and weight distribution of lignin. This
information is important to allow the utilization of isolated lignin in the
development of engineered lignin-based structural materials. Specific equipment
for determination of molecular weight and molecular weight distribution includes
a solvent delivery system for a liquid chromatography system, an injector, a
variable UV detector, a differential refractometer, integration software, and an
IBM personal computer for data analysis. A Fourier transform infrared
spectrometer will be used for the quantitative structure analysis of isolated
lignins and lignin derivatives, for lignins in solid materials and several other
applications.
