We propose a laboratory in which students will investigate the design and
implementation of human-computer interfaces (HCIs). The laboratory will enhance
two courses currently taught at Appalachian State University, Human-Computer
Interface Design and Microcomputer Systems. It will allow students to build
prototypes of HCIs, compare HCI design options, create professional
presentations of HCI designs, and implement HCIs including graphical user
interfaces using an object-oriented language (C++) with appropriate software
library support. Currently, many undergraduates have little opportunity to
explore the development of HCIs even though one-half of many software
development projects involve the development of the human-computer interface.
The current situation leaves many undergraduates woefully unprepared for current
practice in software development. Our proposal helps to alleviate this problem
by exposing these students to the difficult design decisions and programming
techniques that arise in HCI development through the use of supervised and
unsupervised laboratory exercises.
