The National Science Teachers Association is working with the National Council
of Teachers of Mathematics and the American Association of Physics Teachers to
produce a magazine for high school students who are gifted in science and
mathematics. The purpose of the magazine is to provide enrichment opportunities
in creative thinking and problem solving to attract these students to science
and math related careers. The magazine, to be called Quantum, will be patterned
after the successful Soviet student magazine, Kvant, which contains physics and
mathematics articles and numerous problem-solving activities. According to the
Letter of Understanding with the Quantum Bureau in Moscow, the Kvant editors
will provide translations of articles and original copies of accompanying
artwork. Two editors-in-chief, one for math and one for physics, and an advisory
board made up of outstanding science and math teachers and professors will
determine the content of Quantum, review all articles for the publication, and
solicit articles from U.S. scientists and mathematicians to supplement those
from Kvant. The first year of this three-year project will be devoted to the
publication of two premiere issues of the magazine, the first in November of
1989 and the second in April of l990. Recipients of the first issue will return
a response card evaluating the publication in order to receive the second issue.
A marketing survey will be conducted following distribution of the second issue.
Sales of subscriptions and advertising space, as well as corporate donations,
will help support the cost of producing Quantum.
