Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Sophisticated computer simulations and theoretical modeling
will be provide better understanding of how low mass stellar systems form and
change with time. Detailed comparison of these simulations with data from the
Hubble Space Telescope, and later the James Webb Space Telescope, will answer
fundamental questions about dark matter and the faintest stellar systems in the
universe. The PI will collaborate with education experts from McDonald
Observatory to develop two workshops that incorporate data and scientific
visualization procedures from this project?s simulations to provide high school
teachers with training and materials to actively engage their students? interest
in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will provide theoretical
framework at the frontier of near-field cosmology. It will develop accurate
numerical methods and galaxy models that contain explicit treatment of star
formation feedback. One result will be ultra-high-resolution zoom-in images for
individual dwarf galaxies. Another will be high-resolution simulations of the
Local Volume to compare with existing and future data sets, such as those
obtained with Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, and the
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. This will dramatically improve the
understanding of galaxy formation in and around the Local Volume and how to
connect faint stellar systems in the nearby Universe to their progenitors as far
back as the cosmic dawn era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
