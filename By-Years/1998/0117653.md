0117653&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wang/SUNY-SB&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
analyze data from repeated transects across the &lt;br/&gt;continental shelf and
upper slope off the East Coast of the U.S. These &lt;br/&gt;will be used to
study the structure and variability of the shelf-break &lt;br/&gt;front and the
flows on either side of this front. The data consist of &lt;br/&gt;over 700
sections of ADCP data, collected over approximately 9 years from&lt;br/&gt;a
container ship making routine trips between New York and Bermuda,
&lt;br/&gt;together with XBT data spanning two decades. In addition to providing
&lt;br/&gt;information about the short-term variability of the circulation in
this &lt;br/&gt;region, this unique data set should permit the study of the
inter-annual &lt;br/&gt;variability of a current system that affects conditions
in the &lt;br/&gt;economically important and biologically &lt;br/&gt;
