The project "Boston University/Keio University Workshops," funded for June 2014
- June 2017, consists of three annual workshops at Boston University in areas of
mathematical research common to Boston University and Keio University, Japan.
The workshop subjects are dynamical systems and applications, geometry and
mathematical physics, and algebraic geometry. These five-day workshops will
consist of lectures by experts aimed at the graduate student level, as well as
talks by advanced graduate students. Funds will be used to provide partial
support for US graduate students from outside the Boston area.

The purpose of the Boston University/Keio University workshops is to expose
graduate students to areas of strong current research interest in pure and
applied mathematics and statistics. These workshops extend the previous smaller
scale BU/Keio workshops, which graduate students found very beneficial. Each
workshop is anticipated to host a total of 30-50 participants. Graduate students
will hear lectures from leading experts in these fields, have the chance to
present their own research results in a professional setting, and network with
their peers and faculty members. A website devoted to these workshops will make
lecture notes available to a wide audience:
