DMS-0072700 Sergey Novikov

The main objective of the principal investigator's research program is the
unification of topology and geometry with analysis. He is especially interesing
in specific results describing some phenomena in real world physics where
topological features play a key role. In particular, such phenomena were found
by the principal investigators's group in the conductivity of single crystal
metals in the presence of strong magnetic field, in the theory of nonlinear
waves (solitons), and in the theory of quantum wires (quantum mechanics on
graphs).

This award will support visitors and graduate students in the principal
investigator's school of mathematics which is primarily concerned with the
unification of topology and geometry with analysis. In this way young
mathematicians can interact with a variety of outstanding scientists. These
interactions include scientific meetings with visitors in miniseminars and
attendance at short series of lectures by specially invited outstanding
scientists. These interactions will help attract graduate students to the
subject and improve the quality of their training at the beginning of their
careers.
