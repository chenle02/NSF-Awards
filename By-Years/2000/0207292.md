PI will spend a month (August, 2002) in China studying primitive Middle Cambrian
echinoderms from the Kaili Fauna at the Guizhou University of Technology in
Guiyang as well as at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology in
Nanjing. There are very good possibilities that primary symmetry in echinoderms
(based on the symmetry of the ambulacral system), early evolutionary development
of columnar structures and their holdfasts can be deduced from some of the
material. Most specimens are preserved as molds and extensive latex casting will
be an important part of the data gathering. At present there is good evidence
that the sediments associated with the fossils are not extensively bioturbated,
which makes the mode/mechanism of attachment to the bottom very important: it
will be extensively investigated. Study of this material may well open up a
whole new understanding of the early evolution of this important biotic group
and the collections are available at this time for joint investigation with
Chinese colleagues.
