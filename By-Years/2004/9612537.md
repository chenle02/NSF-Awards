9612537 Wang This exploratory research addresses the area of high data recording
density for computer and network recording applications and multi-media
publishing. The available CD-ROM type of optical data storage is not erasable
and this proposal addresses the demonstration of feasibility in an erasable
optical-disk storage with ion-exchanged glass disks. This is an SGER award to
characterize an ion-exchange glass disk and to demonstrate the laser heating
effect for writing and the UV darkening of glass for erasing. ***
