This planning grant deals with helping people in a flood prone area, Lehigh
Valley, understand climate change and the impacts it can have on their
livelihood. Through a series of town hall type meetings and distributed
materials, the Nurture Nature Foundation and scientists will provide perspective
on climate change and options now available to them. The target audience will
range from teenagers to adults. During these discussions STEM concepts shall be
integrated into the materials. An important aspect of this planning project is
devising strategies for interactions with the local groups in meetings and for
effective displays and exhibits that not only address the flooding/climate
change issues but also reflect the STEM principles and concepts that are
involved.
