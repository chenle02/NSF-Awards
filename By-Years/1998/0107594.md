This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Computer
Simulations of Biological Molecules: Obtaining Unique Information on their
Structure and Function from STM Images." Novel methods and tools for computer
simulations of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of biological
molecules are being developed. These methods are being used for obtaining unique
information about structure, dynamics, and function of proteins, lipids, and
nucleic acids from their STM images. The methods will also facilitate tailoring
STM experiments.
