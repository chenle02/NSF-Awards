The transport properties of iron alloys are central to the understanding
of&lt;br/&gt;dynamic processes in the Earth's core, including convective motions
in the&lt;br/&gt;outer core (which drive the geodynamo) and solid-state
deformation in the&lt;br/&gt;inner core, which may be responsible for the
observed seismic anisotropy.&lt;br/&gt;To better understand these processes the
PIs propose to conduct&lt;br/&gt;experimental studies of diffusional transport
in iron at high pressure (up&lt;br/&gt;to 27 GPa). Rates of diffusion of several
chemical species (Fe, S, O, and&lt;br/&gt;Os) will be measured in both liquid
iron and in high-pressure solid phases&lt;br/&gt;(fcc and hcp). The experiments
will extend to significantly higher&lt;br/&gt;pressures than have been examined
previously and will provide a more secure&lt;br/&gt;basis for extrapolating
diffusion rates and diffusion-related properties to&lt;br/&gt;the conditions of
the core. The results will lead to a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of inner
core rheology and mechanisms for producing&lt;br/&gt;anisotropic textures; the
viscosity and role of compositional convection in&lt;br/&gt;the outer core; and
the spatial distribution of osmium isotopes and other&lt;br/&gt;chemical species
within the core.&lt;br/&gt;
