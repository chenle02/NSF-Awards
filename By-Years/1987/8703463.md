The goal of this project is to undertand this biochemical mechanism and
biological function of bioluminescence, that is, to delineate the mechanism
involved in the conversion of chemical energy into light energy and to elucidate
the roles of luminescence in the physiology of the organisms. To achieve this
goal it is essential to determine the chemical structures of the key substances
involved in the bioluminescent reactions that occur in diverse types of
organisms. The specific aims of the project in the next three years are: (1) to
investigate fungal luminescence, including the determination of the structure of
fungal luciferin, using Panellus stipticus, (2) to complete current studies in
progress, including structural work on the fluorescent substance F of
euphasolids, the chromophores of the photoproteins of the millipede Luminodesmus
and the brittle star Ophiopsilla, and the green fluorescent protein of Aequorea.
