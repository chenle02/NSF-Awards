The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a software platform to facilitate
the identification of existing drugs that can be re-purposed for other diseases,
such as COVID-19. First, identifying FDA-approved drugs that could help COVID-19
patients is expected to save lives. Furthermore, this can prevent the economic
consequences of extended or repeated mass quarantine episodes. Finally, the
availability of a drug discovery platform for flu-like viruses that includes
data from SARS-CoV-2 and other related viruses will add to the national
cyberinfrastructure and will allow a better response at the next occurrence of a
novel virus.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop a prototype
platform to include: i) state-of-the-art data analysis methods, ii) a
comprehensive knowledge base, and iii) an approach complementary to most other
avenues currently pursued in the fight against COVID-19. The approach will focus
on leveraging transcriptomics and other omics data focusing on the hostâ€™s immune
response. This system will enable efficient research into issues such as the
acute reaction of the immune systems, enabling approaches to mitigate and/or
avoid a cytokine storm. This provides important information complementary to
development of antiviral medications or vaccines, important for a future
pandemic regardless of the virus strain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
