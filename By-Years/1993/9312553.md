9312553 O'Hanlon This award provides funding for the first year of a three-year
continuing award under the "Self-Sufficient Partnership for Research" Program at
the University of Arizona's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Microcontamination Control. The Center continues to meet the renewal criteria
requirements of the I/UCRC Program. Additional funds are provided by the
Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste Management to obtain
a non- voting membership in the Center. The Program Manager recommends the
University of Arizona be awarded $40,000 for the first year of a three-year
continuing award. An additional $10,000 is recommended for one year with funding
provided by the U.S. Department of Energy. Near the end of each 12-month period,
the Program Manager and/or the Division Director of the Engineering Education
Centers Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal
criteria requirements, including the following: 1) the extent to which the
university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to which the
support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a robust research program
is developing. If the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend
support for the next period of this continuing award.
