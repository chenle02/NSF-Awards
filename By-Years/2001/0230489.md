0230489&lt;br/&gt;Tadmor&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the PI and graduate
students from Northeastern University in a collaboration with Bernd Noack of the
Hermann Fottinger Institute for Fluid Engineering at the Technical University of
Berlin, Germany. The combined efforts of the German and US groups will go toward
research in control-oriented modeling and control flow for monitoring and
controlling fluid flow systems. They will derive models that reduce the
computational burden ordinarily inherent in computational fluid dynamics
calculations and are also effective for on-line predictive control. Hybrid
modeling techniques in combination with sensitivity analysis will lead to
lighter-weight discrete and continuous models. The flow systems to be studied
represents an important class of system problems that have proven extremely
difficult to model and control. The progress the PIs achieve will have major
implications for industrial control and scientific
instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also has an educational
objective. The project will allow the graduate students involved to benefit from
performing research in another country. They will develop a heightened
appreciation of the world around them while also learning important new
technical skills.&lt;br/&gt;
