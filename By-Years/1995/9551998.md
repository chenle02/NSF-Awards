The major thrust of this project is integrating computers into the laboratory
components of six courses in biology: invertebrate zoology, ecology, animal
physiology, animal behavior, independent study, and senior research. While the
authors have previously incorporated computer-based laboratory exercises into
these courses, the students have been severely limited in their ability to
participate actively in these laboratories because of a lack of equipment. This
project rectifies this problem by providing access to groups of two students to
a computer with supporting software and interfacing devices. Through laboratory
exercises in these courses, students are introduced to computers as biological
tools that can be used to collect and analyze data. This introduction
demonstrates the usefulness of computers to them, and more importantly, allows
the students more time during laboratory sessions to think about the results, to
design new experiments, and to perform these additional experiments. The
students also use the computers and software programs to conduct on-line
literature searches, to learn to use the Internet and Mosaic, and to prepare
oral presentations of their results using a computer display projector. These
computers, along with new physiological equipment, can also be used by upper-
level students for their senior research projects. A computer linked to an
overhead display unit is being made available for use in the lecture component
of these courses, in which the system can function as an electronic blackboard.
This project shows faculty members how computers can facilitate learning and
encourages them incorporate these types of learning experience into two larger
courses offered by the department, general biology and human anatomy and
physiology.
