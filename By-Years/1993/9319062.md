9319062 Rosenberg Montana Dr. Edward Rosenberg, Chemistry Department, University
of Montana, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program for research into the chemistry of trimetallia clusters. These
studies will address fundamental questions relating to the types of molecular
transformations which occur when more than one metal is involved in ligand
activation. Specific topics to be investigated are: (1) the mechanism by which
triosmium clusters promote low temperature transamination, (2) the regio-
reactivity and reaction kinetics of a number of reactions of imidoyl complexes,
(3) the aqueous coordination chemistry trimetallic clusters, and (4) the
mechanism of metal-ligand hydrogen transfer reactions in polynuclear hydride
complexes. Many important chemical processes are facilitated by the use of metal
catalysts. In order to understand, and improve, such catalysts the ways in which
chemical species interact with metals must be known. This project aims at
determining the types of transformations which are possible when a small
molecule interacts with two or more metal atoms. These will serve as models for
the complex transformations which occur in a number of metal catalyzed
reactions.
