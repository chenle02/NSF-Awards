9304492 Romanowicz This research is to model global lateral heterogeneity in the
mantle from long-period body waveforms, using a more adequate theory than
employed until now in inversions of long-period body waves. The theory takes a
normal mode approach which differs from previous ones in that the cross-branch
coupling is considered. The theory is accurate within the great-circle section
defined by the source and receiver and able to bring out the ray character of
long-period body waves. Focusing and defocusing effects within the great-circle
section are automatically taken into account. It uses an asymptotic
approximation to treat the effect of lateral heterogeneity in the direction
perpendicular to the great circle, as done implicitly in all the previous
inversions of long-period body waves. A computationally practical inversion
algorithm has been set up and tested. It will now be applied to the global long-
period digital data set starting with SH and then extending to P- SV cases. ***
