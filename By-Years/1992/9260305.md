This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has as its
objective the development of software which will instruct in the detection of
environmental radiation. In particular, the investigators proposal to build a
computer system that will simulate the presence of various types of radiation
sources in a variety of environments. This system will have three modules, (1)
Surveyor, (2) Radiation Physics Laboratory, and (3) Examination. The Surveyor
will simulate an environment where radiation exposure potential exists. This
module will be connected to an instrument that the trainee can hold in his/her
hand. The Radiation Physics Laboratory module will teach the principles of
various types of radiation, and the Examination module, based on the Survey will
test the knowledge of the trainee of the properties of various types of
radiation and the ability of the trainee in the radiation environment. The
availability of simulation software will enhance the safety of the students who
study radiation measurement in hazardous environments, and it will permit the
simulation of malfunctions which cannot now be demonstrated because of their
danger.
