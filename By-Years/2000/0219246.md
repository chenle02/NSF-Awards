0219246&lt;br/&gt;van Keken&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of computer-aided
stereographic projection techniques has greatly aided interpretation of Earth
Science structure and processes. We have developed and implemented an affordable
PC/Linux based stereo projection system ("the Geowall") that can be used by
individual research groups and within the undergraduate curriculum. The main
goals of this collaborative Information Technology Research project between the
University of Michigan and the University of Illinois at Chicago (EAR-0218918;
PI: A. Johnson) are to greatly improve the content development and delivery for
Earth Science applications. This will include the development of conversion
software and viewers for existing Earth Science applications; implementation of
tools for interaction and manipulation of 3D data; testing of these tools in
Earth Science departments; improvement of the collaborative environment for work
between groups of researchers; and dissemination through the Geowall consortium
(geowall.org). &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
