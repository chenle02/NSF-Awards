The development of sperm cells in mammals is an extraordinary example of
translational regulation of gene expression, a phenomenon in which messenger
RNAs (mRNAs) are stored in an inactive form in the cytoplasm, sequestered from
ribosomes. These mRNAs can be activated subsequently to bind to ribosomes, which
then translate the sequence of bases of the mRNA into the sequence of amino
acids of a protein. The objective of this research is to identify sequences and
proteins that inactivate translation of the mRNA encoding the Sperm
Mitochondria-Associated Cysteine-rich Protein (SMCP), a protein that enhances
the motility of mammalian sperm. The SMCP mRNA is stored in an inactive state
for six days in early haploid developing sperm cells, before it is actively
translated in late haploid cells. The experimental approach utilizes the
creation of chimeric genes consisting of various parts of the SMCP mRNA and the
protein coding region of green fluorescent protein (GFP), the generation of
strains of transgenic mice harboring the chimeric SMCP-GFP genes, and
microscopic and biochemical analysis of the stages of developing sperm cells
that contain GFP-fluorescence and ribosome-bound GFP-SMCP mRNAs. Previous
research has demonstrated that the SMCP 5' untranslated region delays
translation of SMCP-GFP mRNAs resulting in the total absence of GFP-fluorescence
and ribosome-bound GFP-SMCP mRNAs in early haploid cells, whereas the SMCP-3'UTR
permits GFP-fluorescence and ribosome-bound GFP-SMCP mRNAs in early haploid
cells. The objective of future research is to analyze the function of a
promising candidate for a translation control element, a short sequence of bases
at the 5' terminus of the SMCP mRNA. Candidate translational repressor proteins
will be identified by electrophoretic assays for the formation of slowly
migrating RNA-protein complexes. This project is intended to encourage students
from underrepresented groups to enter careers in science.
