Professor Mark A. Ratner is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study an extension of the static and dynamic
self-consistent field technique. Proposed development research includes the
generalizaiton of static mean field techniques to work in optimized general
coordinates, the use of specific correlation factors to surmount problems caused
by static correlations, and the use of Fourier methods in time and space to
increase the efficiency of mean field calculations. Applications research will
include lifetime studies of weakly interacting molecular clusters using both
static and dynamic methods, perturbative studies of weakly bound molecules, work
on lineshapes in metal clusters, and time dependent dynamics in electron
transfer systems. %%% Recent elegant laser spectroscopic advances in the field
of chemistry have greatly increased our knowledge of the rates, mechanisms, and
the product distributions in gas phase chemical reactions. These advances have
placed new demands upon the theorist to develop, implement, and utilize
theoretical tools capable of describing the results of such experiments, and to
predict the behavior of reactions under differing conditions. The mean field
approximation used by Professor Ratner is one successful theoretical approach to
dealing with the quantum many body problems of this type.
