ComputingThis project encourages more students, especially minorities, women,
and the physically disabled, to enter careers in computer science and
engineering. The target audience consists of students enrolled in introductory
classes for non-science majors, future teachers, as well as introductory courses
for computer science and engineering majors. The project illustrates the major
themes of computer science and engineering; fosters technological literacy; and
provides hands-on familiarization, exploratory learning and experimentation with
computer applications using an integrated academic program of interactive,
instructional software and digital video delivery options. Two modules,
Computers and Television, and Computers and Music, are being designed,
developed, prototyped, and evaluated. Provisions are being incorporated into the
products so that they may be ported to various software platforms. The goal of
the products is to allow students to not only master the most important
principles of computer science and engineering, but also discover that science
is exciting, engaging, and interesting and open to minorities, women, and the
physically disabled.
