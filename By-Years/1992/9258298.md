The research activities includes: the design, synthesis, and study of molecular
and polymeric liquid crystals with useful electrical and/or magnetic properties;
investigations of supermolecular organizations to create new organic metals,
magnetic materials, nonlinear optical materials, and ferroelectric liquid
crystals; and new conducting polymers with novel electronic structures and with
chemically sensitive conductivities.
