CTS - 9526328 Nair Rodriquez-Hornedo University of Michigan ABSTRACT The project
aims at understanding the molecular processes that control crystallization
during dissolution of metastable solid phases in the presence of surfactants.
The objectives include identifying the role of metastable solid phases on the
nucleation of stable molecular crystals and explaining the effects of surfactant
association on nucleation mechanism and crystal morphology. Experiments will be
performed using dihydrate carbamazepine as a model drug and two types of
surfactant, aliphatic long-chain surfactants and bile salts. Molecular modeling
will be used to study the role of crystallographic parameters and molecular
structure of dominant crystal faces. The key question is whether nucleation of
the stable crystalline phase is enhanced by crystal surfaces of the dissolving
metastable phase. If nucleation occurs at very low supersaturations, the drug
concentration in solution may never reach the desired levels. The results on the
effects of surfactants on nucleation and crystallization will be particularly
useful to the pharmaceutical industry and may also have an impact on the
manufacturing of specialty chemicals.
