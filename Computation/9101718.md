This project concerns the development of numerical methods designed to assist
the computer-aided analysis of nonlinear oscillation problems. The investigator
undertakes work on the computation of normal forms for certain infinite
dimensional systems, and a study of the relationship between that and a
Lyapunov-Schmidt based technique developed by the investigator for the analysis
of Hopf bifurcation problems. The use of symbolic manipulation software is
expected to play an important role in this local analysis. Simultaneously and
complementarily, the investigator will undertake significant modifications and
improvements of existing simulation and numerical curve tracking software that
he has developed. The issues addressed and techniques proposed are selected to
promote the analysis of problems typified by systems possessing "time-delay"
effects. Such so-called functional differential equations are important in their
own right, and provide a transition towards analyzing analogous questions in
problems from fluid dynamics. Specific problems include models of chugging in
liquid propellant fuel rockets (where the time delay corresponds to the time it
takes to vaporize fuel), oscillations in coupled (Josephson Junction)
semiconductors, and pattern formation in diffusive chemical reactions. Both the
analytic and computational aspects of this research are motivated by the goal of
making the mathematical analysis of certain dynamical systems more accessible to
nonspecialists in the field.
