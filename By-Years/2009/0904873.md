The 2009 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Mobile Ad hoc and Sensor Systems
(MASS-2009) to be held at Macau SAR (Hongkong), PRC October 5- 8, 2009. MASS is
a good quality annual meeting; it provides a venue for presenting new research
results on ad-hoc and sensor networks. The conference fosters exchange of ideas
among researchers and practitioners. In addition to technical paper
presentation, the conference will also have keynote talks, panels, and
workshops.

Participation in MASS-2009 will be an important experience for US based graduate
students; about 10 US based graduate students (including female and minority
students) will participate in this conference using the provided support. It
will not only provide them an opportunity to interact with peers and
distinguished researchers, but also expose them to cutting edge research in the
field of computer communications and networks. Such experience will be helpful
to their education, career and professional growth.
