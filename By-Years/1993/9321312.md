This proposed research represents an effort to understand methods in
nonequilibrium statistical mechanics in terms of ergodic theory and dynamical
systems theory. This connection will be studied using model systems which are
sufficiently complex to be ergodic and mixing but sufficiently simple to permit
an analytic treatment, supplemented by computer studies, when necessary. ***
