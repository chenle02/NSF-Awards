Theoretical studies and computer simulations of limited gene flow in uniformly
distributed plant populations predict the development of patches of genetically
similar individuals. This study will measure the fine-scale genetic structure of
a large old-growth stand of Turkey Oak (Quercus laevis) to test the isolation-
by-distance model. The age of this stand, its carpet- like distribution, and the
uniform habitat make it an excellent test case for genetic isolation-by-
distance in the most simple circumstances. A plot of 160m X 160m will be
surveyed on a 10m grid and 10 trees will be sampled from each of 256 quadrats.
These will be genotyped for 12 polymorphic allozyme loci using starch gel
electrophoresis. Spatial structure will be described with spatial
autocorrelation, spectral analysis, and stochastic models. Paternity exclusion
and mating system analysis will be used to estimate the distribution of pollen
and seed travel distances. Observed parameters of demography, outcrossing rate,
and pollen and seed dispersal will be used in a computer simulation to predict
expected values of the spatial statistics which will be compared with the
observed values as a test of the isolation-by- distance model.
