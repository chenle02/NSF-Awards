Despite their ubiquity and importance in physics and engineering, water waves
remain very difficult to analyze or to predict, largely because of the presence
of the unknown, time-varying fluid domain and the nonlinear way the
spatiotemporal patterns affect the transport of energy and fluid particles.
While many analytical tools currently exist for studying water waves of small
amplitude, this project focuses on developing new machinery to construct large-
amplitude waves and to investigate their ability to persist under small
perturbations. Another objective of this project is to understand how energy
evolves in response to the interaction between a fluid and a solid. Results from
this project will advance the mathematical theory of water waves and contribute
to understanding of other mathematical models in fluid mechanics and other
related branches of applied science and engineering. This research also involves
training and collaboration with graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.

This project will develop a rigorous study of some nonlinear partial
differential equations arising from water waves and other fluid models,
extending some of the analytic techniques to related contexts, and integrating
the research to the education of undergraduate and graduate students.
Specifically, the proposed research addresses three separate directions
regarding the existence and qualitative properties of the solutions to the water
wave problem as well as other physically significant systems: (1) using a novel
global bifurcation theoretic machinery to construct large-amplitude front-type
solutions and solitary wave solutions to a two-phase fluid system in a channel,
and extend this global theory to handle traveling waves that evolve according to
more general symmetry groups; (2) proving the spectral stability of solitary
waves to some long-wave water wave model which are indefinite energy saddles;
(3) establishing exact energy equality for a fluid-interaction model and
deriving sufficient conditions for the weak inviscid limit of Navier-Stokes
solutions in domains with boundary. The main ingredients and techniques involved
in the study include methods from elliptic partial differential equations,
bifurcation and degree theory and stability analysis, together with energy
estimates and Fourier analysis.
