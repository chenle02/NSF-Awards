The New York State Museum houses numerous collections dealing with the
archaeology of New York State and the northeast. These materials are
irreplaceable and crucial to our understanding of the prehistory of the eastern
United States. Collected systematically by prominent archaeologists, they are an
important research resource both for the long sequence of occupation that they
represent and for their regional character. Unfortunately, they have suffered
because of past housing problems. The New York State Museum recently moved to
new climate- controlled quarters. This project, part of a three stage program,
will upgrade curatorial standards. The staff will inventory the collections,
reorganize the way the objects are stored, and conduct a survey for conservation
needs. They will also develop a computerized inventory. These procedures will
help stop the deterioration of the collection and make the objects more
accessible to researchers.
