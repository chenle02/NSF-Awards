Metalliferous deposits prescipitate along mid-ocean ridges when hot
hydrothermal fluids contact cold seawater. Three classes of models have been
developed to explain this process: 1) qualitative models describing sulfide
chimney formation, based on petrologic studies of hot spring deposits at several
locations; 2) quantitative chemical models, based on what isknown of the fluids
at 21N on the East Pacific Rise, describing fluid/rock interactions but failing
to account for the changes in these interactions through time; and 3) laboratory
experiments of sulfide precipaitation, which to date have not duplicated truly
in situ temperatures and pressures. The PIs seek funds to continue Tivey's
previous work on a transfer-reaction model of chmney growth, and to validate it
against information obtained at several existing vent sites. Her model is unique
in its incorporation of both the physical aspects of an active chimney (flow
rates, fluid temperatures, porosity of the chimney walls, cross-sectional area
and shape of the chimney, etc.) and the chemistry of the fluids and
precipitates. By allowing each of these parameters to change in both time and
space, the PIs contend they, more than any other modelers, will be able to
characterize many features of the whole hydrothermal vent system.
