This project is to develop improved procedures for earthquake analysis and
design of building with asymmetric plan. This type of buildings are least
understood and generally suffered greater damage than symmetric buildings during
past earthquakes. The research will be condicted to (1) study the earthquake
response in the inelastic range, (2) develop simplified procedures for design,
(3) evaluate the adequacy of torsional provisions in current codes, and (4)
determine the optimal center for the reference center for flow eccentricity
measurement and to the location of the code-specified equivalent lateral forces.
The developments and results expected from this project will enable better
evaluation of the response of asymmetric-plan buildings to earthquake ground
motion, thus improving the capability to assess to the safety of existing
buildings and of design proposed for structures to be consulted.
