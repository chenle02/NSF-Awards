Richard J. Saykally of the University of California in Berkeley is supported by
the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in his continuing studies of
clusters using infrared spectroscopy. The goal is to determine structure, force
fields and hydrogen bond network rearrangements in water clusters (hexamer,
octamer and larger) using far infrared (FIR) laser vibration-rotation-tunneling
(VRT) spectroscopy or infrared-cavity ring down laser absorption spectroscopy
(IR-CRLAS). A water-water pair potential will be derived from analysis of the
dimer spectra, and an effective potential for the larger clusters and liquid
water will be constructed. Prof. Saykally will also investigate intermolecular
dynamics of nucleotide bases and their hydrated clusters. To support these
studies, a number of technological advances are planned including extension of
the CRLAS deeper into the mid-IR and development of a new FIR laser with a ring
cavity design. Establishing a detailed and quantitative understanding of liquid
water continues to be a problem of major importance. While the intriguing
properties of supercooled water and hydrophobic interactions occupy the interest
of many prominent chemists and physicists, the more mundane problem of
accurately describing the ordinary liquid over a wide range of temperatures is
of considerable practical importance. This project will enhance our
understanding of the liquid and solid phases of water by examining successively
larger clusters one molecule at a time, and studying these clusters in great
detail with new laser technology and state-of-the-art theoretical methods. The
resulting data will ultimately provide a more detailed description of the
important many body forces operating in the liquid. The newer effort involving
studies of hydrogen bonding of water with nucleotide bases is clearly of
fundamental significance in biology.
