This award supports the second Brazil/U.S. Workshop on Physical Oceanography to
be held in Sao Paulo, Brazil at the Oceanographic Institute of the University of
Sao Paulo (IOUSP). The U.S. organizer is Wendell Brown of the University of New
Hampshire and his Brazilian counterpart is Affonso Mascarenhas of IOUSP. The
participants include ten U.S. scientists in physical oceanography and a larger
number of Brazilian scientists than participated in the previous workshop. The
areas to be discussed include the circulation along the South American coast,
equatorial and shelf dynamics, surface and deep western boundary currents, deep
water/shelf interaction, Amazon river outflow and shelf flow interaction and
estuarian dynamics. The workshop will foster future cooperative research on the
South Atlantic. Only a collaborative effort can provide the level of human and
financial resources necessary to understand the kinematics, dynamics and
theormodynamics of this crucial part of the global ocean in the next decade.
Planning discussions for cooperative research projects will be held and will
provide the basis for a draft planning document on future Brazilian/U.S.
collaborative research.
