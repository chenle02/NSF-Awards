With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor Schelly of the
University of Texas, Arlington will elaborate the dynamics of electroporation of
bilayer vesicles. In this methodology, cell membranes or models thereof are
exposed to electric field pulses which results in pore formation in the cell
wall. These openings are useful in that it provides access to the intracellular
contents which can be altered or removed. In this investigation, the mechanisms
of pore formation and closure will be studied. Further, data will be garnered on
pore stability, durability and size control. The ability to manipulate the
intracellular contents of biological cells would be extremely useful in the
treatment of diseases. In this project, a methodology will be studies in which
holes/pores are formed in the cell wall of a cell or cellular wall model. It is
through these pores that manipulation can occur. Thus, the mechanism of pore
formation as well as factors which control stability of the pore, its size and
longevity are the goals of this investigation. This is a significant project
with regard to health care. For example, physicians could use this technique to
place a drug in a given cell and by means of the cell's natural course, the drug
would be delivered to a specific site for action.
