ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11 July 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1216046&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;PI: W.
Wilcock&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific
Support item for the University of Washington for the R/V THOMAS G. THOMPSON and
the broader Academic Fleet; namely a group purchase of winch level wind up-
grades for compliance with latest UNOLS research vessel safety standards. This
item will enhance safety, extend cable life and reliability, and provide greatly
improved support capabilities to
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit:
The PI addressed the Broader Impacts and Intellectual Merit of the proposed
equipment specifically for the R/V THOMPSON and BARNES. The research projects
supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit. The
University of Washington vessels support federally funded scientific research
throughout the world?s oceans to expand human knowledge of the ocean
environment. During operations, the vessels routinely expose graduate and
undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography through the ?Teachers at Sea?
program, real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and University
open house events. All told, the THOMPSON and BARNES are scheduled to complete
nearly 260 NSF sponsored days in 2012.
