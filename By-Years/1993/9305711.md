9305711 Schulte Variations in pressure and temperature are combined with time-
resolved Raman spectroscopy to study reaction parameters and motions relevant
for protein function. The principal focus is on two prototype processes: ligand
binding to myoglobin and light energy transduction in the proton-pump
bacteriorhodopsin. The protein is brought to a particular state of the Gibbs
free energy surface by changing pressure and temperature. A sudden external
perturbation, for instance a pressure jump or a laser flash, initiates a
reaction or a relaxation. Kinetic studies of vibrational modes that change in
position and intensity explore the highly degenerate energy surface and
relaxation phenomena. In addition to monitoring Raman bands in the visible we
use excitation in the near-infrared to obtain Raman spectra in the absence of
undesired photochemistry and resonance enhancement. These investigations provide
new information on the arrangement of the conformational energy surface in
myoglobin and bacteriorhodopsin, pressure effects on protein dynamics and on the
molecular structure of bacteriorhodopsin activation. %%% The dynamics structures
which proteins maintain to perform biological functions are distinguished by
changes in energy and volume from the unfolded polypeptide chain. Site-selective
spectroscopic studies at variable temperature and pressure provide insight into
the relative energy scales of molecular interactions in the stabilization of the
biologically active molecule. Vibrational marker bands are used to monitor
structural changes and motions in myoglobin and bacteriorhodopsin and correlate
them with protein function. Since proteins share similarities in the
thermodynamic, structural and dynamic properties with many disordered systems
such as glasses, new insights from this research will have an impact on models
for disorder and complexity in other fields of science. ***
