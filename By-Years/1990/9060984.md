Complex physical interactions which characterize reacting flows have precluded
the development of a generalized combustor design methodology. State-of-the-art
numerical models are limited in their ability to perform economical engineering
estimates or to evaluate innovative system concepts. Consequently, the design of
high performance combustors relies heavily on an experience data base, extensive
testing, and empirically based estimates of performance. Energy International
has developed a direct simulation mixing and chemical reaction processes with a
stochastic model. It is proposed that the model be applied to analyze a laminar
flame and compare the numerical results with existing experimental data to gain
confidence in the model. Furthermore, the full-simulation code will be adapted
to the parallel-processing architecture. The modified simulation code will be
implemented in a multi-processor workstation network to provide an economical
design tool for the industry. The application of these concepts will provide an
acceptable engineering approximation to actual finite-rate mixing and chemical
reaction in reacting flows, a practical alternative to the use of more
sophisticated numerical method, and an essential capability for the design of
next-generation combustion systems.
