This proposal requests support to obtaining, an NMR Spectrometer for the
following applications: Identification of semiochemicals; Synthesis of organic
compounds; Development and characterization of synthetic, selective, polymeric
membranes; Biologically active products from algae and plants; Stereochemical
studies; Bleaching and pulping studies on model compounds; Transhepatic behavior
of environmental toxicants (toxicology); Structure of copolymers and binding of
solutes; Solid polymer-electrolyte complexes (solid state probe); Structure of
multisite, viral-associated polymerase inhibitors; Geochemical origins of
S-heterocyclics; Conformation, crystallinity, and morphology of polysaccharides
(solid state probe); Structure of biologically transformed hemicellulose;
Glycero- and glycolipids of parasitic protozoans of medical importance; Control
of annelation in fused polycyclics; Delignification of wood in situ (solid state
probe); Degradation of aromatic pollutants by ligninolytic fungi; Polymer-
polymer interactions (solid state probe); Metabolic studies in insects; Computer
assisted structure elucidation; Structure elucidation of microgram amounts of
insect semiochemicals; Degradation of polysaccharides; Structure-mutagenicity
relationships in chlorinated ligno-humics; Kinetics of starch retrogradation
(solid state probe); Cation binding sites in anionic polysaccharides (solid
state probe); Structure and hydration effects in cellulosic oligomers, dermantan
sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan, mannan, and galactomannan (solid state probe).
