Riley&lt;br/&gt;0120472&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evolution has long served to unify
the study of biology, but it has now acquired a more central role. Today
evolution informs and directs data acquisition, analysis and interpretation in
all of the life sciences. This transformation comes in part from the explosion
of raw data, from sources as far-ranging as genome sequences, adaptive
physiology, population genetics, long-term behavioral studies, developmental
mechanisms, ecological genetics, large-scale ecosystem studies, functional
genomics, and phylogenetics. Such data can only be interpreted and synthesized
using highly developed database management and analysis tools and requires the
comparative tools of evolution. There is no institution dedicated to the
consolidation, synthesis and dissemination of this broad sweep of evolutionarily
relevant information. Therefore the goal of the proposed workshop is to discuss
the need for an evolutionary synthesis center, as well as the practical, data-
related capacities required for such a center. A center for evolutionary
synthesis would serve the needs of the evolutionary biology community by
providing mechanisms to foster collaborative, cross-disciplinary synthesis of
existing and newly-produced datasets. The center would also play a critical role
in the further unification of the biological sciences as it draws together
knowledge from disparate fields to increase our general understanding of
biological form and function. Finally, the center would also play a valuable
role in organizing and synthesizing evolutionary knowledge that will inform non-
academics, for example, in areas of applied evolution such as infectious
disease, drug design, and bioremediation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
