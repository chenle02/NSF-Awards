This award provides support for an ad hoc workshop on the physics of a
magnetized dusty plasma. The primary aim of this short, 3-day workshop will be
to bring together leading US researchers in the dusty plasma community to
develop the working parameters for a mid-scale magnetized dusty plasma
experiment.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will consist of a series of presentations
followed by lengthy discussions.&lt;br/&gt;Topics under discussion will include:
physics basis for magnetized dusty plasma experiments, new wave modes in
magnetized dusty plasmas, experimental limitations and diagnostic
needs.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held at Auburn University in Auburn, AL in
Fall, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;The activity will advance the scientific study of the
physics of dusty plasmas. There are presently very few studies focused on the
impact of magnetic fields on dusty plasma or plasmas with embedded paramagnetic
particles. This workshop will serve as an important first step to explore this
regime of dusty plasma research.&lt;br/&gt;
