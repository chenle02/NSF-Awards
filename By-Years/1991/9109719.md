This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Lowery to initiate studies
aimed at establishing myogenic cells of fish muscle (satellite cells) in
culture. Such cell cultures should subsequently prove to be invaluable tools for
the study of myogenesis in fish. It is anticipated that this award will help Dr.
Lowery obtain the preliminary results necessary to launch an independent
research career.
