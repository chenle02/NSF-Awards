This award is to the Cornell National Supercomputer Facility (CNSF) in
collaboration with the NAtional Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)
and the University of Alabama at Huntsville for the 1991-1994 SuperQuest
Program. This is a three year continuing award to support the integration of
computational science and its tools into the high school science and mathematics
curriculum. A national competition for high school students and teachers was
held. These students proposed the investigation of a scientific problem and its
solution using supercomputing resources. Judging was based on scientific
content, effectiveness of computational approach, creativity and clarity. The
proposals were eleven winning teams attending CNSF; for teams at NCSA and three
teams at the University of Alabama. Each team will consist of three-four
students and a teacher. The proposed topics range from the extinction of the
dinosaurs to a study of traffic jams to preserving organs at low temperatures.
The SuperQuest teams will receive training in basic supercomputer usage,
programming languages, computer graphics and basic numerical methods. They will
be aided by supercomputer experts in developing and implementing their programs
on the centers' supercomputers. Workstations will be donated to the schools and
the winning teams will receive technical assistance in setting up the remote
computing sites. The students will deliver scientific talks on their projects at
professional scientific meetings.
