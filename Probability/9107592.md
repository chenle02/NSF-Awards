The principal investigator will conduct research on several problems about the
asymptotics of the Lyapunov spectrum and stabilization by noise. Lyapunov
exponents of random differential equations characterize the exponential
divergence of solutions to such equations. The research involves several fields
of mathematics: probability, differential equations, control theory and ergodic
theory, and is relevant to applied engineering problems. The specific problems
are noise dependence of the p'th moment Lyapunov exponent, invariant probability
measures and the Lyapunov exponents in non-Markovian situations, stabilizing
effects of noise in linear and nonlinear systems, and by computer simulations
numerics for estimating rotation numbers, as well as pathwise and moment,
Lyapunov exponents. The principal investigator will conduct research on several
