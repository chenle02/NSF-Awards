The Iowa State University will initiate a four-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Molecular Biology which will offer science enrichment activities for
20 precollege students entering grades 8 and 9. This program will emphasize both
content instruction and science practice through laboratory experimentation
utilizing research techniques and equipment. Topics will include chemistry,
biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology, and biotechnology. Career
exploration will be emphasized through interactions with scientists, visits to
industrial laboratories and career planning exercises.
