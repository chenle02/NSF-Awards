The strength, movement, and associated precipitation of fronts traversing
orographic features can be significantly affected by the terrain. Dr. Knight
will continue his studies of frontal inter- action with topography via two
approaches. A two-dimensional numerical model based on the primitive equations
of meteorology will be used to calculate the suite of physical processes
involved in the interaction. The model cold front will be formed by the shear
flow induced by an evolving non-linear baroclinic Eady wave (the theoretical
analogue of a developing midlatitude cyclone). The effect of varying mountain
sizes and atmospheric stabilities will be simulated, in both the presence and
absence of atmospheric moisture. Under the second approach, the model's
simulations will guide the observational analysis of case studies of cold fronts
crossing the Appalachians. Observed fronts that are significantly affected by
the mountains will be compared with those that are not. In addition to
elucidating aspects of the interaction, the case studies will provide a partial
check on the verisimilitude of the model simulations. Better understanding of
the interaction may lead to improved predictions of precipitation in mountainous
terrain, a key aid in water resource management.
