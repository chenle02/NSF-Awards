This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).The award will fund the support of Prof. Yuri Gershtein
research program on CMS Experiment at CERN and outreach efforts with QuarkNet.
The ultimate goals of the CMS experiment is the discovery of Higgs boson and
investigation of its properties, as well as the search for new phenomena that
might shed light on the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking. The group
has made significant contributions to new phenomena searches and electroweak
measurements at DÃ˜ experiment at the Tevatron. In CMS, they will concentrate
their efforts on electro-magnetic calorimeter (ECAL), electron and photon
identification, and preparatory work for physics analyses. The group expects
that it will be able make significant contributions to the early physics
analyses and subsequent hunt for the Higgs boson and physics beyond the Standard
Model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the broader impact the proposal includes a number
of education activities. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be
involved in research at the forefront of the high energy physics. This proposal
will contribute to enhancing the existing QuarkNet effort at Rutgers University.
