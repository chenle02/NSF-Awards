This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
Chemistry Division, will study the fundamental chemistry of alumina-supported
catalysts. Such catalysts are commonly used in the petroleum and petrochemical
industries, but are not well understood. By studying the details of the surface
chemistry of the catalysts, understanding leading to optimization of catalytic
efficiency and specificity will be obtained. In turn, optimization of industrial
processing with such catalysts may be anticipated. %%% This research, supported
by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will
employ Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA) to characterize the
surface oxidation state of alumina-supported chromium catalysts, and then
correlate oxidation state with reactivity. Means of easily depositing well-
defined thin layers of known oxidation state will also be pursued. By
correlating catalytic activity with surface structure and oxidation state,
control of catalytic activity will be sought. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray
Absorption Fine Structure measurements will also be employed.
