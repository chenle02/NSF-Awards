9531053 Ritchie This REU-Site award will provide an opportunity for ten upper-
division undergraduate students to engage in experimental and theoretical
condensed matter physics research during a nine week summer program. Examples of
research projects include: materials structural characterization; imaging of
magnetic recording media structures using magnetic force microscopy; ion
channeling studies of semiconductor alloy films on silicon substrates; scanning
transmission electron microscopy studies of the structure of carbon nanotubules
and of nanometer-size particles; phonon lifetime studies in semiconductors;
quantum mechanical-based simulations of complex materials and biological
systems; and quantum Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the electronic
structure of atoms and molecules, properties of clusters of atoms; and quantum
fluids and solids. %%% Minorities and women will be particularly targeted for
recruitment nationwide, through cooperation with agencies involved in increasing
their participation in scientific research. Research results will be presented
by participants, and prepared for publication the "on-line" program evaluation
strategy developed during the previous funding period will be expanded, with
particular emphasis placed on determining how the individual student's needs
were met in terms of establishing and fostering their desire to pursue a
research career.
