The proposed research will complete the initial stages of an interactive
computer system for disaster management that will be applicable for communities
of all sizes. The system will be developed to an extent that it will be usable
as a demonstration project for a workshop with local disaster management
professionals. After using the system, they will provide feedback as to methods
of improvement. Additionally, the North Carolina State University (NCSU)
researchers will propose a set of data to collect to make the system fully
functional to predict and respond to a range of manmade and natural disasters.
After interacting with the system during the workshop, these local disaster
management professionals will discuss whether the proposed set of data is
appropriate and how it can be modified to better meet the needs of the emergency
response community.

Upon completion the computer system will be available as a new classroom tool
for earthquake engineering, urban planning, risk analysis, and infrastructure
related problems. The computer system will be the backbone on which new 3D
spatial tools for analysis will be built by the NCSU team and others. The system
will provide an information model capable of being shared across, federal,
state, and local jurisdictions. The system will provide an informational
resource from which other researchers can conduct discipline specific studies
using both the computer system and the data sets compiled from this research.
The system will eventually be made available to all communities. Additionally, a
wide range of students from underrepresented groups will work on the project.
These will include at least 1 female graduate student and 2 female undergraduate
students.
