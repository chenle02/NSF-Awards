The proposal is devoted to mathematical models of statistical mechanics. Some of
the most intriguing issues in modern research are the non-classical phenomena of
superdiffusion and superconductivity and the newly discovered doubling effect
for the second moment (representing the superdiffusion coefficient). The PI will
investigate these phenomena by employing various chaotic dynamical systems --
periodic Lorentz gases, the Galton board, Bunimovich stadia, diamonds with
cusps, etc. He will also study the classical gas of hard balls whose ergodicity
remains to be proved in full generality. The proposal also includes
multiparticle gases with a common thermostat and the fluid dynamics governed by
Navier-Stokes equations and quasi-geostrophic equations.

The proposal has a potentially broader impact on physics and other sciences. All
its problems come from physics and the proposed research activities will have
direct relevance to statistical mechanics, hydrodynamics, studies of electricity
and superconductivity. The PI closely collaborates with physicists, other
scientists, statisticians, and engineers. The PI publishes books and survey
articles, maintains a web page with all his publications (including numerical
data from computer experiments and the code), and uploads computer programs to
MATLAB exchange public forums.
