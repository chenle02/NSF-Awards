The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that
will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what
we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. One promising
approach to support learning is the use of online learning communities. Another
approach is place-based education, in which people learn about concepts through
their application in the places people know: their homes, towns, and regions.
This project examines an existing experimental online community called
WeatherBlur, which uses both approaches as well as citizen science to connect
kids, teachers, fishermen and -women, and scientists to learn about the local
impacts of weather and climate in Alaska and Maine. The project will examine how
this unique community connects people and will collect data on other learning
communities to compare what features of the community allow people to
collaborate and learn well across such diverse audiences. The research will
yield a set of guiding principles for how to effectively structure online
communities like WeatherBlur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to
contribute to theories of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) by
exploring the theory of non-hierarchical learning communities. Data will be
collected from the WeatherBlur community including social network data and a
series of stakeholder interviews to document current practices within
WeatherBlur; this data will be used inductively to help elaborate the theory.
Stakeholder perceptions and theory building will be reciprocal and iterative
through at least two iterations of member checks. Then, the project will conduct
a cross-case comparative analysis of the WeatherBlur community and other citizen
science online communities to help characterize the relationship between
different types of communities for learning. The cross-case analysis will rely
on self-report surveys and semi-structured interviews with both community
architects and community participants. Furthermore, a community observation
protocol will be constructed to operationalize the non-hierarchical learning
community concept, and will be used to enrich the cross-case comparison.
