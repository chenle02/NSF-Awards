This project studies a new approach to exploration. In this approach, the
explorer's description of where to go is not prescribed by a path, but instead
by a model of what the explorer believes. In the context of a human scientist
and robotic explorer working together, this approach transforms the co-robotic
relationship into a collaboration in which the human and robot work together to
fill in gaps in knowledge to make discoveries. The science hypothesis map is the
structure in which human scientists initially describe their belief about the
world and in which the belief state evolves as the robotic explorer collects
information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses a pressing and
understudied area of human/robot interaction: it directly tackles the challenges
of human scientist interaction with remote robotic explorer by crafting a
representation of the environment that is expressive and intuitive for the human
while quantifying information to enable meaningful robotic decisions. The
hypothesis map formulation is a novel and radical departure from our prior work
which has focused on human goal selection and robotic autonomy. It has the
potential to revolutionize exploration robotics by changing the nature of the
relationship between human and robot from supervisory control to shared
information discovery.
