Abstract LACY, J. H. AST-9618723 Funds are to be used to complete a mid-
infrared (5 mm to 25 mm spectral regime) high resolution (R ~ 150,000) cross-
dispersed echelon spectrograph and to demonstrate its capabilities on a
telescope. Initially the spectrograph is to be equipped with a 20 x 64 element
Si:As focal plane array.
