Parallel computers have the potential to significantly outperform current
computer systems. In order to exploit this potential, techniques for creating
and evaluating efficient parallel programs are needed. Current parallel
computers have significant overheads and latencies for messages and this will
continue for at least several years. Thus it is essential that programs for
parallel computers be designed with these overheads in mind. Parallel computers
are complex systems, so it is often difficult to predict the performance of
programs based only on analytic models. Thus, it is important to evaluate
parallel programs using both simulations and implementations. Networks of
workstations are already widely available and they are likely to become even
more prevalent. They provide an easy way to integrate the latest workstation
technology into a parallel system, and they provide a cost effective parallel
computer. Thus programs developed for a network of workstations have the
potential to have a significant impact. This research focuses on developing and
evaluating programs for networks of workstations. It results in effective
algorithms for both basic problems such as load balancing, median finding, and
simple graph algorithms, as well as for more complex applications such as
modeling air or fluid flows. It also results in improved network support for
algorithms on networks of workstations. As indicated, the performance of these
programs is evaluated using simulations, so that the performance can be
predicted for a range of settings, and by measurements of actual implications. A
second focus of this research is to model cache-coherent shared memory systems,
and to develop algorithms with good locality to help improve performance. Since
algorithms for networks of workstations often exploit data locality, some of the
algorithms developed for the network of workstations settings will also be
effective on cache-coherent shared memory machines. Simulations and tests help
determine which of the network algorithms perform well in this setting.
