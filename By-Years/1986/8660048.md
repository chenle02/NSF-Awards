This research is aimed at developing improved rechargeable lithium (Li)
batteries. At present the main problem to be overcom is the poor cycleability of
Li electrodes. Ultimate uses could be as power systems in satellites and
portable communications equipment. The PI plans to synthesize and purify two new
lithium salts: lithium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide and lithium
hexafluoroantimonate which are not available commercially. He will then test
them for physical, chemical and electrochemical properties followed by cycling
studies. The personnel are well qualified and facilities are adequate. Funding
is recommended for this Phase I project.
