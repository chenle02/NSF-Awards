This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating laser
cooling techniques from the science of atomic physics to fill a gap in the
technology of precision sensors. The translated science has a unique combination
of high sensitivity, good stability, and excellent reproducibility, which
provide exemplary performance and efficacy when compared to the leading
competing technologies of mechanical and electronic sensors. The project
accomplishes this goal by developing new vacuum techniques resulting in a
prototype glass cell that will enable laser cooling in a commercially practical
device. The partnership engages Triad Technology, Inc to provide guidance in the
spectroscopic cell market space and other aspects such as financing and
commercialization as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology
along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.

The potential economic impact is expected to be up to one billion dollars in
the next twenty years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the
precision sensor market. The societal impact, long term, will be significant
improvement in a wide range of vital technologies, including vehicle navigation,
energy exploration, threat detection, and secure communication.
