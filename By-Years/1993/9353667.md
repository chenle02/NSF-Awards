This project is for partial support of a conference of physics Department Chairs
to be held in Washington DC in May 1993. The conference will bring together a
large number of chairs, and it will allow planning and coordination of both the
research and education roles of physics departments in all kinds of
institutions. It will address issues of undergraduate and graduate students and
of faculty, of the role of the physics department in research, with future
teachers, and with underrepresented groups.
