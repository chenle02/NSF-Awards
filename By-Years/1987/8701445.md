Narrative: Past and present U.S. and Oriental marine farms have been developed
essentially by trial and error procedures. In the hope of improving sea farm
performance it is proposed to apply fundamental engineering principles to the
development of tuned farms for maximum production. It is intended that this
study will help provide a technical base for a new U.S. mariculture industry.
System identification via empirically determined transfer functions will help
quantify farm performance. The process input is sea surface elevation and the
output is water velocity over the farm. Past studies have demonstrated a strong
correlation between water velocity over the farm and growth rate of both sea
plants and sea animals. Long-line farms will be engineered with three different
types of crop substrates attached: hanging lines, panels, and containers. Some
of the farm features that influence the hydrodynamic performance include: main
line tension, main line length, substrate position along farm, farm sites, main
line orientation, buoy size, substrate attachment, and seasites. Many of these
features will be studied for both average and storm conditions. An important
test of marine farm improvement will be to compare growth of a crop on tuned and
untuned farms. The results of the hydrodynamic tests already completed and of
those proposed in this effort will be used to design a crop substrate and a
storm- resistant farm structure for growth of an agarophyte in the ocean. The
results of the crop growth experiments will then be used to further refine the
applied marine farm engineering methods.
