This award supports mathematical research focusing on analytic and geometric
problems associated with functions and domains defined in the complex plane. The
work combines methods of harmonic analysis, quasiconformal mapping and geometric
function theory. Certain domains which have been identified as being
particularly suited to questions of extensions of analytic maps to
quasiconformal maps, chord-arc domains, form a class whose generic properties
will be analyzed. This will include the question of whether the class is
connected. In addition, work will be done on the problem of factorizing bi-
Lipschitz planar maps, using the boundedness of a the Cauchy integral to obtain
geometric information about domains and obtaining distortion estimates for
quasiconformal maps in higher dimensions. Included in the research will be work
to extend the recent results of Bishop-Jones on quasicircles to the problem of
determining which quasiconformal maps send the line onto a chord-arc curve. The
theories of geometric function theory and quasiconformal mapping have
contributed significantly to the understanding of geometric transformations of
plane domains and domains in higher dimensions where the transformations are
constrained by the amount of twisting or shrinking that is permitted (bounded
dilatation). This project continues this tradition by taking up the study of
several new concepts which have arisen in the past few years.
