The study focuses on detailed geological-pedological characterization of the
pre-Woodfordian paleosols in Indiana, with emphasis on the Sangamon Soil. Pre-
Sangamonian paleosols will also be investigated. Although there are numerous
excellent exposures of paeosols in Indiana, comprehensive descriptions and
characterizations are uncommon, especially from a pedological viewpoint, except
in the southwestern part of the state. Far less is known about paleosols in
Indiana than in other midwestern states such as Illinois and Iowa. However, the
state is geologically well located so that the proposed study can include
paleosols developed from different parent materials, under different
topographic, and therefore drainage, conditions (paleocatenas), and over as
great a range of latitude as possible, in order to possibly evaluate differences
due to paleoclimate. In the context of our knowledge of paeosols in the
midcontinent, the study should contribute to understanding of sedimentological
and erosional histories with respect to pedological history, especially in "two-
story" or "multiple- story" paleosols often marked by lithologic and/or
pedologic discontinuities. Also to be considered are the effects of diagenesis,
definition of glacial/interglacial boundaries and stratigraphic correlation,
relative degrees of development of paleosols, and applications such as the
siting of waste-disposal facilities. The objectives of the study will be
achieved through a combination of field investigation, laboratory analysis, and
dating. All investigations will be conducted in the context of the soil profile.
