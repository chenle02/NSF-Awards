9414122 Beasley The objective of this research is the simultaneous measurement ,
using sounding balloons, of electric field and x-ray fluxes in selected
thunderstorms. The observations will be made during the verification of the
Origins of Rotation in Tornados Experiment (VORTEX) and should benefit from the
additional meteorological measurements intended for VORTEX.
