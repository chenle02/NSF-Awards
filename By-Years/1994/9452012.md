9452012 Sharp With funds provided by the NSF ILI-IG and local match, Delta
College will purchase a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS). The
addition of the GC/MS will enhance the FTIR, NMR, and high performance HPLC as
the four major instruments in Delta College's Chemistry Department. This
equipment will improve the learning opportunities for science students enrolled
in the core chemistry courses (general, inorganic, organic, and Chemical
Analysis/Instrumentation) as well as those in other specialized chemistry based
curricula such as Chemical Technology and Environmental Science. Laboratory
experiences developed using the GC/MS are a critical component for the
analytical techniques required of students in the newly established Water/Waste
Water Treatment curriculum. The GC/MS will be available to area researchers and
small businesses to conduct sample analyses and research projects that
incorporate Delta College students.
