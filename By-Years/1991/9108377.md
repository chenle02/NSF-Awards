This project involves the study of the factors which control the secretory
function of the adrenal medulla (the inner portion of the adrenal gland) during
fetal development using the pregnant sheep as the animal model. The adrenal
medulla is active in early fetal life and responds to stressful stimuli by
releasing catecholamines into the circulation. In the immature fetus before the
establishment of functional neural input to the gland, the adrenal medulla can
respond directly to stress such as hypoxia. During maturation, there is a
transition from direct to neural control of adrenal medullary secretory function
such that in the mature fetus and adult, adrenal medullary function is entirely
under neural control. The neurotransmitter mediating the neural control is
acetylcholine. In the present project, the hypothesis that the adrenal peptide
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is the mediator of the direct control will
be tested. Two specific objectives will be investigated. First, the
effectiveness of VIP and acetylocholine in stimulating catecholamine release and
biosynthesis in the adrenal medulla will be determined in sheep fetuses at
early, mid and late gestation. Secondly, the appearance of receptors for VIP and
acetylcholine on the fetal adrenal medulla at these gestational ages will be
examined. The maternal adrenal medulla will be similarly studied for comparison.
The hypothesis that in the immature fetus, the adrenal medulla responds to VIP
stimulation but not to cholinergic stimulation because of the lack of
cholinergic receptors will be tested. As the fetus matures, responsiveness of
the adrenal medulla shifts from VIP to acetylcholine in association with the
appearance of cholinergic receptors. The results from these studies will provide
understanding for the factors which regulate adrenal medullary function during
fetal life, and the maturation of these events leading to adult type of
function.//
