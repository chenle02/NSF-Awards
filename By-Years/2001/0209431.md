The fast growth of the applied area of analog-to-digital conversion has
simultaneously hindered the solid establishment of its mathematical foundations.
This has become particularly critical with the currently successful technique of
modulation, as recent results of the principal investigator have shown the
inaccuracy of the conversion error model universally adopted until now. The
research proposed in this project is based on recent discoveries of fundamental
algebraic properties of n th order modulators and aims at establishing the first
general algebraic foundations to modulation. On going research has already
proved effective in correcting the classical error model. Although new practical
improved techniques may not be the immediate outcome to this small grant
proposal, the establishments of solid foundations will enable the growth of
powerful analytical tools, opening new directions of design not accessible by
the currently empirical approach to modulation.
