Much of the theoretical work in distributed computing has assumed one of two
extreme timing models, either completely synchronous or completely asynchronous.
The goal of this research is to develop realistic, partially synchronous models
and to determine the relationships among them. This should help to identify
precisely what time behavior is necessary and sufficient for particular
properties to hold. Complementary work will be to design and analyze distributed
algorithms that have timing-based correctness conditions or rely on specific
timing behavior. Another application area is that of correctness conditions for
systems that support shared objects. The goal is to understand and unify the
large number of different correctness conditions present in the parallel
architectures, distributed file systems, and operating systems literature, many
of which are timing-based, and to quantify tradeoffs between concurrency and
time performance.
