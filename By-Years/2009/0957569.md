This award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports work by
Professor Virginia Cornish at Columbia University to carry out fundamental
studies on technology to discover cellulase enzymes for biofuel production. One
of the major bottlenecks to cost-competitive conversion of biomass to
fermentable sugars for biofuel production is the high cost of the cellulase
enzymes needed for biomass degradation. The Cornish laboratory has engineered a
general system for coupling the growth of yeast to enzyme activity, a system
that has now been adapted to detect cellulase activity and facilitate the
identification of new cellulases. This strain is now being optimized so that it
can be used to identify active enzymes from very large pools of candidate
cellulases and is being used to search the DNA of microorganisms for novel
cellulase enzymes. The optimization of the laboratory's strains around the
cellulase application will also further the technology more generally, which
will ultimately allow it to be applied to the detection of other hydrolase
enzymes needed for biofuel production and to other classes of enzymes. This
research has the potential to identify improved cellulase enzymes that could
make the conversion of biomass to biofuels and other commercial products more
cost-efficient, helping to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels for energy.
