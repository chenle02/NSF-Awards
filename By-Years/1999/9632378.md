ABSTRACT The proposed work will address thermal and mass transport phenomena
occurring during freezing of multicellular tissues. The solidification process
and tissue transport properties will be studied experimentally by using both a
directional gradient solidification stage and an isothermal cryogenic perfusion
microscope stage. Transient finite-element analyses will be performed to study
the interaction of the global thermal fields and the interface morphology fields
take place at a length scale several orders of magnitude smaller than the
thermal field. The unique approach of combining experimental and computational
investigations at the microscale and macroscale transport has a good potential
to improve the fundamental understanding of freezing in multicellular tissues
and lead to better processing protocols for cryopreservation of tissues and
cryosurgery.
