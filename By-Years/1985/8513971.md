An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Electromagnetics is
initiated at Northeastern University. This Center is an experiment in
university/industry interaction. Research will be responsive to industry
supporters and is initially focusing on: conformal phased-array antenna fiber
optical feed system; plasma and optical studies in gaseous etching;
photoconductivity of ultra-sensitive detector materials; plasma-assisted
deposition of crystalline, microcrystalline, and amorphous thin films;
spectroscopic characterization of semiconductor interfaces and heterostructures;
experimental study of the use of lateral electromagnetic waves to locate buried
objects; radar scattering studies applied to analytical modeling and computer
simulation of clutter signals; and intelligent antennas.
