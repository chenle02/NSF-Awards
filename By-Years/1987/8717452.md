The design of site developments, such as commercial buildings or residential
subdivisions, integrates the work of architects laying out the site, a number of
engineers designing the structures, site grading, storm drainage, and provision
of utilities, and review by city officials who must approve the design before
issuing a building permit. There is very little automated integration of the
work of these individuals in current design practice. As a result, the continual
cycle of design, review and redesign is time-consuming, expensive, and produces
feasible rather than optimal designs. The proposed research aims at automating
the design process through computerized integration of its component activities:
a centralized database keyed to a model of the site terrain, visualization of
the site in its existing and proposed conditions using an advanced CAD graphics
system, more accurate computation of storm drainage over the site using the
finite element method, and a design checker incorporating the city's ordinances
and rules of good design practice so that the design proceeds along acceptable
lines from the beginning. Existing site developments at several locations in the
U. S. will be redesigned to show how design can be carried out quicker and more
effectiveny with an automated system.
