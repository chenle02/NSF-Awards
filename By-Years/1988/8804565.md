This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences. It is
for the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required by
several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for one project
alone. Support from the National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts
and contributions from manufacturers, and with substantial cost-sharing from the
institution submitting the proposal. This is an instance of university,
industrial, and government cooperation in the support of basic research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment in this project will be used in the
following research projects; (1) Numerical Approximation of Convergence Rates,
Invariant Distributions and Absorption Probabilities for Markov Chains in Random
Environments; (2) Mathematical and Computational Studies of Particle Channeling
in Crystals; (3) Comparison of Measures of Biological Fitness; and (4)
Mathematical Modelling and the Analysis of Data on the Interaction of Cells with
Their Environment.
