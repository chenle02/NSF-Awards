This project is developing an introductory physics laboratory program centered
around the use of microcomputer tools for the collection, display, and analysis
of scientific data. The computer tools are used for both qualitative and
quantitative observations of physical phenomena. Laboratory activities are from
curricular materials already developed and classroom tested for the Workshop
Physics Project at Dickinson College and the Tools for Scientific Thinking
Project at Tufts University. This allows laboratory instructors at colleges and
universities to share in the educational benefits of these established
educational programs through three quarters or two semesters of introductory
physics without changing the structure of their introductory programs
significantly. Student Laboratory Activity Guides are being created for three
sets of topics: (1) Mechanics, (2) Thermodynamics, and (3) Circuits.
