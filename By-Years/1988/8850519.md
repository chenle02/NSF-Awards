The goal of this conference is to develop a k-12 Earth Science Education
Framework. Approximately twenty geoscientists representing NASA, NOAA, USGS, and
NSF-Geoscience research programs, twenty earth science teachers, and several
specialists in earth science education will take part in a 5-day conference to
undertake this task. A pre-conference paper will be prepared by each scientist
delineating the major concepts of Planet Earth within their field of expertise.
During small group sessions at the conference teachers will work with scientists
to identify those concepts that are important for all students and those that
should only be introduced to students desiring to pursue a career in one of the
sciences. This award will only cover about ten percent of the cost of this
conference. The major cost of the conference will be funded by other government
agencies, publishing companies, school systems, and the American Geological
Institute.
