This grant provides the funds to continue to make measurements of airglow and
aurora above South Pole Station, Antarctica. There are several instruments
(Michelson interferometer, a scanning near- infrared photometer, a four-channel
photometer and an Ebert-Fastie spectrophotometer) which produce infrared and
visible spectral of several atmospheric species (oxygen, nitrogen and the
hydroxyl radical). These measurements are used to deduce the mesospheric winds
and temperature, planetary wave activity and the energy of the precipitating
electrons which cause the aurora. This research is being done by undergraduate
institution.
