&lt;br/&gt;0345474 Koller&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Stanford University has been
awarded a grant to develop a framework for integrating the extremely large
amounts of information being generated by high throughput technologies now in
sequence, expression, pathways and interactions within the cell with each other,
into a Probabilistic Relational Modeling (PRM) environment that will help us to
understand complex interactions at the subcellular level. The interactions
involved run the gamut from protein-protein interactions in single species to
full pathways and higher level processes examined across multiple species. A
dedicated modeling language will be developed within the framework. The system
will be designed to focus on the strengths of each data set and on maximizing
the synergism among data sets to gain the maximum possible useful information
while minimizing the effects of the true statistical and methodological noise
within each data set individually. The project will include multiple graduate
and post doctoral students and will be used in undergraduate education as well.
