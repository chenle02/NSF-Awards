This grant provides support under the Presidential Young Investigator Program.
The project involves the application of inorganic chemistry to materials science
with a focus on the synthesis and characterization of new solid state materials.
Low temperature synthetic methods will be developed and exploited to produce
kinetically stable solid state complexes which are inaccessible by other means.
Target substances include new layered compounds such as metal sulfides which
have interesting electronic and magnetic properties. Another goal of the project
is to explore and characterize the effects of novel dopants on conducting
polymers. For example, polyacetylene will be doped with heavy metals. Such
dopants may change drastically such properties as magnetism, conductivity or
charge storage capacity. Conducting polymers and layered metal sulfides will be
investigated also as possible electrode materials for storage batteries. An
important goal of this research is the development of a material to replace
lithium in non-aqueous storage batteries.
