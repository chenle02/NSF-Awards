9412354 Scranton The Departments of Chemical Engineering and Chemistry at
Michigan State University will purchase FTIR equipment that will be dedicated to
research in engineering. The equipment will be used for several research
projects, including in particular, high-speed FTIR studies of cationic
photopolymerizations, controlling polymer structure and morphology for photonic
switching applications and structural characterization of a high performance
organic interfacial system. ***
