9322243 Karlstrom The goal of this project is to develop a sustainable
undergraduate research program at the University of New Mexico (UNM). We will be
making research an integral part of our undergraduate program with a strong
emphasis upon recruiting women and minorities into the sciences. The proposal
has two related components. First, Junior and Senior geology majors will conduct
geologic research in conjunction with a faculty mentor. Second, Hispanic and
American Indian students will be offered jobs by faculty mentors in support of
ongoing research; these jobs will lead towards development of more independent
undergraduate research projects. Our experience from past REU projects is that
undergraduates are enthusiastic about solving research problems, but they need
this type of close supervision in order to conduct and complete high quality
research. The unifying concept is to integrate more undergraduate students into
existing interactive departmental research programs. These include structural
geology and tectonics, paleomagnetism, basin studies, enviornmental geology,
planetary sciences and volcanology. New Mexico is an ideal site for field-based
research and the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences has excellent
analytical facilities to support undergraduate research. Further, the University
of New Mexico has large numbers of Hispanic and Native American students and has
made a major commitment to minority education. Nevertheless, minorities are
still under represented in the sciences. We feel that an REU site grant can have
a major impact in fostering undergraduate research and education in general, and
in recruiting minorities into the earth sciences.
