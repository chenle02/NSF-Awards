The National Aeronautics and Space Administration-sponsored balloon flight of
the Solar Bolometric Imager (SBI) is scheduled for September 2003, and it
presents an important opportunity to measure the wide-band photometric
contributions of bright photospheric magnetic structures to the total solar
irradiance variations. Uncertainty in these contributions is presently one of
the main obstacles to assessing the likelihood of secular irradiance variations
in excess of those now linked to sunspots, faculae and changes in the network
area. This effort will support co-ordinated ground-based photometry during the
flight. This will have the added benefit of enhancing the science output from
the SBI flight by broadening the range of structures measured. The greater
significance of the research lies in its direct importance for climate studies
and the interpretation of 20th Century global warming.
