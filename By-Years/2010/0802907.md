The Powering the Planet (PP) Chemical Bonding Center focuses on one of the
"Grand Challenges" for the 21st Century: the efficient, and ultimately
economical, conversion of solar energy into stored chemical fuels. PP efforts
will focus on developing the components for a solar water splitting system.
These components are: (i) a membrane-supported assembly that captures sunlight
and then efficiently separates and transports charge, (ii) a two-electron
catalyst that reduces water to hydrogen, and (iii) a four-electron catalyst that
oxidizes water to oxygen. This interdisciplinary effort will involve
semiconductor materials, polymeric and inorganic membranes, synthesis, theory,
and mechanistic chemistry. The basic science pursued in PP will provide the
foundation for future carbon-neutral energy technologies. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;PP will train a diverse and talented pool of students in the
technical skills needed for the solution of this critical challenge. PP will
incorporate underrepresented groups through partnering with specific
undergraduate institutions and providing broad access to PP research scientists
through both direct and virtual (videoconference) interactions. Outside of the
laboratory, PP participants will help develop innovative curricula for high
school, undergraduate, and graduate students. PP researchers will raise the
public's awareness of the challenges of the energy problem, how solar energy can
contribute to its solution, the nature of the fundamental scientific challenges
in developing a water-splitting device, and the impact of PP research through
public lectures, national TV and radio programs. Further, PP PIs will work with
several major business leaders and companies in the U.S. to help them develop a
position that contributes positively to the energy and sustainability challenges
confronting our planet.
