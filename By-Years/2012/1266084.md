This collaborative research grant investigates new optimization models for
determining resource allocation decisions of law enforcement to interdict
illegal drug networks. These decisions focus on scheduling the activities of law
enforcement in order to successfully monitor, target, and arrest criminals in an
illegal drug network. These decisions will be modeled using a novel dynamic
interdiction framework and a Markov Decision Process framework. The proposed
models specifically incorporate the need to balance intelligence operations,
which help to identify new criminals and build cases against known high-ranking
criminals, and physical interdictions, which remove criminals from the network.
Specialized constraint programming-based optimization algorithms will be
proposed and integrated into traditional integer programming techniques in order
to exploit the structure of the scheduling decisions associated with
identifying, targeting, and arresting criminals throughout the network to solve
the proposed models.

If successful, the results of this research will provide tools that help to
better understand how to utilize scarce law enforcement resources to mitigate
illegal drug trafficking. This includes a better understanding of: (i) how to
utilize resources of national agencies (e.g., the Drug Enforcement Agency)
across various cities in partnering with local law enforcement, (ii) how to best
diversify the portfolio of criminals that are currently under surveillance by
law enforcement, and (iii) how the flow of information between criminals impacts
interdiction efforts. The results of this policy-driven analysis will be shared
with practitioners through collaborations with local law enforcement agencies.
The project will engage freshmen engineering students in cutting-edge research
and develop their high-performance computing skills by implementing the
specialized algorithms on supercomputing resources capable of exploiting
decomposition-based solution approaches.
