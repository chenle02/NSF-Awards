This project is to continue the development of tools based on Fractal Geometry
for the description, generation and encoding (compression) of images, using
automata-theoretic techniques. A design system will be developed based on Mutual
Recursive Function Systems which should be specifically suitable for concise
description (design) and efficient generation of images with a hierarchial
structure and which are characterized by a mixture of order and chaos. Images of
natural objects typically have both of these properties. The main goal is to
improve the algorithm for image encoding (data compression) based on weighted
finite automata (WFA). WFA can simulate wavelet transforms which constitute one
of the best known methods for image compression. This fact will be used to
design an encoder combining the advantages of both the fractal approach and the
wavelet transforms. The theoretical properties of WFA as computers of real
function will also be investigated. This is a new application of finite automata
with much potential, for example, the possibility of mechanical integration: an
automaton computing a function of one variable can be converted to one computing
the integral function of f.
