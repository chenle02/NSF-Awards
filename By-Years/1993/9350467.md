9350467 Fabien This is a Presidential Faculty Fellow (PFF) award. The activities
under this award include development of innovative courses in the areas of
kinematics and dynamics of machines, dynamic system analysis and automatic
controls. In addition, laboratory development and research projects are pursued
related to analysis and synthesis of mechanisms, vibration control of nonlinear
flexible structures, and design of electromechanical systems. Specific
contributions include significant and novel contributions to the field of
mechanical engineering, specifically dealing with the application of modern
control theory for electromagnetic leirtation devices, and the formulation of
linear and nonlinear control strategies for the analysis and design of high-
speed mechanisms. ***
