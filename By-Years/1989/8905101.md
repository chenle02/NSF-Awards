Modern techniques of stable isotope analysis produce routine high precision
analysis of bulk samples, but few studies have successfully determined isotopic
ratios with spatial resolution below 5000 pm for silicates or 500 pm for
carbonates. Recent developments in laser and ion microprobe techniques allow
analysis at the scale of 0.1-50 pm (+ 1 %) and refinements hold promise of
precision of + 0.2%. Theoretical considerations and preliminary analytical
results predict that sub-millimeter isotopic zonation will be found in many
rocks and that analysis of zoning patterns will provide important new evidence
regarding fluid migration, recrystallization and diffusion. I propose to use
laser microprobe and ion microprobe techniques to study micron-scale zoning in
high grade metamorphic rocks. The recently completed (Aug, 1988) laser
microprobe system at the University of Wisconsin will provide relatively rapid
analysis of samples for O, C, and S isotope ratio at 30-50 pm spatial
resolution. I propose to spend my sabbatical (1989-90) using the newly installed
(Jan, 1988) Cameca ims/4f ion microprobe at the University of Edinburgh for
detailed oxygen and carbon analysis at 0.1-1.0 pm resolution. The principal
rocks and to elucidate the causes of such heterogeneity. Samples have been
chosen so as to restrict theories of fluid migration in the deep crust,
granulite genesis, and cooling/uplift rates.
