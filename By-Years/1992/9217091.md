The Grand Challenge Application Groups competition provides one mechanism for
the support of multidiscipinary teams of scientists and engineers to meet the
goals of the High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Initiative in
Fiscal Year 1992. The ideal proposal provided not only excellence in science:
focussed problem with potential for substantial impact in a critical area of
science and engineering) but also significant interactions between scientific
and computational activities, usually involving mathematical, computer or
computational scientists, that would have impact in high-performance
computational activity beyond the specific scientific or engineering problem
area(s) or discipline being studied. This is a project to research and develop
an Automated Interactive Microscope (AIM). The AIM will combine the latest
technologies in light microscopy and reagent chemistry with advanced techniques
for computerized image processing, image analysis, and display, implemented on
high-performance parallel computers. This combination will produce an automated,
high-speed, interactive tool that will make possible new kinds of basic
biological research on living cells and tissues. While one milestone of the
research will be to show the proof-of-concept of AIM, the on-going thrust will
be continued development as new technologies arise and the involvement of the
biological community.
