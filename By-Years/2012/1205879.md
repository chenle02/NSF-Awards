This project deals with structures and applications of combinatorial link
homologies. The first theme of the proposed research is link homologies and
embeddings of Lie algebras. It is known that certain embeddings of Lie algebras
induce state sum formulas for the corresponding polynomial link invariants. The
Principal Investigator (PI) will study how to "lift" such formulas to the
categorifications of these link polynomials. The main motivation for this is a
potential explicit categorification of the Kauffman polynomial using certain
additional structures on the Khovanov-Rozansky homology. The second theme is
twistings in link diagrams and the Khovanov-Rozansky homology. Krasner
simplified the Khovanov-Rozansky chain complex of a two-strand twisting, which
has led to new topological and structural results about the Khovanov-Rozansky
homology. The PI will further study applications of this simplified chain
complex. The final theme of this project is the spanning tree model. The PI will
study potential applications of the explicit spanning tree model for the odd
Khovanov homology of knots recently discovered by Roberts, Jaeger and
Manion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the late 1990s, Khovanov pointed to a new
direction in the quantum invariant approach to low-dimensional topology. His
work showed that, instead of working inside a linear space or a module, one
should work inside a category. This way, the construction will lead to
homological invariants which retain more topological information than the
polynomial invariants. Such homological invariants are called categorifications
of the corresponding polynomial invariants. Khovanov categorified the Jones
polynomial and, with Rozansky, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial. Experts have used these
categorifications to prove topological theorems that were only accessible by
geometric analysis before. Among these, the best known is Rasmussen's
combinatorial proof Milnor's Conjecture. The goal of this project is to further
expand the scope of the categorification approach to knot theory by better
understanding existing categorifications, constructing new categorifications and
finding new applications of these categorifications.
