This project is a continuation of a successful program previously funded for
junior high and high school science and/or mathematics teachers. Thirty-two
teachers will be given the opportunity to develop proficiency in robotics labs,
utilizing these labs and concepts as a classroom resource. This will be
accomplished by holding sessions once a week during the spring semester and a
week-long session in June. Classroom visitations for purposes of support and
observation will be conducted throughout the spring and again the following
fall. The outcomes will include heightening the teachers' capabilities in
articulating "Hi-tech" careers for the students in this newly emerging area of
technology. This hands-on, experiential project aims to motivate and excite the
teachers and students to the many possibilities of technology in their lives.
The intention is to integrate the robotic technology into the existing science
and/or mathematics curricula.
