This Arctic project will measure a number of trace gases which play an important
role in the destruction of stratospheric ozone. The measured species will
include hydrogen chloride, methane, nitrous oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ethane,
water vapor, nitric acid, chlorine nitrate, carbon dioxide, the
chlorofluorocarbons F11 and F22, ozone and carbon tetrafluoride. The measurement
will be made from the ground by a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer
operating in two modes. The primary mode will be to view the rising (or setting)
sun at high spectral resolution and to deduce the atmospheric constituents by
observing the absorption of solar infrared radiation and simultaneously deduce
the altitude distribution of some of the trace gases. The secondary mode will be
to use the FTIR at low resolution to measure emission from trace gases during
the polar night when the sun is unavailable as a source of radiation. This
project is important for the study of global change, especially for the effects
of man-made chlorine bearing compounds on the ozone layer.
