This project will allow botanists at the the California Academy of Sciences to
complete three activities that are critical to preserving and making available
for study parts of the botanical collection. These activities are: (1) Mounting
and curating a historic collection of 40,000 plants from Sierra Nevada; (2)
curation of the Lupinus collection, perhaps the finest in North America; and (3)
refoldering all type specimens within acid-free folders. CAS's plant collection,
with approximately 1.6 million mounted specimens and 8900 primary and secondary
types, is the fifth largest in the U.S. Geographic representation is weighted
toward North America and Latin America (75%), with major holdings from
California and Mexico. Collection use by professionals and students is high over
the past five years (700 visitors; 400 loans, 65,500 specimens). This project
will insure the conservation of extremely important holdings at CAS and
increasing the availability of the collection for studies in biodiversity of
North and MesoAmerican plants.
