This proposal aims to support the International Conference and Workshop on
Cluster Algebras and Related Topics, to be held in Mexico (Morelia and Mexico
City) in December 2008. These activities will be cofunded by the Algebra, Number
Theory, and Combinatorics Program and the Office of International Science and
Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cluster algebras provide a unifying algebraic
and combinatorial framework for an impressive variety of phenomena in settings
as diverse as quiver representations, Teichmuller theory, classical and non-
commutative algebraic geometry, tropical calculus, Poisson geometry, Lie theory,
and combinatorics of fans and polytopes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference
and workshop bring together both young and established researchers working on
all major lines of inquiry involving cluster algebras and objects derived from
them (cluster categories, cluster varieties, quivers with potentials, etc.),
with the goal of cross-fertilization and exchange of ideas between the different
domains of application. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference and workshop
attracted approximately 100 participants, including a large number of young
researchers, most of them from the US and Latin America. The format of the event
---a week of introductory mini-courses followed by another week of research
talks---is designed to introduce young mathematicians into this exciting field,
and facilitate exchange of ideas between established researchers with different
mathematical backgrounds.
