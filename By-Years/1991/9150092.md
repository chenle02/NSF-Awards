Approximately 600 demonstrations will be recorded on videodisc for use in
teaching introductory physics by high school and college teachers and at
informal science programs. The experiments will be chosen mainly from the
collection at the University of Maryland by high school teachers. The use of two
channel audio will enable teachers to use the narration supplied or use their
own. Transcripts of the narration, notes on construction of demonstrations and
information about the demonstrations accompany the videodiscs. The
demonstrations will be keyed to popular physics texts and a search routine will
be available. The discs will be distributed commercially.
