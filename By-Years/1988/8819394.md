The nonlinear optical properties of quantum-confined structures and
superlattices in GaAs-GaAlAs semiconductors has been of significant recent
interest. The PI's previous research have shown that by growing asymmetric
quantum-well and superlattice structures, one can achieve second-order nonlinear
susceptibilities otherwise unobtainable in conventional materials and comparable
in magnitude to those of organic nonlinear materials, without limitations
usually found in organic materials. The practical implementation of the results
can find important applications in doubling the frequency of semiconductor
injection lasers, waveguide couplers, various sensors, optical logic elements,
novel ultra-fast and very sensitive photodetectors, and in testing of electronic
circuits. The current research will investigate more interesting
heterostructures involving materials with various band-offset combinations, as
well as some of the novel opto-electronic devices based on asymmetric quantum-
well structures. Theoretical work will involve enhancement of the previous model
in order to study a wider range of materials and geometries and in order to
better predict the performance of the devices. Experiments on nonlinear and
time- resolved spectroscopy of asymmetric quantum wells will be conducted in a
new laboratory currently being established. The results of the research could be
an important step toward engineering of novel nonlinear materials and opto-
electronic devices.
