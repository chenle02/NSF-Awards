Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will initiate a 2-week residential Young
Scholars project for 20 students in grades 10-11 in engineering. The NYS Center
for Advanced Technology in Automation and Robotics will conduct a two-week
resident course entitled "Computer Integrated Engineering and Manufacturing
Systems". Recruitment will concentrate on identifying potential minority,
female, and disabled students from throughout NYS. The course will offer
instruction in key disciplinary subjects, hands-on laboratory experience, and
exposure to operating manufacturing facilities. Emphasis will be placed on
exposing students to research methodologies, exploring careers in engineering
and discussions of the philosophy and ethics of the engineering profession. The
knowledge gained during this course will assist students in career selection and
increase the number of students selecting an engineering curriculum for
universities studies. Follow up activities will allow students the opportunity
to give presentations on their academic experience to fellow students.
