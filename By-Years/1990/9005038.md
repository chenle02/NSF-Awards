This program is a study of the interaction of clusters of galaxies with the
cosmic microwave background radiation. Both theoretical calculations and a
series of observations will be made. The principle investigator has been largely
responsible for the observational evidence for the existence of the Sunyaev-
Zel'dovich effect, which predicts small irregularities in the background
radiation due to the effect of clusters of galaxies. These observations and
their interpretation are very difficult, and this investigator is widely
regarded as the leading expert on these studies. If successful, this work will
lead to a greater knowledge of the constituents of clusters of galaxies, and a
new method of determining the Hubble constant.
