This project will advance the understanding of multi-phase flows that are
encountered in many scientific and engineering applications. Multi-phase flow
problems exhibit highly dynamic, complex interfaces, and the project will
develop computational tools to predict the evolution of such interfaces; the
challenge is that these interfaces may be largely deformed with intricate
localized patterns. Methods for numerically tracking and predicting the dynamics
of the interfaces must be able to correctly capture local features with optimal
computational costs and high accuracy. This project aims to develop and analyze
techniques for fast and highly accurate interface reconstruction methods with
emphasis on three-phase (liquid-gas-solid) flow. An application of interest here
is deposition of eye drops onto 3D realistic eye geometries. The project also
involves research training and integrated education of students in an
interdisciplinary setting and the development of codes to support reproducible
research.

The volume-of-fluid (VOF) method is one of the most commonly used interface
tracking methods in multi-phase flow simulations. Research in this project
involves the development of techniques to improve the accuracy of the interface
reconstruction scheme for the volume of fluid method for simulating multi-phase
problems on complex geometries. The three most important aspects we are
investigating are (1) robust and highly-accurate partition of unity multivariate
approximation volume-of-fluid (PUMA-VOF) method; (2) simultaneous space-time
schemes for advection-type partial differential equations (PDEs) on time-varying
domains; (3) mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of problems with
moving geometries. The research will include theory and practical application of
PUMA-VOF on the field of scientific simulations on complex geometries.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
