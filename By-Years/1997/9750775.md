Kinetic experiments are often limited by the necessity of hand mixing, which
produces atypically slow reactions. These reactions are not representative of
those encountered in real-world situations. This limitation is being addressed
by the purchase of a stopped-flow apparatus with fluorescence and absorbance
detection equipment. Six kinetic experiments are being developed that illustrate
fundamental chemical and biological processes and incorporate them into the
physical, analytical, inorganic, and biological chemistry laboratories. These
new experiments are developing the chemical intuition of the students, giving
them a sense of the time scales over which reactions occur. Examples include the
very fast proton transfer reactions and the much slower rates involved in
protein folding. The experiments being developed are: Proton Transfer an
experiment based on the CO2 carbonic acid bicarbonate equilibrium; Electron
Transfer the reduction of cobalt (III) pentamine complexes by Fe(CN)64-, which
demonstrates the discrete nature of ion pair formation followed by electron
transfer; Ligand Substitution two proposed experiments, one that shows faster
than expected rates for octahedral substitution, and the other that serves as an
alternative to classic spectrophotometric multicomponent analysis by using time
rather than wavelength as the discriminator; Protein Folding the determination
of the rates of refolding of several proteins separating the various stages of
the process by using a fluorescent probe as a marker for conformational changes;
and Enzyme Kinetics chance's method applied to peroxidase, which demonstrates
the formation of the enzyme substrate complex and its concurrent disappearance
with the formation of product. The instrument is having a significant impact on
the laboratory curriculum because it allows teachers to give students a better
sense of fundamental chemical processes and kinetics while exposing them to
state-of-the-art instrumentation. *
