The PIs will use a new computer code to simulate seismic wave propagation in
some characteristic structures of mid-ocean ridges. Full waveform modeling of
anisotropic and heterogeneous media will be an essential tool in the planning
and interpretation of seismic experiments targeted at mantle structure beneath
the oceans. The PIs will investigate the use of ray theory in passive OBS
experiments. Predictions of seismic observables will be compared to those
obtained of waveform modeling using a pseudo-spectral method. The research will
concentrate on three structural features: normal oceanic crust and lithosphere,
a mid-ocean ridge and a segmented slow-spreading ridge (where structural
wavelengths become smaller than the signal wavelengths).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
