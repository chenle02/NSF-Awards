An applied physics instrumentation laboratory is being assembled to introduce
students to modern techniques of computer interfacing using LabVIEW. LabVIEW, a
graphical programming language produced by National Instruments, is an
application used widely in industry. Based on past experiences, LabVIEW-based
projects can provide very useful training for undergraduate physics majors.
Several students have obtained employment due to their LabVIEW training.
LabVIEW-based instruction is bring fully integrated into the applied physics and
engineering programs. Students are learning the basics of interfacing using
LabVIEW, and then undertaking individual projects based on real-world
applications.
