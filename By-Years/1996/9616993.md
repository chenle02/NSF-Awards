Improving productivity and reliability of labor-intensive high-performance
software is an important scientific problem with obvious economic ramifications.
This research is testing the feasibility of a radically new compilation and
meta-compilation methodology to improve productivity and reliability for high-
performance algorithmic software in the C programming language. The research
combines partial evaluation for deeply-nested SETL data structures, data
structure and algorithm selection techniques, and transformational techniques
from relational query optimization. This is leading to a statically typed
variant of SETL from which it is expected large-scale C programs can be
generated at a high translation rate.***
