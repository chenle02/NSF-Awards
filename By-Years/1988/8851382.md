The Advanced Workstation Applications and Graphics Laboratory includes a number
of scientific workstations in a network with peripherals such as printers,
plotters, a video recorder and associated software. The system is expandable and
could include as many as 40 workstations. The laboratory network is connected to
a campus network to extend access. The laboratory is expected to: 1) improve
instruction in the sciences through detailed visual displays of molecular
structures, simulations of complex systems, complex mathematical surfaces and
functional relationships; 2) provide students with the tools for computer
graphics and other applications requiring complex, high-speed computations such
as CAD, map preparation from large data bases, and modeling of electronic
andmolecular structures; 3) provide students with state-of-the-art instruction
in computer graphics; 4) prepare high-quality, sophisticated courseware which
requires high-resolution graphics. The grantee provides funds for this project
that are an equal match for the NSF award.
