This award supports advanced accelerator physics research and education program
at the existing Stony Brook Center for Accelerator Science and Education (CASE)
at Stony Brook University (SBU). It draws on CASEs ability to pursue cutting-
edge, forward-looking explorations in accelerator physics to study the physics
of advanced cooling for circular high-energy hadron and lepton
colliders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This research is
focused on developing the groundbreaking concept of Enhanced electron Cooling
(EeC), a novel stochastic cooling techniques with bandwidth of ~(10)^17 Hz
capable of cooling TeV-scale hadron and muon beams. The availability of such
cooling technique would have a major impact on the discovery potential of future
high-energy colliders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The
success of this research will entail transformational advances in various
branches of science, affording broad benefits to society. Cooling techniques
would significantly impact both nuclear and particle physics through the
enhanced capabilities of existing and future colliders. The process of enhanced
bunching could bring about a new generation of compact but intense sources of
incoherent radiation. Two students and one postdoc involved in the program will
be immersed in an atmosphere of cutting-edge accelerator research and
development. The group will work towards broadening the educational, outreach,
and diversity programs at SBU and CASE.
