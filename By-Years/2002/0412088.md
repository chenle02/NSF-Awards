&lt;br/&gt;This award is for partial support a conference on Harmonic Analysis,
Ergodic Theory and Probability. A classic example of the interplay among these
topics is the use of harmonic analysis to prove convergence results for ergodic
averages. Recently, there has been a great deal of interplay between these two
fields, including major advances on several open problems. This interplay
touches upon subjects of active interest in probability theory, such as
martingales, Bernoulli convolutions and random polynomials. Seemingly unrelated
advances in these fields that were reached independently in the past few years
have several joint features and the proposed conference will elucidate these
relations. The conference aims to make these advances better known and discuss
open problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the meeting is to
expand research activities in these closely related fields, bringing together
researchers in different areas to solve similar problems and strengthening the
cooperation between groups working in different physical locations. We plan to
especially encourage women, underrepresented minorities, junior mathematicians
and graduate students to attend and a significant portion of the budget is
devoted to this. &lt;br/&gt;
