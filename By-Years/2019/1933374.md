The requested funding will be used to continue providing guidance on major
ocean-related science, engineering, and policy issues to the federal ocean
agencies, including the National Science Foundation. The Ocean Studies Board
(OSB) is the focal point within the NRC for ocean-related science, engineering,
and policy issues. The board explores the science, policies, and infrastructure
needed to understand, manage, protect, and restore coastal and marine
environments and resources. The board exercises leadership within the ocean
community by helping identify and communicate the needs of the field, responds
to specific requests from government agencies and Congress, and oversees a
variety a study projects related to ocean science and engineering and their
impacts on policy. The operations of OSB are funded by a number of federal
agencies, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), Office of Naval
Research (ONR), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the United States Geological
Survey (USGS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OSB strives to increase public
awareness of ocean issues, to support ocean science education, and to enhance
the dissemination and impact of OSB reports. The OSB also supports the
recruitment of minorities into the earth sciences through participation in
mentoring and fellowship programs. To further outreach and dissemination, The
OSB provides report-in-briefs, a short summary (4-6 pages) of the key issues in
reports; booklets on ocean themes; and brief overviews of new reports and
ongoing activities through the production of a biennial
report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
