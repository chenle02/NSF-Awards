This project greatly enhances the laboratory experience of undergraduate biology
students at the University of Minnesota at Morris by providing a microprocessor-
controlled luminometer. Undergraduate students often need quick, exciting, safe,
and successful projects that represent the state-of-the-art technology in order
to first appreciate the rewards of doing research. Great improvements are being
made in this department's ability to meet these goals by developing several
projects centered around new technologies involving luminescence detection. The
kinds of projects involve: a) quantification of bioluminescent phenomena in
whole organisms, cell fractions and biochemical fractions (fireflies,
luminescent algae, and luminescent bacteria are readily available); b)
quantification of ATP in cell fractions after being exposed to various
conditions (luminescence using firefly luciferase is by far the most accurate
and sensitive method known for measuring ATP); c) quantification of several
enzyme activities by following NADH concentration in cellular fractions
(commercially available bacterial luciferase can be used as a sensitive method
of detecting NADH and related compounds); and d) detection of antibodies using
commercially available luminescent tags. The experiments described here are so
far superior in cost effectiveness and safety to the radioisotopic methods
usually employed in this context that the grantee is being urged to publish them
for wide dissemination among college biology faculties. The approaches supported
through this grant are expected to significantly improve undergraduate biology
laboratories at the University of Minnesota at Morris and potentially to have
value on a national scale.
