ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0225014&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
major objective of the Gordon Conference in Chemical Oceanography is to bring
together every one or two years leading members of the scientific community,
along with post doctoral fellows and graduate students, to discuss new and
exciting research in marine chemistry within an informal setting. In 2002, the
Gordon Conference in Chemical Oceanography will be held at the Queen's College
in Oxford, United Kingdom to discuss research activities in the following areas:
(1) gases in the ocean; (2) Redfield ratios; (3) ocean carbon sequestration; (4)
metal isotopes in ocean cycles; (5) trace metal uptake by marine biota; (6)
marine calcification; (7) carbonate dissolution; (8) chemical transformations by
bacteria; and (9) novel organic proxies. The Gordon Conference has become
recognized as an important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary
field of marine chemistry and forge new scientific alliances. Having the Gordon
Conference in the United Kingdom will enable U.S. scientists to discover what
new research activities are being carried out in Europe and facilitate
international collaborations. For this reason the National Science Foundation,
along with the Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of
20 graduate students and 33 invited speakers in the 2002 Gordon Conference in
Chemical Oceanography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
