Professor Cassandra L. Fraser is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular
and Nanochemistry Program in the Chemistry Division to conduct research on
difluoroboron beta-diketonates that show reversible mechanochromic luminescence.
These unusual pigments change emission color when scratched, crushed or smeared,
and can self erase with time. Difluoroboron beta-diketonate dyes will be
structurally modified and their solid state and solution properties thoroughly
characterized to gain better mechanistic insight into the factors influencing
initial and post shear emission properties, and thermal and self-healing
kinetics.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;These studies will provide insight into
molecular and environmental factors affecting mechanochromic luminescence and
suggest ways to more effectively control properties for imaging, sensing and
detection applications such as opto-mechanosensors, security inks, tamper
detection, intelligence and forensic uses, unprecedented self-erasing/rewritable
responsive pigments for art, design, consumer products, and more. The proposed
research provides unique interdisciplinary research and training experiences for
graduate, undergraduate and high school students crossing chemistry, materials
science, and physics. Creative arts and architecture collaborations and related
university-wide interdisciplinary programs provide opportunities to explore
design across the length scales and to share the excitement of science with
broader audiences.
