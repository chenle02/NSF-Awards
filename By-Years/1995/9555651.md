9555651 Wulff This 3-year project involves secondary school science teachers
from New York in an innovative Science Research course. The course provides a
"fundamentally new way of teaching" by placing much of the responsibility on the
student as the prime initiator of the research and for the associated learning.
The centerpiece of the project is an intensive 3-week summer workshop where well
prepared science teachers study the general process whereby students go from a
broad topic of interest to a defined research problem. This is complemented by
learning required skills and techniques to guide and advise students as they
seek information, contacts with senior scientists, accessing information
electronically and communicating the results of the research. Academic year
follow-up includes 6 meetings with a focus on solving problems and networking.
The program enrolls 20 teachers the first year, 30 the second and 40 the third.
