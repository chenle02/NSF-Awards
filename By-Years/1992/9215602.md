Funds are requested for a Gordon Conference on fibronectin and related
macromolecules to meet in Oxnard, California, in February 1993. The paradigm of
an extracellular adhesin, fibronectin, interacting with a transmembrane receptor
has proven applicable to a number of adhesion systems. In parallel has come the
realization that the transmembrane receptor for fibronectin is only one member
of the integrin family of functionally and structurally related cell surface
receptors. These receptors and their ligands are involved in many basic
functions of cells of all types, including plants, e.g., adhesion, determination
of shape, differentiation, migration, cytoskeletal organization, and
organization of extracellular matrix. The challenge to the field over the next
several years is to comprehend and organize the large amount of new structural
information and design experiments based on it. This conference will serve as a
valuable forum to present and discuss new information, identify problem areas,
and plan new approaches.
