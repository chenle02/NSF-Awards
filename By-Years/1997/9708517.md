This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Memphis purchase a distributed-
memory, eight-processor computer, two graphics workstations, and six
workstations. This equipment will enhance research in a variety of areas
including catalytic hydrocarbon conversion, nonlinear optical materials,
electrochemical interface phenomenon, and the feasibility of building
`computers` from DNA. A network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new
way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a `computer
network` also serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and
algorithms, provides graphics and visualization facilities, and supports
research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing.
