The goal of the research is the establishment of accurate and physically
demonstrable dynamic interfacial crack initiation and rapid crack growth
criteria. Experimental measurement of the near-tip deformation fields at
bimaterial interfaces will be performed by means of a newly developed Coherent
Gradient Sensor technique (CGS) and ultra high speed photography. Theoretical
and 3-D numerical studies of dynamic fracture in bimaterial systems will be
conducted parallel to the experiments. These will provide direct comparison with
the experiments and will ensure the accuracy of the optical measurements. The
ability to perform direct near-tip dynamic measurements in real time will allow
us to study the effects of inertia and rate sensitivity on the initiation and
propagation toughness of bimaterial systems.
