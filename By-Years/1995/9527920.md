9527920 Rothwell Of the major groups of vascular plants (ferns, gymnosperms,
angiosperms), the conifers and their close allies (gymnosperms) have an
extensive fossil record extending back at least 300 million years, and in
deposits rich enough at times to produce coal. Despite this rich base of
material, fossil conifers and relatives are often poorly documented, with
literature reports focusing on isolated or disarticulated plant parts but rarely
integrating all material available. Paleobotanists Gar Rothwell and Gene Mapes
of Ohio University are working to improve whole-plant reconstructions of
numerous critical taxa of ancient conifers and relatives, on the basis of
material accumulated by them as well as of specimens to be studied in museum
collections in several countries. With character data amassed from both
vegetative and reproductive structures, the researchers can begin to address the
long-term goal of reconstructing the phylogenetic history of all the living
conifers, taxads, and relatives (cycads, Ginkgo) in the wider context of their
fossil ancestors. Recent molecular (DNA) findings and reanalysis of anatomical
and morphological features have changed dramatically our understanding of the
evolutionary relationships of several gymnosperm groups like the genus Taxus
(source of taxol) and the Gnetophytes. Studies of numerous fossil genera, known
at present only from scattered plant parts, will improve our understanding of
gymnosperm diversification through time, and contribute to robust hypotheses
about lineage relationships among the seed plants.
