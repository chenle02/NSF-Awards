Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-
0415979&lt;br/&gt;Beebe/Delaware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project,
carried out in collaboration between Professors Beebe and Teplyakov in the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Delaware, uses nanopits in graphite
surfaces to template the growth of silicon oxide nanostructures. These "molecule
corral" templates can be formed in a controlled fashion on the graphite
substrate, and are used to controllably synthesize a range of silicon oxide
nanoparticles, whose surface modification chemistry is then systematically
studied. Information from this work helps to design process chemistries for the
synthesis of nanomaterials with promising applications in electronic devices and
sensor systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program, Professors Beebe and Teplyakov at the University of
Delaware are examining methods for controllably synthesizing silicon oxide
nanoparticles of various sizes, shapes, and size distributions. Using "molecular
corrals" developed in Beebe's laboratory as templates, a wide range of
controlled nanomaterials can be produced. The surface chemistry of these silica
nanomaterials is then examined in this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
