Wetlands are at the forefront of national and international research,
management, and advocacy addressing water futures, biodiversity, development,
and sustainability. As such, they have generated national and regional
contestations over science, water, and livelihoods. Under the supervision of
Prof. Stephan Helmreich, Ph.D. student Caterina Scaramelli will conduct
ethnographic and archival research on two coastal wetland sites in order to
better understand the role of conservation science in wetland monitoring and
management.

In addition to producing a dissertation, the co-PI will share her findings by
creating an online platform for hosting research data and video production. This
aspect of the project promises to add innovative tools for research,
communication, and public dissemination.
