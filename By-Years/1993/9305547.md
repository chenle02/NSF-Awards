All statistical procedures result in an inference, a statement that is based on
both the observed data and the assumed model. Since there are often model
assumptions that are difficult (or impossible) to check, it is desirable for
inferences to be robust against model assumptions. The inferences that we are
most concerned about are post (data accuracy measures for confidence sets and
hypothesis tests. Such measures are often derived through decision theoretic or
Bayesian arguments, hence are based on assumptions about sampling distributions,
loss functions, and prior distributions. Here we want to investigate the
performance of accuracy estimators, using both frequentist and Bayesian
criteria, as the underlying assumptions are relaxed. We are most interested in
procedures constructed from default priors, for these tend to perform well under
both frequentist and Bayesian scrutiny. One way that we will address the
sampling robustness is to combine the default priors with an empirical
likelihood to obtain a (somewhat) automatic inference robust procedure.
Robustness of inference will be judged using a variety of criteria such as
ranges of posterior probabilities, multiple and distance penalizing loss
functions and a new (and promising) theory of dilation of probabilities.
