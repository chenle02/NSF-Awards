The goal is to increase fundamental understanding of intelligent and learning
control theory and practice of this project. The specific objective is to
explore intelligient control concepts by identifying, modeling, and controlling
the combustion processes in both large gas turbines and automobile engines. A
multidiscipinary approach will be used to concurrently make fundamental progress
in control theory, develop real time learning and control algorithms, and
conduct laboratory experiments to test ideas. Results form statistics, neural
networks, artificial intelligence, knowledge-based systems, and biology will
first be investigated. A hierarchy of controllers will then be developed: a
human operator, a top-level discrete action controller, and lower level
continuous controllers. Finally, the project will verify a validate the
intelligent and learning control systems by a combination of theoretical
exploration, computer simulation, and laboratory experimentation. This research
offers the protentinal of substantial economic and societal benefits in real
world applications. An intelligent engine control system that can optimize the
proper air/fuel ratio on a real time basis can provide real advances
simultaneously in both air pollution reduction and improved fuel economy.//
