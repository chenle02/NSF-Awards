The work consists of three tasks related to the enhancement of
visualization/graphics capabilities for computational scientists. The
environment for the visualization is on workstations where data from
supercomputers can be more efficiently manipulated by the user. One of the tasks
is the development of new strategies for coarse grained parallelism on a local
network of these workstations. The other two deal with better methods for the
display of engineering data.
