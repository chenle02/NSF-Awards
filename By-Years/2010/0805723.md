This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Biology for FY 2008. The
fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Examining microbial
biodiversity and spatial-temporal distribution using phylogenetic clustering and
overdispersion analyses." The Fellow is Kathryn M. Docherty and the sponsoring
scientist is Professor Jessica L. Green at the University of Oregon Center for
Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.

A very diverse community of microorganisms plays critical roles in
biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem function yet we do not have an in-depth
knowledge of these roles in linking spatial, temporal and environmental
variation. This project examines nitrogen-cycle related microbial biodiversity
using two powerful and cutting-edge informatics tools, phylogenetic clustering
and over-dispersion analyses, to compare microbial communities across several
levels of spatial and seasonal gradients. The advantage of using this highly
computational approach over traditional diversity measures is that phylogenetic
relatedness can be compared to ecological similarity, so that ecological trait
conservatism and redundancy can be examined and functional microbial diversity
explored, within the context of environmental and evolutionary history.

Until recently, microorganisms were assumed to be globally distributed and have
fundamentally different spatial scaling relationships relative to macro-
organisms. However, recent studies suggest that microbial biodiversity is
similar to higher organisms and that scaling can result from environmental
heterogeneity and dispersal history. This project uses various datasets
collected over broad spatial, temporal and environmental scales and uses novel
bioinformatics approaches to examine and compare several different functional
microbial communities to each other, as well as to plant and abiotic data.

The training plan provides a unique opportunity in biostatistical, mathematical
and theoretical modeling as well as professional networking, mentoring and
career-development opportunities.
