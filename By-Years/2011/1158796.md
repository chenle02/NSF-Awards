This workshop explores the technical and policy issues in cybersecurity in the
context of award activities in NSF's International Research Network Connections
(IRNC) program. Those issues include not only operational network security, but
the application of network security research and development innovations, the
proper role of IRNC activities as part of a comprehensive and secure NSF
cyberinfrastructure, and the potential of IRNC activities to contribute to
network security research and development. Experts from research and industry
are engaged for this event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit is found in
the workshop's exploration of a combined set of technical, policy, legal, and
behavioral issues in cyber security applied to a diverse set of network
infrastructure activities. Broader impact is reflected in the role of IRNC
activities in serving international research and education activities across
science and engineering domains.
