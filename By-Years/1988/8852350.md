Montana College of Mineral Science and Technology will purchase a data logger,
six water level recorders and logger, a well monitoring system, a water quality
monitor, a ground water flow meter, eight conductivity meters, a generator, a
stratigraphic gamma probe, a normal resistivity probe, two wellhead temperature
probes, a permeameter, two air-lift samplers, a gas chromatograph and an organic
vapor detector. This equipment will be used to improve instruction in a summer
field course in hydrogeology. Students will receive "hands-on" training in well
construction, aquifer testing, well development, and water quality monitoring.
Montana College of Mineral Science and Technology will match the NSF grant with
an equal amount of funds, and also will provide funds for well drilling and
construction.
