This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program, will support Professor Bradford Wayland of the University of
Pennsylvania in his continued studies of metal-centered radicals and their
reactions with organic radicals, particularly in the context of olefin
polymerization. Recent discoveries of new methods for establishing quasi-living
polymerization in free-radical polymerization of olefins will be explored. This
is accomplished through the use of metal-centered radicals to trap the growing
end of the polymer. The key feature to the success of this strategy is the
strength of the metal-carbon bond that is formed, which must be sufficiently
weak that the reaction is rapidly reversible to allow for facile chain growth.
Living radical polymerization will provide a new approach for producing low
polydispersity homopolymers and block copolymers of olefins that can only be
polymerized by radical initiation. The initial research will center on the use
of alkyl cobalt tetramesitylporphyrin complexes to initiate and control living
radical polymerization of acrylates and to provide a prototype for establishing
guideline criteria for the design of metal complexes that promote similar living
polymerization processes. Experiments are outlined to determine the metal-carbon
bond strengths of a variety of potentially useful alkyl derivatives. The
properties of polymers not only depend upon their chemical structures but also
upon their molecular weight. Until recently it has been difficult to control the
molecular weight and especially the dispersion of molecular weights of the
individual molecules of polymers of certain types of monomers. This research
explores a newly discovered way, which involves the generation of `living`
polymer chains, to control the molecular weight including dispersion. The term
`living` means that the individual polymer molecules are capable of adding more
monomer units if they are added to the system. This allows the use of block
polymerization strategies in which a second type of monomer is added to the
living polymer so that a region of a new type of polymer is added to the
original chain. By alternating additions of two (or more) types of monomers,
polymers with new material properties that are not characteristic of those of
either monomer can be prepared.
