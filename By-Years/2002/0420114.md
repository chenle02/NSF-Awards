This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a self-contained, automated microfluidic system for gene expression
profiling. The proposed system is expected to significantly reduce the labor,
equipment, and technical skills necessary to perform a DNA microarray
experiment.

The commercial application of this project will be to enable DNA microarray
expression profiling for molecular characterization of diseases. Additional
applications include comparative genomic hybridization, detection of single
nucleotide polymorphisms and identification of thread agents like bacteria and
viruses.
