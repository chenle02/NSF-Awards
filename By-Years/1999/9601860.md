9601860 Bobba Instrumentation for in-situ characterization of electrochemical
and optical materials and for graduate education in materials science will be
acquired by Southern University. This includes development of an ultrahigh
vacuum scanning tunneling microscope, upgrade of a Fourier transform infrared
spectrometer, and acquisition of ultraviolet-visible-near infrared and
fluorescence spectrometers. Activities that will be supported include research
on electrocatalysts and electrolyte membranes for methanol fuel cells, solid
electrolytes and intercalated cathode materials, and photonic materials
including rare-earth-doped glasses and ferroelectric crystals. The
instrumentation will also support instructional courses at the undergraduate
level and in the newly created MastersO program in Physics. %%% The acquisition
of the new instruments and implementation of the research will strengthen
faculty instructional quality and provide a strong experimental research base in
the Department of Physics. Over seventy minority undergraduate students, ten new
graduate students in Physics, and the faculty in the College of Sciences and
Engineering will benefit from use of the instrumentation. ***
