This Presidential Young Investigator Award project is in the general area of
analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfields of solid state chemistry
and surface science. There are two major thrusts in this experimental program.
The first focusses on the synthesis and characterization of low-dimensional
inorganic materials. Of particular interest to this research is the development
of an understanding of how the electrical, optical, and magnetic properties of
these materials are controlled by factors such as metal-metal coupling and solid
state structure, as well as how these factors can be manipulated synthetically.
The second research thrust centers on the use of scanning tunneling microscopy
for the in situ study of surface adsorbates. Initial studies will focus on the
structure and bonding of transition metal catalysts on metallic supports and the
structures of important biological molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces. The
research activities that are enabled by this Presidential Young Investigator
Award could give rise to the discovery of strategies for the design and
preparation of materials with predictable electrical, optical, and magnetic
properties. Additionally, these studies should yield insights into the dynamics
of interfacial processes that are of importance to catalysis and bioprocesses.
