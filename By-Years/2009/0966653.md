The principal investigators propose to organize the fifth Yamabe Memorial
Symposium, with an emphasis on geometry and low-dimensional topology, at the
School of Mathematics of the University of Minnesota from Friday to Sunday,
October 8-10, 2010. The list of speakers includes Toby Colding, Kenji Fukaya,
David Gabai, Ko Honda, Claude LeBrun, Melissa Liu, Yi Ni, Ron
Stern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Hidehiko Yamabe (1923--1960) was an active
and highly collaborative mathematician in the School of Mathematics of the
University of Minnesota from 1954 to 1960. His sudden illness and untimely death
occurred in the same year that he moved to Northwestern University. His work on
topological groups, geometry and analysis were outstanding contributions to
modern mathematics. In year 2001, we proposed to enhance the Yamabe Memorial
Lecture by creating the Yamabe Memorial Symposium, a top-level biennial geometry
conference in the School of Mathematics, University of Minnesota. Every two
years, perhaps in the Fall of even-numbered years, mathematicians will gather at
the University of Minnesota for a long weekend to hear geometry talks, discuss
the latest research and interact with graduate students and junior researchers.
In each biennium, a specific area within geometry will be singled out for
special emphasis.&lt;br/&gt;One goal will be, as a way to honor the memory of
Hidehiko Yamabe, to advance areas of mathematics related to his interests, which
touched in a substantial and ground-breaking way on several quite different
areas of mathematics, all of which may be roughly described as having
significant geometric aspects. At the same time, it will provide a valuable
opportunity for graduate students and junior researchers to interact with, and
learn from, mathematicians working at the highest international level. Finally,
a long-lasting benefit will be the stimulation of innovative developments in
mathematics research.&lt;br/&gt;The previous Yamabe Memorial Symposiums were
held in 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008 respectively with a great
success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference web page is
