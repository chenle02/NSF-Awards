In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, laser- and microwave-based molecular beam spectroscopic techniques
will be used (1) to obtain rotational constants, hyperfine constants, and
permanent electric dipole moments of transition metal clusters of Sc, Ag, and Pt
and their hydrides and carbides; (2) to study the predissociation of CH; and (3)
to study the vibronic problem in MgOH by measuring the proton magnetic hyperfine
constants. The first study provides tests for ab initio calculations, while the
second is a way of examining the nature of two states which become mixed in an
avoided crossing. Since the states differ in their electronic character, the
Stark shifts provide some information which can be used to deduce the mixing set
of levels. In the third problem the observed constants can provide information
about the potential energy surface shape. %%% The goal of this research is to
simplify optical spectra in order to study the dynamics and structure of very
short-lived (transient) gas phase species. The chemical bonding in some very
fundamental chemical species containing transition metals will be investigated.
An understanding of such bonding is important in surface science and inorganic
chemistry, and has implications for catalysis.
