Researchers at the University of California, Davis (UCD) will collaborate with
other scientists in the Ocean-Atmosphere-Sea Ice-Snowpack (OASIS) 2009 field
campaign at Barrow, AK. This project has three main objectives, centered around
the photochemistry of snow: 1) Measure the amount of light absorption by soluble
species in/on snow grains, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitrate, nitrite,
and unknown (presumably organic) chromophores. 2) Measure the physical,
chemical, and optical properties of the snow. 3) Integrate these results to
characterize the contributions of organic chromophores to light absorption in
snow, determine the physical and chemical factors affecting light fluxes and
light absorption in snow, examine the effects of snow photochemistry on snow and
boundary layer composition, and model the snow photochemistry. The UCD team will
also coordinate the OASIS field campaign. This would be among the first studies
of the contributions of organic species to the pool of chromophores in/on snow
grains, and could lead to significant advances in our understanding of snow
photochemistry and its impacts on atmospheric composition.

Broader impacts include: outreach via live web cams during the field campaign;
coordination with U.S. and international TV stations to cover the Barrow field
work; participation of undergraduate students; educational outreach to students
at a rural high school near Davis; coordination of data archiving from the field
campaign; and hosting OASIS 2009 sessions at conferences.
