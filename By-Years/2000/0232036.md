This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to
investigate the design of learning objects that are intelligent, activity-based,
accessible and reusable. Intelligent tutoring systems have been shown to be
instructionally effective in mathematics, science, and writing instruction.
Intelligent tutoring systems, however, are often not practical due to the costs
and resources required to design, develop, and evaluate them. The goal of this
effort is to enhance the capability of instructional developers by creating
intelligent learning objects that can be used in intelligent tutoring systems
across domains in multiple science education learning environments. The plan is
to analyze skill-based science instruction to determine functional requirements
for reusable learning objects; to design and develop one intelligent, activity-
based learning object; to demonstrate its application in two science domains;
and to develop preliminary design and use guidelines.

The long-term goal of the project is to improve science education by making
instructionally effective, intelligent technologies more commercially feasible.
Commercialization plans are to market an Internet-based tutoring system for
biology/microbiology high school and community college science departments;
reuse the intelligent learning objects in the development of other intelligent
learning environments; and license the intelligent learning objects to other
educational software developers.
