This research is a continuation of analyses of previously obtained field
observations in winter clouds over the northern Colorado Rockies. The goals are
to characterize and describe microphysical processes taking place within natural
and seeded clouds for various types of weather systems as they develop and move
over the Rocky Mountains. A unique combination of tools including radar,
aircraft, upper air data, dual-wavelength radiometers, polarized lidar, surface
observations and numerical models will be used. The results of this
investigation will increase knowledge of many aspects of mountain cloud
processes including: understanding the potential of water supply augmentation by
weather modification; improved mountain weather forecasts; aircraft operations
in mountain clouds; and evaluation of environmental issues related to cloud and
snow chemistry.
