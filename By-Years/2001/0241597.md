This project will conduct a magnetotelluric survey at the Ridge 2000 integrated
studies site on the East Pacific Rise near 9 degrees north. Key questions to be
addressed are: What is the distribution, vertical extent and volume fraction of
melt present in the mid to lower crust? To what extent does hydrothermal
circulation play a role in heat removal from the crust? To what extent is melt
accumulated at the base of the crust? What, if any, connections exist between
the crustal melt accumulations and the region of decompression melting deeper in
the mantle?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
