With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Martha Macri will continue work on
the J. P. Harrington Database Project, transcribing and coding the linguistic
and ethnographic notes on American Indian languages collected by J. P.
Harrington during the first half of the twentieth century. The men and women he
interviewed were often among the last speakers of their languages. During the
1980s, Harrington's original handwritten field notes, currently housed in the
National Anthropological Archives at the Smithsonian Institution, were
microfilmed, resulting in 477 reels from which the J. P. Harrington Database is
being created. This project focuses first on the California notes and includes
some languages of Oregon, Nevada, and parts of Washington.

Harrington's notes are being transcribed and coded for several linguistic and
ethnographic categories. The notes can be printed from the database, and the
possibilities for generating lexical lists and other useful data are virtually
endless. Increased access to this enormous resource is of value to linguists,
biologists, anthropologists, historians, geographers, and archaeologists.
Perhaps its greatest value is to Native American community scholars for use in
cultural and language revitalization, as well as for documentation of tribal
histories and genealogies. It is invaluable to those studying the many languages
of California, and their complex historical relationships. The project
anticipates, and indeed depends on, the combined efforts of the academic
community and native scholars currently engaged in the study of the languages
and cultures recorded by Harrington.
