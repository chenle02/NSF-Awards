Abstract - Integration of Unstructured Text Documents in A/E/C Model Based
Systems

The Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (A/E/C) industry is adopting
established communications and information technologies to improve
collaboration, coordination, and information exchange among the many
organizations that participate in all phases of a construction project life
cycle. Inter-organizational information systems, are currently used for this
purpose. They can be described as a set of interrelated components that collect,
retrieve, process, store, and distribute information to support planning,
control and decision making between different organizations. In distributed and
dynamic construction environments, the ability to exchange and integrate
information from different sources and in different data formats becomes crucial
to improving the processes supported by these systems. Previous research showed
that a major hurdle in integrating A/E/C information in such systems is related
to its variety of data types. Since a large percentage of construction
information is stored as unstructured text documents, methods for managing this
type of data become important for construction information management.

This research focuses on developing methods to integrate unstructured text
documents for use in inter-organizational processes, developed by large dynamic
distributed virtual organizations in construction project value systems. This
investigation is based on available data from internet-based project-oriented
inter-organizational information systems developed for the construction
industry. In this research, automated processes for retrieval, classification,
and integration of unstructured text documents in A/E/C model based systems are
explored. Specifically, a combination of techniques from the areas of
information retrieval and text mining are analyzed to develop intelligent search
engines to identify documents relevant to each component of the project model.
Afterwards, an association between relevant documents and project objects will
be implemented according to the IFC specification.
