GALE (Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment), a major study of severe winter
storms along the eastern U.S. seaboard, was conducted during January - March,
1986. Oceanographic measurements of currents and water properties were made to
better assess the response of the shelf and Gulf Stream to severe storms, and to
quantify the effects of the coastal ocean on these storms. In this project, the
P.I.'s will continue the analysis of these data and testing of models in order
to better understand the physical processes governing shelf circulation and
exchange under severe conditions.
