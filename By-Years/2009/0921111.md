The 40th American Physical Society Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical
Physics&lt;br/&gt;(APS-DAMOP) meeting at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville, VA. The&lt;br/&gt;conference held from May 19 ? 23, 2009 was
partially supported by the National Science&lt;br/&gt;Foundation (NSF) to cover
the travel expenses for students to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;APS-Damop is
the primary professional society of most American atomic,&lt;br/&gt;molecular,
and optical (AMO) physicists. The meeting emphasizes atomic
and&lt;br/&gt;molecular structure and dynamics, but also strongly
embraces&lt;br/&gt;quantum optics, atom optics, and related research. Both
experimental and theoretical research&lt;br/&gt;areas are represented in
proportions similar to their national representation and NSF
support.&lt;br/&gt;The Proceedings of the meeting are published in the Bulletin
of the American Physical Society&lt;br/&gt;and are available on the World Wide
Web.&lt;br/&gt;
