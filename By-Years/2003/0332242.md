This award helps support a conference entitled, "Tropical Climate Variability
Beyond the Historic Record" at the University of Southern California in the
summer of 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the award provides travel
support for approximately twenty scientists with expertise in terrestrial and
marine aspects of climate to participate in presentations and discussions that
synthesize the latest scientific research on modern-day, early Holocene, and
last glacial records of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the conference is to bring together an
internationally recognized group of climatologists, modelers, geochemists,
paleoceanographers, and paleoclimatologists to share the latest ideas on
tropical climates and ENSO. The participants, which include seasoned
researchers, new investigators, and students, will produce and distribute a
document synthesizing and summarizing the conference proceedings and findings
for examination by the wider scientific community. In this manner, an open and
lively exchange of views on this important topic will be enabled.&lt;br/&gt;
