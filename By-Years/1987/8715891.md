The American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Society
for Microbiology will jointly prepare a report on the state of biotechnology in
Latin America. The report will identify Inter-American cooperative activities
that may be useful for U.S. scientific societies, universities, and biotechnolgy
companies. The report will describe and analyze national and regional
experiences that address the three critical constraints currently facing the
basic and applied biological sciences in Latin America: l) the lack of capital
resources and trained personnel; 2) unavailability of materials and equipment;
and 3) limited information available to the scientific community.
