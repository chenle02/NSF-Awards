A mid-infrared (4 to 27 micron meters) imaging echelle spectrometer will be
built for the Keck Telescope. The instrument, dubbed SADIE (San Diego Imaging
Echelle), is to be a general purpose user instrument serving all of the
University of California, Caltech, and University of Hawaii astronomical
community as well as their collaborators. It is the only dedicated infrared
spectroscopic instrument currently proposed for the Keck Telescope. Due to the
huge light gathering power and unprecedented mid-IR spatial resolution of the
Keck Telescope, SADIE will allow its user community to make significant advances
in many areas of astrophysical interest. Such areas include, but are not
restricted to, studies of (1) active galaxies and QSOs, (2) nearby normal
galaxies, (3) star formation, (4) planetary nebulae (5) interstellar and
circumstellar matter, (6) novae and supernovae, (7) the dynamics of stellar
systems, and (8) solar systems objects. Because it is a general purpose
instrument, SADIE will use a variety of gratings, including a low order echelle
in Littrow configuration. SADIE's spectrometer optics feed a blocked impurity
band conduction, direct readout array focal plane. Because of SADIE's versatile
design, it will be capable of broad and narrow band imaging as well as
spectroscopy at spectral resolutions of 100, 800, and 7000 at two plate scales,
0.4 and 0.2 arcsec per pixel. The 20 X 64 element array, built by Aerojet
ElectroSystems, will provide background limited performance at all spectral
resolutions. SADIE is designed to allow the incorporation of much larger arrays,
a commitment by Aerojet exists to provide UCSD with samples of their new 100 X
100 pixel, capacitive feedback IBC arrays. If these arrays prove suitable, they
will provide a natural upgrade for SADIE.
