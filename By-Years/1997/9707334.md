9707334 Fashoro This research focuses on the modeling of a pneumatic actuator
that has characteristics more similar to human muscle than standard electric or
hydraulic actuators. This involves the development of non-linear adaptive joint
motion control strategies for an artificial elbow joint driven with artificial
muscle actuators arranged in antagonistic pairs. There are two major tasks
proposed for this research: (1) the building of a one-link physical model and
the derivation of the dynamic equations for the fine motion of the elbow joint,
and (2) the incorporation of a non-linear dynamic/static artificial muscle model
into the dynamic equations of the fine motion of the artificial elbow. This
device could have use in prostheses, orthotes, robot arms and surgical hands.
