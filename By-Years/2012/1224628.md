In this project, the principal investigator and his assistants are working on a
framework for achieving&lt;br/&gt;scalability and sustainability in three-
dimensional wireless sensor network deployments. The objective is&lt;br/&gt;to
study the design of energy-efficient three-dimensional k-covered wireless sensor
networks, where each&lt;br/&gt;point in a field of interest is covered by at
least k heterogeneous sensors, in the presence of obstacles&lt;br/&gt;and mobile
events in the field. This study is based on Baxter's factorization of Ornstein-
Zernike equation,&lt;br/&gt;the pair-connectedness theory, and potential fields
to solve the problem of joint k-coverage, duty-cycling,&lt;br/&gt;and data
forwarding in three-dimensional heterogeneous wireless sensor networks with a
goal to achieve&lt;br/&gt;sustainable and scalable deployments. The principal
investigator plans to evaluate the performance of this&lt;br/&gt;framework
through simulation using a network simulator, such as TOSSIM, and implementation
using a test-bed of sensors, such as MICAz motes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project has significant impact on its field and the society. It has a rich plan
for the integration&lt;br/&gt;of research and education through the development
of curriculum and resources for teaching to a wide range of undergraduate and
graduate students. Based on the results of this project, the principal
investigator plans to develop a set of networking courses. Also, the principal
investigator has a plan to recruit, train, and mentor graduate and undergraduate
students including women and members of underrepresented minority groups.
Furthermore, this project allows the principal investigator mentor K-12 teachers
and high-school students through research seminars. It helps the principal
investigator attract and recruit students to pursue science careers.
