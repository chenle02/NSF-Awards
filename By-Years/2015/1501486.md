This project contributes to the study of science and engineering education by
addressing the research question, "Do project-based learning instructional
strategies integrated with sustainability content have an impact on student
enrollment and retention in STEM college credit certificates and degrees?"
Research-informed activities will focus on the development and pilot testing of
several coordinated strategies: (1) providing secondary students with
opportunities to earn industry certifications by incorporating a replicable
Sustainable Engineering certificate within an Early College dual enrollment
program; (2) increasing general science knowledge and interest in STEM by
offering relevant sustainability courses to both scientist/technicians and non-
science college majors; and (3) meeting workforce and societal needs by engaging
students in learning sustainability content, embedded within multiple STEM
degree and certificate programs.

Project objectives and outcomes include: (1) developing a new 18 credit hour/6
course Sustainable Engineering certificate containing specializations tied to
industry certifications; (2) increasing enrollment in Sustainable Engineering
courses; (3) increasing the number of students pursing the embedded Sustainable
Engineering certificate as part of their degree program; and (4) increasing
knowledge of scientists/technicians and non-scientists exposed to
sustainable/renewable concepts. Outcomes will further support the development of
replicable models for STEM student success, and will impact the training of the
future science and technology workforce, increasing participation among
underrepresented groups and those empowered by their knowledge about green
technology.
