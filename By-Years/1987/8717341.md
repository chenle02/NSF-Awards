The work will be a continuation of several lines of high- pressure, high
temperature research at RPI aimed principally at shedding light on the rates and
mechanisms of chemical transport in rocks of the Earth's crust and upper mantle.
The focus is upon phenomena occurring between or among mineral grains,
including: 1) CO2-H2O fluid wetting in a variety of crustal and upper mantle
rocks; 2) kinetics of fluid generation by hydrous and carbonate mineral
breakdown; 3) transport of fluid away from its source region by hydrofracture
and/or grain-edge dissolution; 4) metasomatic transport via a mobile fluid phase
of trace elements and radioactive/radiogenic isotopes; and 5) grain boundary
diffusion in rocks lacking a free fluid phase. The results will be applied to
models of large- and small-scale chemical transport in the Earth.
