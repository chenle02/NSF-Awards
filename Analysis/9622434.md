DMS-9622434 Dadarlat Purdue University Research Fdn The investigator will
continue his work on Elliott's program of classifying simple or real rank zero
nuclear C*-algebras by K-theoretical and tracial invariants. This will involve
research directed toward developing a local theory of approximately
multiplicative completely positive maps of nuclear C*-algebras with algebraic
invariants based on ordered mod-p K-theory. In a related direction the
investigator will pursue the classification of simple or real rank zero
subhomogeneous C*-algebras whose local spectra may have arbitrary dimension
growth. He will study applications of the classification results into dynamics.
C*-algebras can be thought as collections of infinite matrices of complex
numbers displaying a rich algebraic structure. They correspond to a new idea of
space: non-commutative or quantum space. Many singular spaces that are needed in
the various areas of mathematics and physics can be successfully replaced by
non-commutative C*-algebras. Remarkably, many of the tools of measure theory,
topology, dynamics and differential geometry have powerful extensions to this
non-commutative setting.
