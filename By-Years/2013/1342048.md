This project supports the US Ignite Application Summit which will be held in
Chicago, IL on June 24-26, 2013. US Ignite fosters development of next-
generation applications to provide transformative public benefit. The
applications focus on six national priorities: Education &amp; Workforce
Development, Energy, Health, Public Safety, Transportation, and Advanced
Manufacturing. The inaugural US Ignite Application Summit will provide the first
opportunity to bring together the community involved in US Ignite?s mission to
share experiences, demonstrate successes, discuss barriers and difficulties,
further engage industry and communities, and inspire students, academics, open
source developers, and community leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant
part of the Application Summit will be the demonstration of NSF-funded
applications. The Application Summit participants will demonstrate that advanced
networking technologies such as software-defined networking, virtualized
networks, gigabit to the end-user, and GENI racks have real applications in the
US Ignite target sectors. The combination of technology demonstrations and other
summit activities will: enlarge the community that is knowledgeable about and
can apply next-gen technologies to public benefit applications; engage the non-
academic community including industry labs, federal mission agencies,
foundations, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, open source developers, and
students at-large; build a sense of community and common effort within US Ignite
constituencies as they meet in role-based groups: cities, foundations, and
testbeds, application developers, and technical coordination and tools; and
obtain participant buy-in for the next year of US Ignite efforts to ensure
resources are widely available and partnerships are coordinated to support
development of more applications for public benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
