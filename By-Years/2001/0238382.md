Layering has long been a basic architectural principal in communication
&lt;br/&gt;networks. Recently, however, there has been much interest in
exploring &lt;br/&gt;various techniques that allow for a stronger coupling
across traditional &lt;br/&gt;layer boundaries, in particular between the
physical layer and higher &lt;br/&gt;network layers in wireless networks. At the
physical layer, the fundamental &lt;br/&gt;performance trade-offs as given by
information theory are, in many cases, &lt;br/&gt;well understood. When higher
layer objectives, such as delay, enter the &lt;br/&gt;picture, there is much
less fundamental understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is addressing
several key problems in cross-layer resource &lt;br/&gt;allocation in wireless
networks. In these problems, physical layer "radio &lt;br/&gt;resources" are
dynamically allocated over time and between users in order &lt;br/&gt;to satisfy
both network layer and physical layer performance requirements. &lt;br/&gt;Ideas
from information theory and communication theory are used for
&lt;br/&gt;modeling the physical communication channels. Queueing theoretic
models are &lt;br/&gt;used for incorporating network-level quality of service
issues. The &lt;br/&gt;emphasis of this effort is to improve understanding of
the basic &lt;br/&gt;architectural trade-offs and fundamental performance
limitations in these &lt;br/&gt;settings. &lt;br/&gt;
