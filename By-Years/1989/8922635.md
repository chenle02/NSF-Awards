A two-dimensional numerical model developed to study the transformation of
nearshore surface gravity waves through the shoaling region and across the surf
zone will be compared to existing data from a two-dimensional wave array off
California and tank studies at WES in Vicksburg. Also sensitivity studies will
be performed examining changes in output to different boundary conditions.
