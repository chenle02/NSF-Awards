The workshop advances the participation of African Americans in the Civil and
Mechanical Systems research programs of the National Science Foundation. An on-
going external entity is created to assure that these programs achieve at least
parity with all other culturally defined groups in proposal submission rates,
award rates, and funding levels. The workshop serves as a pilot for other NSF
research programs targeting African Americans and as a catalyst for internal
upgrade of the productivity expectations of all NSF research program managers
relative to the cultural diversity and funding distribution of their research
grant awardee populations.
