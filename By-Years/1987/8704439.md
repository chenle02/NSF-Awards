Dr. Schmidt is one of the few researchers in the area of organelle biosynthesis
that is addressed the role of past - transcriptional processes in the
establishment of the phenotypes of chloroplasts. A complete overview on
regulation of chloroplast gene expression cannot be achieved without a thorough
understanding of these events. He has, in the last grant period, made some
significant findings. The processes involved in maturations of proteins into
chloroplasts have been characterized. The extent to which photosynthetic protein
accumulation is regulated at the posttranscriptional level by selective
chloroplasts proteases has been investigated. Additionally, analyses of
translational versus post-translational regulatory processes that mediate the
stoichiometric accumulation of RuBPcase, photosystems I and II, and the light
harvesting complexes of thylakoid membranes have been carried out. Future plans
are logical extensions of this work. Five publications have resulted from these
investigations. Dr. Coggin will join Dr. Schmidt this summer. He will focus on
isolating and characterizing mutant Chlamydomonas strains with photosynthetic
systems deficient xanthophylls. He will chemically mutagenize the cells and then
screen them by their larger chromolography. The cells would then be
characterized.
