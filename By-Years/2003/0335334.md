&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish a web-based, interactive electronic
community&lt;br/&gt;to build capacity and enrich the knowledge base of the MSP
projects and the&lt;br/&gt;Learning Community of which they are a part.
Specifically, MSPnet will 1)&lt;br/&gt;expand MSP projects access to, and
ability to share, resources, emerging&lt;br/&gt;research, tools, best practices,
obstacles and strategies; 2) strengthen&lt;br/&gt;geographically dispersed
partnerships by enhancing and sustaining dialogue&lt;br/&gt;through innovative
collaborative tools, events and structures; 3) create a&lt;br/&gt;growing
archive, for both researchers and practitioners, of the lessons
and&lt;br/&gt;accomplishments of the MSP program; 4) enhance the public's access
to, and&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of, the MSP program; 5) conduct research on the
impact of on-line&lt;br/&gt;formats, functionalities and structures to enhance
large scale education&lt;br/&gt;reform efforts.
