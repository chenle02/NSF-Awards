Professor Archdeacon will study width parameters of embedded graphs, embedding
properties of covering graphs and the lifting properties of embedded graphs. The
proposed research studies new techniques for coverings and wrapped coverings and
applies these techniques to topological graph theory. Graph Theory goes back
perhaps two hundred years, but only in the last half-century has the field
become an active, fertile, and flourishing branch of mathematics. A graph is a
network of lines ("edges") joining points ("vertices"), thus the language of
graphs becomes a natural way of describing interrelationships among separated
objects. Graph Theory figures most prominently as an essential tool in
Communications Theory and Computer Science.
