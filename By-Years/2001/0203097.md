This RUI project is a collaborative study of two issues in growth of thin films
on Group IV semi-conductor surfaces, i.e., on silicon and germanium. A team of
four researchers at Bradley Univer-sity will address growth and characterization
of ultra thin metallic films on silicon single crystal surfaces, and electron
and photon assisted deposition of SiGe alloy films on Si(100) and Ge(100)
surfaces under very low thermal budget conditions. Issues to be explored include
electrical con-ductivity in ultra-thin metallic films on silicon as well as
electromigration effects which may ac-company high current densities in such
films. Also, fundamental issues of electron and photon driven processes in
adsorbates which may serve as precursors to growth of SiGe alloy films will be
studied. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental research
issues in topical areas of materials science having technological relevance.
Undergraduate students will play a primary role in the project, with op-
portunities for research integrated directly into their academic program. The
research program will provide access to state-of-the-art surface science
equipment and unique opportunities for un-dergraduates to participate in and
develop skills in exciting areas of materials science at the na-noscale level.
An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, and the
integration of research and education. &lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;
