Natural resources are one factor of industrial production that, along with
economic, geographic and cultural factors, will shape an enterprise and
influence its chances of success. Entrepreneurs may devclop a sustainable
enterprise based on renewable or abundant resourses, or they might follow a
strategy that depletes a scarce local resource, or they might rely on materials
and energy brought in from distant sources. Each of these choices has
consequences for the local economy, environment, and society. In early years of
the republic, entrepreneurs in the upper Housatonic River basin of Connecticut
chose to rely on indigenous resources, while those in the lower reaches of the
river basin followed a distinctly different path. Using documentary and material
evidence, the project will assess the comparative advantages (of resources,
demand for products, and connections with related industries) enjoyed by
entrepreneurs in these two locations, explaining how geographic, physical and
cultural factors influenced entrepreneurs' decisions.
