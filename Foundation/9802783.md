This project will concentrate on set theory and applications of set theory in
algebra. The major topics of research will include left-distributive algebras,
elementary embeddings, stationary sets, the theory of large cardinals,
applications of forcing, the singular cardinals problem and the theory of
possible cofinalities, countably complete filters and ideals, infinitary
combinatorics, and problems in Boolean algebras.

The proposed research deals with the abstract mathematical discipline called set
theory. Set theory serves as the foundation for other mathematical disciplines
such as topology, measure theory, and functional analysis. Its study of abstract
infinite sets provides an invaluable insight into the expressive power of modern
mathematics and its limitations. In particular, modern set theory with its
emphasis on independence proofs and the theory of large cardinals enables to
establish provability or unprovability and analyze the complexity of
mathematical conjectures.
