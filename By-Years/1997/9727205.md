The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Prof. George W. Flynn of
Columbia University in his continuing studies on collision dynamics and
relaxation of molecules with `chemically significant` amounts of vibrational
energy. Prof. Flynn will prepare high energy or reactive donor molecules using
excimer-pumped dye lasers or optical parametric oscillators and then monitor the
final quantum state of the collision or reaction products using IR/VIS
absorption or UV fluorescence. Doppler-resolved IR diode laser spectroscopy will
yield information on the velocity of product molecules. Thus Prof. Flynn can
determine the vibrational, rotational and translational energy of the energy
acceptor (bath) molecules. The ultimate goal is to determine the energy transfer
distribution function P(E,E'), i.e., the probability that a molecule, initially
at an energy E, will undergo a collision induced transition to an energy E',
with change in vibrational energy of E'-E. The PI will investigate the mechanism
for excitation of quencher vibrational 'dark' states and will measure the
distribution function at low temperatures (10K) to gauge the effects of
collision velocity and complex formation in the relaxation process. The
importance of the research is that it sheds light on the mechanism by which
molecules dissociate, or break apart, and recombine. Normally, we assume that
the loss of gain of vibrational energy is controlled by very strong collisions
between molecules, but this is a gross approximation compared to the detail with
which other processes, for example, the dissociation rate as a function of
energy, are known. The distribution function that Prof. Flynn will obtain, when
coupled with good theoretical calculations, should allow a much deeper
understanding of the dissociation and recombination processes that are so
important to combustion and atmospheric chemistry.
