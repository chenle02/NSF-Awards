Seed distribution, plant demography and spatiotempporal heterogeneity ofthe
environment, by their interactions, determine the ecological and evolutionary
landscape inhabited by an organism. A simple hypothesis that quantitatively
links these three areas of evolutionary ecology in a new way is proposed. A
model of plant population dynamics and forest dynamics predicts that ant-
dispersed species will be characterized by a slower rate of demographic change
during gap-phase regeneration than bird-dispersed species. Selection for these
divergent seed dispersal syndromes (local dispersal vs. long-distance dispersal)
will be investigated in a family of understory herbs by comparing changes in
demography, light environments and disperser assemblages during gap-phase
regeneration. Preliminary data confirmed that the Costa Rican Marantaceae
provide an excellent opportunity for the study. The static distribution of
plants in forest light habitats was significantly associated with dispersal
syndrome, suggesting differences in their dynamic response to intermediate
habitats during gap-phase regeneration.
