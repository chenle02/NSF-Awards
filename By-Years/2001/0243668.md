The Tufts University Department of Biology has a long-standing commitment to
mentoring undergraduates in research, as well as a strong track record of highly
productive interdisciplinary research collaborations. Science is an increasingly
collaborative enterprise, requiring the combined expertise of researchers from
diverse fields. Students thus require training not only in specific research
skills within a discipline, but also need to learn how to build a successful
collaboration. This REU Site provides a program that allows undergraduate
students to undertake biological research as a collaborative enterprise. The
goals of this summer program are: to increase students' proficiency in
biological research and collaborative skills, to educate and inspire students
toward future research careers, and to develop students' ability to effectively
communicate scientific results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 10 week summer program
entitled, "Integrative Approaches to Studying the Ecology of New England
Organisms," will provide 10 students opportunities to work closely on one of
eight collaborative, interdisciplinary projects combining faculty expertise in
animal behavior, endocrinology, biochemistry, conservation biology, and plant
ecology. The program is committed to provide research opportunities for
undergraduates, including students traditionally underrepresented in science and
those who might not have such opportunities at their home institutions (with an
emphasis on local community college students). Students will work with two
mentors, one serving as the primary mentor, to combine research techniques from
different fields to design and conduct an independent project. In addition to
research involvement, the program includes weekly discussions, seminars, field
trips, and a student symposium. For more information, contact Colin Orians at
