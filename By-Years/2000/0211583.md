This award is to support research that will develop new and extend existing tree
ring records from the North American Arctic treeline. Since the northern limit
of treeline coincides with the southern limit of the Arctic Front, this work
will provide a spatial and temporal constraints on the Arctic Front over the
last millennium. &lt;br/&gt;Field work will be undertaken to collect samples
from northern Canada and Alaska. Analyses will include cross-dating, ring width,
and measurement of maximum latewood density. All data will be standardized to
maximize extraction of low frequency climatic variability. Finally, tree-ring
chronologies will be incorporated into dendroclimatic reconstructions of past
temperature.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposed research
are that it will lead to information about the variation and nature of the
forest tundra ecotone during a time of rapid environmental and climatic change.
