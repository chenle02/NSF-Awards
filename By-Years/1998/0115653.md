With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Connecticut College will acquire a 400 MHz NMR
Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a)
tandem intramolecular cyclization-Claisen rearrangement sequence as a facile
route to the tetracyclic 5-7-6-3 ring system of phorbol; b) synthetic strategies
toward the ingenol ring system; c) novel syntheses of biologically active
5,7-fused sesquiterpenoids; d) synthesis and characterization of firefly
luciferin analogs; e) solution structure of the C-terminal domain of firefly
luciferase; f) synthesis and characterization of doubly 15N-labeled
coelenterazine; and g) the 13C-NMR characterization of nonaqueous sol-gel
systems. The NMR will also be used in the undergraduate laboratory courses.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry.
