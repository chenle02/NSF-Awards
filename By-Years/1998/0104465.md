Dr. Coble is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Chicago.
Her research program centers on measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) which will test the standard theory of structure formation in the early
universe. Her observations will be made with the Degree Angular Scale
Interferometer (DASI), which is currently operating at the South Pole Station.
DASI will be used to measure the as yet undetected polarization of the CMB, and
following a planned upgrade will be used to observe smaller angular scales as
well as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in galaxy clusters. Dr. Coble's
educational program will be carried out at the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy
Museum, where she will teach courses on astronomy and cosmology, and establish a
communications link to the South Pole while she is conducting research.
