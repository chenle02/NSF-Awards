Dr. Mark A. Smith is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study ion-molecule reactions at temperatures approaching
absolute zero. These measurements provide valuable insight into the mechanism of
molecular synthesis in interstellar clouds where these conditions are
approached. Smith is pursuing a two pronged approach aimed at advancing the
methodology for the direct study of molecular collision dynamics in the ultralow
energy regime. One portion of this program is directed at obtaining a detailed
characterization of the rotational and parallel translational degrees of freedom
for small molecules as they exit the free jet. This data will provide critical
input for the fundamental advancement of supersonic flow theory for gaseous
mixtures. In the second portion of the program of study the results from the
flow characterization studies are used to better interpret kinetic observations
of termolecular ion association reactions in the 4 to 30 K regime.
