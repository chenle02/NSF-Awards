The use of remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) data in
research today is an essential skill for every geographer. This project,
therefore, has established a teaching facility in Remote Sensing/GIS for the
Geography Department. The equipment and facility are primarily used for teaching
undergraduate students to analyze remotely-sensed data and combine it with GIS.
It is also expected that the project will foster the development of remote
sensing and GIS programs, and facilitate undergraduate education and training in
the region.
