ABSTRACT Harold Kung A catalytic reaction system suitable for use in a
synchrotron X-ray beam is constructed. The system is to be used by the duPont-
Norhwestern-Dow collaboration access team at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at
Argonne National Laboratory. The reactor system is equipped with a gas
chromatograph and a mass spectrometer, and is serviced by a gas manifold capable
of handling up to eight gases by remote control. It is to be used for in situ
studies of catalytic reactions and structural studies of catalysts and catalyst
precursors including vanadium-phosphorus oxides, transition-metal-promoted
rhodium, copper-zinc oxide, supported palladium, microporous redox systems, and
zeolites. ***
