Meller 9623605 This Career Award project presents a research and education plan
driven by the integration of production system operations and facility layout
decisions. The objective is the development of an integrated layout model that
can be used to evaluate how changes in production system operations impact the
facility layout. Features include the ability to highlight when changes to a
layout will be economically feasible from a production operations perspective.
Impacts of the project include an improved research model for facility layout
decisions, new case-studies and educational algorithms for instructional
purposes, and engineering internships for graduate students. Project objectives
are pursued with substantial industrial interaction and support.
