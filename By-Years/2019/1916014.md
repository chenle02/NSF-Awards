Methods for statistical analysis of high dimensional data and large random
matrices have receive increased attention in recent years. This project aims to
develop new methods for these problems and extend the applicability of existing
methods. The research on new methodology for high dimensional data includes both
tools for ultra-high dimensional data, and the theoretical study of statistical
properties for methods applicable to data with high dimensionality and fixed
sample sizes. In this project, the PIs will develop new statistical methods and
extend existing methods with novel applications in many fields of statistics,
physics, and biology. The efficiency of these methodologies will be demonstrated
via simulations and applications to real data sets. In addition, the research
results will promote teaching and learning activities. The research results will
be disseminated through conference presentations and publications.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This project develops new methodologies for tests on the dependence
structure for high dimensional data and large random matrices. The PIs will
investigate a series of topics that are closely related to high dimensional
data, including tests on dependence structure for high dimensional data, tests
on high-dimensional mean vectors and high-dimensional covariance matrices, and
nonparametric tests for complete independence for high-dimensional data. In
addition, the PIs will study the spectral radii of large random matrices such as
the limiting distribution for the maximum eigenvalue from principal minors of
sample covariance matrices, the largest eigenvalues of Markov matrices, and the
limiting distribution for the largest absolute value for the products of
truncated unitary matrices. The research in this project will expand the scope
of the application of high-dimensional statistical methods and large random
matrices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
