This planning grant will lead to a proposal from the Science and Mathematics
Learning Center at Chardon State College, representing the Northwest Nebraska
Educational Consortium. The project works with teachers from every school in the
districts, system administrators and college faculty to meet the inservice needs
of the community. The thirty-four members also participate on the strategic
planning team. They also assume responsibility for doing a needs assessment in
their respective buildings. The final proposal will seek to "improve the
leadership and pedagogical skills and science and mathematics knowledge base of
all consortium teachers and empower the teachers, as professionals, to plan the
curriculum changes." Cost sharing is 166%.
