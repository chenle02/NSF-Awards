9508273 Reddien The Department of Mathematics at Southern Methodist University
will purchase equipment and software dedicated to the support of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment and software will be used to support a
broad range of research in applied mathematics. The investigators have proposed
four projects in the following areas: Steepling in Upward Directional
Solidification Capillary-Gravity Waves and Wind-Drift Currents The Numerical
Computation of Linear Electromagnetic Dispersive Waves Spatio-temporal Patterns
Generated by Motile Bacteria
