This project incorporates an ultracentrifuge into the undergraduate Biology and
Chemistry programs at Saint John's University and the College of Saint Benedict.
An ultracentrifuge with vertical and swinging buckets is being purchased to
illustrate the principles of separation by centrifugation, as well as the
isolation or purification of proteins, DNA's and RNA's. Students in a variety of
courses, including Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, and Cell Biology, as well as
students involved in individual research projects, are gaining firsthand
knowledge of the uses of the ultracentrifuge. The university will contribute an
amount equal to the award.
