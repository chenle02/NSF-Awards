9725405 Buffler The southern Red Sea-northern Danakil region of Eritrea is
located at the northern apex of the Afar depression, which represents a major
plate boundary triple junction underlain by an upwelling mantle plume. Here
three active continental rifts converge and three major plates are separating
with the formation of oceanic crust. Recent circumstances have allowed research
efforts in this active area to address several tectonic rift processes, tectonic
inversion, and controls on rift sedimentation and hominid paleontology. Results
are expected to provide tectonic and geologic framework data in support of
hominid studies as well as providing insight into near-triple point rift
processes.
