This project is designed to give undergraduate students an opportunity to use
new instrumentation for laboratory experimentation and research projects in cell
culturing, hybridoma technology, protein isolation and characterization, and
antigen-antibody analysis. The major instruments purchased are laminar flow
hoods, an inverted microscope, a CO2 incubator, a liquid nitrogen storage tank,
a centrifuge, an ELISA reader and software, and gel electrophoresis equipment.
These are to be used primarily in a new cell biology course but also in existing
courses in invertebrate zoology, embryology, immunology, genetics and a non-
majors biology course. Independent study students can also utilize it. The
college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
