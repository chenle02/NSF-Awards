Marion Technical College will use this grant to connect its campus to the
Internet using OARnet, an Ohio based ISP. Marion Technical College is a two-year
college offering 30 technical degree and certificate programs. The college has
over 1600 students and 100 faculty and staff. The college needs the Internet
connection to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the
nation and the world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of
this institution as well as the community in general. The award provides partial
support of the project for two years.
