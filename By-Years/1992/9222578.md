This project encompasses a number of important topics relating to the dynamics
and predictability of the atmosphere. Dr. Robinson will employ a suite of
models, ranging from simple to complex general circulation models, to examine
the following: (1) what determines the temporal and spatial scales of the low
frequency variability in atmospheric models and in the atmosphere, (2) the
relative contributions of the tropics and midlatitudes to low frequency
variability, (3) the extent of dependence of atmospheric predictability on the
initial large-scale flow pattern, (4) the relationship between US summer climate
(and rainfall) to the interannual variability of sea surface temperatures,
particularly in the tropics. This research builds on his prior studies in which
he demonstrated the strong coupling between synoptic scale eddies and low
frequency variability of the atmosphere, namely that the synoptic eddies serve
as the principal energy sources for low frequency phenomena. This has important
implications for the predictability of atmospheric flows.
