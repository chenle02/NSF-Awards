The University of Kansas has been awarded a grant to convene a workshop on
ecological niche modeling for early hominid groups. The workshop will bring
together a wide array of experts in early hominid evolution, paleoclimatology,
niche modeling and informatics. The popular GARP algorithm that has been widely
used to model and then map the potential habitat of various organisms, will be
the primary tool used. It will be modified for use with paleoclimates. The
workshop will be primarily aimed at developing a proof-of-concept and
preliminary data to serve as the basis for a large and integrated collaboratory
research project.
