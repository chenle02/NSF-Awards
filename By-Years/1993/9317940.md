9317940 Malone The primary objective of the workshop will be to identify
scientific and science-related issues important to the interaction between
global change and the future development of the society and economy to bring to
the attention of a meeting of donors to and sponsors of global change research,
e.g., national funding agencies, international organizations, private
foundations, etc., in November 1993 in Bellagio, Italy. Workshop participants
will include the widest possible representation from relevant natural and social
science disciplines. The workshop will review recent developments in the
scientific understanding of global change and consider how these and further
improvements in such understanding are likely to interact with and impact the
future development of the society and economy, especially the sustainable
development of both developed and developing countries.
