This project is concerned with a variety of problems involving the action of
groups on graphs related to the so-called amalgam method. The amalgam method
refers to the family of results and techniques which have been developed to
examine the structure of vertex stabilizers, inspired originally by
Goldschmidt's theorem on trivalent graphs. The principal investigator intends to
extend these methods, to apply them to the classification of sporadic simple
groups, to examine the connections between amalgam-type geometric situations and
group presentations and, in general, to investigate the extent to which the
structure of vertex stabilizers determines the global structure of a graph. This
research will focus on the area of mathematics which bridges graph theory and
group theory. This blending of combinatorics and algebra has been a very
fruitful endeavor enhancing both subjects.
