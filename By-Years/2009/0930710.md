This Small Business Technology Transfer Research Phase I project is directed
toward the development of a high-efficiency and high-power AlGaN-based
semiconductor light emitting diode (LED), operating at 300nm or shorter, for a
wide range of applications including air and water purification, polymer curing,
fluorescent spectroscopy, secure optical communications and biological and
chemical hazard monitoring. These devices will be developed using molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE) for low-cost and high-yield production on large-diameter
substrates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aluminum Gallium Nitride UltraViolet optical
sources offer the possibility of compact, light-weight, low-cost, low-power-
consumption optoelectronic systems that would enable a new generation of systems
for applications that include biodetection, non-line-of-sight covert
communications, sterilization, and air and water purification. If a low-cost and
long-life LEDs with UV light emission below 280 nm is developed the application
to water purification alone could represent a very large
market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;
