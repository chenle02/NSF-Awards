long term goal of this research is to understand the nature of the developmental
genetic differences that make all individuals of a species unique, and
distinguish the various species from one another. Towards this end, differences
between two types of fishes that are closely related, but genetically distinct,
will be studied. The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, has some populations
that live in rivers and others that live in caves. Cave forms differ from their
surface relatives by having greatly reduced eyes and pigmentation. The caves in
which they live provide little food and they have adapted to this by developing
a slower metabolism. Other senses are overdeveloped to compensate for the lack
of vision: e.g., smell, taste and the ability to detect vibration and current.
Not only can they survive eternal darkness, they thrive in
caves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The genome of this species will be mapped at a fine
scale using microsatellite DNA markers, in hybrids between the cave and surface
forms. The map and further analysis of the hybrids will permit the detection and
characterization of genes (QTL) that are responsible for the differences between
cave and surface forms. The results will give estimates of the "genetic
architecture" of trait differences: the number of genes involved and magnitudes
of their individual effects, and their positions in the genome relative to one
another. Positional information of some of the major effect QTL will be used to
identify and clone the genes; this will facilitate their functional analysis.
The results will shed light on the genetic pathways involved in development and
maintenance of complex traits, like the vertebrate eye and other aspects of the
sensory system, control of pigmentation, behavior and metabolism. The results
will also inform on the nature of genetic differences distinguishing populations
and species, and on the constraints on evolutionary change resulting from trait
correlations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
