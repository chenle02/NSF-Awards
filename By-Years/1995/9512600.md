The Kansas Ecolgical Reserves (KER) includes a wide variety of managed natural
and experimental areas in the tallgrass prairie-eastern deciduous forest
ecotone. Recently ecological research at KER has grown to include a diverse
assemblage of individual and collaborative research efforts with a trend toward
developing long-term projects and experimentally manipulated ecosystems, both
terrestrial and aquatic. Development was assisted by funds from institutional,
private, and federal sources. This project will enhance research facilities in
three ways: (1) to install a surveyed field grid for georeferencing study sites
and field research facilities throughout KER, (2) to expand the database
management system and GIS by adding key equipment, such as a UNIX workstation,
software, etc., and by establishing a set of core map coverages, and (3)
construction of a lath house that will be used for plant population and aquatic
studies. The enhancement will supportvongoing research programs, make the field
station more attractive for outside investigators, and foster research aimed at
larger spatial and temporal scales.
