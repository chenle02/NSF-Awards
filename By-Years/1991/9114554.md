This research develops improved statistical methods for both planning and
analyzing robust design experiments. A new experiment format, the combine array
format, will be developed to reduce the experiment size and allow greater
flexibility for estimating effects which may be more important for physical
reasons. Design strategies, alternative graphical tools and tables, and computer
algorithms will also be developed to help engineers plan more efficient
experiments themselves. For analyzing experiments, the response model approach
will be developed to yield additional information about how control parameter
settings dampen the effects of individual noise parameters. Alternative
variability measures for Taguchi's signal-to-noise ratios and methods for
empirically determining the appropriate measure to use will also be developed.
The impact of this research is expected to be significant in terms of expanding
the science base of techniques for improving product quality, manufacturability
and reliability at low cost.
