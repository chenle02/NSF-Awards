This project titled "The Solvent Cage Effect in Organometallic Chemistry" will
be carried out by Thomas W. Koenig and David R. Tyler of the University of
Oregon and is funded within the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program. The research will examine the fate of organometallic radicals
in a solvent cage. The results of this study are expected to lead to enhanced
knowledge of the reactivity of organometallic radicals and thus a greater
understanding of the mechanism by which many organometallic reactions occur.
Studies will be carried out on cage radical pairs that are formed both
reversibly and irreversibly from selected precursor molecules. The reversibly
formed cage pairs will be generated by thermolysis of metal-metal or metal-
carbon bonds, such as in octacarbonylbis(triphenylphosphine)dimanganese(0). The
irreversibly formed cage pairs will be generated by photolysis of dimetallic
complexes which eliminate an intervening atom or molecule, such as
bis(tetracarbonylcobalt)mercury in which the mercury atom is eliminated as the
small spacer molecule between the cobalt groups. Specific goals in addition to
the increased understanding of radical reactivity are: determining substantially
improved values of bond dissociation energies for organometallic complexes;
determining the cage efficiency, i.e., cage combination compared to cage escape
of radicals; and assessing the effects of steric size and mass of the radical as
well as the viscosity of the solvent on the cage efficiency.
