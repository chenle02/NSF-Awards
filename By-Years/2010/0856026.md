In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter
represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The
rest, whose effect we can only see gravitationally, appears to be dark. Particle
physics models suggest that dark matter is composed of relic weakly interacting
massive particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang. Efforts to directly
detect WIMPs are hampered by small interaction probabilities and large
backgrounds that mimic expected dark matter signals. Fortunately, a number of
unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against
backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions. The largest and most
robust of these signatures, based on the predicted behavior of the WIMP flux as
the Sun-Earth system moves through the galaxy, is a day-night modulation of
nuclear recoil directions in the lab frame. The intellectual merit of this
proposal resides in the Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT)
Experiment's unique and powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of
the most important questions in science today.

This award provides funds to support this group and to provide the funds for
fiducializing DRIFT and retrofitting the present DRIFT detector in the Boulby
(U.K.) Mine with such a system.

Broader impacts of this work include the training of students (including under-
represented minorities) in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving
them exposure to a wide range of hardware and software experience. The UNM DRIFT
group has demonstrated this capability with previous NSF funding. The DRIFT
detector technology has promising applications to axion searches, Homeland
Security and double-beta decay experiments.
