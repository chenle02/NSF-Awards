At the Asilomar Workshop on Rock Magnetism (September 16-19, 1986) it was
unanimously agreed that the next generation of paleomagnetic problems which
impact on geomagnetic field generation and reversal, tectonics of continental
margins and Precambrian continental drift require a major increase in our
knowledge of the effects of time and temperature on the magnetization of pure
magnetite and titanomagnetite. A materials synthesis technique, the glass-
ceramic method, which produces well dispersed single crystals ranging in size
from 50 nm to 100 um in a non-magnetic matrix material has been developed. These
samples (and other newly synthesized ones) will be used to study the effects of
applied field, temperature and internal stress on the acquisition and stability
of thermo-viscous magnetization. The experiments will reveal whether domain
wall/stress interaction through "disacommodation" or "aftereffect" phenomenon is
important for multidomain samples whose thermomagnetic properties we have shown
to be not explicable with existing theories. The results will also be relevant
to best and possibly improve thermal paleointensity methods, presently a matter
of considerable controversy.
