9224282 DeSouza This proposal requests funds for one desktop, multi-processor
workstation (SUN SPARCstation 10) and six small desktop workstation/terminals
(SUN SPARCstation IPC) for use in several locations. At present, student use of
UNIX-based workstations/terminals is limited to the previously mentioned SUN and
three 1988-vintage Textronix workstations. Additional capabilities must be
secured so that the students and faculty can effectively make use of the current
state-of-the-art software available to the meteorological community. This
project will allow Millersville University to fully utilize forthcoming
technology for the foreseeable future. ***
