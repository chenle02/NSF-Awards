A sequence of platform carbonates and phosphorites in southwest China, near
Kunming, contains the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary and is well studied in terms
of lithologies and faunal content. It has been proposed as a global stratotype
for the boundary. We have obtained preliminary magnetostratigraphic data which
show eight reversals and yield a paleopole which is unlike any paleopoles thus
far observed for the South China block for any Phanerozoic rocks. This proposal
requests funds to collect an additional 1600 paleomagnetic samples over several
parallel sections, in order to test the preliminary magnetostratigraphic
polarity determinations. The promising preliminary data suggest that this
section could provide a standard for the magnetostratigraphy of the Precambrian-
Cambrian boundary, with which other sections could be compared (e.g., in
Siberia, Australia, Mongolia, North America, Europe or Morocco). Given that the
boundary is associated with the first appearance of diverse shelly fossil
assemblages, it is a feature of primary importance in stratigraphy and earth
history. A reliable reversal record for the Chinese boundary section would be of
great value in internal correlation.
