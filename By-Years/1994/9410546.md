In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Prof. L. Peteanu of the Carnegie-Mellon University will explore the
possibilities of a combined Stark-Raman effect to investigate vibrational mode
couplings in the neighborhood of the curve crossings of excited electronic
states. The Stark-Raman technique would provide an ability to determine the
effect of an (external) electric perturbing field on the vibrational
displacements in the excited states of photochemically active molecules.
Previous attempts to observe the influence of an externally impressed field on
the Raman spectrum of a molecule were unsuccessful and this field has lain
dormant for more than 40 years. The present research is to explore this
essentially unknown field. With the superior theoretical and experimental
techniques that are now available, there are valid expectations that a new area
of molecular spectroscopy will be developed. If sucessful, the Stark-Raman
technique will be useful in situations where the usual techniques of infrared
absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy are inadequate.
