DEB-0108150 Coley&lt;br/&gt;Plants and herbivores comprise the majority of the
earth's biodiversity, and nowhere are their interactions as intense as in
tropical forests. The evolutionary interactions between herbivores and plants
has led to an "arms race" in which innovations in plant defenses are met by
counter adaptations on the part of herbivores. For example, plants have a
battery of physical, chemical and phenological defenses which help to protect
their leaves against herbivores and pathogens. And herbivores have a staggering
array of mechanisms for avoiding, detoxifying and even using plant defenses for
their own benefit. Despite the wide acceptance that many traits of plants and
herbivores result from an "arms race", we know very little about the underlying
evolutionary mechanisms or ecological conditions that would lead to the
evolution of novel defenses. To address this, we will study the defenses of
rainforest trees in the family Leguminosae, quantifying various defenses,
including alkaloids, measuring rates of leaf-feeding by herbivores and
characterizing growth and defensive traits of herbivores. The work will be
conducted at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama and at the
University of Utah. This basic research is necessary for understanding how
natural selection favors the evolution of novel defenses as well as why suites
of defenses tend to co-occur in different species of plants, as well as how
plant defenses may constrain the behaviors, growth and defenses of the
herbivores that feed on them. In addition, the research has applications for
forest management, and for the development of medicinal drugs and agricultural
crops using genes and defensive compounds from wild
plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
