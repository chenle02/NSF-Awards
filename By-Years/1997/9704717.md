SuperDARN is an international HF radar network designed to measure global-scale
magnetospheric convection by observing plasma motion in the Earth's upper
atmosphere. Plasma convection is controlled by a series of interactions between
the solar wind, and Earth's magnetosphere, and the high-latitude (Arctic and
Antarctic) ionosphere. By measuring the global-scale plasma motions and studying
their temporal evolution, we obtain a better understanding of the processes that
couple the solar wind's energy and momentum to the upper atmosphere, and thereby
obtain a better understanding of space weather processes at polar latitudes.
Currently, there is no SuperDARN coverage of the region extending from central
Canada westward through Alaska. It is proposed to install a SuperDARN radar at a
site near Soldotna, Alaska. Since the radar measurements will extend 3000 km
poleward from the radar location, data from this radar will complement data from
all other geophysical monitoring instruments located in Alaska and will extend
beyond Alaska's Arctic slope into the region over the Arctic Ocean where no
other ground-based sensors are available. The field of view of the Soldotna
radar will include the Poker Flat Rocket Range, and the new HAARP and HIPAS
ionospheric modification facilities. The SuperDARN network has been developed by
scientists in Canada, Finland, France, Great Britain, Japan, South Africa,
Sweden, and the United States. The network has components in the northern and
southern hemispheres. The northern hemisphere component consists of six radars
with coverage extending from Finland westward to central Canada. Measurements
are made continuously over nearly 12 hours of local time from 65o-85o magnetic
latitude. It is truly a global-scale measurement system for studying physical
processes occurring in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere in arctic and
antarctic regions.
