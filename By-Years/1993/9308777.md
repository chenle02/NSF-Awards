This project is to do the research and development necessary to prepare trial
instructional materials on microscopy and microscopes, how they work and how
they used to answer questions in different fields of science K-12 schools. The
intent of this proposal is to develop a preliminary teaching guide and kit (a
test module)which provides an integrated constructivists approach to science
learning by using the microscope to discover knowledge in life, earth and
physical sciences. The materials will be developed in collaboration with the
Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley, California. A unique opportunity is
available to test the materials with the Excellence in Teaching Elementary
Science (EXCITES) Program within is an NSF funded project to be held at the
University of California at Davis during the summer of 1993. The project
includes a follow-up fall workshop for revisions and additional development,
with continued participation and testing by the EXCITES teachers in the summers
of 1994 and 1995. This phase of the project will culminate with a curriculum
guide which has been tested for three years and ready for national distribution.
