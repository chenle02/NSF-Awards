The Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University will purchase
optical and electronic test and measurement equipment which will be dedicated to
support research in engineering. This equipment will be used for several
research projects, including, in particular, coherent wavelength- division
multiplexed (WDM) networks, optical interconnects, and local- area networks. A
four terminal WDM network utilizing 3Gb/s per station phase-shift-keying for a
total throughput of 12 Gb/s will be contracted. The system will be used to
investigate the advantages and limitations of key technologies important to the
development of WDM interconnects and local area networks. Three areas will be
investigated: (1) the advantages and limitations of the phase-shift-keyed
modulation; (2) the impact of various modulation and coding techniques of
performance degradations due to fiber nonlinearities; (3) the advantages and
limitations of polarization maintaining fiber in WDM interconnects; and (4)
network level protocols for high speed interconnects.
