School-aged children live important parts of their lives outside the home.
Parents play a critical role in structuring and monitoring their children's
activities outside the home, yet there has been little examination of this role.
This research planning project will to develop a plan to examine parents'
actions in choosing, supervising and intervening in children's organized leisure
activities outside of the home in order to increase our understanding of the
socialization process and broaden our view of family life. The goals of the
planning period for this project are the selection of research sites, pre-
testing of interviews and observations of families and of adults involved in
children's activities, the development of strategies for videotaping families in
their homes, and preparation for the fixed-response survey questionnaire. This
research planning project sets the stage for research that will provide valuable
information about the way in which parents bring their social resources to bear
in assisting their children's performance. This project also provides an
excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to carefully lay the
groundwork for her future line of research.
