The research objective of this award is to model the contributions to airliner
safety of processes used by aircraft builders, the airline industry and their
regulators and to explore their impact on airliner structural design. This will
allow an aircraft designer to present to a customer the choice between designing
more safety into the airplane versus achieving the same level of safety though
maintenance and training procedures. Inspired by a crash of an American Airlines
airplane due to extreme rudder commands, the research will also explore a new
approach for reducing unexpected failures by simulations of extreme behavior by
a pilot. The research thus addresses a critical lack in the current design
framework of complex systems by systematically uncovering processes of
unexpected and un-modeled failure scenarios and by including operators? extreme
behavior into the design and safety assessment.

If successful, the research will provide insight for aircraft builders,
airlines, Congress and the President on strategies to improve safety at less
cost, resulting in more efficient resource allocation at the national level.
This can help decisions on directing resources to safety research, tax
incentives to aircraft builders, maintenance and pilot training and regulations
and accident investigations. Although the proposed research focuses on aircraft
structures, the same frameworks can be applicable to any complex engineering
system whose safety depends on a sequence of processes throughout its life
cycle. This includes infrastructural systems, whose reliability is directly
related to public safety. A Ph.D. student from an international joint Ph.D.
degree program will enhance international collaboration, and an undergraduate
student will be recruited for research from underrepresented groups. Two
graduate and undergraduate courses will closely be integrated with this
research. The research results will be widely distributed for maximum impact in
a variety of conference and journal venues.
