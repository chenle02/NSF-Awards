This investigation will focus on the nonlinear constitutive relations needed for
flexible composites undergoing large deformations. The theoretical phase will
examine biaxial behavior of a fabric reinforced flexible composite while the
experimental part will involve characterization of the component materials,
fabrication and testing of such composites.
