With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program and
support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor
Jennifer Swift and collaborators from Georgetown University will acquire a Raman
spectroscope/microscope. Raman spectroscopy is an analytical technique that
provides data on the chemical structure and physical properties of a material.
It elucidates what atoms are bonded to each other and the strength of those
interactions. When combined with a microscope, the instrument can probe very
small areas of the material providing insight on how the properties of the
material will vary as one scans across it. The acquisition will provide training
to undergraduate and graduate students in the use of this analytical tool. It
will be used by students in the chemistry and physics undergraduate research
programs (REU) at Georgetown and by high school students in a summer research
program sponsored by the American Chemical Society (Project ACS-SEED) which
supports students from economically disadvantaged groups.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at
all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesizing and characterizing
molecular crystals such as polymorphs; (b) studying hydrates and co-crystals;
(c) analyzing single and multi-component nanoparticles of molecular and
polymeric species; (d) using metal nanoparticles for fuel-cell development; (e)
employing gels and viscous dispersants for cultural heritage conservation; (f)
using organometallic framework materials for gas separation and storage; and (g)
using conducting polymer electrodes for biomedical and environmental
applications.
