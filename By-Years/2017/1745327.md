Following the collapse of a bridge span on a critical section of I-85 in Atlanta
on March 30, 2017, drivers significantly changed their travel behavior. One
component of this change in travel behavior was a 50-70 percent increase in
transit ridership at certain stations on Atlanta's MARTA transit system.
Previous studies of severe network disruptions in Minneapolis, California, and
Japan have predominantly indicated that major travel behavior change is
fleeting. However, the experience in Atlanta may prove significantly different,
as MARTA's rail transit system provides a direct parallel route for many
commuters. This Grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will assess
the extent to which riders sustain this change in mode choice, and will discern
their underlying preferences and attitudes regarding travel. This work will
contribute to society's ability to create a more sustainable transportation
system by expanding knowledge of transportation choices concerning alternative
modes. The research team includes multiple undergraduates and grad students from
diverse backgrounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will measure and model
the rebound effect (i.e., the extent to which individuals and households revert
to their pre-disruption activity-travel pattern after the restoration of the
critical infrastructure) and the hysteresis effect (i.e., the extent to which
some changes are permanent even after a substantial period of time has elapsed
since the restoration of service). The study design includes work to identify
perceptions regarding transit service across patrons who were willing to try the
service in more extreme conditions, but who do not remain patrons in the longer
term, including attitudes about shared spaces and other lifestyle choices to
fill an important gap in mode choice modeling.
