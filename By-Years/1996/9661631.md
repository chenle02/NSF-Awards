*** 9661631 Heimberger Software development and maintenance are a consequential
part of current business activity in many sectors of the economy activity.
Unfortunately, the current state of statistical practice in software engineering
is immature because researchers and practitioners have a limited knowledge of
statistics. Compounding this problem is that the applicability of methods is not
always systematically demonstrated and that methods are not usually presented in
a context that is familiar to engineers and managers. This Small Business
Innovation Research Phase I project to be carried out by Software Productivity
Solutions addresses these problems by developing an innovative quantitative
methodology and supporting tool for Decision Support for Managing Performance
Risk (DSMPR) in software projects. DSMPR will demonstrate the value of applying
statistical and decision analysis techniques to a well-defined software
management problem and provide a methodology that describes how they should be
applied in the software management process. DSMPR will accomplish its tasks by
integrating selected techniques from Forecasting and Multi-Attribute Utility
Theory into a methodology and tool for software project management. The result
will be a significant improvement in the quality of insight provided to software
managers for decisionmaking. DSMPR has a strong commercial potential for
satisfying the needs of a broad and largely untapped market. DSMPR will help
software project managers to assess the significance of differences between
plans and actual performance; quantify the performance risk represented by the
deviations; and assist in making tradeoffs in planning corrective actions. By
providing such project management and decision-support capabilities, DSMPR will
have a broad applicability to both commercial and Government industry sectors
where large software projects are common. These sectors include
telecommunications, transportation, and distribution. *** .
