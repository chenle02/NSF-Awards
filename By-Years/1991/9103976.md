This project will develop a unified approach to existence, uniqueness and
stability of solutions to equations arising in magnetohydrodynamics and the
dynamics of incompressible fluids. The main problems involve nonlinear
eigenvalue problems formulated from basic physical principles. Analytic and
numerical studies will be undertaken to solve such problems. This project
attempts to explain fundamental questions concerning fluids of interest to
geophysics, oceanography, and nuclear fusion.
