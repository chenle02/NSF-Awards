Plants have evolved an array of traits that protect them against damaging
insects, and different plant species vary dramatically in their level of
chemical defenses. Despite substantial progress in understanding the biology of
plant chemistry, a basic understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that cause
plants to vary in defense is lacking. Recent results suggest that differences in
the reproductive strategies used by plants might play an important role.
Specifically, reproductive systems that result in the loss of genetic diversity
may also result in lowered defense. The goal of this project is to better
understand whether different plant reproductive strategies influence the ability
of plants to maintain defenses against insects, and to elucidate the genes that
cause such evolutionary change.

Interactions between plants and insects are of critical importance to natural
and managed ecosystems as insects consume a large proportion of the biomass
produced annually by plants. Such damage costs billions of dollars in lost
revenue to farmers and foresters each year. It is therefore important to
understand how plant species defend themselves and why they frequently vary in
the types and levels of defenses they employ against insects. This project will
help to elucidate the evolutionary and genetic causes of variation in plant
defense observed among plant species, and ultimately provide a better
understanding of the biological interactions within natural and managed
ecosystems.
