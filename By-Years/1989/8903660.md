An earlier paper from this research on outer-rise earthquakes (events occurring
within the downgoing oceanic plate near the bathymetric trench axis) suggested a
possibility of monitoring stress level on subduction boundaries. The results
have stimulated the interest of many seismologists. This research will continue
the work by extending the analysis of earthquake focal mechanisms to smaller
events and relating them to the spatial and temporal variations of earthquake
occurrence. Because monitoring stress level along subduction boundaries relates
is a measure of the probability of earthquake occurrence in that region, the
research has direct application to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
