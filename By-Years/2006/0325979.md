The goal of the proposed research is to develop a framework for forward error
control (FEC) in combination with bandwidth management and routing in optical
networks that is aware of optical channel characteristics and can allocate
network resources to optimize system performance. The FEC schemes are based on
low-density parity-check codes and iterative joint detection/decoding techniques
that mitigate (linear and nonlinear) distortion and crosstalk. The adaptive
error protection FEC techniques will be developed that are tailored for the
time-varying characteristics of requirements of optical networks.
&lt;br/&gt;Network management protocols supporting novel FEC schemes will be
developed and tested to demonstrate their efficiency and benefit in next
generation optical networks. Novel network path selection algorithms will be
developed for primary and backup paths in heterogeneous environments that
satisfy constraints imposed by both variable network requests and the physical
layer. The project will also give the extent to which the combined coding and
network management techniques can be used to relax constraints on optical
communications materials and devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
