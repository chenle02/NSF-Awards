This planning grant is to develop a computerized activity based costing model
which could be utilized by any medical care facility to determine the true cost
of providing services. The developed software will enable the users to consider
tangible and intangible costs and benefits associated with providing services
offered by the medical care facility. Once the relevant literature has been
evaluated and analyzed, a methodology for identifying all the activities
performed in medical care facilities, and a means of tracing costs to these
activities will be established. Then a list of various cost drivers will be
generated to trace the cost of the activities to the cost objects.
