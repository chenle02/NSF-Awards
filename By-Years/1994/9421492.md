This award made in the Organic Dynamics Program will support the research of
Paul Engel at Rice University. The research will focus broadly on the free
radical chemistry of azo and azoxy compounds. Specific areas of research that
will be addressed are :(1) determination of the stabilization energy of alpha-
azo and azoxy radicals, (2) utility of azoperesters as mixed bifunctional free
radical polymerization initiators, (3) rearrangement rates of the
dimethylcyclopropylcarbinyl radical as applied to radical clocks,(4) free
radical reactions of the azoxy group, (5) thermolysis rates of acyclic
azoalkanes, and (6) generation of preoxetane biradicals from azoalkanes.
Photochemical and thermal approaches will be employed to generate the free
radicals under investigation. This research will advance the fundamental
understanding of the generation and stabilization of free radicals derived from
azo and azoxy compounds as well as explore their use in synthetic
transformations and as initiators for high speed polymerizations.
