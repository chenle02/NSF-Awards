This proposal is for the development of a process to automatically classify the
developmental stage of somatic embryos as an integral part of an ongoing
bioreactor plant propagation technology being developed at DNA Plant Technology.
The bioreactor technology involves the scale up o somatic embryogenesis for the
reproduction of select plants on a commercial scale. An image analysis system
coupled to discriminant analysis softeware has been demonstrated as an
appropriate technology for the rapid screening of somatic embryos, but the
process requires further development to improve the accuracy of the
identification parameters. The successful improvement of this method will have
several benefits. Image analysis can be used as a tool for the objective and
rapid classification of large numbers of somatic embryos produced under
different conditions. This data will allow the incremental improvement of the
bioreactor operating parameters to increase the efficiency of the bioreactor
embryo development process. The image analysis will also provide the basis for
the subsequent development of cell or embryo sorting techniques that would
further improve the efficiency of plant development from somatic embryos.
