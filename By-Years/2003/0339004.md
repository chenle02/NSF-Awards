This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will draw on the
research team's experience with electronic Braille Displays to extend their
benefits to Tactile Graphic Displays seeking to considerably increase their
portability and decrease their cost. C.A.Technology has performed extensive
experiments on Shape Memory actuators and intends to test the feasibility of low
profile Tactile Arrays based on this technology. In the first part of the
research program, the feasibility of a single dot tactile module as described in
our US Patent Application will be tested. In the second part, the feasibility of
an Array comprising a plurality of single dot modules plugged into a base
motherboard will be tested.

These Tactile Arrays could be easily implemented into a wide range of electronic
data acquisition and processing devices, particularly portable devices: notebook
or pocket computers, digital cameras, cell phones. By removing the cost and size
factors which have limited the market penetration of current electronic Tactile
Displays, this new technology will be accessible to many more blind and deaf-
blind individuals and significantly improve their employment opportunities.
