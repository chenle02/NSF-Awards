Dr. Kargon is undertaking a pilot project to put the papers, letters, film and
audio archives of J. Robert Oppenheimer on two CD-ROM disks to be made available
at low cost to libraries and individual scholars around the world. Under this
grant, they are: (1) transferring the Oppenheimer papers, along with audio and
visual material, to two CD-ROM disks, accessible upon a wide range of computer
platforms; (2) including on the disks a complete Oppenheimer bibliography and
selected secondary works (subject to copyright arrangements); (3) identifying
the necessary software to enable researchers to scan, search and view the
materials; and (4) assessing the feasibility and costs of the new process in a
full report of the pilot project, so that the techniques they develop can be
widely disseminated for future development.
