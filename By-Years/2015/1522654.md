This project focuses on developing efficient innovative acceleration techniques
and their underlying theories for the algorithms in nonlinear optimization. The
acceleration techniques and algorithms developed in this project will have broad
impact in many areas of computational science, including imaging/signal
processing, optimal control, computer vision, petroleum engineering, topology
optimization, and electronic structure computations. The algorithms developed in
this research will be made publicly available on the web and will be applied in
solving various computational problems. In addition, the student involved in
this project will have excellent opportunities to participate in
interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will include
developing subspace techniques for nonlinear conjugate gradient method and
accelerated nonlinear conjugate gradient methods with theoretically guaranteed
optimal global complexity. A framework of inexact alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM) will also be developed, in which multiple steps are
allowed to solve the subproblem to an adaptive accuracy, while still maintaining
global convergence even when the problem has more than two blocks. The project
will also study acceleration strategies for gradient based stochastic
optimization. In particular, adaptive strategies for choosing sample points and
extracting quasi-Newton information based on the obtained stochastic information
will be explored. In addition, a novel dual active set approach will be
developed for solving smooth large-scale nonlinear optimization. For example, in
projection on polyhedra, an algorithm can be developed to approximately identify
the active linear constraints, while an asymptotically faster algorithm can be
used to compute a high accuracy solution.
