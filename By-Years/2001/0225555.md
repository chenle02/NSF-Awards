This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to enable additional observations
and analysis during the NASA-sponsored "Matador" project of the University of
Arizona. Planned for May-July at a site in the Arizona desert, the purpose of
Matador is to document the characteristics of dust devils, as measured by remote
and in-situ sensors. Vortex circulations in the atmospheric boundary layer, of
which dust devils are a visible example, carry heat and particulate matter
(aerosols) from the earth's surface into the atmosphere, though the physics of
these circulations and the contribution they make to the overall vertical
transport of heat and mass are not understood. This grant enables the deployment
of additional instruments for flux measurements and provides for data analysis
by Dr. Renno, students, and collaborators. Outcomes of the research will be
quantitative estimates of the heat and mass transport by vortices in the
boundary layer and the data needed to test theoretical models of dust devils.
This supplement to the Matador project is a sufficient incentive to entrain the
collaboration of boundary-layer researchers from academic and research
institutions in Mexico and The Netherlands.
