The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Professor Simon's time-
resolved investigations of solute relaxation, charge transfer, and electron
solvation in liquid media. These studies give important insight into detailed
dynamical processes in the liquid state. Using a variety of steady state and
ultrafast time-resolved techniques, he is examining how solvent dielectric
friction influences molecular rotational motions and the localization and
solvation of photogenerated electrons. The role of dynamic solvation and
vibrational relaxation in charge transfer is also being studied. A new approach
based on time-resolved measurement of circular dichroism is being applied to the
study of solute relaxation both in polar and nonpolar fluids. The effects of
solvent friction on intramolecular rotations around bonds, on molecular
inversion, and on structural relaxation on ground state potential surfaces are
being examined.
