Proteus mirabilis exhibits two biological phenomena that merit detailed genetic
analysis: (1) Swarm colony development, involving regular cycles of bacterial
growth, cellular differentiation and migration of multicellular groups; and (2)
the Dienes reaction, whereby two swarms from different strains produce specific
boundary structures when they encounter each other on a common substrate. These
two aspects of Proteus biology raise fundamental questions about how
multicellular biological patterns are generated and how self/non-self
recognition occurs. The proposed research entails the use of in vivo methods for
insertional mutagenesis and molecular cloning to identify segments of the
genomes of different P.mirabilis strains which encode components of the systems
that control morphogenesis and strain identity. The research will test specific
hypotheses about the role of diffusible substances in guiding swarm colony
development and about the role of prophage sequences in interstrain boundary
formation. The data will provide a foundation for a molecular comparison of the
many (possible over a billion) distinct strains which comprise the species P.
mirabilis, and these results will serve as a basis for understanding
multicellular controls and how they operate as bacteria function in natural
environments.
