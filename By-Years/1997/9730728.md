9730728 Barstow This is an integrated high school curriculum called
"Astrobiology - The Search for Life On Other Worlds" that is developed by TERC,
Inc. in collaboration with NASA. The course explores such topics as how planets
form, what physical and biochemical conditions are required for the origin of
life, how the evolutionary tree for terrestrial organisms is constructed , what
evidence exists for the possibility of life on Mars and Europa, and how space
missions gather additional evidence and search for extraterrestrial
intelligence. The course covers basic concepts traditionally taught in biology,
chemistry, geology and physics courses and thus is an integrated science course
for high school students. The curricular materials are delivered in a printed
Teacher's Guide, a printed Student Research Manual, a CD-ROM with images and
data, and a website.
