This proposal requests funding to help defray the expenses of participants in
the Annual Spring Institute in Noncommutative Geometry and Operator Algebras
(NCGOA) to be held at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee from May 5
to 11, 2017. Additional information about the institute can be found on the

The connections between operator algebras and logic have dramatically reemerged
in the last 15 years. Advances in descriptive set theory have led to solutions
to long standing problems in operator algebras and these have in turn spurred
growth in descriptive set theory. Also, the emergence of continuous model theory
in operator algebras has extraordinary potential to answer difficult problems in
this area. The aim of this school and conference is to bring together world-
class researchers and young workers from these areas to learn concepts and
techniques from each other and to focus on recent developments.
