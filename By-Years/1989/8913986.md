The primary objective of this US-Polish Joint Fund project between Dr. Maciej
Grabski of Warsaw University of Technology and Dr. Rishi Raj of Cornell
University is to study the effect of metallurgical variables on distribution of
grain boundary (GBs) structure and properties in polycrystal and its influence
on mechanical behavior of materials. The structure dependent ability of grain
boundaries to sustain or to relax stress concentrations is responsible for many
phenomena of engineering importance. The proposed research may therefore create
a new possibility for grain boundary design for improved mechanical performance
of polycrystals, especially in the range of intermediate and high temperatures.
This project in engineering-metallurgy fulfills the program objectives of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and
Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
mutuality of benefit.
