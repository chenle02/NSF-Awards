The objective of this proposal is to organize the first annual principal
investigator meeting for the National Robotics Initiative (NRI). The NRI was
launched in the summer of 2011 and there is a clear need to bring together the
researchers of the projects awarded in 2012 and 2013 to provide cross-project
coordination in terms of common intellectual challenges, methods for education
and training, best practice in terms of transition of results and opportunities
for broader dissemination of project status, activities and results.

The meeting will be organized as a two-day meeting in the vicinity of Washington
DC which broadens the impact to other governmental agencies, as members will be
invited due to proximity. The meeting will include all the PIs for the NRI
initiative, and invitations to all the program managers for robotics related
programs in DC in addition to organizers of the Robotics-VO (Virtual
Organization). Finally, the meeting is organized to take place during fall of
2013 to allow the second cohort of NRI projects to participate, allowing greater
cross-fertilization of topics and ideas.
