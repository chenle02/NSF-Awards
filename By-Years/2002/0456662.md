0456662&lt;br/&gt;Zander&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes plans for the 2005
AEESP Research and Education Conference, which will be held at Clarkson
University in Potsdam, NY, in July 2005. The conference will focus on ways that
environmental engineers and scientists integrate their work in a wide range of
complex systems and applications and communicate their results to a broad
spectrum of audiences. A key feature of the AEESP Education and research
conferences is the extent of active participation by attendees both in the
technical program and in social events. Through this approach, the conferences
promote a sense of community and professional development in the attendees, who
comprise a broad spectrum of the faculty that serve the discipline of
environmental engineering and science.
