The purpose of this proposal is to systematically investigate how instruction
can be designed to encourage students to transfer what they have learned from
one context to other contexts. The research is based on the premise that it is
not just the content of what students learn that matters for transfer, but also
how learning contexts are framed, which may be in a more expansive or bounded
manner. The hypothesis is that contexts framed expansively are more likely to
support transfer-of-learning because they encourage students to orient to
current learning activities as opportunities to join larger intellectual
conversations that extend across time, places, topics, and people. High school
biology students will participate in a series of experiments to systematically
test the extent to which different aspects of expansively framed instruction
support the transfer of knowledge and practices from one-on-one tutoring about
the cardiovascular system to learning about the respiratory system and other
science topics. A parallel series of comparative studies will then be conducted
in high school biology classes to investigate how to best incorporate expansive
framing into the classroom to have the most powerful effects on transfer. This
research is important because if instruction can be modified to better promote
transfer, then science education will have a much greater impact on students?
lives. Too often students learn science ideas in relative isolation, failing to
connect the ideas or grasp the key concepts that could serve them in their
future schooling, careers, and as scientifically literate citizens. Further, if
this work is successful, it can support the development of curriculum units and
teacher training materials that will allow these methods to make a difference
for an increasingly wide range of students.
