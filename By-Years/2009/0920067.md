genomic era is how to understand the hidden information buried within genomes. A
crucial step in information decoding from DNA sequence to protein structure
occurs through the function of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules. The
functions of RNA depend on the three-dimensional structure and stability.
Because RNAs are highly charged polyanions, their folding concentrates negative
charge, which is countered by significant ion binding to the RNA making
structure and stability strongly dependent on ion effects in the solution. Many
modeling studies on the ion effects in RNA folding are based on the mean-field
Poisson-Boltzmann approaches. These approaches do not consider correlations,
fluctuations or finite size of the ions. However, a variety of experiments have
pointed to the potential importance of these three effects for multivalent ions
such as magnesium. Because magnesium ions are essential for RNA tertiary
structure folding, the inability to treat the correlation/fluctuation and ion
size effects has greatly limited the understanding, prediction, and design RNAs
in various applications. This project will address this deficiency in theory by
developing a new model for understanding the to role of divalent ions on the RNA
structure and function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Quantitative
predictions for the ion effects in RNA folding will impact a broad range of RNA-
related research, including quantification of the stabilizing forces in RNA,
prediction of RNA stability and folding cooperativity, quantitative
understanding of the mechanisms of ribozymes, riboswitches and microRNAs, and
rational design of therapeutic RNA aptamers. The project will provide unique
educational and training opportunities for graduate and post doctoral student
coming from traditional physical science backgrounds and allow them to move into
the field of biophysics. &lt;br/&gt;
