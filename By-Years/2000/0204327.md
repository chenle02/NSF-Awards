This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Multi-species
sequence comparison and compositional analysis of plant centromeres." This
research seeks is to understand the composition, organization and evolution of
centromeres--regions that mediate chromosome partitioning. Centromere sequences
from relatives of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana are being compared to
assess sequence conservation and determine the types and abundance of sequence
classes. This will distinguish rapidly evolving sequences from those exhibiting
significant conservation.
