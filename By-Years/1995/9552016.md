This project is designed to excite student interest in science at the entry
level through an Open Laboratory. The laboratory, located in college library, is
being used to support the three entry-level biology courses. The target
population includes first-generation college students who are underprepared,
nontraditional students and non-majors who plan to become elementary or high
school teachers. The curriculum for the entry-level courses is being enhanced
through increased emphasis on problem-solving experiments, conducted by students
in the Open Laboratory.
