The objective of this research is to investigate the fundamental issues of how
to actually fuse multi-sensor data to represent the robot task environment. The
principal investigator will first develop a hierarchical strategy for acquiring
robot sensory information based on four distinct phases: "Far Away," "Close To,"
"Touching," and "Manipulation." Because each phase consists of common
information and phase-specified information, the principal investigator will
package the information for each phase into a phase-oriented distinct template.
The next step will be the development of sensor models, sensor coordination, and
fusion of multiple sensor data. A new "confidence distance measure" and
"distance matrix" will be used as criteria for the detection of sensor errors
before the beginning of the sensor fusion process. A mathematical model will be
created to represent the level of confidence measures for determining the
optimal fused sensor data. Following this, the principal investigator will group
all information from the four phases to establish object information templates
and complete the representation of the task environment. This approach permits
data to be merged in both a low-level way (to minimize the influence of noisy
data) and a high level way (constraints are put on the influence between sensors
and the way the data is combined). This work can potentially clear the air on a
number of issues: the usefulness of faulty sensor isolation, the accuracy of
combined data sources, and the overall cohesiveness of the various templates for
phased sensing.
