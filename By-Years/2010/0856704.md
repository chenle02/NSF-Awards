This "science posse" project is piloting and assessing a program designed to
increase the total number of STEM majors from underrepresented groups. Building
upon successful models already developed by The Posse Foundation and the
Meyerhoff program at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, this program
is enrolling 12 students per year in each of the first three years of the grant
period. The posse program is recruiting students who display an interest in and
aptitude for science from inner city high schools. Each science posse
participant engages in a four-week pre-matriculation program introducing them to
laboratory research and a series of enrichment workshops illustrating the
connections between the sciences and mathematics. Each participant also receives
an opportunity to take part in an eight-week summer collaborative
student/faculty research experience at Dickinson after either their first or
second year of study, as well as an additional eight-week summer capstone
research experience at another academic or industrial research laboratory
following their junior year. The goal of the program is to achieve an overall
increase of at least 28 STEM graduates and to establish a cohort of science
major role models for future students among underrepresented minority groups.
Methods and results of the program's activities will be disseminated widely
within the broader science education community through journal publications and
presentations at professional meetings to serve as models for other
institutions.
