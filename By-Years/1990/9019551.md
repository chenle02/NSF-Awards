Currently a need exists for accurate, dependable microsensors which can
communicate to the observer data associated with processes which may be at the
molecular level or the parts per billion to trillion range. Surface acoustic
wave (SAW) technology offers one of the most attractive methods to realize the
microsensor. The SAW gas microsensor basically consists of twin SAW delay lines.
Each line is configured as an oscillator and the propagation path of one
contains a selectively sorbent film while the other is the uncoated reference.
Phase delay changes induced by the gas sorbed on the film results in frequency
shifts which are directly proportional to the gas concentration. An
interdisciplinary effort which includes the theory, design, fabrication and
testing of SAW devices and the physics and chemistry of surfaces is ongoing at
the University of Maine to realize the potential of this sensor. The purpose of
the present renewal project is to continue the ongoing experimental and
theoretical study of the SAW gas microsensor. The sensing film being used is
tungsten trioxide (WO3) and the gas being sensed is hydrogen sulfide (H2S).
Microscopic and macroscopic experimental tools are being used in order to study
and optimize sensor properties such as selectivity, sensitivity, operating range
sensor signature, response time, recovery time, reproducibility and aging.
