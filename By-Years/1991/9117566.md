Cosmogenic chlorine-36 buildup dating is a new geochronological method that
measures how long a rock has been exposed to cosmic rays on the earth's surface,
rather than the time since it became a geochemically closed system. The method
can thus be used to date the construction of landforms, such as glacial
moraines, that are difficult or impossible to date using conventional methods.
This award supports glacial chronology investigations by cosmogenic 36Cl buildup
at four locations (1) measurements on samples from Mauna Kea, (2) the Wind River
Range, Wyoming, (3) Banks Island, NWT. Canada, and (4) one other site in the
High Arctic. These sites will provide a latitudinal transect of the northern
hemisphere to test whether the chronological pattern previously observed at
Hawaii and the Sierra Nevada was due to coincidental local anomalies or to truly
global climate effects. One potential implication of a positive result would be
that the growth of continental-scale ice caps may be more a response to internal
dynamics than global climate forcing.
