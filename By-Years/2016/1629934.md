The ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the
identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full
participation and advancement of women faculty in academic institutions.
Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in areas such as policy,
practice, culture, and organizational climate. The ADVANCE Institutional
Transformation (ADVANCE-IT) track supports the development of innovative
organizational change strategies within an institution of higher education to
enhance gender equity in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clemson University will implement TIGERS
ADVANCE (Transforming the Institution through Gender Equity, Retention, and
Support): a set of policy changes, procedural innovations, and institutional
programs to improve the representation and status of women in STEM at Clemson.
TIGERS ADVANCE has five goals: (a) transform the culture and improve the campus
climate, (b) increase the representation of women in STEM disciplines, (c)
ensure equitable workload distribution, (d) enhance faculty mentoring and
leadership development, and (e) implement family-friendly policies. The social
science research project embedded in the project will focus on chairs' decision
making related to service assignments and workload among faculty.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clemson University's ADVANCE-IT project is grounded in
organizational identity theory. This is an innovative approach that envisions
fostering individual identification with the university by creating the
conditions for fair treatment of and improved institutional support for all
faculty. Clemson is the leading STEM education institution in South Carolina,
and will work through a regional network of institutions of higher education to
communicate findings, provide policy recommendations, and share best practices
to ensure recruitment, advancement, and retention of STEM women faculty.
