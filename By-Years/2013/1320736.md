The general vehicular networking system (VNS), where the vehicular ad hoc
network (VANET) is integrated with hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), enables a
wide range of intelligent transportation system (ITS) applications. With
different visions on VANETs, most of the existing studies provide case-specific
solutions in an incoherent manner, which can hardly be integrated into an
effective system. This project aims at developing a reliable, energy-efficient,
and secure VNS with a synergetic approach through five complementary research
tracks: infrastructure optimization, protocol design for reliable networking
performance, energy-efficient VNS, security and privacy provisioning, and
virtual-field testbed development. This project is expected to significantly
advance the state of the art of VANET research by addressing some fundamental
research issues. Analytical models are developed to study the road-side
infrastructure deployment, networking protocols and control algorithms for
optimal performance, considering the complex issues of mobility, interference,
and data traffic dynamics. The throughput-optimal control in a multi-radio
multi-channel context with dynamic network topology is studied to improve the
throughput over a multi-hop vehicular network. Energy-efficient solutions are
pursued by exploiting the interplay between the VNET and HEVs. Scalable security
protocols with small computation and communication overhead are developed to
provision security and privacy in VANET. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
research seamlessly integrates research and education activities in the areas of
optimization, probability and random process, graph theory, wireless networking,
HEV technologies, as well as computer simulations. The research proposed in this
project has a good potential to be transformed into practical protocols or
control algorithms for VANETs.
