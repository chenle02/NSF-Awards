This is an investigation of the systematics of sedimentary sequence formation
at Atlantic type margins; that is, the relationship between sea level change and
sedimentary record at a subsiding basin margin. The goal is to be able to
interpret seismically measured or determined sedimentary sequences in terms of:
(1) correlatability with like sequences elsewhere and with a eustatic sea level
curve, (2) improved determination of the amplitudes of eustatic sea level
change, and (3) interpretation of sequences in terms of depositional
environments. This modeling and analysis effort will consists of numerical
modeling of sequences, analysis of the present day Pleistocene sedimentary and
geomorphologic processes that are responding to glacioeustatic signals, and
backstripping and reconstruction of the morphology of the Miocene sequences of
the New Jersey shelf.
