project comprises three components uniqueness of minimizers for polyconvex
energy functionals that arise in nonlinear elasticity. Criteria will be develop
to distinguish those deformations that are diffeomorphisms; ii) stability and
interaction of vortices (or defects) in time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau or
Landau- Stuart models describing superfluids or superconductors. Various
conjectures by physicists and applied mathematicians will be examined; iii)
minimization problems concerning ferro-magnetic materials. The goal is to
determine whether configurations that have been experimentally observed occur as
limits of minimizers to the corresponding magnetic energy functionals. The above
project concerns three mathematical models formulated by physicists and material
scientists in order to describe the behavior of certain materials. The goal of
this proposal is to determine rigorously whether solutions to the given
mathematical models do, indeed, exhibit the expected behavior in each case. The
first problem concerns deformations of certain hyper-elastic materials in two or
three space dimensions. The presence or absence of singularities (such as sharp
edges or interfaces) will be examined. The second problem concerns defects in a
superconducting material. It is proposed to determine how such defects interact
and stabilize in time. In particular, conjectures by physicists about when
defects split apart or disappear will be investigated. The third problem
concerns properties of materials which are magnetically saturated. Certain
configurations of the magnetic field have been observed experimentally, and we
wish to investigate whether stable solutions to the mathematical model exhibit
these configurations.
