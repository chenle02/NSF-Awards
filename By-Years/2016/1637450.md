Summer is the rainy season for East Asia. The Meiyu-Baiu rain band, extending
from the eastern flank of the Tibetan Plateau northeastward through Korea and
Japan, is the single most important climate phenomenon of the region. The
termination of this summer rain band in late July has been tied to the abrupt
onset of tropical convection over the Northwest Pacific east of the Philippines,
through a meridional dipole pattern of summer rainfall variability. The abrupt
onset of Northwest Pacific convection remains unsolved with local sea surface
temperature (SST) rising above 28 degrees C as early as in June.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effort under this project will investigate the hypothesis
that the gradual moistening of the lower troposphere via shallow convection
leads to a threshold behavior of abrupt convective onset over the tropical
Northwest Pacific. During the satellite era starting 1979, interannual
variability in tropical Northwest Pacific convection is well correlated with El
Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Specifically, an anomalous anticyclonic
circulation (AAC) forms and rainfall decreases over the tropical Northwest
Pacific in post-El Nino summers. Through earlier studies a positive feedback has
been identified due to interactions between the AAC and Indo-Northwest Pacific
SST during summer when the southwest monsoonal winds prevail. We will
investigate the mechanisms and predictability of this regional coupled mode.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The correlation between the AAC and ENSO breaks down
during half of the 20th century from the 1920s and 1970s. Weak ENSO amplitudes
are considered to have caused the low correlation. This aspect as well as the
role of random noise due to atmospheric internal variability will be explored
critically. Locally, Northwest Pacific convection affects the U.S. affiliated
Northern Mariana Islands and Guam. Remotely, it affects the South and East Asian
monsoon regions, home to three billion people. This research will help improve
seasonal forecast and climate change projection in the regions, thereby
contributing to several ongoing international research programs. The project
trains the next generation of climate scientists by including graduate students
and postdocs in the research team, and by exposing them to international
collaborations.
