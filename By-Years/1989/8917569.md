This research project is to assess the impact of parasitism on fish populations
in the Bear Lake fishery. The assessment will be based on both parasite and host
population dynamics. The P.I. will also identify parasite species that have
potential as biological tags to study fish populations in Bear Lake. The use of
parasites as biological tags to study food habits of Bear Lake fish will augment
traditional fish diet studies, which only reveal prey fed upon immediately prior
to capture. Information gathered from this research will be useful in the
management of the Bear Lake fishery and will contribute to our understanding of
host-parasite ecology in aquatic ecosystems.
