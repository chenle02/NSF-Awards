While there is evidence that learning plays a role in the development of the
correct usage of certain vocalizations in several species of monkeys and apes,
there are few studies that have demonstrated such plasticity in the production
of calls. The present research investigates developmental complexity in primate
vocal communication. Behavioral data, tape-recordings, and computer-aided
spectrography will be used to study the acquisition and significance of pigtail
macaque (Macaca nemestrina) vocal "signatures." The project focuses on
recruitment screams, vocalizations that have been found to designate events and
objects in the animals' external environment and that thus are rudimentarily
semantic. Calls used in the recruitment of allies during fights require
knowledge of kinship and dominance relationships in the group and are therefore
ideal to test hypotheses that learning may be involved in the development of
nonhuman primate vocal behavior. These calls have "signature" information in
their acoustic structure that may serve to identify kin groups. Foster-reared
infants will be studied for evidence that they acquire the signature of their
adoptive matriline. The long-term aim of this research on the vocal
communication of monkeys is to explore cognitive dimensions of primate behavior
that may ultimately provide insights into the evolutionary origins of human
language. Results should also contribute to a better understanding of the
criteria for appropriate primate models for studies of language acquisition.
