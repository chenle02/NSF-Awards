A fundamental component of intelligent behavior is how people make inferences
about novel objects, people, and situations. In category-based induction, people
use their knowledge of categories to make such inferences about new items from
those categories (Will that dog attack? Which treatment will help this
patient?). The present research investigates how people make such predictions in
a common situation, when the categories are uncertain. For example, if medical
treatment is required before a final diagnosis is possible, how do people take
account of the various possible diagnoses (categories)? Past research has shown
people often make inductions poorly in such situations, focusing on the most
likely category and ignoring other possibilities.

The proposed research examines the basis for these errors in explicit, conscious
predictions and whether reasoning can be improved by including information from
implicit, fast, unconscious predictions. Pilot work suggests that implicit
predictions can be more accurate than explicit ones. The proposed research
attempts to confirm this finding and explores the psychological mechanisms that
underlie the improved reasoning.

This research will have two important contributions. First, it will help in
understanding the differences and similarities between conscious and unconscious
processes. This distinction is crucial in much research on mind and behavior,
and the present research will help us understand why these differences exist.
Second, the results may lead to specific proposals for ways to improve
predictions in medical, personal, and economic decisions. When categories are
uncertain, people often do not make good predictions, but decision aids that
help include implicit, unconscious processes may improve performance.
