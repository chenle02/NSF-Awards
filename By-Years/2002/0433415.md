This award supports a series of workshops involving discussions among leading
climate scientists and journalists to address institutional and cultural issues
surrounding the communication of science news through the media. The goal of the
activity is to identify obstacles to effective communication and understanding
and develop strategies to overcome these obstacles. The lessons learned and
strategies developed from one workshop will be carried forward to the next
workshop so that participants may build upon the collective work of the group.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activity involves a broad range of individuals from
experienced researchers and seasoned journalists to new investigators and
graduate students in science and journalism in an effort to develop guidelines
for best practices in this arena.&lt;br/&gt;
