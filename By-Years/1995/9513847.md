9513847 Linbo Certain transgenic plant lines expressing translatable or
untranslatable forms of the tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) coat protein gene are
resistant to infection by TEV. Past research has suggested that such transgenic
plants are resistant due to the presence of a sequence specific RNA dgradation
activity which targets both the transgene RNA and TEV RNA. The specific aims of
this research are to identify: (1) the significance of the RNA degradation in
virus resistance, (2) the specific RNA sequences recognized by this RNA
degrading activity, and (3) how the RNA degradation system may be induced. %%%
Plant viruses can be serious agricultural pathogens, causing significant crop
losses. The largest group of plant viruses, and one of the most economically
important is the potyvirus group. Some transgenic tobacco plant lines have been
engineered to produce two different types of coat protein RNA when infected with
TEV. The plant which has one form of the RNA is immediately resistant to the
viral infection but the other type is at first susceptible and then becomes
resistant. The goal of this project is to characterize the two forms of
resistance. ***
