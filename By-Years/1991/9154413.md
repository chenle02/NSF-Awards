ABSTRACT As the number of children living in dual-earner families continues to
increase, it becomes critical to understand the effects of parents work
experience on children's development and the processes through which such
effects occur. This research will finalize the methodology for a study of the
impact of parents' occpuational experiences on family processes and children's
well being among African-American families with preschool children. Currently
there are two limitations of the work-family literature: (1) a failure to
consider the ways in which the cultural context in which families operate may
condition linkages between work and family life, and (2) a failure to elaborate
the mechanisms through which parental employment impacts children. This support
will facilitate instrument development and identification of an adequate
sampling frame from which to select respondents. Other scholars, and service
providers who have expertise in these two areas will be consulted.
