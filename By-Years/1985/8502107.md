This project will study and develop a system to deliver chemicals into the body
by controlled lightwave pulses. The optically controlled system will unbind some
stored chemical which will diffuse to a second optical fiber which contains
monoclonal antibodies immobilized on its surface. The resulting system
constitutes a remote, competitive binding immunoassay which can be performed
under optical control. This will open up new possibilities in the treatment of
patients as well as in industrial process control. Remote optical reagent
generation will be a major tool in biological research, allowing precisely
controlled ;itin situ;ro delivery of chemicals into microscopic areas.
