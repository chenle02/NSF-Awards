A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site will be established at the
San Diego State University (SDSU) Department of Astronomy under the direction of
Dr. Eric Sandquist. The scientific focus of the program will involve
observational astronomy, and specifically photometry (brightness measurements)
of stars and galaxies. Example projects include tests of stellar evolution,
searches for extrasolar planets, and the structural properties of dwarf
galaxies. The program will make heavy use of telescopes and data taken at Mount
Laguna Observatory, a research-grade facility at an excellent site run by SDSU
and within 45 minutes travel from the campus by car. Mentors will be drawn from
faculty at SDSU, other California State University (CSU) campuses, and the
University of Kansas.

Up to 12 students will be selected each summer to take part in a 10 week program
at SDSU involving hands-on research using astronomical observing and data
analysis techniques. Approximately half of the student participants will work
with faculty mentors at SDSU, and will be recruited from SDSU, San Diego County
community colleges, and from CSU campuses not having active research faculty.
The rest of the participants will be recruited by active faculty researchers at
other CSU campuses and the University of Kansas, who will also serve as mentors.
The program is specifically designed to offer cutting-edge experiences in
astronomy to students who might not otherwise have access to research-grade
facilities and to encourage research at campuses which do not offer doctoral
degrees.
