This award supports a Dissertation Improvement Grant for doctoral student Frank
Feeley. Researcher Feeley will be working closely with PI Tom McGovern to
explore the site of Gufuskálar in western Iceland. This dissertation improvement
grant will support two seasons of archaeological investigation of the site in
order to better understand its role in the early "global" economy of Icleand, as
well as the origins of the modern world economic system. The site of Gufuskálar
is important as it's one of the few surviving examples of the handful of large
medieval fishing stations. These stations marked Iceland's introduction into the
growing world system of medieval trade, which is the basis for our modern world
economic system. The investigation will use a unique methodology of examinining
fish crania to determine the movement from subsistence to commodity fisheries in
Iceland during the Viking period. In addition, both sea and wind are quickly
eroding the site, which is one of the largest medieval fishing stations in
Iceland. This project will contribute to the preservation of information in
danger of being lost and will contribute to the preservation of this important
site itself.
