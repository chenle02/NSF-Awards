9221733 Reimer Automated DNA sequencer will be used by the Biotechnology-
Molecular Biology Instrumentation and Training Facility at the University of
Hawaii in studies that will include characterization of the DNA that codes for
the motility protein dynein; evolutionary studies on mitochondrial DNA; and
characterization of significant genetic elements from Drosophila, marine
microbial species, and tropical crop plants. Biological researchers from several
schools and research institutes of the University will use the instrument for
highly repetitive sequencing of specific loci from multiple sources, for
extensive sequencing of specific structural genes, and for characterization of
PCR amplified "micro-satellite" DNA fragments. Automated DNA sequencing
equipment can now perform this monotonous task with comparable or higher
accuracy than manual methods, with lower personnel requirements and without the
need for radioactive materials. This instrument will provide access to DNA
sequencing services to approximately 40 research groups on campus on a minimal
fee basis.
