*** 9615803 Warrington This grant provides funding to enable eight graduate
students to attend and participate in the Engineering Foundation Workshop on the
Commercialization of Microsystems `96. This workshop will focus on issues
related to the commercialization of technologies emerging in the field of
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The field has emerged over the past ten
years, largely under NSF funding, and an industry totaling about $4 billion per
year has grown based on the technology. But considerable additional growth is
expected. The workshop discussions will focus on the barriers to continued
commercialization of MEMS and to the lowering of these barriers. Students will
be selected using a competitive process. This grant will enable graduate student
participation in this workshop, thereby providing a broad exposure to
commercialization issues in an area of emerging technology. This exposure should
enable students to make greater contributions to the field and to the
commercialization of the technology upon their graduation. The field is becoming
a major employer of engineering graduates and should contribute very
substantially to the creation of new jobs over the next 20 years. ***
