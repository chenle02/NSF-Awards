The objective of this project is to develop a method of teaching that will
attract more women to science courses. The project develops innovative
complementary courses in introductory biology and chemistry with a new
atmosphere in the expository portion and with a laboratory component designed to
promote the investigative nature of science. The introductory course changes
include: (1) The establishment of a mode of education common to both biology and
chemistry, allowing considerable cross-referencing between the courses. (2) The
development of open-ended laboratory experiences which will encourage small
groups of students to determine the parameters of selected questions and, with
minimal faculty direction, to design and run significant experiments themselves.
(3) The development of computer simulations that complement the wet laboratory
exercises which will allow greater freedom of preliminary exploration by
students in a non-threatening and less time-consuming way.
