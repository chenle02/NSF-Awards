This research investigates a computationally efficient and numerically reliable
procedure for modeling the forming process of sheet metals via the finite
element method. The research work consists of four different areas: 1) study of
robust shell elements by considering elasto.plastic, large deformation and
including both membrane and bending actions, 2) modeling of interfacial friction
effect, 3) improvement in computation efficiency, and 4) development of an
interactive graphics with a remeshing technique.
