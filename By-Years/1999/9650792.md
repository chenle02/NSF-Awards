This institution is acquiring computers, interfaces, appropriate sensors, and
support equipment for three chemistry laboratories that make possible the
introduction of microcomputer-based laboratories into the general chemistry
program. Approximately 700 students take general chemistry each year. The
acquisition of this equipment enables students to collect, display, and analyze
data rapidly such that students can investigate graphical relationships,
discover mathematical relationships, handle statistical analyses, and design new
experiments in an effort to enhance critical thinking capability. An emphasis is
being placed on the investigation and interpretation of graphical patterns and
mathematical relationships within the general chemistry laboratory program. The
project provides for the development of new experiments dealing with gas laws,
spectrophotometry, thermochemistry, and electrochemistry that utilize the newly
acquired computer systems. In addition, all general chemistry students work in
teams to design a team experiment using the new equipment. This is the project's
culminating activity in the general chemistry laboratory program.
