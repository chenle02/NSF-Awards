This three year project is sponsored by the University of Washington and will
provide an intensive four week summer program for well prepared teachers of
chemistry. Thirty teachers will be selected each year on a competitive basis
from the Northwest, including Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and
Wyoming. The focus of the program will be environmental chemistry. The course
will entail learning of content, development of teaching demonstrations, working
with modern instrumentation and computers and microscale experiments. The
teachers will also participate in a contemporary issues seminar. Teachers will
be taking topics relating to inservice activities and will be expected to assume
teacher leadership responsibilities after the program is over. The amount of
cost share in this proposal is equivalent to 36% of the NSF funds.
