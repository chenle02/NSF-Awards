This is a program to study, via optical integral field unit spectroscopy, the
astrophysics of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), which are thought to be young
galaxies in the process of formation. The main goals are 1) To reveal the
astrophysics of a statistically useful sample of several hundred high-redshift
SMGs, and their counterparts detected using Spitzer Space Telescope; 2) To
understand the place of SMGs as signposts to active regions of the distant
Universe, and their role in defining the stars in disks and bulges/spheroids in
galaxies today. This research will lead to a better understanding of galaxy
formation in the early universe and the nature of galaxies today.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include research training for
undergraduates, interaction with local K-12 educators, and providing tours of
local K-12 students to the Palomar and Owens Valley observatories. &lt;br/&gt;
