At the end of the Paleozoic, the western margin of North America changed from
passive to convergent, and lower Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in the Great Basin
were remagnetized from S. Nevada to west- central Utah. In northern Nevada,
remagnetization did not occur until the Triassic. This study will test if the
different timings of remagnetization were the result of different docking times
of terranes onto the western North American Margin. The stratigraphic and areal
extent and the timing of remagnetization will be determined for each carbonate
sequence and it will be determined if the remagnetization was normal or
chemical. The remagnetization will then be related to known regional tectonic
events. The results of this study will provide important information about
remagnetization processes and will have direct bearing on tectonic
reconstructions of western North America during the late Paleozoic
