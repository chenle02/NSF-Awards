This award will support Professor Nikolaos Peppas of Purdue University in a
research collaboration with Professor Paolo Colombo of the University of Parma,
Italy. The researchers intend to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the
transport and release of water soluble peptides from non- porous, hydrophilic
polymers. Polymer/peptide systems to be investigated include uncrosslinked
poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(acrylic acid), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and
various polymethacrylates. Diffusion and release studies will be performed with
calcitonin, trazodone, diclofenac, diltiazem and prazosin. Controlled release
systems of the swelling type are a promising new class of polymeric systems for
release of drugs and biomolecules. Although their capability to release small
molecules at constant rates has been proven through previous studies, no study
has been done yet for the release of high molecular weight (75,000)
macromolecules. Obvious applications of this research will be in the area of
release of genetically engineered molecules in target areas. The proposed work
will provide an important understanding of the coupled phenomena of
diffusion/swelling/dissolution and will offer guidelines for the development of
better controlled release systems.
