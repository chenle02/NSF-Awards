An award is made to the University of Oregon to develop an instrument capable of
three-dimensional imaging of large numbers of living multicellular specimens,
especially embryos and larvae of zebrafish that serve as models for the study of
many biological processes. Observation of cellular interactions during early
development, wound healing, disease progression, and many other events has been
enormously beneficial to our understanding of both normal and aberrant
biological function. We have lacked methods, however, to apply recently
developed advanced three-dimensional imaging techniques to large numbers of
specimens, limiting both the rate of experiments and the statistical robustness
of results. This project addresses this challenge through the development of new
instrumentation. Implementing this research will provide valuable cross-
disciplinary training for graduate students and undergraduates, as it fosters
the development of skills in optics, device control, computational data
analysis, microbiology, and developmental biology. In addition to research, the
instrument will be used in activities related to summer undergraduate research
internships and a day camp that the PI has co-organized for several years that
exposes socioeconomically disadvantaged high school students to science. More
broadly, the instrumentation developed by this project will provide previously
unseen views of cells, tissues, and organs in living animals that can underpin
new perspectives on health and disease.

In recent years, advanced three-dimensional imaging methods have provided deep
insights into the spatial and temporal arrangements of cells. A high-resolution,
three-dimensional microscopy method known as light sheet fluorescence microscopy
has proven itself to be particularly powerful for imaging living specimens over
many-hour or several-day durations. This and similar methods, however, have
suffered the limitation of very limited throughput, capable of imaging one or at
most a few specimens during an experimental run. It is increasingly apparent
that the high variability of developing organisms, and the subtleties of
mechanisms governing them, call for studies that can apply high-precision
imaging to much larger numbers of specimens. This motivates the instrument we
will design and build, which integrates high-throughput specimen handling and
real-time computational image analysis with light sheet fluorescence microscopy.
Specific imaging targets that we will design our instrument to be capable of
imaging and analyzing include the gut microbiota, immune system, and groups of
neurons. Beyond this, there is a large list of systems for which long-duration
three-dimensional imaging with high statistical power would be useful, implying
a sizeable impact for our instrumentation.
