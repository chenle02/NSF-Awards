This research is proposed as an Accomplishment Based Renewal based on the
strength of the past research of the proposer. Future work will continue to
concentrate on the factors that control a major earthquake's size, location, and
timing. Using plate tectonics as a framework, measurements will be made of the
depth extent and geometry of the seismogenic zone, i.e., that portion of the
plate interface capable of generating large earthquakes. The methodology
developed to perform this measurement is innovatively flexible and powerful with
rigorous statistical error estimates. Measurements will also concentrate on the
"inside" part of the earthquake where spatial heterogeneity in coupling strength
along the fault controls many features of seismicity and earthquake rupture
processes. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program.
