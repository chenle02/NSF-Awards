This proposal creates a Diffusion and Evaluation Center for the Research in
Education and Evaluation in Science and Engineering (REESE) program.
Specifically, this Center: &lt;br/&gt;1. Provides support and capacity building
opportunities for the REESE PIs through technical assistance that strengthens
methodological and analytic approaches;&lt;br/&gt;2. Creates opportunities for
dialogue and interaction through PI and other themed meetings, online resources,
and provides mechanisms for PIs to share instrumentation, data and
findings;&lt;br/&gt;3. Produces studies and reports based on various aspects of
the REESE portfolio through (in consultation with NSF) identifying criteria to
assess the rigor of studies and provide information on the effectiveness of the
program and the studies it supports; &lt;br/&gt;4. Summarizes key findings of
REESE projects to various audiences such as researchers, policymakers, and
practitioners; &lt;br/&gt;5. Contributes to the creation of an evaluation
framework for the REESE program, and&lt;br/&gt;6. Conducts original research on
salient issues related to the portfolio.
