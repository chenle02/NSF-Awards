Portland State University continues operation of a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Site. Ten undergraduates and five undergraduates are
recruited every year for an eight-week and one-academic semester research
experience, respectively. Recruitment is nationwide, with an emphasis on
students from community colleges in the greater Portland area and from four-year
colleges where few research opportunities exist. The REU Site offers a variety
of interdisciplinary research projects that emphasize materials
characterization. As such, REU participants learn the use of major research
instruments such as electron microscopes. Other student activities include a
workshop on laboratory safety, database searching and computer tools; a short
course on the application of microscopy and microanalysis; and a research
symposium where students present the results of their
work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
