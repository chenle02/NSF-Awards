The primary goal of this project is to build knowledge about how to maximize
the effectiveness of different modes of use of multi-media, anytime/anyplace
group support systems. The project will experiment with "combination" or "mix
and match" modes used by the same group over a period of time. These are the
types of systems and patterns of use which are likely to be most prevalent over
the next decade, yet there are no other experiments on such a phenomenon in 212
studies published to date on group decision support systems. The research will
integrate theory development, empirical research, and technology innovations,
and may include controlled experiments. Other aspects to be studied may include
the interaction of task and technology, the use of more sophisticated multi-
criteria decision analysis tools, and the interaction of cultural
characteristics with technology. The research will help to develop and integrate
theories of effective computer support for collaborative work, and improve the
process and outcomes of distributed collaborative work, such as software
engineering work. http://eies.njit.edu/~hiltz
