Using a recently discovered effect (Laser Amplified Motion Detection and
Analysis, LAMDA), this project is to develop a far- field optical microscope
with a resolution of 10nm. This resolution, one-fiftieth of the wavelength of
visible light and about one-twentieth of the resolution obtained by previous
optical microscopes, would permit the imaging of detail never before realized
with an optical microscope. The LAMDA microscope would be capable of making
directly observable, in real time, such biological entities as DNA-protein
complexes, the emergence of cell-growth factors in development, the structural
details underlying mitosis, and of channel-forming proteins in biological
membranes. Further applications would encompass all of the sciences,
engineering, process control in the semiconductor and magnetic data storage
industries, in fact wherever light microscopy of unprecedented high resolution
can be of value.
