This award supports the research of Professor T. Zaslavsky to work in
combinatorics. He intends to investigate surface embeddability of graphs, biased
graphs, matroids satisfying a linear reduction law and coloring and chromatic
polynomials of linearly representable matroids. The research is in the general
area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study
how discrete collections of objects can be organized. And, so it is extremely
important to modern communications, for example the design of large networks as
in telephone systems and the design of algorithms in computer science.
