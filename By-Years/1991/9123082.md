This project is the continuation of an investigation of the transport of
chemical trace elements and species from source regions through the atmosphere
to the Greenland ice sheet. Its goal is to provide information for the
interpretation of the trace element distribution in a long ice core being
obtained through the Greenland Ice Sheet Program (GISP-2) drilling effort. The
ice core is expected to provide a detailed record spanning 200,000 years. The
project has three specific objectives: (1) the identification of source regions
and atmospheric pathways for the chemical constituents reaching the drill site,
including the possible changes in air mass characteristics during transit, (2)
the study of the wet and dry deposition mechanisms and rates of incorporation of
chemical species into precipitating snow, and (3) the investigation of post-
depositional changes in snow chemistry and of the redistribution of species
within the snowpack. Field work consists of the collecting of air, aerosol,
precipitation, and deposited snow samples, which will be analyzed for various
anions and cations, trace elements, carbon compounds, and trace gases. A special
atmospheric camp, to ensure that samples will be uncontaminated by the drilling,
is being maintained as part of the GISP-2 program.
