This research project addresses the gap in the understanding of the polyhedral
(geometric) structure of general mixed-integer programming problems. With an
ultimate goal of developing efficient and effective cutting plane procedures for
mixed-integer problems with general integer variables, strong cutting planes
applicable to general mixed-integer problems will be identified through
polyhedral analysis of fundamental single-constraint mixed-integer sets. The
methods of the research are based on a recent work on sequence independent
lifting of valid inequalities through the use of superadditive functions for
general mixed-integer programming. The expected outcome of this research project
is novel cutting plane procedures that will be incorporated in branch-and-cut
algorithms for solving large-scale mixed-integer programming problems. If
successful, the research project may lead to significant advances in the
understanding of general mixed-integer polyhedra and in the solution methods for
large-scale instances of mixed-integer problems with general integer variables.
