9530173 This planning proposal takes advantage of the ongoing Earth System
Science Education (ESSE) program, already funded by NASA, to contribute to the
development and the emerging goals of the IAI program. The concept of the Earth
as a system is central to the seven research themes already identified for the
IAI science agenda. By virtue of its interdisciplinary agenda Earth System
Science and Elobal Change topics both place unusual demands and provide for
exiting opportunities in the development of classroom educational resources to
meet the needs of IAI member countries. The ESSE program will be used as a model
for the development of similar collaborative efforts within the IAI member
countries; however, tailored to the specific technical capabilities and
scientific interests of the participants. In addition, the existing scientific,
technical and support resources of the ESSE program will be available to share
with the ESSE-IAI team to facilitate an immediate, effective initiation of the
proposed program. ***
