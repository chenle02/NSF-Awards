This project will improve understanding of terrestrial carbon sinks by linking
process-level biological information obtained for individual plants or
ecosystems over short time scales with observations and models that characterize
the large spatial domain and long time scales of regional and global concern.
The P.I. will obtain comprehensive observations and use archived data integrated
across several spatial and temporal scales, including tower and aircraft flux
measurements and forest biomass inventories, to develop an integrated ecosystem-
atmosphere model that captures both slow and fast ecosystem processes. The
combined results will provide quantitative constraints to the carbon budget at
regional scales. The integrated model will be optimized using atmospheric and
biospheric data that quantitatively link properties of the terrestrial
biosphere-atmosphere system with the underlying fundamental biological and
physical processes. The project has an outreach program that includes an
interactive CD-ROM with information on the carbon cycle and climate change and a
module for having students conduct hypothesis testing using project data.
