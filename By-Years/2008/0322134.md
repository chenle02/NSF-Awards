Thin mechanical components are ubiquitous and constitute a multi-billion dollar
industry; examples include outer-shell of automobiles and aircrafts, most
plastic components, etc. Like all mechanical components, they are subject to
rigorous computational analysis before production. Existing analysis techniques
for thin components, for historical reasons, are based on the mid-surface of a
thin component. Unfortunately, the mid-surface is often ill defined for complex
objects. This has led to fragile and inaccurate algorithms. This project
proposes to use of the skeleton of a solid, abandoning the notion of a "mid-
surface" approach. The skeleton, unlike the mid-surface, is well defined and can
be computed uniquely for a solid. Initial investigation shows that this would
result in robust algorithms, involving the combination of the Kantorovich
principle of dimensional reduction with the unique topological and geometrical
properties of skeleton representation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the
research would lead to a fundamentally new and unified theory of thin component
analysis consisting of an unambiguous and complete mathematical language of
skeletal reduction, and associated algebra. The mathematical principles would
also be of interest to researchers involved in the broad area of boundary value
problem analysis. Dissemination of the findings of the research will be
articulated to University of Wisconsin students through a graduate course, and
students and researchers elsewhere through seminars. It is also the intention to
facilitate a transfer of technology of the ensuing theory and algorithms to the
CAD/CAE industry. An environmental impact of the project is in the plastics
industry where components are almost exclusively thin; better analysis
techniques have the potential of significantly reducing the tonnage of plastics
used (and discarded) today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
