During emplacement of large masses of magma, country rock material is
transferred out of the path of the ascending/inflating magma body, but precisely
how this is accomplished is a long-standing problem. This project will approach
the question by examining selected examples in which pluton roofs (as opposed to
the more commonly preserved walls) are available for study, in the hopes they
preserve evidence for the space-accommodating mechanism that is not evident in
pluton walls. The work will involve detailed mapping, strain analysis, fabric
study and other microstructural techniques to constrain three-dimensional
structural reconstructions of emplacement-related deformation. The Yerington
batholith, Nevada, the Mount Powell batholith, Montana and other examples will
be studied. Results will address how material was transferred during emplacement
and will help refine the relationship between emplacement of plutons and magma
chamber evolution.
