&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves the development of new methods in
synthetic chemistry, and the subsequent application of the methodology to
complex synthetic problems. This includes the development of the chemistry of
tert-butyldimethylsilylhydrazones (TBSHs) for the synthesis of gem-dihalides,
vinyl halides, hydrocarbons, diazo compounds, halogenated TBSHs, esters, ethers,
and cyclopropane derivatives, and a directed condensation reaction to form mixed
azines. Investigation to study new chemistry of mixed azines with the goal of
developing a catalyzed process for the extrusion of dintrogen to form olefinic
products is planned. Novel methodology directed toward a direct and
generalizable enantioselective synthesis of quaternary carbon centers will be
developed. In related work, a method for establishing vicinal carbon centers in
a stereocontrolled manner will also be pursued. Studies to further develop a
palladium-catalyzed decarboxylative coupling of arene carboxylates and its
extension toward a protio-decarboxylation process as well as coupling reactions
will be investigated. A convergent, enantioselective synthesis of the
cytochalasins will be achieved suitable for the preparation of members of the
class with widely variant macrocyclic substitution. A synthesis of the novel,
nominally aromatic hydrocarbon bicyclopentadienylene will be completed and a
study made of the chemistry of this theoretically interesting and thus far
elusive molecule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Andrew G.
Myers in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University.
Dr. Myers will focus his work on developing synthetic methodology that can be
applied to complex synthetic problems. The broader impact of the work is in the
areas of pharmaceutical, agricultural and materials chemistry. Further, the
project presents an excellent setting for the training of graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;
