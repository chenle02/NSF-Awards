Theoretical work in a varied set of mathematical problems in continuum
mechanics will be carried out. These include: a) nonlinear wave propagation in
viscoelastic media; b) sheets with bending stiffness, and c)
quasiconvexification stored energy function in membrane structures. The aim is
to provide a coherent general theory of large deformation of membranes and
networks (such as cloth and cable networks) and to develop approximate methods
for the solution of boundary-value problems within this theory. This research
has impact on the new technologies in civil and mechanical engineering.
