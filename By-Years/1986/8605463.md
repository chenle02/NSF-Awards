A machine vision system is being acquired, which will be used to support current
research in three-dimensional object recognition and imag analysis. The system
will be used to explore a new, general approach to recognizing, describing, and
understanding three-dimensional objects in any arbitrary orientation, given a
single 2_d camera image and predefined object models. The models consist of a
series of edge vectors and vertices in 3-space. The procedure for detecting an
object and its orientation involves matching of pairs of edges from the models
to pairs of edges in the image. Using the matched data, an expert system can be
developed to compile the information into a comprehensive set of descriptions of
the 3-D scene.
