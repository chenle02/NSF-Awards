0100813&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Garcia-Garibay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award co-
sponsored by the Division of International Programs and the Division of
Chemistry will support a Regional Workshop on Photochemistry, Photophysics, and
Spectroscopy in Organized Media to be held in Cordoba, Argentina on May 25-28,
2001. The workshop is organized by Dr. Miguel A. Garcia-Garibay of the
University of California, Los Angeles and Professor Pedro F. Aramendia at the
Universidad de Buenos Aires in Argentina. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop
will afford 18 U.S. scientists the opportunity to interact with 18 counterparts
from Central and South America. It will serve to bring together major
researchers in the area of photochemistry, photophysics, and spectroscopy, to
explore new directions influenced by the interaction between light and matter in
various materials systems. Young researchers from the U.S. and Latin America
will comprise a significant number of the attendees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
workshop will focus on studies of solids, thin films, supramolecular aggregates,
and other non-fluid systems that have important applications in the fields of
materials science and engineering, photonics, sensors, and molecular
computing.&lt;br/&gt;-&lt;br/&gt;
