The proposed research seeks to design organic semiconductors-SWNT composites of
high mobility as an inroad into this technology that could be disruptive towards
silicon-based devices. The studies delineated in this proposal promise to create
environmentally stable organic semiconductor composites that could be patterned
with laser printing technology. The interdisciplinary team that has come
together to address these problems incorporates expertise in advanced organic
synthesis, organic device fabrication, and large area dry printing. As a
benchmark, this proposal seeks to create materials with that soluble and can be
printed to yield materials that have high environmental stability, on/off
current ratios greater than 10 6 , and mobilites ca. 5 to 10 cm 2 /Vs.
