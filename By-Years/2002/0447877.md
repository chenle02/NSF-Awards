Personal computing is currently undergoing a major revolution: the growth of
mobile computing. The number of mobile devices is on a rapidly increasing
trajectory, including millions of Bluetooth and WiFi enabled devices such as
cameras, PDA, cell-phones, and music players. Although each device has a
specific purpose, they are all used to create, store, and share vasts amounts of
personal data. Along with this growth comes a data management nightmare: systems
frustrate users with the lack of availability of data, complications in
transferring data from one device to another, and limited battery lifetime.

This CAREER research is designing and building mobile systems that address power
management, variable connectivity, and usability concerns. A variety of
techniques are employed, from unique combinations of hardware and software, to
innovative techniques in measurement in modeling. The research includes building
real systems, in order to demonstrate the benefits of these approaches to end-
users.

The first issue to be addressed is power management in always-on devices.
Through a hierarchy of connected low-power embedded subsystems, the mobile
devices efficiently enter low-power modes to provide data transfer
opportunities. Second, because many devices frequently disconnect from their
peers, it is necessary to use third party devices to transfer data updates.
Using techniques from Distributed File Systems, as well as Disruption Tolerant
Networking, the research is building systems that take advantage of mobility to
transfer data between normally disconnected devices. Third, efficiently
transferring data using mobile devices requires efficient operating support for
storing data.

This CAREER grant funds these research activities, as well as ongoing
collaborations with four other colleges in the Western Massachusetts area.
Through interactions with two highly-ranked all-women's colleges, the PI is
encouraging more female students to pursue graduate school in Computer Science.
