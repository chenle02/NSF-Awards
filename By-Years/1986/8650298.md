This project will add a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and two
associated sampling accessories to the Lawrence University chemistry laboratory
holdings. This instrument will significantly improve undergraduate laboratory
work at Lawrence, especially in organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and
advanced laboratory courses, and in undergraduate research. It will provide the
students with an instrument illustrative of the state of the art in computer-
controlled instrumentation and in the application of the fast Fourier transform
to spectroscopy, two revolutionary developments of the past several years to
which undergraduates in a high-quality laboratory program need exposure.
