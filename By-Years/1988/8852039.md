The Department of Sociology, Anthropology and Social Work has developed a social
research curriculum and a Center for Social Research. The curriculum and center
provide opportunities for social science students to conduct field and
laboratory research preparing them for careers as researchers, teachers and
advisors and as scientifically literate citizens. The computers, printers and
software funded by this award are used throughout the curriculum to foster
methodological rigor and analyze real world data. The award will be matched by
an equal amount from the grantee.
