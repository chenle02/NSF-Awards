The Symposium on Computational Geometry (SOCG) is the premiere international
conference in computational geometry. Throughout its more than 30-year history,
SOCG has played a seminal role in the formation and evolution of the field, and
it continues to serve as the flagship venue for groundbreaking research in all
areas of geometric computing. In recent years SOCG has expanded to incorporate
CG Week, an event that includes technical sessions with contributed talks, at
least two invited talks, a multimedia/video session, satellite workshops, and
the Young Researchers Forum, a setting for students and postdocs to present
their research. This award will provide travel funding for students and post-
doctoral fellows to participate at SOCG and CG Week as well as general support
for CG Week activities. Participation by members of underrepresented groups will
be encouraged.
