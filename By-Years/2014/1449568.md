Non-technical Abstract: This award to CUNY City College supports research, done
under the Partnerships for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) program,
on vapor-liquid and gas-liquid systems, as well as granular and colloidal
materials. The partnership with the University of Chicago leverages strengths of
each institution, coupling theoretical and experimental tools in a useful way.
In addition to producing research, this partnership has been successful at
moving minority students into the STEM work force. Funds in this award will be
used to continue graduate student stipends, and to continue undergraduate and
REU student support.

Technical Abstract: Dynamics associated with heterogeneous materials, which are
controlled by multiple forces, is poorly understood. The difficulty is that
interactions involve a range of length scales, from single molecules in
condensation processes to colloidal patterns in granular materials. This lack of
understanding hinders the development of many applications, such as inkjet
printers and coating systems. The work funded here couples experimental,
theoretical and simulation tools to help understand the controlling forces at a
fundamental level.
