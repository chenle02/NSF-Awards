A basic security concern inherent to outsourced computating services is
guaranteeing the integrity of the information received from the cloud. The
concern relates both to outsourced data storage and to the results of outsourced
computations. There are several aspects to this problem like ensuring software
correctness, protecting against intentional deviation and shortcuts, maintaining
data provenance, and guaranteeing results of distributed computation from
mutually distrusted sources. Moreover, it is not enough to provide separate
guarantees on each axis, solutions to these concerns must
compose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concentrates on the design of
mechanisms that enable clients to verify the correctness of the results of
outsourced computations, authenticity and provenance of remotely stored data,
and the combination of the two. Particular emphasis is given to mechanisms that
provide composable security guarantees, where one can combine the security
properties of several individual mechanisms to a joint, holistic security
guarantee, and furthermore make informed and meaningful tradeoffs between
performance and verifiability. These new abilities are bound to greatly enhance
the acceptance and usefulness of cloud computing, and in particular open it up
to new classes of applications and markets.
