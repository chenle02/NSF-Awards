One of the basic problems in dynamical systems, a mathematical structure that
models systems such as planetary motion, is to understand what predictions can
be made about the evolution of the system in the distant future, and by doing so
describe the dynamical properties of the system. A natural way to study
dynamical systems is via a coding mechanism, creating a simplified model for a
potentially complicated system. The principal investigator will study a series
of related problems aimed at understanding how various measurements of
complexity of the system relate to its dynamical properties, combining dynamical
methods with algebraic and combinatorial, or counting, techniques to study these
questions. Along with the research goals of obtaining a deeper understanding of
the connections among these fields, the principal investigator will continue
work on broadening the cohort of researchers working in these areas. Efforts in
this direction include organization of conferences, with numerous meetings aimed
at early-career researchers in dynamics, continuation of mentoring programs
aimed at diversifying the workforce, and directing undergraduate and graduate
students in research.

The research carried out consists of the principal investigator building on
past results to study topological and ergodic properties of symbolic systems.
One series of questions is on their automorphism groups, a way to capture the
symmetries of the system, exploring the complicated group structure that arises
for more complicated systems and the constraints on the group structure that
arise in simpler systems. A second area of focus is on the measurable properties
of symbolic systems, studying how the simplex of invariant measures depends on
various notions of complexity. The third focus is on higher dimensional systems,
relating the complexity of configurations to the dynamical properties of the
systems, and the fourth area is the study of nilpotent structures in recurrence
and convergence problems.
