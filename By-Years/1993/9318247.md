9318247 Jones This research is aimed at determining the molecular mechanisms
underlying the phenomenon of development of a larval caterpillar form into the
winged, adult moth. The maintenance of a larval form, and the suppression of
adult form, is due to the maintenance of a high titer of juvenile hormone during
the larval stage. The molecular mechanism by which a high titer of juvenile
hormone causes suppression of genes associated with the adult form is not well
understood. It is the objective of the present grant research to determine the
mechanisms, using as a model system the suppression of expression of hexamerin
genes by juvenile hormone. In this proposed research, we will analyze the
regulatory promoter DNA associated with the hexamerin genes for the presence of
proteins that bind to the DNA in a JH- sensitive manner. By various tests,
including gel mobility shift analysis, DNA footprinting and cell transfection
assay with wild type and mutant sequences, we will narrow down to and identify
the particular DNA bases to which the regulatory proteins bind. ***
