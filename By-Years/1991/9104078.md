This project is concerned with the development, analysis and implementation of
a robust, globally convergent, Nonsmooth Equation Based, Successive Quadratic
Programming (NE/SQP) method for solving the finite-dimensional variational
inequality, nonlinear complementarily and nonlinear programming problems. The
method is an iterative descent algorithm that is based on a common reformulation
of these three important classes of mathematical programs as a system of
nonsmooth equations, to which an extension/modification of the classical Gauss-
Newton method for smooth equations is applied. Some preliminary convergence
results have been established, and computational experience with previous global
non-smooth Newton methods suggests that the new and improved NE/SQP method could
become a major practical tool for solving various kinds of systems engineering
and economics equilibrium problems, as well as for a variety of optimization
problems arising from diverse disciplines in science and engineering.
