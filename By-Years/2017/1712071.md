This award partially supports the Geosciences Graduate Research Grants program
managed by the Geological Society of America (GSA). The primary role of this
program is to provide partial support for graduate students to complete Master's
and Doctoral thesis research. Grants are intended to provide partial support of
their research project, not to sustain the entire cost. Since the amount of
money requested for grants usually exceeds the amount available, applications
are evaluated on a competitive basis. Applications are evaluated on the basis of
the scientific merits of the problems, the capability of the investigator, and
reasonableness of the budget. Grants are awarded only to individuals;
institutions, societies, and universities are not eligible. GSA strongly
encourages women, members of under-represented groups in Geosciences, and
persons with disabilities to participate fully in this grants
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The management and implementation of the program
takes advantage of online resources; thus, the application, review, and
submission of progress reports are done electronically. The applications are
reviewed by a committee of 31 members that covers the range of disciplinary
expertise represented in the applications. GSA will be partnering with
organizations that support under represented students to promote this funding
opportunity to members of these organizations.
