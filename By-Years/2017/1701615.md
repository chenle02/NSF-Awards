The IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Symposium is a top-tier venue for cybersecurity
and privacy research, and has been for much of its 36-plus-year history. Student
attendance at S&amp;P is an important part of graduate education in
cybersecurity. The 2017 Symposium will consist of approximately 60 technical
papers and Systematization of Knowledge papers, which provide valuable
background to students who are learning the literature.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to encourage
participation in this IEEE Symposium and its Student Program Committee by
students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection
include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by
coursework and/or project experience. Organizers encourage participation of
women and students from other under-represented groups.
