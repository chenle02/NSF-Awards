To better understand how the brain functions, scientists are in search of new
methods to activate specific neurons in laboratory animals without restricting
their behaviors. This research effort will create technologies that rely on
magnetic fields to stimulate specific, genetically modified neurons. A major
advantage of this "magnetogenetic" technology is fact that magnetic fields
easily penetrate bone, skin and tissue making it easier for scientists to probe
the role of specific cells deep within the body without using any implanted
devices that could otherwise interfere with normal animal behavior or cause
damage to the target tissue. Better understanding of how the brain works in
laboratory animals will help reveal fundamental principles of computation in the
brain that may apply across animal species to include humans. This deeper
understanding of the brain is key for developing better diagnosis and treatments
for neural disorders and to improve artificial systems like neural networks
designed to operate like the human brain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will
focus on understanding how biogenic magnetic nanoparticles tethered to
temperature sensitive ion channels render specific cells sensitive to magnetic
fields. The major goals of this effort will be the development of a
comprehensive theory for the mechanism of action for these magnetogenetic
channels, and the creation of a set of transgenic fly lines that display robust
behavioral responses to magnetic fields. These magnetogenetic fly lines will be
compatible with Gal4/UAS system such that magnetogenetic channels can be easily
targeted to specific cells. The outcome of this work will be both a fundamental
understanding of magnetogenetic mechanisms and a set of transgenic fly strains
that will empower researchers to probe neural circuits in this common model
organism.
