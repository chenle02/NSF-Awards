The NAS study on the proposed National Ecological Observatory
Network&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An award has been made to the National Academy of
Sciences (NAS) to appoint an ad hoc NRC committee to evaluate which important
issues in ecology can only be addressed on a regional or continental scale and
whether these issues constitute national concerns. The committee will then
examine the concept for the National Science Foundation's (NSF) proposed
National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and assess whether NEON's
national network of field and laboratory research infrastructure is an
appropriate and necessary means to address these large-scale questions. The
committee will also assess the impact that NEON may have on the scientific
community and on the next generation of scientists. A report will be produced
for broad distribution.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The report will have enormous
impact on the ecological community because infrastructural availability
influences the type, timescale and geographic scale of research that can be
conducted. Therefore, input will be solicited from the ecological community and
the wide scientific community via a web-based forum. The type and scale of
research that can be conducted, in turn, has broad societal impact as it affects
whether ecological issues of national concerns could be addressed. &lt;br/&gt;
