This research endeavors to explore uses of Markov chains, focusing on
applications in statistical physics and computer science. Markov chains are used
in these disciplines to study features of a combinatorial set by allowing (1)
the sampling of configurations and (2) estimating the set's cardinality. In
statistical physics such sets arise as models of simple physical systems, where
the configurations typically represent arrangements of molecules in the system.
Sampling provides insight into the thermodynamic properties of the system, such
as the specific heat and free energy. Recently in computer science, several new
techniques have been developed for proving that certain classes of Markov chains
are rapidly mixing. In fact, there has been considerable success with algorithms
for precisely the types of problems arising from physical models. This project
represents three new ways of continuing this research in directions which will
be beneficial to both fields. (1) Develop provably efficient algorithms for
other combinatorial problems. Two problems of interest are: (a) k-coloring,
which arises in the Potts model for antiferromagnetism, and the Ice model, and
(b) Hamiltonian cycles on lattice regions and hypercubes, which has applications
in cryptography (for encrypting images and generating random Gray code) and
biophysics (for studying compact conformations of polymers). (2) Design sampling
algorithms for finite lattice regions which will give insight into the
corresponding problems in infinite lattices (i.e., the continuum limit). (3)
Develop decomposition techniques for bounding the mixing rate of Markov chains
and study applications using "`simulated tempering." Finally, this
interdisciplinary research will be complemented by the design of new courses
which focus on (and encourage projects related to) recent research results and
through the organization of workshops and seminars which bring together
scientists from the relevant disciplines.
