9707406 Brown This project will continue the experimental studies in the
Chihuahuan Desert near Portal, Arizona. The 20-ha study site contains 24 fenced
plots, each 0.25 ha in area. The investigators have maintained the removal of
some or all species of rodents and/or ants from 10 plots continuously since 1977
and from an additional 10 plots since 1988. Standardized censuses of rodents,
ants, and plants provide invaluable data on responses of individuals,
populations, and communities both to experimental perturbations and to
background temporal and spatial variation in the environment. Results to date
demonstrate: 1) reorganization of the entire ecosystem, including large
increases in woody vegetation and extinction, colonizations, or shifts in
abundance of many animal species, apparently caused by a change in climate since
the late 1970's; 2) complex seasonal and interannual dynamics of rodent, ant,
and plant populations; 3) direct effects of seed predation by rodents, birds,
and ants which substantially alter species composition of winter annual plants
but leave overall population density and species diversity unchanged; 4) direct
effects of competition by kangaroo rats on population densities and species
diversity of other seed-eating rodent species; and 5) indirect effects of
kangaroo rats on vegetation (summer active grasses), other rodents, birds, and
lizards. This project will continue the experimental manipulations and
standardized censuses of rodents, ants, and plants. In addition, the
investigators will: 1) analyze the relationship between local abundance, spatial
distribution, and temporal distribution of annual and woody plants, rodents, and
ants; 2) investigate the relationships between species composition and ecosystem
processes; and 3) assess the interacting influences of climate, livestock
grazing, and fire on the transition between desert shrubland and arid grassland.
