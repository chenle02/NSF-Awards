9318891 Taylor The vision of the Center for Light Microscope Imaging
andBiotechnology (CLMIB) is that understanding the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of fundamental biological processes is within reach during the next
decade. This will be made possible by integration of three major tools:
biochemistry, molecular biology/genetics, and optical techniques which allow
exploration of the in vivo dynamics of cell structure and chemistry. The third
of these is the focus of the Center. The Center's strengths are in development
of, a) novel reagents for detecting, measuring and manipulating the chemical and
molecular components of cells, b) new and integrated modalities of light
microscopy to detect and measure temporal and spatial changes in cell structure
and chemistry, and c) advanced computing methods to record, analyze, display and
model complex imaging data. Technique and instrument development is driven by
the needs of biological research to answer basic questions in cell and
developmental biology, and by emerging applications in biotechnology. The
Center's research and training activities are organized into programs in Cell
Biology, Developmental Biology, Applied Biotechnology, Fluorescence-Based
Reagents, Machine-Vision Microscopy, 3-D Microscopy, Advanced Image Analysis,
and Automated Interactive Microscopy. Twenty-five faculty from 6 departments and
26 graduate students from 7 departments are now working on research projects
that involve collaborations between biologists, chemists, physicists, engineers
and computer scientists. Direct or indirect support from the Center has resulted
in 162 publications. A new interdisciplinary course, Applications of
Fluorescence Spectroscopy in Biological Research, was initiated, and a
biotechnology training laboratory is being constructed for this and related
courses. Other knowledge transfer activities include organizing two conferences,
supporting a general-use imaging laboratory for outside researchers, and cr
eating a scientist exchange program with industrial collaborators. Transfer of
technology occurs through interactions with 14 corporations that license the
Center's technology and/or collaborate on research projects. These corporations
include multi-nationals such as Dupont, Kodak, Carl Zeiss and Procter and
Gamble, as well as biotechnology start-ups such as Biological Detection Systems,
One-Cell Systems and Cadus Pharmaceuticals. Two new corporations have already
been formed in Western Pennsylvania based on technology transfer from the STC.
Two patents have issued from Center research, 4 patents have been submitted, and
27 disclosures have been submitted to the University. The STC is involved in two
major K-12 outreach projects: a) a group of high school students and teachers
worked with the Center for 6 weeks in the summer in a program called "Careers in
Applied Science and Technology (CAST), and b) the Center is collaborating with
the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh and the Studio of Creative Inquiry at
Carnegie Mellon University to produce a planetarium show called "Journey to the
Center of the Cell". This project will use advanced visualization technologies,
based on work in the Center, to educate the general public, particularly young
students, about scientific discovery and the biology of the living cell.***
