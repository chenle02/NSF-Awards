0128975&lt;br/&gt;Moloney&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Jerome Moloney and
students from the University of Arizona in a collaboration with Wulfhard Lange
of the Department of Applied Physics at the University of Muenster, Germany. The
aim of the international project is to make a systematic study of the spatio-
temporal dynamics of technologically vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers
(VSCEL) devices. The effort will bring a leading experimental group in Germany
together with the US group whose expertise is in modeling and simulation. The US
group has established a unique capability to calculate from first principles the
full many-body microscopic optical response of a great variety of semiconductor
quantum well materials. These simulation tools will be extended to the study of
VCSEL structures in order to investigate, among other phenomena, the role of
oxidation layers and their geometry in controlling current spreading and
diffractive spreading in very small and large aperture VCSELs. The international
team makes a powerful joint theory and experimental program that will
significantly impact a critical emerging technology sector. The work plan
provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the international
travel and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
