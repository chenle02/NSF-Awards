Wireless broadband technology is now a vital part of our daily lives and plays a
crucial role in industrial competitiveness. Thus, ensuring an efficient
relocation of spectrums to meet the exploding demands will be an important
public policy agenda for years to come. To achieve this objective, there have
been significant innovations in market design such as simultaneous ascending
auctions, package auctions, and incentive auctions. Nevertheless, the
information about the public policy issue and market design algorithms are not
yet widely available and the lack of information creates barriers in education,
research, public awareness, and policy formation. The PI and the development
team will leverage their multi-disciplinary and cross-domain expertise in
economics and computer science to address these challenges.

The goals of this project are to provide: 1) a software that implements
prototypes of major spectrum allocation algorithms, 2) detailed information
about their definition, theoretical properties, empirical application, and
experimental results, 3) tutorials and lesson plans for the spectrum allocation
policy and the role of public policy, 4) case studies of spectrum allocation
policies in the US, Europe, and Asia describing the application of economic
theory, data analysis, and policy decisions, and 5) experimental and theoretical
studies of the spectrum allocation mechanism employing the software.

In the short term, this project will enable educators to develop courses for the
spectrum allocation policy and market designs, students to actually work with
these mechanisms, researchers in labs and in the field to conduct experiments
and simulate auction outcomes, and policy makers to understand current best
practices in the spectrum policy. In the long term, the outcomes of this
research will improve public awareness of the spectrum policy.
