This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Dr.
Wesley G. Bentrude at the University of Utah. The investigation will result in
an improved understanding of the fundamental processes involved in reactions of
organic phosphorus compounds. The experiments to be carried out by Dr. Bentrude
will focus on photochemical and free radical reactions of both tricovalent and
pentacovalent organophosphorus derivatives. Efforts will be aimed at gaining a
new understanding of the reactions of intact tetracovalent phosphoranyl
radicals. Spectroscopic and product studies will be employed to define the
scope, mechanism, and structure-reactivity patterns of reactions in which these
radicals lead to structurally novel products.
