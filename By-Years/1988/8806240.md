Several of the major nitrogen metabolic pathways are impacted by activities of
the arginine biosynthetic pathway. In plants, little is known regarding the
metabolic regulation of arginine biosynthesis. Similarly, mechanisms regulating
the activity of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), the enzyme that catalyzes the
first committed step in the arginine biosynthetic pathway, are unknown. The
dynamics of nitrogen allocation to the arginine, pyrimidine nucleotide and
polyamine biosynthetic pathways will be investigated under different
physiological conditions, using radiolabeled precursors and specific inhibitors
of these pathways. These experiments will be carried out in two model systems
(tobacco transformed with the nopaline synthase containing Ti plasmid pGV3850
and osmotically-stressed oat leaf) in which high rates of arginine utilization
in the tissue would be expected to support elevated arginine pathway and OTC
activities.%%% Nitrogen metabolism in plants is affected when the plant is
stressed. This project investigates the pathway of polyamine biosynthesis and
how it is regulated during stress. This will lead to a better understanding of
the changes taking place in the plant. Interventions will be possible to protect
plant productivity.***//
