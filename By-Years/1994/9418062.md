9418062 Hodges This project will conduct mapping and geochronological studies of
the Annapurna Range in central Nepal, where the processes of coeval shortening
and extension occur within a convergent plate boundary setting. The extensional
and strike slip faults are thought to work along with erosion to compensate for
the extreme topographic gradients that would be produced by crustal shortening
alone. Previous work has shown that there are miultiple generations of
shortening and extesional structures in the Annapurna Range. This project will
provide a reliable map of these structures, and obtain precise ages and
pressure/temperature histories of the movement episodes. The results will give a
better understanding of the relationship between thermal and tectonic processes
in dynamically compensated orogenic regions, and will be applicable to orogenic
belts worldwide.
