An increased understanding of processes allowing one species to "invade" the
area occupied by another will help answer fundamental questions in ecology. Just
as importantly, a predictive understanding of biological invasion should
increase our capacity to respond effectively to alien species that increasingly
impose economic problems on agriculture and threaten native biodiversity across
North America. Ecologists recognize that biological invasion often depends on
the way invaders are initially clustered, but most available models poorly
approximate consequences of these spatial patterns. Our research applies
nucleation theory, developed in physics, to the invader-clustering problem.
Physicists originally developed nucleation theory to explain a variety of
process, such as crystallization in solids, the formation of snowflakes or
hailstones in the atmosphere, and growth of magnetic domains in certain
materials. Each such process begins with one or more small "nuclei," which may
disappear or grow, depending on the environment in which they form. We apply the
theory to predict when spatial clusters of an invading biological species will
disappear, or when clusters will grow, combine and alter the native ecological
community. Conducting the research will further allow us to introduce questions
in biology to physics students, and to train biology students in quantitative
methods.
