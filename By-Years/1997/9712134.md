9712134 Kroll The diverse structural forms observed, for example, in lipid-
water phases are characteristic of those found in many amphiphilic mixtures.
These structures consist of interfaces, or membranes, which divide the material
into distinct volumes. Such two-dimensional assemblies can form a large variety
of thermodynamic phases, such as closed vesicles, lamellar or cubic crystals,
and disordered bicontinuous networks. They also determine the architecture of
biological systems. The objectives of this project are to obtain a better
understanding of (i) the equilibrium thermodynamics, structure, and phase
behavior of membranes and other macromolecular assemblies, and, (ii) the
dynamics of complex liquids and the dynamical behavior of polymers and membranes
in solvent. Both simulation and analytic techniques will be used. An essential
component of this research will be to develop and implement new algorithms for
the numerical simulation of the equilibrium and non- equilibrium dynamics of
these systems. %%% This project will employ advanced computational techniques
and theoretical analysis to study complex fluids. The systems to be studied are
comprised of materials like water and fatty acids. These systems form all sorts
of complex structures which are not well understood. They present a significant
challenge to the researcher. These systems also form the basis for biological
materials which make up many life forms. ***
