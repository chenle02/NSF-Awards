The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Biosurfaces is a
National Science Foundation sponsored consortium that develops new ideas into
new technologies, particularly in manufacturing strategies for biotechnology,
using a demonstrated successful model of collaboration between universities and
the private sector.

The Center's research has its strategic focus in biotechnology, biomaterials,
and bioengineering, with rigorous milestones and independent evaluation. The
topical area - biosurfaces - makes connections between particular disciplines
that historically have not been linked at universities, federal labs, or
industrial research laboratories.
