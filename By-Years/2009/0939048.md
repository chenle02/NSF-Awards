0939048&lt;br/&gt;Vainrub&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research
investigates the hitherto unknown fundamental characteristics of electrostatic
DNA hybridization. Namely; the yield, kinetic rates, ability to denature long
DNA and to support a sufficient number of hybridization cycles, in order to
establish conditions for efficient PCR amplification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
specific aims are to: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Construct a fluorescent detector
for hybridization and extension of electrode tethered primers.&lt;br/&gt;An
evanescent wave fluorescent real-time detector will be built to measure the
kinetics and yield&lt;br/&gt;of denaturation, annealing, and extension stages in
solid-phase PCR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Prove-in-principle and optimize
electrostatic isothermal PCR. Linear and exponential&lt;br/&gt;amplification
will be demonstrated in real-time PCR mode using oligonucleotide
templates.&lt;br/&gt;Efficient electrostatic pulse cycles and optimal surface
and solution conditions will be defined.&lt;br/&gt;Amplification protocols will
be developed.&lt;br/&gt;
