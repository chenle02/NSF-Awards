The PI proposes to study the record of the cosmogenic and atmospheric 14C in
air samples that have been trapped in the ice core recovered from the summit of
the Greenland ice sheet by the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2). The
abundance of 14C in the GISP2 ice core will be used to determine the atmospheric
chemistry at the site for the past 30,000 years and to determine the chronology
of climatic changes. Changes in the 14C tracer are an important piece of the
evidence of a changing atmosphere during the transition from full glacial
conditions to the present interglacial period.
