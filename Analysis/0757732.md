This project involves investigations into the global conformal geometry of
Riemannian manifolds and the local quasiconformal geometry of nonsmooth
manifolds. Questions and proposed methods arise from analysis, geometry, and
topology. The main topics are the global rigidity phenomena of mappings
distorting the infinitesimal conformal geometry and natural local
parameterizations of nonsmooth quasiconformal geometries. New methods that go
beyond the range of nonlinear potential theory in the context of global rigidity
questions will be introduced, and new geometric structures on quasiconformal
manifolds will be explored.

Quasiconformal methods give information about the geometrical properties of
spaces simultaneously at all scales. These methods have their roots in complex
analysis and in the geometry of the complex plane. The methods, however, can be
used both in higher dimensions and in spaces where analysis based on traditional
calculus is not available. Mathematical areas of application for these methods
include such subjects as Teichmuller theory, topology and geometry of manifolds,
geometric group theory, nonlinear geometric analysis, and nonsmooth calculus on
manifolds. Quasiconformal mappings have recently begun to play a serious role in
applied areas as well. These include fluid dynamics, elasticity, and even the
analysis of nanostructures. This project focuses on the following fundamental
question: When can a given geometry of a space be understood as a possibly
highly distorted Euclidean geometry?
