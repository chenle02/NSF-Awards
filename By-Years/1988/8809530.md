Hampton University proposes to develop a 5-year plan for an experimental
laboratory for parallel processing and artificial intelligence research. The
faculty of the Computer Science Department will undertake the major
responsibility for developing the five-year plan for building the proposed
facility. In cooperation with faculty in the Mathematics, Physics, and
Engineering Departments, the planned facility will support a wide spectrum of
parallel processing research, from formulation of parallel algorithms to the
design of efficient system software for parallel machines. It will also support
artificial intelligence research that focuses on the development methodologies
and verification of AI software for parallel systems. The planning budget will
support on-campus personnel directly involved in the project, consultants,
travel expenses for advisory services, and important conferences. Hampton
University and AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories will commit in-kind support as a cost
share in the planning study.
