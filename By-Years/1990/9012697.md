In this project, the P.I. will continue operation and expand the scope of the
Data Information Unit (DIU) for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
The DIU provides a means of rapid dissemination of information among WOCE
scientists, and other scientists in the community, both about data sets
collected and to be collected, and about other aspects of management and
organization of WOCE.
