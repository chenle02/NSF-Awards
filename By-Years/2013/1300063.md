Katharine Hunt and Robert Cukier of Michigan State University are supported by
an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to
develop computational tools for determining the forces acting on a fluorescently
labeled protein molecule in an optical field and to examine the possibility of
light-induced changes in the conformations of fluorescently labeled proteins.
Attention focuses on single, labeled molecules in the size regime intermediate
between the small-molecule limit, where dipole-gradient forces predominate, and
the Mie scattering limit, where the forces due to changes in the momenta of
photons scattered by the object are most important. The analysis includes
variations in the polarizability within the labeled protein molecule and
variations in the polarizability with time, as the fluorophore is electronically
excited in response to the optical field. Changes in the forces acting on the
nuclei in the protein molecule are to be incorporated into the molecular
dynamics simulations using the Cukier group's CUKMODY code, to model a solvated,
illuminated leucine zipper protein that is labeled with fluorescein and to model
a modified zipper protein bZIP, which traps DNA.

The theoretical work characterizes the forces acting on biomolecules in laser
fields and the possibility of light-induced changes in the conformations of
proteins labeled with dye molecules. This research is related to current
developments in biomolecular photonics, single-molecule spectroscopy, and the
analysis of biomolecules based on fluorescent labeling.
