This is a request for a Minority Research Planning Grant by Dr. Ogunwole. He
has designed a set of experiments to collect pilot data that he will
subsequently use in preparation of future research proposals. He will focus on
the effect of age and diet on insulin regulation of a key enzyme. That key
enzyme is lipoprotein lipase (LPL) whose activity is important in lipid
metabolism. In addition to dietary fat, he will also look at dietary
carbohydrate and influences of both on LPL activities in fed and fasted rats.
These studies may help shed light on the regulatory role of insulin.
