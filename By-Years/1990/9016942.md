The objective of this research is to measure the vertical component of the
electric field in the atmosphere using a modified radiosonde and field mill
attached to a free balloon. The measurements will serve to verify an alternate
technique using tethered kites by evaluating local meteorological influences
which could affect the conductivity of the air or the apparatus. The
measurements will be conducted on Christmas Island, Republic of Kiribati.
