9411757 Economy This proposal is for research on exploring the fabrication and
mechanical properties of Carbon/Boron Nitride (C/BN). The proposed work focusses
on: a) nature of the liquid crystalline state of borazine oligomers, b)
simplified process of borazine oligomers for advanced composites, c) nature of
C/BN interface, and d) new methodology for preparing borazine. The composites
may have better mechanical properties and the improved oxidation resistance
temperature up to 850C. The proposed research will explore method to prepare
borazine with a cost effective procedure. %%%% Light weight and of better
mechanical and oxidation resistance temperature composites of Carbon/Boron
Nitride will be developed and evaluated in the proposed work. Such composites,
if produced successfully, will be useful in electronic industry and have
potential use in light weight components for high temperature/ mechanical
applications. ***
