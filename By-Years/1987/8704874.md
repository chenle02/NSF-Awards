Parameters derived from spectral analysis of radar signals, viz. their
strength, Doppler shift, and Doppler spread, contain information about winds and
turbulence in the atmosphere. Further statistical analyses of time and spatial
series of these parameters in turn provide information about atmospheric wave
phenomena influenced by gravity, interactions of these waves with winds, and
about their eventual breakdown into small scale chaotic or turbulent motions.
The mechanisms through which radar signals are scattered by turbulence and
optimum techniques for deriving most useful parameters from these signals are
also of significant interest for designing radar experiments. Several middle
atmosphere radar facilities have been constructed in the U.S., Japan, West
Germany, and Scandinavia. We continue to have access to some of these radar
facilities for designing and conducting new experiments, and to data collected
with them. Efforts at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) are directed
towards the statistical signal processing of radar and rawinsonde data tapes,
sophisticated graphical displays of results, interpretation of these results in
terms of fluid wave and turbulence phenomena in the atmosphere, and on
mechanisms of interactions between atmospheric turbulence and the probing radio
waves. It is anticipated that over the next three years about 7-8 MS and 2-3
Ph.D. theses could be supported with the purchase of the data processing and
graphics equipment provided by this grant.
