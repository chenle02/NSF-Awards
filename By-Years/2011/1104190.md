Advanced vehicle control systems are becoming more sophisticated on today's
vehicles for both safety and propulsion. This results in an increasing demand
for highly skilled automotive technicians to maintain and repair these complex
systems. Currently, training for testing and repair of these systems is limited
to manufacturer and dealer channels. A large unmet demand in the secondary
repair market exists. J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College (JSRCC) in
collaboration with City College of San Francisco, Southside Virginia Community
College and James Madison University will develop three courses in advanced
vehicle control systems including laboratory exercises, pilot the courses in
traditional class format, and refine, convert and deliver them in distance
learning format. The project will also provide students with applied research
experience and disseminate the results nationwide.

The broader impacts of this project include developing course and laboratory
materials that can be adopted by other institutions, spurring the training of
advanced vehicle control technologies in two-year schools nationwide, and
addressing the unmet demand for high-tech automotive technicians. The project
plans to host statewide conference to demonstrate the programs and laboratories
in Virginia and California. A national web-based symposium will also be
developed to facilitate the dissemination of the project results. Presentations
will be given in regional and national conferences.
