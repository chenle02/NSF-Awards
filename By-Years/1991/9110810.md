This research studies the role and the performance of multi-level caches in
scalable shared memory multiprocessors. The objectives of this project are: (1)
evaluate and characterize performance of multi-level caches for multiprocessors
as a function of cache parameters, cache coherency protocol, and program
characteristics using trace-driven simulations; (2) evaluate cost-performance
tradeoffs in selecting various multi-level cache configurations for scalable
shared memory architectures using different workload parameters; (3) investigate
and develop trace reduction and sampling techniques to speed up simulations to
study multi-level cache performance in multiprocessors;(4) develop analytical
models to evaluate performance of multi-level caches in scalable architectures;
and (5) investigate what minimal set of characteristic metrics must be measured
to predict multi-level cache performance over a wide range of cache parameters.
