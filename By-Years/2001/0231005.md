Physical chemistry instructional laboratories at colleges and universities in
the United States are in need of modernization. Not only do they lack modern
equipment, but many of the topics in the lecture are not reinforced by the
laboratory component. The problem is largely due to the expense involved in
purchasing spectroscopic equipment such as lasers. In this project we are
developing several laboratory modules which will utilize new generations of blue
and near-UV diode lasers that can serve as low-cost spectroscopy sources for
physical chemistry experiments. The planned modules cover the following topics:
laser Raman spectroscopy, laser light scattering to monitor particle size, laser
ionization of alkali metal atoms, and luminescence decay to measure excited
state life times. Previous experiments that utilize the blue diode lasers which
examine the photoelectric effect, laser-induced fluorescence, and electronic
spectroscopy of argon atoms are also being developed into full modules. The
instructional modules to go along with the equipment are being developed both as
traditional laboratories and inquiry-based activities. Partner institutions will
test the modules as they are developed. A commercial vendor will also be a
partner to develop these experimental modules into low-cost instrumental
packages for those who are unable to build these experiments on their own.
