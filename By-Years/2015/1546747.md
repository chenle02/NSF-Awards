Robotics is undergoing tremendous growth over a wide range of important areas,
from transportation, to manufacturing, entertainment, space exploration, health-
care and education. While the field is progressing forward, both in research
findings and industrial markets, the percentage of female roboticists continues
to lag far behind their male counterparts. This project will strengthen the
presence of women in robotics by organizing "RSS 2015 Workshop on Women in
Robotics" and partially defraying the cost of women to attend. The workshop will
be held at the Robot Science and Systems (RSS) conference on July 16th in Rome,
Italy.
