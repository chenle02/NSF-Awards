This award will support collaborative research between Dr. C. Russell Hille,
Ohio State University and Dr. Robert F. Anderson, Gray Laboratory, Mount Vernon
Hospital, Middlesex, England. The investigators will carry out a study of the
oxidation-reduction behavior of milk xanthine oxidase, a well-defined enzyme of
importance in metabolism. Xanthine oxidase contains four sites capable of
reversibly accepting reducing equivalents during catalytic turnover. A total of
six reducing equivalents are required to fully reduce all these centers. The
enzyme thus provides an excellent opportunity to examine the principles
governing biological electron transfer as a system in which the sites are held
at a fixed distance and orientation to one another, within a more or less rigid
polypeptide matrix. The principle technique to be used in this work is pulse
radiolysis, a technique whose utility in studying biochemical oxidation-
reduction problems is not widely appreciated. It is anticipated that the results
of this work will have implications beyond xanthine oxidase alone, and will
prove relevant to other more complex systems, such as those occurring in the
mitochondrion and chloroplast. The demonstration of the general suitability of
pulse radiolysis in the study of intra-and interprotein electron transfer would
provide the field with a powerful new technique for the study of these
fundamental biological processes. The British collaborator is a recognized
expert in pulse radiolysis and has a long standing interest in the application
of pulse radiolysis to the study of electron transfer processes in biologically
important molecules. The project will also benefit from state-of-the art pulse
radiolysis facilities available at the Gray Laboratory. Dr. Hille's expertise is
in oxidation-reduction enzymology and enzyme kinetics.
