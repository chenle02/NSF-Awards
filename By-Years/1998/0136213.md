This proposal will field a multi-method study of gender disparities in response
to household economic crises (e.g., illness, floods, unemployment) among poor
households in Lucknow, India. Survey data will be collected in four waves over a
two and a half year panel design in order to obtain before and after measures of
responses to crises. Household assets and decision making power will be
evaluated at each wave. Qualitative data will be collected at the beginning and
end of the field work. Household and individual-level data will be supplemented
by community level focus groups exploring the key risk factors and community
resources available to respond to those risks. Individual assets within the
household are expected to be a determinant of who suffers most from crises, but
gender differences are also expected to play an independent role.
