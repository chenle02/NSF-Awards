This project aims to synthesize certain ideas coming from two rather distinct
subjects in geometry and topology: persistent homology, which was created as a
tool for studying the topological structure of data sets; and symplectic Floer
theory, which concerns certain properties of the geometric transformations
("Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms") that underlie classical mechanics. Despite their
different origins, it has recently been appreciated that persistent homology and
symplectic Floer theory share key algebraic structures, and the time is ripe to
exploit these parallels and apply the insights gained during the separate
developments of these two subjects over the last several years in order to learn
more about each of them. In particular, methods from persistent homology will
make it possible to prove new results about a natural geometry on the group of
Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms and about the relationships between the fixed points
of different Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms.

The starting point for this work will be recent results that adapted the
construction of "barcodes" from persistent homology to the context of Floer
theory over Novikov fields by using a novel approach involving non-Archimedean
singular value decompositions, and proved a version of the Bottleneck Stability
Theorem for these new barcodes. Building on this algebraic foundation, the
investigator expects to express and generalize the notion of extended
persistence in a way that allows one to streamline arguments involving action
windows in Floer theory; among other things this may lead to new proofs of
Conley conjecture-type results and generalizations of recent work on autonomous
Hamiltonians. The project will also study the properties of certain symplectic
capacities built from filtered Floer-theoretic invariants, leading to new
relations between lower bounds for the Hofer norm and the properties of periodic
orbits of Hamiltonian systems.
