9307411 Sorooshian Advances in radar spatial resolution and rain gage technology
have been found inadequate for flash flood forecasting raising questions about
the reliability of existing warning systems. This project will addressed the
hydrometeorological issues relevant to the flash flood phenomena, particularly
as it pertains to the relationship between rainfall and water shed
characteristics, and the resulting flooding. The work will develop a
quantitative understanding of rainfall characteristics pertinent to rainfall-
runoff forecasting; will evaluate the space- time resolution of rainfall
sensors, both radar and gage, on rainfall-runoff simulations; will improve
understanding of how hydrologic characteristics that can cause flooding; and
will increase the knowledge on how the requirements for minimum spatial
resolution of rainfall data varies regionally, and with storm and watershed
characteristics. The advances in knowledge will benefit flash flood mitigating
efforts which every year causes substantive life and economic losses. ***
