Over a three year period, TERC and the University of California, Santa Barbara
will collaborate with leaders of highly-acclaimed mathematics staff development
programs for elementary teachers to infuse a thoughtful, well-integrated
emphasis on gender equity into these programs. Materials for these projects will
be revised, and new workshop sessions focusing on equity will be created.
Project Results: 1. A new emphasis on gender equity being incorporated into the
most visible and well-attended reform math workshops in the country. 2. For
staff developers and workshop leaders, an increased understanding of ways of
incorporating equity issues into workshop discussions and activities. 3. The
development of new workshop sessions on topics such as "gender, technology, and
math reform" as extensions, supplements, follow-ups or "replacement units" for
collaborators to add to their existing workshops. 4. For the over 13, 600
elementary teachers attending match workshops each summer, an increased
awareness of how to make equity a central focus of their work with reform math.
