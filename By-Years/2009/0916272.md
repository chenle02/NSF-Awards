The proliferation of camera-enabled consumer items, like cellular phones,
wearable computers, and domestic robots, has introduced moving cameras, in
staggering numbers, into everyday life. These cameras record our social
environment, where people engage in different activities and objects like
vehicles or bicycles are in motion. State-of-the-art structure from motion
algorithms cannot reliably reconstruct these types of scenes. The overarching
focus of this work is to develop the theory and practice required to robustly
reconstruct a dynamic scene from one moving camera or simultaneously from
several moving cameras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this, the PI is
developing a theory of imaging in dynamic scenes. A useful ?device? for
analyzing dynamic scenes is to visualize them as constructs in spacetime,
analogous to static structures in space. Much of the progress in multi-view
geometry in static scenes has centered on the development of tensors that embody
the relative positions of cameras in space. The dimensional analogue is being
used to define corresponding analogues for multi-view geometry in dynamic
scenes. A goal in this work is to derive geometric relationships within a system
of independently moving cameras. To reconstruct unconstrained dynamic scenes,
factorization approaches are being extended to spacetime to simultaneously
reconstruct nonrigid structure from multiple moving cameras.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algorithms that result from this research create the
space for a host of new technologies in several industries such as autonomous
vehicle navigation, distributed visual surveillance, aerial video monitoring and
indexing, cellphone interface, urban navigation, coordination and planning for
autonomous robots, and human-computer interface.&lt;br/&gt;
