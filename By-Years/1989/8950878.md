In this project, students at West Florida University are introduced to
electrochemical equipment capable of preforming coulometry, ac, dc, and pulse
voltammetry, and other electrochemical techniques. The equipment is used in five
undergraduate courses covering biochemistry, analytical, inorganic, organic, and
physical chemistry. This equipment is also used for undergraduate research and
will be used to help launch a new laboratory course in polymer chemistry.
Sophomore, junior, and senior students study the properties, structure, and
reactions of a variety of compounds using electrochemical analysis as a probe.
The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
