This award provides travel support for undergraduate student participation in
the Symposium on Undergraduate Research. This Symposium will be held at the
annual meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Laser Science (DLS),
in conjunction with the annual Frontiers in Optics (FiO) meeting of Optica. The
conference program includes many of the research topics central to Atomic,
Molecular, and Optical Physics. The support of students through this award makes
a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists.
Students who graduate with a background in laser science acquire a broad range
of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas
of science and technology.

The meeting is scheduled to be held in Tacoma, WA on October 9 2023. It offers
an opportunity for undergraduate students to present their research results and
to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also
the broader international community. Support is provided only for US students
(students enrolled in US universities).

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
