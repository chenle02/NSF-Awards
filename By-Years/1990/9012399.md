This project involves the application of Glymour's "bootstrapping" account of
evidential relevance to a methodological controversy in cognitive
neuropsychology. The controversy centers on an influential claim by Caramazza
that brain-damaged performance can provide relevant evidence for models of
cognition only in the form of single-case studies. If this claim is true, then
group studies of brain-damaged performance--in particular, all studies based on
the classical syndrome categories (such as Broca's aphasia, Wernicke's aphasia,
conduction aphasia, etc.)--are worthless as confirmatory or disconfirmatory
evidence in constraining rival functional architectures. The primary objective
of this project is twofold: firstly, to clarify the different methodological
roles of single-case versus group studies, as manifested in dissociations in
performance, double dissociations, and associations of deficits (the typical
operational elements in cognitive neuropsychology), on the basis of a
bootstrapping account of evidential relevance; and secondly, to evaluate
bootstrapping relative to other accounts of evidential relevance--for example,
the hypothetico-deductive account and the Bayesian account--in terms of the
detailed working out of this application. The long-term aim is a complete
analysis of the logic of testing models of cognition, as an aspect of the
general theory construction in the sciences.
