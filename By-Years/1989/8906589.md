It is proposed to develop 1) microprobes suitable for measuring local
concentration profiles in immobilized cell layers, 2) a stable, flow-
insensitive, steam-sterilizable dissolved oxygen sensor, and 3) microminiature
electromechanical valves and pumps by making use of microcircuit fabrication
technology. The proposed microprobes for measuring microenvironmental conditions
in the immediate vicinity of the immobilized cells are expected to significantly
expand the scope of research with immobilized cell processes. The proposed DO
sensor will be particularly useful for monitoring dissolved oxygen in mammalian
cell cultures and in immobilized cell reactors where sufficient medium flow
cannot be provided. The proposed microelectromechanical valves and pumps will be
essential for developing sophisticated instruments on a silicon wafer, which can
be mass produced for a variety of applications. To carry out the proposed
research successfully, a diffusion furnace system capable of oxidation of
silicon wafers and chemical vapor deposition is requested.
