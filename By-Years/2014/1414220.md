This award provides support for the 27th Cumberland Conference on Combinatorics,
Graph Theory and Computing, to be held during May 16-17, 2014, at West Virginia
University. The conference will feature several one-hour invited talks and a
number of contributed talks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic objective of the
conference is to bring together researchers with expertise in graph theory,
combinatorics and computer science in order to make advances in these areas. The
conference will give both junior and senior researchers opportunities to present
their own new results in combinatorics and computer science, and to work
collaboratively on unsolved problems. The majority of the funds will be targeted
for travel and accommodation support for students, post-docs and under-
represented groups.
