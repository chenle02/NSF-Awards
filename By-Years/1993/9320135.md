CTS-9320135 University of Texas at Austin William J. Koros ABSTRACT The
objective of this SGER project is the organization and development of a National
Separations Summer School for new faculty in chemical engineering. A trend in
hiring new engineering professors in nontraditional emerging areas coupled with
industrial restructuring including massive early retirement programs threatens
the transfer of fundamental knowledge and skill as well as the infrastructure in
the chemical industry sector. With a scope spanning from traditional separation
methods to new technologies, the course should prepare faculty to be more
effective instructors in separations and should stimulate their active
participation in the field with new research directions. FLW K PSFONTS K !
