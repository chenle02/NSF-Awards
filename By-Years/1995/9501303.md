9501303 Dwyer This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
significantly improve hyphenated Liquid Chromatography/Infrared (LC/IR)
Spectroscopy technology for use in polymer characterization. This methodology
provides a marked advance over conventional chromatography/IR spectroscopic
analytic methods. Phase I research successfully developed a prototype for a wide
variety of polymer applications. The Phase II research plan is divided into four
parts: (1) define limits of the system, including quantitative analysis, and
examination of artifacts; (2) expand the list of applications: test additional
copolymer systems, as well as blends and alloys; (3) modify system design to
provide automated multi-sample analysis; and (4) develop 3D/IR software to link
with commercial chromatography software packages, and to provide additional
modes of data analysis. The combined capacity of the hardware/software
represents a quantum advance in capability for polymer characterization. The
results of this study will expand the commercial market to polymer scientists
working on a wide range of applications from research to manufacturing and
quality control.
