The Limpopo Province in southern Africa is a high-grade metamorphic belt that
represents the exhumed root of a continent- continent collision zone. Granite-
greenstone terranes of the Zimbabwe Province, to the north, and Kaapvaal
Province to the south, flank the Limpopo Province. On the Kaapvaal craton, the
Witwatersrand Supergroup is interpreted as a foreland-basin fill, representing
the sedimentary response to collisional events in the Limpopo orogeny. A
sedimentary succession of comparable lateral extent, thickness, and lithology to
the Witwatersrand Supergroup is not present in the Zimbabwe Craton adjacent to
the northern marginal zone of the Limpopo Province. Instead, five local and
lithologically distinct stratigraphic successions of different age are present
in the greenstone belts. At least four of these successions, developed in the
lower and upper greenstones, are of comparable age to the Witwatersrand
Supergroup. The absence of a Witwatersrand equivalent in Zimbabwe raises several
important questions regarding the evolution of the southern African Archean in
specific, and Archean tectonics and sedimentation patterns in general: 1) What
are the detailed characteristics of two of the 3.0-2.7 Ga Zimbabwean basins,
including source-area composition, source-area age, source-area location,
sediment dispersal patterns, depositional environments, basin configuration,
basin evolution, and tectonic setting? 2) What was the genetic relationship of
the Zimbabwe sedimentary basins with respect to the evolution of the Limpopo
orogeny? 3) Was the Limpopo orogeny of Pyrenean or Himalayan type? A
multidisciplinary approach, involving detailed field mapping, structural
analysis, sedimentologic-stratigraphic analysis, and geochemistry, will be
applied to two of the stratigraphic successions to address the above questions.
