Roland J. Benabou New York University SBR-9601319 This research seeks to explain
the following set of facts with one economic model: 1) countries vary widely in
their redistributive policies, 2) higher levels of income inequality are
associated with lower subsequent growth rates, 3) there is no relationship
between inequality and the share of transfers in GDP and 4) transfers appear to
be positively associated with subsequent growth. The emphasis of the research
will be primarily theoretical, as opposed to empirical. It will seek to explain
the above set of facts without making overly restrictive assumptions about
individuals' behavior. The principal investigator will also look at technology
adoption as a response to heterogeneity in workers' skills, the hypothesis being
that heterogeneity in workers' skills leads to heterogeneity in technologies and
increased wage inequality.
