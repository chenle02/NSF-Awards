Abstract The Polar Research Board (PRB), a unit of the National Research
Council, was established in 1958 to advise the government on polar issues. The
PRB strives to make research in the polar regions more productive and responsive
to the needs of the United States, to maintain U.S. awareness of and
representation in international science programs, and to enhance understanding
of issues in polar regions. The Board provides national and international
scientific and technical information to U.S. government policy makers and the
polar community, represents U.S. interests in international nongovernmental
polar scientific organizations, and conducts focused studies in areas of polar
science, technology, and resource management. The PRB facilitates participation
of U.S. scientists in two critical international committees dedicated to
planning and coordinating research in the Arctic and Antarctic (i.e., IASC and
SCAR). PRB activities are conducted by a group of volunteer experts, supported
by a small staff, selected from academic institutions, industry, and national
laboratories. The PRB will continue to serve as an information center for
distributing materials on IASC and SCAR to U.S. government agencies and the
polar community. Other federal agencies and foundations also provide support to
the PRB.
