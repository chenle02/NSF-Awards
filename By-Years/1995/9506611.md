9506611 Layne This grant will continue funding of the UNM/SNL Ion Microprobe
Facility, a joint venture of Sandia National; Laboratories and the University of
New Mexico's Institute of Meteoritics, begun in July 1992. The facility has
historically provided 20 hours/week of analytical time to NSF funded
investigations in the earth sciences. The time allotted to NSF supported
researchers will now be increased to 30 hours/week. More than 19 separate
analytical packages for trace element and isotopic analysis of natural and
experimental materials have been developed at this facility and since the
inception of the current NSF facility support grant in July 1993, an aggressive
program of preventative maintenance and instrumental improvements has resulted
in greater than 93% of scheduled analytical time running successfully. Future
technical development efforts will place particular emphasis on extending the
facilities current strengths and PI's interests in the areas of i) stable
isotope ratio analysis, ii) trace element analysis in rock forming silicates,
silicate glasses and carbonates, and iii) trace element imaging techniques. ***
