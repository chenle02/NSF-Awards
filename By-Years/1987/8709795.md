The proposed research is to establish a class of polynomially bounded algorithms
for solving convex programming problems efficiently. The work is to focus on
classical barrier methods, such as the Sequential Unconstrained Minimization
Technique (SUMT) and it's variants. Specifically, " Projective SUMT " is one
such variant that is derived from the barrier function method by utilizing the
differential equation characterizing the trajectory of unconstrained minimizers.
The assumptions for convergence of these barrier-type methods are considerably
weaker than those proposed by Karmarkar. The concept of factorable functions wil
be used in the analysis of running time. Representation of a function as
factorable enables the automatic calculation of higher order derivatives, and
can be useful for encoding the data and function calculations. The running time
also depends upon the time required to solve a system of equations with respect
to the Hessian of the suitable factorable barrier function, the solution of an
approximate step-size problem, and the number of iterations required to find the
solution to prescribed accuracy. These issues will be explored in the research.
