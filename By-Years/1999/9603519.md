We propose to integrate sample injection, capillary electrophoresis and NMR
(Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) detection on a single silicon substrate using MEMS
(MicroElectroMechanical Systems) fabrication techniques. The integration and
micro scale dimensions (100 micron wide flow channel, 100 micron diameter NMR
coil) of the system will provide increased separation efficiency , decreased
sample volumes (nanoliters), and increased NMR detection coil sensitivity. Most
importantly, the precise geometrical control and material choices afforded by
using MEMS fabrication techniques will allow optimization of running time, limit
of detection and NMR spectral linewidth. The design, fabrication and testing of
the prototype system will demonstrate proof of concept and leading to the
development of a family of integrated analytical instruments based on micro NMR
detection.
