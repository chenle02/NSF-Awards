Research on Learning Technologies: Teacher Researcher Collaboration in
Scientific Modeling: The High School Science Virtual Machine Laboratory Boston
University has been awarded $858,545 to establish over 3 years an approach to
high school science education by allowing students to model and visualize
physical, chemical and biological phenomena of increasing complexity. The
project will take advantage of two advances in technology: One is the emergence
of JAVA, a platform independent language that enables transmission of
applications over the WEB to run locally on any platform. The other is the
existence of public domain versions of distributed parallel computing operating
systems. One such system, PVM, will be used and modified to enable students to
use many computers in a school as a larger parallel computer. The tools and
applications will be used by the researchers and teams of high school teachers
to develop education-oriented modeling programs that do not sacrifice needed
functionality or sophistication.
