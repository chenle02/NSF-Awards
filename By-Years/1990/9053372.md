Students are discovering the concepts and ideas of calculus by exploration and
experimentation in a revitalized calculus course, called Calculus & Mathematica,
that combines the concept of calculus as a laboratory science with correct
mathematical foundations. The classroom/laboratory is equipped with Macintosh
computers and the text materials are presented via the Notebook feature of
Mathematica.
