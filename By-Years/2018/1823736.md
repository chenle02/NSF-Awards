The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in providing
a design-driven robotics framework encompassing a low-cost, modular robot
hardware kit, a software app for motion design, and a web-based Computer-Aided
Design (CAD) environment to enable students, makers, hobbyists, and industry
practitioners to innovate and invent robots and machines. The framework brings
together computational thinking, design process, and programming to meet STEM
imperatives and provide compelling value propositions for both the education and
prototyping industry. The proposed robotics framework has the potential to fill
2.5 million unfilled jobs in STEM and positively impact the U.S. educational
robotics market, which is expected to grow to $2.7 billion by
2021.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project leverages the latest research in
mechanism synthesis area to create novel algorithms for designing motions of
planar linkage mechanisms. Planar linkage mechanisms are rigid bodies connected
to one another using rotating or sliding joints and their special configurations
give rise to desired motion. Their implementation in a mobile app provides users
an ability to synthesize and simulate mechanisms for robots and machines. While,
the robot hardware kit employs inexpensively produced novel planar and compliant
pieces to create a new method of interconnection to realize three-dimensional
geometry and mechanisms of robots and structures, the web-based CAD tool would
allow users to design customized robot parts. The flexibility of the design
allows for the use of any programming platform and any readily available sensors
and actuators thereby dramatically broadening the inventions design
capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
