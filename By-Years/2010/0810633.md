This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project seeks to
create the first social community for e-learning, enabling professionals and
amateurs to generate, distribute, and share more effective e-learning
experiences through collaboration and social interaction. The application is
focused on higher education. The community will include students, faculty and
alumni engaged in peer-to-peer tutoring relationships, providing and consuming
supplementary instruction in the form of user-generated tutorials. Specifically
this SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept using
a pilot deployment with a major institution, using a range of rubrics to
evaluate the technology, user experience, and market viability. The research
project will combine both theory and practice in a seamless user-friendly
environment that will empower the individual user to learn, create and share
their knowledge.

The e-learning market is facing disruptive change from so-called Web 2.0 social
communities. According to leading market analysts, the supply chain is rooted in
old business practices and unable to meet the needs of the new buyers.
Significant technical and business innovation is required to introduce user-
generated content into this market, while maintaining quality of materials and
cognitive principles of e-learning software design. The outcome of the research
project will provide a platform to accomplish this change, creating a peer-to-
peer learning community that will generate a diversity of learning materials to
provide individualized learning experiences to its members. Leveraging the
wisdom of crowds, the platform will enable students, faculty and alumni to
engage in a national conversation focused on learning, creating and sharing a
range and quantity of e-learning materials that has not been feasible till now.
This will have significant and sustained impact on education.
