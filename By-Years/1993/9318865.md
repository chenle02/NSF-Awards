9318865 Mast Eastern Mennonite College requests support from NSF for connection
of its campus network to VERnet. VERnet is the midlevel network located in the
state of Virginia. VERnet will provide operations management and information
services and it will give Eastern Mennonite College connection to the NSFNET, a
high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The
college needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
