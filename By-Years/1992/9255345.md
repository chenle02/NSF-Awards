This project, sponsored by Texas A&M University, will provide stipends for 15
high school teachers to do summer research with the Principal Investigators of
NSF sponsored research projects. Each teacher will spend eight weeks on the
research projects which include the fields of Chemistry, Biology, Physics,
Geosciences and Engineering. In addition each week the teachers will attend
seminars where teachers will share their experiences, plan for classroom
implementation and learn of recent innovative concepts and programs in science
teaching.
