This 8-week summer residential Young Scholars Program will emphasize research
participation in the life sciences, biochemistry, physiological psychology, and
some earth sciences such as paleontology. To provide a broad perspective and a
background for their research participation, special advanced coursework will be
provided during the mornings of the first four weeks with research participation
in the afternoons. The last four weeks will be devoted to full-time research
participation with occasional seminars in the evening. The coursework will
include: lectures and discussions covering selected topics in modern cellular,
molecular, evolutionary and developmental biology and biochemistry; readings and
discussions of great experiments in biology and biochemistry; and guest lectures
by research scientists. Research participation will involve the student as a
junior member of a research team engaged in on-going research, sometimes on a
joint project with members of the team and sometimes on an independent facet of
a problem. At the end of the program, the participants will submit a written
paper and will give oral presentations on their research at a two-day simulated
professional meeting.
