In this project the principal investigator and his students will work on a
number of problems in complex variable theory centered around the distribution
of values of complex functions. In particular, they will study the ramification
and value- distribution properties of quasi-regular mappings, the exceptional
set in the Gross star theorem and in Plessner's theorem, and the error term in
the Nevanlinna theory. In addition, the principal investigator and his students
will explore the application of some of this work to problems in differential
equations and complex iteration. The area of complex variable theory has had a
long and distinguished history, and the principal investigator is one of the
leaders in the subarea of complex variable theory concerned with the
distribution of the values of complex functions. In this project the principal
investigator will work with graduate students to extend our knowledge of the
value-distribution properties of various classes of functions that arise as
solutions of differential equations in the complex plane.
