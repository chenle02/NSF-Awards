This project will conduct paleontological and geological surveys of western
Ethiopia in order to prospect for deposits that contain the remains of fossil
primates, mammals, lower vertebrates, and plants that are of critical importance
for reconstructing the history of primate and human evolution in Africa.
Ethiopia is well known for its rich fossil record that documents the early
history of hominid evolution, but all of this fossil evidence is restricted to
the Ethiopian Rift Valley in the east-central to southern portion of the
country. Here we will focus efforts in western Ethiopia, an area that has never
before been examined for fossil bearing deposits. Sediments and volcanic rocks
dating from about one to over 40 million years in age are known to occur in this
region, and it is likely that these sediments contain fossils. This is a
critical period of time for primate and human evolution. Likely areas for
focusing the field efforts will be determined by remote sensing using thematic
mapping with satellite imagery. Field work will concentrate on these areas for
prospecting and recovering fossils, and detailing the geological history of the
region.
