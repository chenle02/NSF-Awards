This research investigates the cooling ability of grinding fluids for both
conventional and creep feed grinding conditions. The objective is to analyze the
convective heat transfer occurring at the workpiece surface, and ultimately to
predict the fraction of the total grinding energy which remains in the
workpiece, and the workpiece temperature. This experimental effort will address
four measurements: temperatures within the workpiece and at its surface, the
change in temperature of the grinding fluid, the grinding forces, and the
grinding wheel topography. This research, combined with a parallel modeling
effort in another grant will permit a basic understanding of the thermal aspects
of grinding. Grinding accounts for about 20 percent of the machining
expenditures in the United States, and is consequently of great industrial
importance. Energy generated during grinding may cause thermal damage the
workpiece and wheel. To avoid this, grinding fluids are often used, but their
effects are not well understood. The overall objective of the proposal is to
investigate the cooling ability of grinding fluids for both conventional and
creep feed grinding conditions so that a predictive model can be developed.
