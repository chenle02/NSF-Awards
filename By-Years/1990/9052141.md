Colgate University is providing students with an opportunity to examine the
nervous system at the biochemical level. The project is having an impact on the
Neuroscience curriculum on two levels. First, the project is providing equipment
for a laboratory section that enables juniors and seniors to learn basic
biochemical methodology. The students isolate and characterize subcellular
fractions from central nervous system tissue. The fractions are analyzed for
biochemical markers (enzymatic activity), by SDS- polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and immunoblots, and for lipids. At the second level, the
students are designing senior thesis projects that address problems at the
biochemical level utilizing the equipment in the project. Two specialized pieces
of equipment are being used. The first is a system that runs, stains, and
destains SDS-polyacrylamide gels in 1 hr. In addition, transfer of polypetides
to nitrocellulose in preparation for immunoblot analysis is accomplished in 15
min. The second is a spectrophotometer equipped with 6 wells to allow for the
simulataneous acquisition of kinetic data from 6 samples. The project brings to
the Neuroscience curriculum fundamental methods and techniques for the
examination of the biochemical properties of the nervous system. The university
is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
