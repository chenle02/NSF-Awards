The investigator studies models for the unsupervised clustering and hierarchical
organization of objects based on similarity data. The research takes a three-
pronged approach to meeting the objective of scaling the analysis to large data
sets. First the investigator studies powerful latent variable models with
relatively few parameters for analyzing similarity data. Second, the
investigator develops dramatically faster algorithms for fitting the models.
Specifically, the models are fit with combinatorial variants of the EM algorithm
which converge much faster than the conventional EM algorithm. Third, the latent
variable structure of the models are extended hierarchically, leading to
scalable algorithms which hierarchically cluster previously found clusters of
objects. Investigations of this type f latent variable hierarchy lead to models
and algorithms which scale to large data sets much better than traditional flat
models. The similarity analysis in addition extracts out relationships between
clusters, and allows for targeted clustering based on a prior specification of
cluster relationships of interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In this modern data
rich age, there is a pressing need for statistical models which can handle large
data sets. This investigation focuses on the ubiquitous type of relational data
called similarity data, consisting of similarity measurements between pairs of
objects. Examples of data which fit into this framework include internet traffic
between routers, web connectivity data used by search engines, and microarray
gene expression data. There is great interest in finding internet traffic and
web topic clusters as well as functional groupings of genes. The investigator
studies models and algorithms for clustering and organizational analysis of
relational data which can scale to large data sets. The analysis finds
meaningful underlying cluster groups along with structural relationships between
groups. The methodology the investigator develops has widespread applicability
to various disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;
