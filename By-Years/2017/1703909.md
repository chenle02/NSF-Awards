The award provides travel expenses for U.S. researchers to attend the
International Young Scientist Symposium on Catalytic Biomass Conversion (IYCBC)
that will be held at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP), Chinese
Academy of Sciences, China, on July 11-13, 2017. The symposium will provide the
U.S. researchers the opportunity to share research experiences in the biomass
conversion area with peers from Europe and Asia, thus ensuring continued
worldwide competitiveness of U.S. catalytic science and technology in biomass
conversion to fuels and chemicals.

The IYCBC will include topics like preparation and characterization of novel
catalyst materials, conversion of cellulose and lignin model compounds, design
of catalysts and processes, and life-cycle analysis and carbon footprint
tracking for biomass-derived chemicals. The U.S. researchers will be exposed to
the different biomass research and technology practices of their European and
Asian counterparts in an environment that will promote long term collaboration.
Such international collaborations are vital for finding sustainable solutions
for the production of fuels and chemicals via catalytic approaches that have
minimal impact on the environment.
