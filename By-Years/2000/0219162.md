Although the internet's origins lie in computer and communication technology,
control and stability theory have also had a major influence on its development.
After the development of the additive increase, multiplicative decrease
algorithm by Jacobson in 1988, the first significant Active &lt;br/&gt;Queue
Management (AQM) algorithm introduced was Random Early Detection (RED). In RED,
the basic idea is to let the senders know about a high queue occupancy situation
by increasing the &lt;br/&gt;drop probability at the gateways as a linear
function of the time-averaged queue occupancy. Field observations of anomalous
behavior for TCP networks with and without deployment of RED have been made that
show irregular load batching, load oscillations, and high parametric
sensitivity. &lt;br/&gt;Given the heterogeneity of the internet, and the
associated wide variations of parameters, extending the range of stable
operation in parameter space is clearly very important. In this research
program, tools from nonlinear dynamical systems and from bifurcation and chaos
control will be harnessed for the analysis and control of congestion in networks
with one or several bottlenecks with TCP-type and/or UDP-type (User Datagram
Protocol) traffic. The project emphasizes work of a &lt;br/&gt;fundamental
nature to develop an understanding of network congestion dynamics and address
some of the difficult systems issues that are at the heart of the congestion
avoidance and &lt;br/&gt;control problem. The project builds on recent work of
the PI's group on the analysis of nonlinear dynamics in TCP-RED and mixed
traffic networks. The project also leverages past contributions of the PI on
control of nonlinear instabilities (bifurcation control) and on closed-loop
monitoring of the &lt;br/&gt;stability of nonlinear uncertain
systems.&lt;br/&gt;
