Researchers seek to make high-resolution temporal and size distribution
measurements of aerosol composition and size in the Ross Island region, coastal
Antarctica. An Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) will be used to provide
quantitative size and chemical mass loading information, in near real-time of
non-refractory sub-micron aerosol particles such as sulfate, nitrate, chloride,
ammonium, and organic carbon species. Additional measurements will include
aerosol sizing with overlapping size ranges from 20 nm to 100 um, and particle
into liquid sampling for bulk ionic compositional analysis of larger aerosol
particles.

Advantages in continuous AMS monitoring of aerosol include being able to observe
the episodic nature and short duration of new particle nucleation events, thus
capturing the extreme variability of meteorological conditions expected in
maritime Antarctica.

These aerosol measurements are likely to be of interest to other disciplines.
Training of a post-doctoral associate, and research experience for a Polar-TREC
participant are allied broader impacts.
