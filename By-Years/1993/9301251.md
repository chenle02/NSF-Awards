Dr. Paul A. Deck has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Deck's doctoral degree was from the University of Minnesota under
the supervision of Professor Paul Gassman. Dr. Deck will continue research at
Northwestern University under the sponsorship of Professor Tobin Marks. Dr.
Deck's postdoctoral training will provide him with skills in advanced NMR
techniques and x-ray crystallography as he studies new methods for the
preparation of Lewis acidic transition metal and f-element organometallic
complexes and their application to alkene polymerization. Longer term he plans
to investigate ion-pairing and ligand reorganization dynamics in cationic Group
4 metallocene catalysts. %%% The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry
Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden
the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful
careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
