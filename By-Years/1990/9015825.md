Research on GaAs/A1As quantum well structures will be conducted in collaboration
with Dr. Mitra Dutta and her co-workers at U.S. Army Electronic Technology and
Devices Laboratory (ETDL), Fort Monmouth. The program will emphasize study of
GaAs/A1GaAs quantum wells perturbed by the addition of thin A1As barrier at the
center of each well using reflectance and photoluminescence spectroscopies. The
goal is to explore a new method of tuning intersubband transition energies for
FIR detector applications.
