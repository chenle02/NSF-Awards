Semiconductor optoelectronics is becoming increasingly important in science and
engineering. It is therefore highly desirable that engineers and scientists
should be introduced to optoelectronics. Much of the relevant material can and
should be incorporated in undergraduate curricula. The Center for High
Technology Materials at the University of New Mexico, in partnership with Sandia
National Laboratories, will conduct a two-week workshop in semiconductor
optoelectronics for undergraduate teaching faculty in university physics and
engineering departments. The workshop will include lectures, laboratory
tours/demonstrations, and hands-on laboratory sessions in epitaxy of III-V
direct-gap semiconductors, fabrication, processing and characterization of
optoelectronic devices such as semiconductor injection lasers, and applications
such as optical fiber communications. This project aims to facilitate the
inclusion of semiconductor optoelectronics in undergraduate physics and
engineering by developing within faculty a basic knowledge and appreciation of
the subject, providing direct contact with some of the latest experimental and
theoretical advances, and by establishing an ongoing and mutually beneficial
interaction between undergraduate faculty and a national center of excellence in
the field. In addition to the NSF funds, participants' institutions will
contribute about 10% in travel costs toward the operation of the project.
