Award is for a project to install the first operational borehole seismometer in
the deep ocean at the Hawaii-2 Observatory site. ODP Leg 200 drilled and cased a
re-entry hole for this purpose during December 2001. This project will develop
and test an improved seismic sonde, and develop a method and apparatus to lay a
fiber optic cable from the borehole1.5 km to the Hawaii-2 Observatory junction
box, using a deep submergence ROV. In addition, a thermistor string will placed
in a nearby, uncased hole. After installation of the seismometer, it will be
tested and validated by comparison with land-based seismometers and with a
seismometer located on the sea bed at the H2O site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
