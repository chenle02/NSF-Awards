9450870 Potter This Schenectady County Community College project involves the
computerization of the general chemistry laboratory, so that experiments can be
done using computer interfaced instruments and a spreadsheet for data
acquisition and control (LIMSport). A complete revision of the experiments
currently done in the general chemistry laboratory program underway and includes
the development of several new experiments expected to be of interest to others.
The project is designed to: (1) Increase the number of student applications
using instruments interfaced with microcomputers; (2) Improve student
achievement in performance of quantitative experiments; (3) to result in
improved computational and computer skills exhibited by students.
