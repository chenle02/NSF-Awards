Form 10 Abstract AST 96-22697 PI: Thomas Appelquist 1996 Aspen Winter
Astrophysics Conference The 1996 Aspen Winter Astrophysics Conference will be
held during 21-28 January, 1996, on the topic "Black Hole X-Ray Transients". The
rapidly expanding radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma ray data base on these
objects will be presented, along with discussion of the theory of the outburst,
the underlying stellar evolution, and the mechanism of the superluminal radio
jets. This provides a balanced combination of theoretical and experimental
results. Approximately 75 participants are expected. Additional funding is
requested from NASA and DOE.
