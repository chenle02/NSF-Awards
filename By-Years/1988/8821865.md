Dr. Allen W. Cowley, Jr. of the Medical College of Wisconsin will visit Dr. Emil
Monos of Semmelweis Medical University, Hungary, to prepare a cooperative
research project on pressure-induced active responses of vein smooth muscle. The
resulting proposal is intended for consideration under the U.S.-Hungary
Cooperative Science Program and if successful, should contribute to our
knowledge of vascular smooth muscle physiology and the intrinsic behavior of the
systemic veins, particularly myogenic responses.
