Dr. Amy Shachter and other members of the Chemistry Department at Santa Clara
University are being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98, seven
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects in organic, inorganic, biochemistry, and photochemistry.
In addition to individualized research projects, students participate in weekly
research meetings, training sessions in the use of state-of-the-art
instrumentation, and a special ethics program directed by ethicists from the
University's Center for Applied Ethics. The focus is to increase awareness of
ethical concerns in science and to incorporate ethics in the scientific
decision-making process.
