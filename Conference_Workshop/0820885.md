ABSTRACT

Over the last 21 years, the Annual Workshop on Automorphic Forms and Related
Topics has remained a small and friendly conference. Those attending range from
students to new PhD's to well established researchers. For young researchers,
the conference has provided support and encouragement; for accomplished
researchers, it has provided the opportunity to mentor and build networks, as
well as a forum for exchanging ideas. The workshop has become internationally
recognized for both its high-quality research talks and its supportive
atmosphere for junior researchers.

Participants give presentations covering all areas related to automorphic forms,
including Maass wave forms, elliptic curves, Siegel and Jacobi modular forms,
special values of L-functions, random matrices, quadratic forms, computation and
applications of modular forms, etc. These topics are among those at the cutting
edge of current research in number theory, and they have applications in other
fields such as physics, cryptography, and computer science, to name a few.

In addition to research presentations on recent and on-going projects, this
workshop will continue the successful tradition begun in 2003 of featuring
discussion sessions, facilitated/moderated by experts, on numerous topics
germane to junior faculty. In recent years, topics have included ``Where is it
best to publish?", ``How to restart a stalled research program?", ``Encouraging
and retaining women and other under-represented groups in the Number Theory
community'', to name a few. This year, the Workshop will consider the following
topics: "How to start and maintain mathematical collaboration"; and "Where is
research on automorphic forms going?"

These discussions are attended by essentially all the conference participants,
and a written summary of the main points is produced and posted on the
workshop?s website.
