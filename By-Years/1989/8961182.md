This is a study of superplasticity of ceramic coatings produced by ion assisted
deposition, and will determine the utility of such films as ductile overcoats on
metal substrates. Ion assisted deposition combines physical vapor deposition of
an evaporant with low energy oxygen or nitrogen ion bombardment, yielding films
with extraordinary adhesion and anomalously high ductility. This ductility has
been attributed to the extremely small grain size characteristic of ion assisted
deposition. This research seeks to establish film growth conditions which will
consistently deliver superplastic coatings, then to study the utility of these
coatings for enhancing the fracture toughness of metal substrates.
