Bhuyan This project addresses the problem of designing coherent caches for
scalable multiprocessors with shared address spaces. Maintaining cache coherence
in large-scale systems is time consuming due to the lack of sufficient
broadcasting capacity in the interconnection networks. A dynamic cache coherence
protocol is being designed and evaluated to reduce the cache coherence overheads
in large systems. This protocol limits invalidation or update traffic to a
subtree of the interconnection network. The first phase of the project consists
of embedding rooted trees into various networks, and studying the hardware and
timing complexities of directories using the embeddings. In a second phase,
issues such as fault tolerance adaptive routing, and task mapping are being
addressed. The research makes use of analytic techniques and execution driven
simulation.
