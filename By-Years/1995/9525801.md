Abstract ATM-9525801 Curry, Judith A. University of Colorado Title: Impact of
Tropical Ocean Surface Fluxes on the Atmosphere and Upper Ocean: Extensions from
TOGA COARE This is a three project to investigate the heat and water vapor
budgets in the TOGA COARE region in a novel manner by utilizing surface and
remotely sensed satellite measurements and sophisticated one dimensional air sea
interaction model and atmospheric radiative transfer model. The maintenance of
the warm pool is the central problem of TOGA COARE and the heat and water
budgets are critical to understand this. Therefore this work is highly relevant
to TOGA COARE and climate issues. The specific goals to be achieved are: 1)
Determine cloud characteristics and radiation fluxes by examining aircraft and
atmospheric soundings, 2) Extend satellite flux analysis to the entire Pacific
Ocean and 3) Complete gridded surface flux analysis for TOGA COARE IOP.
