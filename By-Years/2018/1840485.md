The 2018 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC), currently
celebrating its 34th year, is a top-tier academic security conference that
averages about 250-300 highly skilled security professional and student
attendees per year. ACSAC regularly brings together the foremost minds in
academic, governmental and commercial computer security to address the most
pressing problems in applied computer security, as well as discuss seminal works
in information security. In addition to the technical papers, the conference
program will include keynotes by distinguished speakers, tutorials, case
studies, panels, a poster session, and works-in-progress talks. This year's Hard
Topic Theme is Big Data for Security. Attendees also have the opportunity to
participate in affiliated workshops on various topics in security. This project
provides travel support for 10-15 students and thus helps build the next
generation of cybersecurity professionals by facilitating interaction of
students with experts in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
