9528429 Martin Monodisperse conductive polymer nanowires and tubules can be
prepared by synthesizing the desired polymer within the pores of nanoporous
filtration membranes. The primary objective of this proposal is to use the
template method to investigate the effects of molecular and supermolecular
structure on electronic conduction in conductive polymers. Specifically,
measurements of the temperature and pressure dependence of conductivity, the
field dependence of conductivity, and the temperature and pressure dependence of
the magnetoresistence, photoconductivity, and Hall effect will be used to
explore how structure affects hopping distance, localization length, and density
of states at the Fermi level in template-synthesized electronically conductive
polymers. %%% The largest impediment to a thorough understanding of electronic
conduction in conductive polymers is the inability to prepare samples whose
properties can be reproducibly and predictably controlled. Template-synthesis
allows for this type of structural control and thus provides a unique
opportunity to explore the fundamentals of electronic conduction in these
materials. ***
