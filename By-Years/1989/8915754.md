Supernovae (SN) are the most energetic known stellar explosions. They occur in
the end stages of evolution of stars with masses 8 times or more greater than
that of the sun. The energy of the explosions comes from the collapse of the
progenitor stars' cores. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to continue
with his current NSF-funded SN research. In particular, he will focus on
evolutionary studies of single and double star systems that lead to explosive
endpoints, the initiation of thermonuclear explosions, the physical
characteristics of expanding SN ejecta, and the progenitor evolution and
explosion of SN 1987A. The work will be carried out in collaboration with
Research Associate Harkness and Postdoc Swartz, plus two graduate students.
