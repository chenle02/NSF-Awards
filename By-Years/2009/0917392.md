Web applications are prevalent and enable much of today's
online&lt;br/&gt;business including banking, shopping, university admissions,
and various&lt;br/&gt;governmental activities. However, the quality of such
applications is&lt;br/&gt;usually low, and they are increasingly popular targets
for attack. This&lt;br/&gt;project aims at developing practical testing and
analysis mechanisms and&lt;br/&gt;tools to secure web applications. In
particular, it focuses on&lt;br/&gt;developing novel, principled techniques to
address the following&lt;br/&gt;research issues: (1) how to formalize security
threats in web&lt;br/&gt;applications; (2) how to provide runtime security for
deployed&lt;br/&gt;applications via dynamic monitoring; and (3) how to provide
static&lt;br/&gt;security enforcement during application development and
testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is interdisciplinary, touching upon a
number of requisite&lt;br/&gt;areas including computer security, software
engineering, and programming&lt;br/&gt;languages. It has the potential to
advance knowledge in each of these&lt;br/&gt;disciplines with novel formulations
of security requirements, systems&lt;br/&gt;concepts, and advanced testing and
analysis techniques. The project&lt;br/&gt;also has the potential for
significant industrial and societal impact.&lt;br/&gt;Through the proposed
research, education, and outreach activities, the&lt;br/&gt;project will empower
web application developers with the knowledge,&lt;br/&gt;methodologies, and
development tools to build secure web&lt;br/&gt;applications. Testing and
analysis tools developed in the project will&lt;br/&gt;also be distributed to
other institutions and the industry for teaching,&lt;br/&gt;research, and
experimental evaluation.
