This award will permit the acquisition of an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass
Spectrometer (ICP-MS) to enhance research activities, hands-on education, and
analytical training. Acquisition of a modern ICP-MS with superior analytical
capabilities will enhance the research resources for the rapidly increasing
student population at Montclair State University (undergraduate population
&gt;60% women and &gt;20% minorities). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ICP-MS will be
shared by interdisciplinary research programs in the College of Science and
Mathematics, College of Education and Human Services (CEHS), and the College of
Humanities and Social Sciences (CHSS). The faculty of the College of Science and
Mathematics actively involve undergraduate and graduate students in their field-
based and laboratory-based research programs, which take place across the United
Sates, South American, Europe, Asia, and Antarctica. Projects that will benefit
from this instrument include contaminant identification and environmental
remediation, petrology and volcanology studies, climate studies based on soil
and sediment chemistry, water quality studies, food quality and food security
studies, and archeological investigations that track building materials through
their elemental fingerprints.
