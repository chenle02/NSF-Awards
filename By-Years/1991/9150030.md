The State of South Dakota proposes a Statewide Systemic Initiative to improve
mathematics and science education. After thorough study of the literature and
examination of exemplary programs in science and mathematics throughout the
country, a state-wide group will establish standards and desired outcomes for
mathematics and science education in South Dakota, using as guidelines the
recommendations of NCTM, MSEB, AAAS, and others. School districts will be given
assistance and incentives to analyze their curricula and devise methods for
raising their programs to meet the new state standards. Valid new methods of
assessing student learning will be developed and implemented. Both teacher
preparation and teacher enhancement will be strengthened to encourage teaching
for understanding and utilizing hands-on methods. The initiative will stress
increased citizen awareness of the importance of mathematics and science and
promote the involvement of parents, business, and mathematicians and scientists
with the schools. Cost Sharing: 50%.
