The research component involves case-based reasoning (CBR) a technique that
stores and later applies cases of known problems and their solutions to solve
new problems. Since few stored cases will exactly match a new problem, most
cases will be related at best by analogy to the new one. In that case, it is
necessary first to retrieve an appropriate analogous case, check to see that it
matches the new problem in some essential ways, then adapt it to the new problem
in such a way as to infer a solution. In storing and using cases, it is
necessary to do some abstraction, either at the time that they are stored away
for later use or at the time retrieved, to avoid having to store large numbers
of very similar but slightly different cases. This project examines the
advantages of developing a hierarchy of abstraction for each stored case, a
technique called "stratified CBR". The stratified CBR technique will be applied
to a typical search task (route planning), two configuration tasks (artifact
design and goal-directed activity planning), and an analytical task (legal
reasoning), in order to test hypotheses about the superiority of the stratified
CBR technique and to gain experience in using the technique. During the period
of the grant, an educational plan will be developed that exposes students to the
insights, perspectives, and tools of AI by (1) educating undergraduates about
AI's basic methods and concepts and about AI's philosophical, social, and
cognitive consequences, and (2) educating graduate students in other fields
about the AI techniques and tools applicable to their fields.
