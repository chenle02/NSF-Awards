9412771 Johnston Research will be carried out at LAMPF into the flavor changing
probability for neutrinos produced in various pion decay modes. An active
detector based on 200 tons of liquid scintillator will be used to detect
reaction products following inverse beta-decay on protons in the scintillator.
Limits set on the cross section for this and related processes will set new
limits, improved by at least an order of magnitude over existing limits, on the
neutrino mass differences between different flavor neutrinos. Research in
electroproduction of hypernuclei will be carried out at CEBAF, focusing on the
lambda(hyperon)-nucleon effective interaction. A specialized spectrometer will
be developed for tagging the virtual photon which initiates the reaction. ***
