9505799 Tanner The Department of Statistics at Northwestern University will
purchase an HP PA-RISC 7200 high-end server, three HP-PA 715/100 workstations
and appropriate statistical software (SPLUS and IMSL) which will be dedicated to
the support of the project "Instrumentation for Parametric and Semiparametric
Modeling of Continuous and Discrete Data". The equipment will be used to address
the computing needs of several interactive research projects: "Likelihood-Based
Estimation in Semiparametric Models" (Project PI: Tom Severini), "Conditional
Log-linear Models for Longitudinal Studies" (Project PI: Shelby Haberman),
"Bayesian Learning in Mixtures-of-Experts and Hierarchical Mixtures-of-Experts
Architectures" (Project PI: Martin A. Tanner) and "NonLinear Partial Least
Squares Using Neural Networks" (Project PI: Ajit C. Tamhane).
