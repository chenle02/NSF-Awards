In this project the PI will conduct preliminary research on how different
methods of voting and aggregating knowledge from members of a group may
influence the performance of the group in terms of the accuracy of the group's
judgment, level of consensus reached, and the group's confidence in their
judgment. Common methods used to make decisions in group setting involve simple
voting or opinion averaging schemes. The PI intends to examine more
sophisticated `influence allocation processes` in which information about the
abilities and levels of expertise of different group members are taken into
account in reaching decisions.
