The Department of Mathematics at St. Olaf College plans to integrate symbolic,
numerical, and graphical computing tools into all courses in its mathematics
curriculum via an electronic blackboard. Department faculty will develop course
materials, software, and documentation. Four classrooms will be equipped with a
micro computer and large screen projector. With well developed software tools
and the means for using them in a classroom, the lecturers will communicate a
more accurate picture of the nature of mathematics and its ideas. The Department
has been in the forefront in the development of materials for and in the use of
symbolic manipulators in calculus curriculum. The grantee is providing in equal
sum obtained from non- federal sources.
