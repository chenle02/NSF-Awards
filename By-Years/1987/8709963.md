The PI has organized the first workshop on applying Artificial Intelligence (AI)
to problems in process engineering. Very few researchers are currently engaged
in this area primarily due to lack of exposure to topics of potential research
interest. The workshop will be attended by both industrial and academic
participants and it is hoped that research issues of importance are identified
and disseminated to the community via published proceedings and a report in AI
Magazine. Funding is recommended at $5,200 out of FY87 funds to be divided as
follows: $2,600 from the Process and Reaction Engineering Program $2,600 from
the Computer-Integrated Engineering Program.
