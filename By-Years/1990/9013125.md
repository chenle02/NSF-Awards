This program focuses on the major aerosol species that are found in the marine
atmosphere: nss-SO4=, from anthropogenic sources and biological sources in the
ocean; MSA (methanesulfonate), form DMS (dimethyl sulfide) derived from oceanic
sources; NO3-, from anthropogenic sources, lightning and the stratosphere; NH4+,
from continental and oceanic sources; Na+, from sea salts. We also study (with
the University of Rhode Island) the mineral species present in the atmosphere in
this region. The major objective is to characterize the distribution of these
species over the ocean and to understand the factors that control their
concentration; the sources of the species and their temporal and areal
variability; the transport paths through the atmosphere and the removal to the
ocean.
