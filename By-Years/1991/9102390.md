Long and Medium-Term Research: Study of Proton Dynamics of Petrovskite Protonic
Conductors This award is under the Program for Long-&amp; Medium Term Research
at Foreign Centers of Excellence, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to
conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at research centers of proven
excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and
the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research
visit by Dr. Tracey Scherban of Columbia University with Dr. Michel Kleitz,
Director, Laboratoire d'Ionique et d'Electrochimie du Solide de Grenoble. The
researchers plan to use techniques of quasi-elastic neutron scattering and Raman
spectroscopy to characterize the protonic conductivity of the acceptor-doped
perovskite oxides, KTaO3 and SrCeO3. They will also investigate the behavior of
the materials as fuel cell electrolytes and as components in electrochromic
devices. The award recommendation provides funds to cover international travel,
local travel abroad, and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S.
home institution.
