This project generally aims to reassess the iconic Devils Hole, Nevada record of
climate and hydrology as it is one of the longest continuous records of
terrestrial climate change available to researchers. The Devils Hole record has
stimulated a quarter of a century of debate with regard to implications about
the causes of regional and global climate change and its relationship, or lack
thereof, to orbital forcing. The researchers and their collaborators have
collected preliminary data that suggests that specific critical portions of this
record have anomalous ages, which, if corrected, would change the interpretation
of the record dramatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The anomalies are associated
with samples collected at significant depth below the water table. Those
collected near the surface do not appear to have anomalous ages. The research
team proposes to test for these anomalies by analyzing cores collected at
different depths and obtain a record with an accurate chronology from the
shallowest of the cores. They further propose to extend the record back in time
to cover the past one million years and increase the resolution of the record
substantially. The research team also plans to construct a record of
fluctuations in the ground water table at Devils Hole. Although there are many
subtleties to the scientific discussion, the crux of the debate is the degree to
which orbital forcing may have played a role in the observed environmental
changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts include helping to better
understand the factors that control climate and rainfall in a region where water
resources are critical, mentoring a postdoctoral research scholar, and the
production of a film on cave climate science featuring underwater research at
Devils Hole.
