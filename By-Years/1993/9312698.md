9312698 Tsui Robust Design is an important method for improving product or
manufacturing process design by making the output response insensitive (robust)
to hard-to-control variations (noise). In analyzing robust design experiments,
Taguchi (1986) proposed a two- step procedure to identify the "optimal" factor
settings that minimize the average quadratic loss. His two-step procedure
becomes very effective in practice since it reduces the dimension of the design
optimization problem and it does not require re- optimization for future changes
of the target value. This research will develop improved statistical methods for
analyzing robust design experiments. The researchers develop a multi-step
analysis procedure for a variety of robust design problems. Their new procedure
substantially reduces the dimension of the design optimization problem and does
not require reoptimizaton for future changes of design requirements. This
produces savings in the development time of product and manufacturing process
design and allows for flexible manufacturing. The procedure also helps engineers
better understand the physical mechanism of the product and process and allows
the designer to make tradeoffs among the off-target bias and the individual
process variances contributed by different noise factors. The research also
identifies the appropriate robust design objectives and establishes their
relationships with the quality loss functions for various robust design
problems. They will strategies for implementing the multi-step procedure for
smaller- the-better and larger-the-better problems as well as for the problems
with several responses.
