9633326 Laub Standard approaches to measuring the condition of various problems
in control theory, such as solving an algebraic Riccati equation (ARE), compress
all sensitivity information into a single condition number. Thus, a loss of
information can occur in situations in which this standard condition number does
not accurately reflect the actual sensitivity of a solution or particular
entries of a solution. In this project we shall investigate a new method that
overcomes these and other common deficiencies. The new procedure measures the
effects on the solution of small random changes in the input data and, by
properly scaling the results, obtains condition estimates for each entry of a
computed solution. This approach, which is referred to as small-sample
statistical condition estimation (SCE), applies to both linear and nonlinear
problems. In the former case (for example, when solving a system of linear
equations or a linear least squares problem), an explicit Frechet derivative of
the computed quantity is available. Thus the method is especially efficient and,
in fact, costs no more than standard normwise or componentwise estimates. Even
in the nonlinear case (for example, solving AREs), considerable efficiencies are
gained when iterative improvement by, say, Newton's method is available. SCE
also has the advantage of considerable flexibility. For example, it easily
accommodates restrictions on, or structure associated with, allowable
perturbations. The method has a rigorous statistical theory available for the
probability of accuracy of the condition estimates. Finally,it is emphasized
that SCE lends itself readily to straightforward implementation into many
existing computer- aided control system design software packages. ***
