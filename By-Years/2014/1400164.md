This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award will
play an important role in making the alternative energy source that harnesses
the power of ocean waves economically viable. The ultimate goal is to make wave
energy a reliable and cost-effective source of large-scale, grid-quality, clean
power. Mathematical optimization models and techniques will be developed and
used to design so-called wave farms. In addition, the wave energy conversion
(WEC) devices that constitute these wave farms can be connected via sensor
networks, which allows dynamic operation of the WECs, allowing for solutions
that are not only cost-effective but also robust with respect to changes in the
sea environment. The academic/industry partnership between Lehigh University and
Ocean Power Technologies (OPT) will give the research strong potential to be
applied in practice, helping the U.S. take the lead in research and
implementation of wave energy conversion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main
objective of this award is to develop novel optimization models and algorithms
for designing and operating arrays of WEC devices. The investigators will
advance the state of the art in modeling and optimizing strategic problems in
the layout of arrays of WECs (also known as wave farms). The project will
consider both deterministic sea environments (for which there are still many
open questions) and stochastic wave environments (which will initiate a new body
of research). Models and algorithms to optimize the locations of WECs within a
wave farm array, which can have a significant impact on the total power of the
farm due to the hydrodynamic interactions among the WECs, will be developed. A
second goal of the project is to optimize the types and locations of sensors
that collect data on waves and forecast the actual waveforms at the WECs, thus
improving the control of the WECs. The research team will develop models and
algorithms for maximum-likelihood estimation of wave realizations as a function
of sensor system design, and then optimize the design itself with respect to the
types and locations of sensors.
