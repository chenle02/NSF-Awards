The Association for Institutional Research (AIR) proposes a two-year
continuation of a program that has increased the capacity of the postsecondary
education community to use nationally representative sample surveys and other
National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Center for Education Statistics
(NCES) datasets, thereby improving the quality of information underlying
decision making in postsecondary education, and the effectiveness of those
decisions. The proposed program has three components that will 1) support new
research initiatives, 2) support dissemination of findings, and 3) provide face-
to-face training in the use of national databases. These components are targeted
to institutional researchers, faculty, and doctoral students who conduct
research about American postsecondary education including trends in science,
technology, engineering, and math (STEM)- and who use national data to inform
campus and national higher education practices.
