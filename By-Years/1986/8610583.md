A workshop will be held to assess the current research on nonlinear optical
materials, to identify limitations imposed by current technology and by
fundamental physical principles, and to make recommendations. The group of
experts invited are in the forefront of the field and consider the workshop most
timely. A mixture of lightwave-oriented investigators as well as materials
-oriented investigators brings a balance which should make for enthusiastic
discussion and a well-rounded important workshop. Representation from numerous
agencies will add an important perspective.
