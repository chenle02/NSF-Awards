This award will support collaborative research between Professor J. Ophir of the
University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and Dr. D.E. Robinson of
the Commonwealth Department of Health, Sydney, Australia. The investigators will
develop techniques for estimating the speed of sound in living bodies,
particularly in the human liver, and will join, in this work, the independent
efforts that have been under way for some time in Houston and in Sydney. The
collaboration will involve the sharing of knowledge derived from simulations,
and phantom and in vitro tissue studies at the University of Texas; and of
information obtained from clinical results in Sydney. The U.S. investigators
will benefit from the experience of their Australian counterparts in the
implementation of clinical apparatus, and the Australians will in turn benefit
from the experience of the U.S. investigators with a complementary beam tracking
measurement method. This study could advance the ability to diagnose liver
disease, and certain other organic diseases, using ultrasound.
