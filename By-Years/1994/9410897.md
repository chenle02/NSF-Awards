9410897 Saberi Almost every physical system has maximum and minimum limits or
otherwise called saturation on its control signal or actuator. The task of
designing feedback laws for linear systems with saturating inputs is very
complex and challenging. Perhaps due to this complexity, the effect of
saturation of actuators has been ignored in most of the modern control
literature. This proposal seeks to develop both the analysis and design tools
for systems with saturating actuators. Our initial work shows that a semi-global
framework is a natural and desirable framework for the design of such systems.
Our recent effort also indicates the emergence of powerful techniques for
designing systems with saturating actuators. This proposal focuses on some of
the central and fundamental control problems for systems with saturating
actuators. Among the many problems which must be confronted are: robust semi-
global stabilization, robust semi-global disturbance rejection and semi-global
output regulation and tracking. ***
