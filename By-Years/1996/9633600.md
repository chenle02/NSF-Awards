9633600 Zink Under the Planning Grant Guidelines The Invention Factory Science
Center (IFSC) develop "The Invention Factory Science Center Phase One Plan".
This new science center is the central component of mixed-use redevelopment
effort at the 45-acre Roebling Industrial complex in Trenton, New Jersey. Phase
One includes the development of a 3200 sq. ft. visitor's center which is
scheduled to open in the Spring of 1997. The IFSC will develop "Pathways to
Science and Technology: An Informal Science Learning System, which is to be an
innovative, interactive computer-based system of activities designed to
stimulate self-directed and continuous learning. It will have a strong
regional/community base, will leverage resources from local academic,
industrial, and educational institutions, and will be disseminated broadly via
state-of-the-art telecommunications technology. The planning activities will
include front-end evaluation of the needs and interests of the community,
meetings of the advisory committee, the development of plans for the
"Pathfinders" software program, and development of plans for the overall
evaluation of the project. t the end of the twelve-month planning period they
will have designs and cost-estimates for the interactive activities and a
general plan for the Visitor center. The value that this planning grant adds to
their effort is support to bring nationally recognized leaders in exhibit
development and informal learning to the planning sessions.
