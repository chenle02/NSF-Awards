This award is for continued research on the development and application of
computational methods for estimating microeconomic decision models. Under the
previous grant the investigator has made significant contributions to the
development of computational methods and has produced several useful
applications. He has also produced several computer programs which have proved
valuable to other researchers working on related issues. The project will pursue
a number of different, but related topics. Among these are: (1) Empirical
applications and software implementation of estimation algorithms for dynamic
choice and equilibrium models; (2) Extending the algorithms to handle continuous
choice variables; (3) The development of algorithms for estimating general
equilibrium models. This research is important because it will contribute to a
deeper understanding of microeconomic decision process, as well as pointing
toward new directions for estimating general equilibrium models.
