9320042 Staman CICNet, a midlevel network supplying high level connectivity to
the universities of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC) (which
includes the universities of Ohio State, Michigan State, University of Michigan,
Indiana University, University of Chicago, Purdue University, University of
Illinois, Northwestern University, University of Wisconsin, University of
Minnesota, and University of Iowa) and establishing cooperative working
agreements with state networks in its region, requests support for a major
initiative of providing ubiquitous access to the Internet. Although the phrase
"rural datafication" has been used to describe this project succinctly, the
primary focus of this project is to extend Internet access and all the services
it provides to under-served constituencies wherever they may be located in rural
and geographically remote areas. The project will focus on three key areas: 1)
selecting and proving standard hardware and software that can handle dial-up and
dedicated, low-speed internet connections; 2) high quality documentation,
training, and associated materials that will reduce the amount of effort and
time to connect participants; and 3) expanding network connections and services
to traditionally difficult to reach and difficult to serve user communities. ***
