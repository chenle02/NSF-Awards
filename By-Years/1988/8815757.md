The major theme of this research is to understand and control atomic structure
and chemical reactivity of semiconductor surfaces, kinetics of reactions
involved in etching, surface preparation and epitaxial deposition of crystalline
semiconductors. The experimental aspects of the work will emphasize
investigation of the structure and structural changes of silicon surfaces
exposed to various reactive chemical environments (e.g., adsorption site
geometries, reconstruction and stabilization of the silicon 100 surface exposed
to halogen atoms). Techniques used in this portion of the work include: low
energy electron diffraction impact collision ion scattering spectroscopy. The
second category of experiments will focus on the thermal reactions that occur on
semiconductor surfaces, measuring the rates and energetics of the reactions. The
influence of surface structure on chemical reactions will be studied using
temperature programmed desorption.
