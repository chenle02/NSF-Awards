9309041 Yager This award will fund research on the use of Raman-based
spectroscopy for use in fiber optic sensing of small molecules, including
anesthetics. Two methods will be evaluated to determine if they can enhance the
Raman signal so that sensing would be possible. The first method will employ
elastomeric absorbents to concentrate small hydrophilic molecules. The second
method will make use of "photon ring" waveguides to produce the illumination.
This study has the potential not only to impact the monitoring of general
anesthetics but also it could prove useful in remote environmental monitoring,
industrial process monitoring, and workspace monitoring. The use of the photon
ring technology to improve the sensitivity of a detector also could have an
impact on the biosensor field. ***
