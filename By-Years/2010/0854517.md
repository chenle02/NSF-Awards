The Eastern Shoshone language, the member of the Uto-Aztecan language family
spoken on the Wind River Indian Reservation in central Wyoming, is on the brink
of extinction, with fewer than 100 fluent speakers remaining. In comparison with
other members of the Uto-Aztecan language family, Eastern Shoshone is under-
documented. The Eastern Shoshone Lexical Database, a project created as a
partnership between the Eastern Shoshone Cultural Center and the American Indian
Studies Program (AIS) at the University of Wyoming (UW), is a two-year research
effort to develop an electronic lexical database by consolidating audio and
transcribed lexical material. Upon completion, materials resulting from this
project will be archived at the American Heritage Center (AHC) at the University
of Wyoming.

This Eastern Shoshone documentation project will be led by the Director of the
American Indian Studies Program at UW and by the Eastern Shoshone Language
Coordinator at the Eastern Shoshone Cultural Center. A panel of five elders, a
linguistic anthropologist, a research assistant and a summer intern will
complete the team. Project staff will extract lexical and linguistic material
from existing textual documents as a starting point for the database.
Approximately 14,000 Eastern Shoshone words, recorded digitally between
2002-2007, will be transcribed and added to the database in both audio and
written formats, along with example phrases and sentences that will be elicited
from the panel of elders during the course of this project. The database will
include digital recordings of words, sample phrases and sentences,
transcriptions of these words, phrases and sentences, English translation, and
descriptive information. This project will create the first lexical database of
Eastern Shoshone. Materials resulting form the project will provide the basis
for the future development of additional language and teaching materials.
