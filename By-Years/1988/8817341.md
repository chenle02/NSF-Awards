Objective of this project is to assess the solubility and relative stability of
chlorite solid solutions at temperature and pressure appropriate to model
accurately the alteration processes in subseafloor hydrothermal systems.
Experiments will be done at temperature and pressure conditions near the
supercritical region for seawater. Fluids will be withdrawn at various stages in
the experiments and analyzed for several dissolved components. The solids and
alteration products will be analyzed using various techniques including
mossbauer spectroscopy. %%% In order to understand alteration processes in
hydrothermal systems, careful laboratory experiments of critical chemical
reactions must be done at temperature and pressure conditions that reflect the
natural environment. Dr. Seyfried has developed sophisticated laboratory
techniques for doing these analyses, including a means for withdrawing small
amounts of fluid for analysis while the experiment is progressing.
