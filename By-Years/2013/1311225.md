Dispersal allows species to persist globally despite local extinctions by
tracking environmental conditions. Reef-building corals are declining worldwide,
largely attributable to global warming. Climate models indicate that existing
coral habitats will continue to deteriorate, suggesting that dispersal to
higher-latitude reefs might allow escape from poor conditions. However, the
question remains if corals possess enough dispersal potential to escape, and can
they evolve to increase their dispersal capabilities? We hypothesize that coral
dispersal potential is a heritable, and therefore evolvable, trait associated
with specific larval energetic profiles, including lipid and protein metabolism
rates reflected in differential expression of metabolic genes. Our research
quantifies the genetic variation in these processes and investigates the
underlying molecular mechanisms that may be the targets of natural selection
under climate change. Establishing the extent to which corals might be able to
avoid the adverse effects of climate change through range shifts will enable
improved predictions of coral persistence and add to our basic understanding of
adaptive evolution in the sea. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides broad
opportunities for public outreach and education. Coral biology is enticing for
undergraduate volunteers and the co-PI has mentored twenty-five undergraduates
from diverse backgrounds. Students learn how to use genetics and bioinformatics
to answer questions of ecology and evolution. This research also involves
students from James Cook University in Australia. Public dissemination of
science is also extensive ranging from public lectures at ?Science Under the
Stars? series to participating in Woman in Science events.
