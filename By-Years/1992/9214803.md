Funded with a Minority Research Initiation Grant (MRI), crystallization rates
for crystalline polymers will be investigated for their sensitivity to flow-
induced effects. The primary interest is in the effect of shear. The study will
explore the relationship between shear stress, shear rate, viscosity, and
crystallization rate as a function of temperature for several polymers. The
approach is experimental and also by way of modeling. The injection molding
process will be modeled and the results compared to experimental findings.
Crystalline polymers, and the injection molding process, are important elements
in the polymer manufacturing industry. This research will add to the capability
to control product and process with greater accuracy and confidence.
