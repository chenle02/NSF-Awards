The aim of this study is to make a contribution towards development of
formaldehyde-free bonding agents for paper. The basis will be the reaction of
paper fibers with polycarboxylic acids which have at least three carboxyl units
that are structurally capable of thermal intramolecular cyclic anhydride
formation (Blanc' Rule). The detailed curing mechanism will be determined and
the effects of processing variables and catalysts will be evaluated. The
structure and properties of the resulting paper will be determined and used to
develop relationships between chemical, mechanical and moisture properties.
