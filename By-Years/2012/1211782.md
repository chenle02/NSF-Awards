This award will provide continued support of Skynet, a web-based software suite
for controlling many remote telescopes simultaneously. As part of this effort,
the group at the University of North Carolina will continue to expand their
network beyond the original PROMPT telescopes, an array of six fully automated
telescopes located at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, into
a larger system with telescopes on several continents. This network will be used
to support observations of gamma-ray bursts and other transient and time-
variable phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to have a
significant impact on time domain astronomy. The leaders of this project also
envision outreach to tens of thousands of citizen scientists and members of the
general public.
