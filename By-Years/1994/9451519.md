A computer is used as both a simulation and measurement tool to illustrate the
behavior of analog electronic circuits. The Kolb learning cycle and the 4MAT
system are used to justify the computer's role in experimentation. The
incorporation of automated device parameter extraction is used to obtain more
accurate computer simulations, and computer-controlled measurements illustrate
design trade-off issues. Because trade-off analysis requires a large number of
measurements, the computer is utilized to automatically control some of the more
redundant activities. Using both simulation and automated measurement increases
student understanding of amplifier circuits and bridges the gap between analysis
and design.
