Research will be conducted on the geochemistries of the major biochemicals in
marine environments. Specific studies will attempt to: (1) Define the sources,
concentrations and reactions of acidic sugars in aquatic environments; (2)
Determine the comparative geochemistries of the major biochemicals in Dabob Bay,
Saanich Inlet and the Black Sea; (3) Describe the microbial degradation of
vascular plant tissues; (4) Compare chemical composition of sedimentary versus
fresh vascular plant tissues; and (5) Determine the fates of the major
biochemicals when zooplankton feed on phytoplankton.
