This award provides partial support for a Chapman Conference on Global Biomass
Burning: Atmospheric, Climate, and Biospheric Implications. Chapman Conferences
are topical meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union. This
conference is designed to create opportunities for discussion not normally
available through the format of larger meetings. The Conference will bring
together a group of recognized experts for a discussion of the multi
disciplinary scientific aspects of biomass burning. Regional and global effects
of biomass burning will be explored by specialists in the relevant biological,
atmospheric and earth sciences and in fire management. A conference- proceedings
volume will record the information and viewpoints presented by participants for
use by the scientific and public-interest communities. Research in this area of
growing world-wide interest is expected to accelerate in the near future. To
help facilitate the growth of the needed research effort this grant supports the
attendance and participation of graduate students having relevant interest in
this field of research by providing for travel and subsistence costs. The
Conference will be held at Williamsburg, Virginia, March 19-23, 1990.
