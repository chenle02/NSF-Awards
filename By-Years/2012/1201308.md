The objective of this program is to develop a chip-scale technology for compact
and efficient nonlinear classical and quantum photonic mixers while maintaining
compatibility with silicon integrated optoelectronics. Proposed research builds
on recent accomplishments of slow-light enhanced nonlinearity which is 20x
higher than that of conventional silicon nanophotonic waveguides, correlated
photon generation via spontaneous four-wave mixing in long chains of low loss
coupled silicon microring resonator waveguides, and telecom-band to infrared
four-wave mixing conversion in nitride-clad silicon waveguides. Devices will be
designed, fabricated and measured which combine electro-optic functionality,
materials engineering and lithographic patterning to substantially improve the
figures of merit of nonlinear optical frequency conversion applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to develop chip-scale devices
with orders-of-magnitude improvement in energy efficiency, and reduction in
size, weight and cost, compared to fiber-based or crystal-based bulk nonlinear
optical systems. Novel scientific insights will emerge from the systematic study
of combined electro-optic and nonlinear optical phenomena in both the classical
and quantum regime, bridging traditional barriers between those fields. The
outcome of this project will be the creation of optoelectronic devices useful
for data and free-space communication, chemical and biomolecular spectroscopy,
sensing, metrology, cryptography, and quantum
photonics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are to integrate several
modern scientific disciplines, to which graduate students will gain valuable
exposure and benefit from research collaborations with industry and government
laboratories which provide broader perspective and scope for field applications
of the novel scientific breakthroughs.
