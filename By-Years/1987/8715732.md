Mathematicians from North America and Europe will be brought together for a
conference in "Finite Buildings, Related Geometries and Applications", an area
of growing research interest. This subject has its roots in the classification
of complex Lie groups, but now has connections in many areas of mathematics,
including discrete groups, finite geometry, combinatorics, K-theory, model
theory, logic, and computer science. This conference will provide an opportunity
for interaction between mathematicians of widely varying fields of research with
a common interest in Finite Buildings. "Finite Buildings" is a relatively new
area of mathematics, reflecting the tremendous growth of mathematics that is
related to the computerization of modern society. Practical applications are in
information storage and retrieval, and in computer hardware design.
