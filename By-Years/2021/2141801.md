Participants in this workshop seek to advance understanding of emergent security
challenges in the Arctic, evaluating the multiplier effects of accelerated
climate change on environmental, economic, and social systems. They explore to
what extent conventional security assumptions are appropriate for understanding
the dynamic Arctic strategic landscape and address issues such as threats to
infrastructure, international hazard response, and public health.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is structured to foster discussion and
debate, stimulate new research agendas, and provide opportunities for attendees,
including graduate and undergraduate students, to become more familiar with
pressing Arctic issues. Five graduate students and ten undergraduate students
selected through a competitive process will have the opportunity to participate,
with emphasis on recruiting from a diverse applicant pool. Other activities
include a student essay contest and outreach to local middle and high school
students through the University of Southern Californiaâ€™s Center for Active
Learning in International Studies (CALIS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
