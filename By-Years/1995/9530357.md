Abstract CTS-9530357 Hunt, Melany L. The PI proposes to study heat transfer and
frictional heating in the flow of granular materials. Two experimental apparati,
one involving channel flow and the other treating annular flow, will be
constructed to model these phenomena. A discrete-element computer simulation
will be used to track the trajectories of individual particles and their
interactions. Granular flow is important in the food processing industry, in the
chemical industry, and in a variety of other applications, such as the flow of
pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and gunpowder.
