ABSTRACT OPP-9632174 FITZHUGH This project by the Smithsonian Institution's
Arctic Studies Center is designed to present profiles of NSF-supported research
projects on the Arctic Studies Center Web Site. The Smithsonian Institution is a
major Web Site with thousands of "hits" per day. Since an important strategic
goal of the National Science Foundation is scientific literacy, this linkage to
the SI offers a unique opportunity for the Arctic Social Sciences Program. The
web site team will be tasked with designing and operating an NSF Arctic Social
Sciences graphic identity which will introduce a mission statement, a menu page
for Arctic Social Science projects, reports and information, news and notables,
hot links to other polar sites, and the NSF Home Page.
