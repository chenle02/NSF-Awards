In this project, coalition of faculty from three universities has developed a
new laboratory for signals and systems courses for Electrical and Computer
Engineering majors. This laboratory significantly improves signals and systems
education by having students design and implement systems that solve real
engineering problems. Required signals and systems courses are very important to
electrical and computer engineering majors because they provide the foundation
for important subjects such as communications, systems, control, and signal
processing. Unfortunately, these courses do not have laboratories or hands-on
activity associated with them. However, it is very important to have today's
engineering students "do" real engineering problems because they are motivated
best by work that they readily appreciate as relevant and useful. This project
builds a laboratory for introductory signals and systems courses, which has
students design and implement solutions to real engineering problems. They test
their designs on their own speech and music waveforms and listen to the results.
The laboratory is built around computer simulation software and data conversion
hardware using high-performance personal computers. Problems are assigned as
homework projects without formal laboratory meetings, therefore avoiding
difficult curriculum changes. Students in this new laboratory focus on solving
real system design problems with the concepts, mathematical descriptions and
block diagrams that are the tools of a signals and systems course. Audio output
helps them connect the frequency domain to reality by associating the spectrum
analyzer of their ears with what they see from output plots.
