Eight students will participate in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
project aimed at algebraic studies in graph theory. Two advisors will work with
the students on topics such as line graphs and their regularity properties which
develop when iterated. Work will also be done in determining which graph
operations commute with the line graph operator. Other students will consider
the classification of graphs whose adjacency matrices have integer eigenvalues,
Hamiltonian graphs which arise as joins of other graphs and determinants of
distance matrices of unicyclic graphs. Included in the orientation phase,
students will be introduced to the program MATLAB, a computer program
particularly useful for the computational aspects of linear algebra. A full
schedule of invited speakers is planned. In addition, students will be be
encouraged to present the results of their work at meetings of the honorary, Pi
Mu Epsilon, or those of the Mathematical Association of America.
