The formation, energy transfer processes, and chemical reactions of the ozone
excited states will be investigated and a kinetic model of these processes,
based upon the experimental results, will be constructed. Specifically, they
plan to measure the wavelength dependence of the absolute quantum yields as
functions of wavelength, pressure, gas composition, and temperature, and to
investigate chemical reactions of the excited ozone states. The research is
motivated by the need to assess the potential atmospheric importance of ozone
excited states which cannot be accomplished until the states, the quantum yields
for production, the wavelength dependencies, the products of the quenching
steps, the connections among the several observed states, and the rate
coefficients for the elementary reactions have been identified.
