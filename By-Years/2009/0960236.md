This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael P. Chiarelli and Nancy C.
Tuchman of Loyola University and Pamela Geddes of Northeastern Illinois
University will acquire a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS/MS) equipped
with an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system. The instrument
will support work at the Center for Urban Environmental Research &amp; Policy
(CUERP) at Loyola University Chicago. The instrument will be a primary tool for
research within CUERP's "Clean Air, Clean Water" program (CACW), in which
emergent contaminants found in natural aquatic ecosystems in and around the
Chicago area as well as the fate of these compounds and their metabolites will
be experimentally manipulated at Loyola's artificial stream facility to
determine their effects on aquatic biota and functioning. Additional research
projects include: 1) studies to determine the positions of phosphorylation in
proteins suggested to be key in triggering malaria, and 2) determination of the
structures of organic semiconductors formed by the gas-phase modification of
rubrene crystals by dieneophiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mass spectrometer is
used to identify the chemical composition of a sample by measuring the mass of
the molecular constituents in the sample after they are ionized and detected by
the mass spectrometer. Liquid chromatography is a technique that separates
chemicals from a mixture or in a solution before they are ionized by the mass
spectrometer. The instrument will provide structural and quantitative
characterization of the chemical composition of mixtures and reaction products
for a core group of faculty users from the Departments of Chemistry and Biology
at Loyola University and Northeastern Illinois University.
