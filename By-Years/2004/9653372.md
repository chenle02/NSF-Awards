PROJECT SUMMARY During the two-year span of this project, a two-week faculty
seminar on Teaching Introductory Physics Using Interactive Methods and Computers
will be held at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. These seminars will
be part of a series that began in 1990. The goal of the seminars is to help
introductory physics teachers develop pedagogical approaches that enable their
students to learn physics using guided inquiry and computer tools to explore
"real world" phenomena. The two-week seminar will be offered in the summers of
1997 and 1998 for thirty invited participants. Topics covered will include:
interactive instructional strategies based on outcomes of educational research;
assessment of student learning gains; laboratory design; computer interfacing;
use of spreadsheets and graphing packages; data and error analysis techniques;
the application of laboratory interfacing and real time data analysis to
laboratories and lecture demonstrations; numerical problem solving and modeling;
and digital video frame capture and analysis for the study of motion, heat and
temperature, and electrostatics.
