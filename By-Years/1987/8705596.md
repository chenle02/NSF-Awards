This project will investigate the nature of computational systems which are
meant to discover proofs and compute with them after they are discovered. The
concept of proofs-as-values is not only interesting in its own right but also
central for the development of interesting theorem provers and proof assistants
for use by mathematicians and computer scientists. As a guide in designing such
proof systems, several relevant issues in the semantics of constructive logics
and higher-order polymorphic \-calculus will be investigated. A clear
understanding of such models would help in developing a consistent and clean
programming paradigm for the implementation of higher-order proof systems. The
project will also investigate the role which extensions of logic programming
languages could play as the underlying implementation languages for higher-order
proof systems. The central role of search and equation solving (unification) in
logic programming may make it more suitable for the implementation of proof
systems than more traditionally used languages such as ML.
