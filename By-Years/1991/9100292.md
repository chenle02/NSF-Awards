This project explores the origin of magnetic anisotropy in ultrathin iron films
deposited on single crystal tungsten substrates using ultra-high vacuum
sputtering techniques. The films will be characterized in-situ during deposition
and subsequent crystallization using grazing incidence X-ray scattering to
monitor the crystallization process and to monitor lattice accommodation and the
number and orientation of crystal dislocations generated. Magnetic anisotropy
measurements will be made and correlated with microscopic structural features. A
second part of the project is devoted to incorporation and study of the effects
of rare earth atoms at the iron-tungsten interface. Rare earth atoms at the
interface in dilute amounts have the potential to produce large magnetic
anisotropy, and this effect will be studied. The dominating importance of
interfacial effects in films which are only a few atomic layers thick can in
principle be used to tune the magnetic anisotropy and magnetic moment of a given
sample to a desired value. Since the mean free path of electrons in these
multilayer media may be substantially longer than the layer thicknesses,
remarkable electron transport properties, such as the giant magneto resistance
effect have been observed. Many of the properties of multilayer ultrathin films
are of interest for technological application, especially for data storage
either magnetic or magneto optic.
