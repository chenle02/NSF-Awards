This is a US-Russian collaborative research project that will explore the
isospin dependence of fragmentation and spallation reactions produced in 1 GeV
proton induced reactions. The principal investigator is Dr. ManYee B. Tsang from
Michigan State University. Her Russian collaborators are Dr. Lyudmila Andronenko
and Dr. Mikhail Andronenko from the St. Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will take advantage of the unique
capabilities of both research groups. The US group pioneers the isoscaling
analysis and modeling while the Russian group has accumulated 1 GeV proton
induced fragmentation and spallation data on many different isotope targets over
the past decades. This collaboration will further understanding of the global
nature of the isoscaling phenomenon and possible extraction of the symmetry
terms in the Nuclear Equation of State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in
nuclear physics research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together
leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary
efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on
the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
