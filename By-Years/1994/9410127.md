9410127 Dewhurst The award is for research involving the addition of polycrystal
slip modeling capabilities to a three-dimensional finite element code to predict
the effects of surface roughening during bulk material deformation. The work
extends current work on the prediction of microstructural texture and
anisotropic material properties during bulk deformation and relates surface
roughening to individual grains on the free surface. Individual grains are
modeled by individual elements of the mesh. A combined experimental and
numerical simulation approach is taken to validate the techniques developed, and
the sensitivity of the surface roughness to process parameters is investigated.
Metalforming industries such as the automotive industry and the beverage can
industry rely on sheet forming processes where surface roughening is a problem.
Improved understanding of the phenomenon of surface roughening is likely to
result from the work described here and would benefit these industries.
