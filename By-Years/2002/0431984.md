The proposal is a request for support to help cover the costs of travel for
graduate students in the Division of Particles and Fields (DPF) to attend the
May 2004 General American Physical Society (APS) meeting. It will take place
from May 1-4, 2004 in Denver, CO. The funds will be used to help support
graduate students who are APS/DPF student members who otherwise could not afford
to attend the meeting.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
