9610496 McCauley This project will use the plant Silene alba as a model system
to investigate how genetic factors influence the persistence of populations.
Many species are distributed into numerous small local populations owing to the
natural distribution of patches of favorable habitat, or due to human impact on
the landscape. Small populations often face a high probability of extinction,
and the persistence of the species at large may require that new populations be
founded at a rate that offsets local extinctions. Since small or recently
established populations often display the harmful effects of inbreeding, it is
important to understand the genetic characteristics of newly formed populations.
This study will ask whether recently established populations are prone to the
harmful effects of inbreeding such that inbreeding influences population
persistence. It will also ask whether the movement of genes from population to
population by pollen dispersal (gene flow) can offset the effects of inbreeding.
Studies of both natural and experimental populations of S. alba will address
these issues. Studies of natural populations will use genetic techniques to
measure the rate at which new genes enter recently founded populations owing to
pollen movement. They will also investigate whether plants formed by this gene
flow are more vigorous than their neighbors. In other experiments artificial
populations of S. alba will be created in order to investigate the interaction
of gene flow by pollen and inbreeding under more controlled conditions. Taken
together, the results of these studies should contribute to a more general
understanding of how genetic and ecological factors interact to determine the
probability that a species can persist in a given landscape.
