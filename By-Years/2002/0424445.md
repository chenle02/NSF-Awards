Multi-agent control: mechanism design and adaptive learning

PI Pravin Varaiya, University of California, Berkeley, varaiya@eecs.berkeley.edu



Abstract



We seek to study control strategies for multi-agent systems in which agents have
different

information and possibly different objectives. We organize these decision-making
settings

as cooperative or non-cooperative games. The objective is to design the 'rules
of the game'

in such a way that agents acting selfishly on their own behalf arrive at
promoting socially

desirable strategies. We will focus on 'combinatorial auctions' as the
paradigmatic game.



Second, we want to study control strategies with low computational complexity,
which rules

out dynamic programming or global optimization. The approach is to reduce
complexity by

resoring to 'learning', based on simulation or experiments, in order to estimate
the value

of a particular strategy.



Examples to test our approach will be drawn from bandwidth trading in
communication networks.
