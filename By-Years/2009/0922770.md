Fusion (when light nuclei bind to make heavier nuclei) and fission (when heavy
nuclei break apart into lighter ones) are fundamental nuclear processes that
have enormous impact on our lives. Fusion is responsible for the heat from the
sun, and for the existence of the primordial deuterium and helium that went into
the first generation of stars after the Big Bang. More complex fusion and
fission processes within stars and supernovae have given rise to the variety of
elements found on earth and in the cosmos. Fission has been harnessed for energy
production, while controlled fusion remains an elusive goal. Both fission and
fusion play a role in nuclear weaponry and national
security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the importance of fission and fusion
processes, we have little theoretical understanding of them from first
principles due to their complexity: fusion involves the interactions of many
quarks within small nuclei, while fission follows from collective dynamics of
many nucleons within large nuclei. We propose here to accomplish the first steps
toward understanding fission and fusion directly from fundamental quark and
nucleon interactions by means of high performance computing. The computer being
purchased with MRI funds in this proposal, coupled with the unique expertise of
the PIs in relevant aspects of nuclear theory, will enable to the PIs to perform
the research and development of computational techniques and algorithms that
will enable efficient study of fission and fusion on leadership class computing
infrastructure, such as the TeraGrid. Research on this machine will include
extensive involvement by post-docs and graduate students, giving them an
invaluable hands-on opportunity to learn the techniques of high performance
computing, skills they will be able to later apply across all the sciences.
