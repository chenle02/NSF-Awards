The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a drug delivery system for use in joint replacement surgery and
in trauma applications, spine infections, and ankle and shoulder replacements.
Joint replacements are successful but occasionally complicated by postoperative
infections, as are other orthopaedic procedures. The proposed technology will
deliver antibiotics to those surgical sites to reduce infections. The technology
will allow antibiotic concentrations to be maintained at higher levels for
longer periods of time, which may shorten treatment durations currently leaving
patients without a hip or knee for months at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project is based on the development of a drug delivery system to treat
post-operative joint infections (PJI) for conditions including joint
arthroplasties/ The current treatment algorithm for the treatment of
postoperative joint infections requires intravenous antibiotics along with
surgery to debride the area and deliver antimicrobials locally. Traditionally,
this includes the delivery of antimicrobials through the use of bone cement,
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Antimicrobials delivered in this fashion reach
minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC); however, the primary culprit causing
persistent PJI is often bacterial biofilm. The ability to adequately treat and
eradicate biofilm-related infections requires an antibiotic concentration known
as the minimum bacterial eradication concentration (MBEC), which is 100-1000
times greater in concentration than the MIC. Current drug delivery is limited to
a burst elution pattern, with limited duration at the MIC and cannot be modified
once surgery is complete. The proposed technology seeks to improve drug delivery
to allow higher levels of local delivery that may be increased or changed as
culture results warrant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
