This award will provide funding to help defray the expenses of participants,
especially graduate students and postdocs, attending the biannual meetings of
the "Midwest Partial Differential Equations Seminar" for the years 2012, 2013,
and 2014. The first of these conferences will be held from April 27-29, 2012, on
the campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago.

The Midwest Partial Differential Seminar began to hold twice-yearly meetings in
Spring 1977. Over the intervening years the seminar has proved to be extremely
influential in the development of aspiring young specialists in the field by
providing a venue in which they could present their work, by facilitating
important professional contacts, and by serving as an incubator for research
collaborations. The next three years of the event will continue and enhance that
tradition.
