This BRIGE engineering education research project will investigate research
mentoring of underrepresented minority students. It will establish best
practices and determine the students' perceptions of the effectiveness of these
practices with a combination of qualitative and quantitative data and methods.
Narrative analysis of critical incidents, structured interviews, and survey
questions will be used. Currently there is very little definitive empirical
information on mentoring best practices, and the results of this work could
support or dispute currently accepted methods of mentoring and research
supervision. The results will provide new data and knowledge that will
significantly advance understanding of effective research mentoring practices
for underrepresented minority populations. This information can be of great
value in the design and implementation of mentoring programs focused on
broadening participation and improving success and retention of underrepresented
student in STEM fields.
