David Raymond Weaver &lt;br/&gt;IOS-0964901&lt;br/&gt;2010 Pineal Cell Biology
Gordon Research Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The 11th Gordon Research
Conference on Pineal Cell Biology: Mechanisms of Circadian Rhythmicity and
Melatonin Action (Pineal GRC) will occur on February 7-12, 2010, in Galveston,
Texas. The Pineal GRC will provide a forum for presentation and discussion of
new developments and ideas in this exciting, interdisciplinary field, including
aspects of melatonin and circadian rhythmicity from the diverse viewpoints of
expertise in retinal phototransduction, chronobiology, brain development,
neuronal signaling, genomics, metabolism, and cancer. The major objective of
this meeting is to promote interaction among a diverse group of scientists in
the cloistered Gordon Conference format, leading to information exchange, new
experimental strategies, new hypotheses, and ideas for future projects and
collaborations. Stimulating and intense discussion will lead to insights into
general principles, and will identify key areas for future research into the
impact of melatonin and circadian rhythms on physiological functions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special efforts have being made to encourage the
participation of women, underrepresented scientists, and those at early stages
of their careers. A significant number of the attendees will be doctoral
students and postdoctoral fellows, and interactions at the meeting will foster
professional growth and career development, enhance networking and promote
diversity in the field of pineal cell biology. The Conference will thus
contribute positively to the professional development of women, underrepresented
groups, and scientists early in their careers.
