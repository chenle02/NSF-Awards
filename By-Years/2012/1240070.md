Fordham University's Noyce Mathematics Scholarship Program is preparing 18 STEM
majors and STEM professionals to teach middle and high school mathematics in
high-need New York City public schools. Students in this program earn a Master
of Science in Teaching while carrying out training in a core activity, the
Japanese Lesson Study. This intensive and structured approach to planning
lessons involves collaborative planning, presentation of the lesson to actual
classes of students while being observed, and revision of the lesson as a result
of the critique of the observers? and the teachers' own perceptions of the
lesson's strengths and weaknesses. By learning to reflect on their own practice,
to be open to observation and feedback from their peers and to encourage their
colleagues, new teachers are better prepared to engage continuously in efforts
to improve their practice, not only on the "planned" lessons, but on all their
interactions with their students. Noyce Scholars continue to interact with the
program during their challenging first two years of teaching, helping them to
remain in the classroom despite structural and systemic conditions that drive
many teachers away from the profession. Overall, this program can become a model
for teacher preparation while serving the broader need of providing qualified
teachers with high mastery of their content to the high-need classrooms of the
city of New York.
