Some of the most interesting and oldest unanswered problems in number theory ask
how often prime numbers appear as the outputs of a polynomial. Another
intriguing set of questions surrounds the Riemann zeta function and similar
functions, called L-functions. These two areas are connected in analytic number
theory through a formula of N.V. Kuznetsov. This research project centers on
generalizing and modifying the formula of Kuznetsov to investigate polynomials
of degree higher than two and more complex L-functions. The project is expected
to develop powerful new analytic tools that will advance future research in
number theory.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Exponential sums may arise in additive
number theory problems that are not attached to subgroups of SL(2,Z). The goal
of this research is to address L-functions and moduli sums of exponential sums
on higher rank groups via generalizations and modifications of the Kuznetsov
formulae on SL(n,Z). There appears to be a direct connection between hyper-
Kloosterman sums on SL(3,Z) and the study of SL(3,Z) automorphic forms with non-
trivial K-types, by a modification of the SL(3) Kuznetsov formula, so one
immediate goal is to study such forms. Studying the exponential sums and
generalized Bessel functions occuring in the SL(3) Kuznetsov formula has led to
significant advances in understanding the L-functions attached to SL(3,Z) Maass
forms, so this research aims to continue this study in the level direction and
on SL(n,Z) for n higher than three.
