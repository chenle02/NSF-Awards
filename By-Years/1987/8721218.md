Within the Appalachian orogenic belt, southeastern New England plays a key role
in models for Appalachian orogenesis, because it contains one of the last
accreted terranes and appears to have the most complete record of the
Alleghanian Orogeny. Part of this history involves igneous activity, including
late Proterozoic arc accretion, followed by episodic extensional quartz-rich
alkalic magmatism throughout much of the Paleozoic succeeded finally by a brief
period of peraluminous granite emplacement in the Permian. This study involves
extensive zircon geochronology on two suites of volcanic rocks from the Avalon
terrane. The study of these rocks may clarify crustal, tectonic and magmatic
processes that occurred during the pre-collisional and early accretion stages of
the Alleghanian orogenic episode of New England.
