The primary coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere is
accomplished via electric currents flowing along the Earth's magnetic field.
Upward current regions generally result from downward flowing electrons which
have been observed with many satellites. In contrast, downward current regions
generally involve upward flowing electrons that have been more difficult to
observe. Thus our outstanding of the downward current regions has lagged behind
our understanding of the upward current regions. This study will develop a self-
consistent picture of the plasma and field properties of downward auroral
current regions. The results will lead to a better understanding of such
features as ion conic particle distributions, downward pointing electric fields
and ELF/VLF turbulence. The theoretical underpinning of the study will be to
break the problem into two separate but coupled problems with vastly different
time scales. ELF/VLF turbulence operates on times scales of milliseconds, while
the evolution of the large-scale auroral current structures takes place on time
scales of minutes to hours. Thus a self-consistent high frequency spectrum can
be determined in the context of a slowly evolving background distribution.
