This award supports the doctoral dissertation field research of Ms. Abilgail
Watrous in China. Her research seeks to answer the student?s thesis question:
"How will the factors of education, income, and migration influence solid-fuel
use in rural China over the next 20 years?" The project, which is designed to
advance knowledge and understanding of rural energy use in China, has three
components: surveys of migrant workers to understand how migration affects
energy perspectives and fuel use, adult energy-education programs, and continued
documentation of rural energy use. Ms. Watrous will collaborate with Prof.
Xudong Yang of Tsinghua University in Beijing and make use of innovative
analytical and modeling methods (agent-based models) as well as the public
surveys. &lt;br/&gt;This is a unique project that will develop important data as
well as the related analytical tools to address the challenges of expanding
energy use and the associated climate change. Because energy use raises several
social and environmental challenges, especially at the scale of the issue
encountered in China, this proposal is especially timely. An important
contribution of the project is to understand better the impact of the migration
of rural Chinese to cities as it relates to overall energy use.
