9523023 Colville The objective of the research is to investigate the enhancement
of the flexural tensile bond strength of masonry mortars by the use of latex
additives in the mortar mix. The research builds on a previous project which
identified several areas of potentially significant research. These include the
effect of polymer content, effect of lime, curing procedure and flow, type of
plasticizer, and moisture content of masonry. This research will provide
approximately 1000 test values on brick masonry prisms constructed with a
variety of latex additives that have already been proven to have considerable
potential on increasing the tensile bond strength of clay masonry construction.
The study will be directed into three phases. Phase 1 will evaluate 9 polymer
types in detail (588 tests). Phases 2 and 3 (336 tests) will focus on those 16
contributions from the 36 mortar batches tested in Phase 1 that are shown to
provide the greatest enhancement in flexural bond strength. The research will
provide for the first time, a comprehensive data base on the enhancement of the
flexural bond strength of polymer modified mortars. This is in itself
significant since there is no current data available that indicates whether or
not the traditional weal link masonry (i.e., the bond between mortar and masonry
unit) can be significantly improved through the use of such additives. The
recent enhancements in concrete strength and durability through the use of
various additives and superplasticizers in the concrete mix, cannot be applied
directly to masonry mortars. The potential impact of such bond strength
enhancement on the use of unreinforced masonry construction has important
implications both in retrofitting and strengthening existing masonry
construction and in the design of new construction. ***
