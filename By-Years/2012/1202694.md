PROJECT ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral Dissertation Research: Memorial Sites and
Collective Memory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This dissertation is an analysis of the
transitional processes from mass violence to post-genocide in present day
Rwanda. One way that communities aim to sustain peace post-conflict is through
the construction of permanent memorials and rituals aimed at creating a
collective memory that can be drawn upon for years to come. However, much of
what we know about collective memory after mass violence is how it operates on
national levels. Analyzing how local initiatives operate differently according
to their orientation to memorialization and reconciliation can illuminate how
memorials matter in the lives of survivors of violence. Additionally, focusing
on the local can shed light on how survivors interact in varied ways with
memorials, and in turn, how memorials shape their understanding of national
unity and citizenship. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research focuses
on these local dynamics by interviewing survivors in three different locations
in post-genocide Rwanda (N= 70) who work at, live by or attend memorials on a
daily basis. The central point of interest in this research is the narratives
that emerge from engagement with memorial sites, rather than an analysis of the
sites themselves. By examining how survivors understand how memorials and
reconciliation programs in present day Rwanda draw upon and shape memories of
the genocide, scholars can begin to understand how local politics and processes
of collective memory interact with national ones. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By
analyzing the local narratives of those who engage with memorials on a daily
basis, scholars will begin to understand the specific dynamics of those
memorials that aid or hinder survivor?s experience of (or participation in)
reconciliation. I hypothesize that various sites of remembrance will operate
differently depending on their orientation towards memorialization vs.
reconciliation. Within each category, I additionally expect that narratives will
differ based on two central dimensions: the framing of, and intended audience
for, the physical memorial/reconciliation program and characteristics of
participants, such as age, class, gender, geography and education. This study
has the potential to articulate the complicated process of reconciliation after
mass trauma. By mapping out the trajectory of those survivors who found
memorials or specific reconciliatory programs central in their recovery from
trauma, we can then apply these findings to other cases of mass trauma. These
cases could range from natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in New
Orleans to mass violence such as in Darfur.
