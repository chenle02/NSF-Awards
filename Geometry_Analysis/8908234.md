The principal investigator will complete the study of Kahler-Einstein metrics
on compact Kahler manifolds. Compact algebraic manifolds with zero first Chern
class will be classified. Stable vector bundles will be constructed over these
manifolds. Complete Kahler-Einstein metrics whose scalar curvature is either
negative or zero will be constructed. The investigators will work toward
understanding non-compact complete Kahler-Einstein manifolds with zero Ricci
curvature. These are being studied extensively by particle physicists who are
interested in superstring theory. In a related investigation, non-collision
singularities of the n-body problem from celestial mechanics will be studied.
Super-hyperbolic and oscillatory solutions which arise from the final evolution
of a gravitational system will be the focus of a special investigation. Two
projects will focus on mathematics relevant to particle physics and cosmology.
Einstein's dream of formulating a general field theory which encompasses all
four basic forces of nature, from strong nuclear to gravitational, will come
closer to realization upon completion of this project. Solutions to Newton's
equations of planetary motion which predict orbits which go to infinity in
finite time will be further investigated.
