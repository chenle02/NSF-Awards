Title: Travel Support for an International Conference on Identifying Pathways
for Deployment of Carbon Capture and Utilization

1722498 Wilcox Carbon capture, storage, and utilization is a pressing topic in
light of climate change concerns and the Paris 2016 International Treaty.
Current routes for industrial-scale carbon capture significantly increase energy
costs while decreasing overall efficiency of energy conversion. This project
provides funds for two students and two speakers to attend an international
conference in Italy to discuss carbon capture, storage, and utilization
technologies in light of this international engineering challenge, with
considerable social, economic, and political barriers.

The organizing committee for the conference strove to provide a unique venue for
discussions of economics and engineering issues of carbon capture and
utilization. High-profile speakers will provide plenaries, while younger
researchers will present more technical information. Outcomes from the
conference will be published as a special issue in "Frontiers Energy Research"
journal. The conference is modeled after a Gordon Research conference, and will
be kept relatively small to facilitate in depth discussions and spur
collaborations.
