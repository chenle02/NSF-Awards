The Black Hills Special Services Cooperative, South Dakota, is planning for the
development of a research-based professional development model designed to help
middle school teachers appropriately integrate technology into mathematics and
science content in a way that raises the interest and persistence of female
students in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this model, professional development
for technology integration will be the vehicle used to address and apply
principles of gender equity at the middle school classroom level. As middle
school teachers learn how to appropriately use technology to add value to
existing mathematics and science curriculum and methodology, they will do so
through the "lens" of gender equity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Target participants in
this project will initially include 30 middle school teachers of mathematics,
science and computer science in five selected middle schools in western South
Dakota which serve approximately 2300 students in grades
5-8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborating partners in the planning proposal are
Technology and Innovations in Education (TIE), Rapid City, South Dakota; the
Center for the Advancement of Mathematics and Science (CAMSE) at Black Hills
State University, Spearfish, South Dakota; the Midwest Alliance for Professional
Learning and Leadership (MAPLE), Rapid City South Dakota; and the following
pre-K school districts in western South Dakota: Belle Fourche, Lead-Deadwood,
Meade, Spearfish, and Todd County. These districts represent a cross section of
South Dakota's student population.&lt;br/&gt;
