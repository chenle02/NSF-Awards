This project is concerned with several problems in commutative algera. The
principal investigators will work on the Horrocks'conjecture. They will also
work on the syzygy theorem and extending certain results to the mixed
characteristic case. Another area of concentration concerns invariants related
to representations of groups in positive characteristic. One of the main
problems to be considered in this area is to describe how tensor functors,
acting on indecomposable representations, decompose. The research in this
project involves two areas of commutative algebra. The first area is concerned
with the structure and properties of syzygies of finite projective dimension and
uses local commutative algebra. A "syzygy" is a linking or yoking together of
steps in a projective resolution describing the structure of a module. The
second area is concerned with decomposing tensor functors under formal group
laws and the properties of the relative Grothendieck groups that are associated
to the decomposition.
