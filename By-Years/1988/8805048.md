The ATP synthase of mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacteria taps the energy of a
transmembrane proton gradient to synthesize ATP. The mechanism of this important
energy- conserving process is not understood in molecular terms. The enzyme is
comprised of two portions, F0, which is an integral, membrane-spanning proton
channel, and F1 which is peripheral to the membrane and contains the catalytic
sites. Together F0 and F1 contain more than eight different protein subunits
with a minimum of seventeen polypeptide chains. Three of the F1 subunits have
been isolated in reconstitutively active forms from the chloroplast enzyme
(CF1), and attempts to isolate the remaining two for use in reconstitution
studies aimed at elucidating subunit structure-function relationships will be
under taken. Other studies will aim at obtaining structural information for the
B subunit which contains part or all of the catalytic site. Chemical
modification with fluorescent and photoaffinity probes will be employed to map
specific sites on the B subunit within the CF1 complex and to identify amino
acid residues involved in, for example, nucleotide binding. Monoclonal
antibodies will be used to identify sites of contact between the B subunit and
other subunits of the ATP synthase. When plants capture sunlight they convert
the radiant energy into chemical energy which supports the synthesis of plant
constituents. The latter provide, directly or indirectly, the nutrients of
animals, including man. The energy conversion process is complex and is
catalyzed by a set of proteins in the chloroplast membrane. Several of these
have been isolated and the PI wishes to isolate and characterize others so that
eventually the whole complex can be reconstituted in a functional form.
