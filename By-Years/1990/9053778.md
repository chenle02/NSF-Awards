The Lawrence Hall of Science proposes to develop a major public education
program, including a traveling exhibition, two planetarium programs, a play, and
a kit for schools entitled "Columbus' Great Experiment." Emphasizing science and
technology, Columbus' first voyage is portrayed as an experiment aimed at
testing the hypothesis (based on doubtful evidence) that sailing to the west was
a more practical way of reaching the Indies than by sailing east around the Horn
of Africa. As with many scientific experiments, the results were quite different
from what the experimenter had in mind: instead of finding a sea route to the
Indies, Columbus vastly expanded knowledge about our planet and spurred
developments in science and technology. These events occurred within a social
and cultural context that were critical to the development of modern science,
and resulted in far-reaching changes in the population and ecology of the world
which continue today. The National Endowment for the Humanities has recently
awarded a grant for the development of the exhibits. The present proposal
requests that NSF join with NEH to complete and expand the project, by funding:
a) components of three additional copies of the exhibition to be constructed by
other museums, thus expanding the public audience to 19 million visitors; b) two
participatory planetarium programs; c) a play about the scientific aspects of
Columbus' voyage; and d) school kits that will enable teachers to present the
most important ideas embodied in the exhibition to students who are unable to
view the exhibition at a science center. Interest in these programs will peak
around Columbus Day, 1992, we anticipate that the materials will be sufficiently
interesting, informative, and entertaining to be used for many years to come.
