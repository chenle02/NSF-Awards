9358236 Diamond This award will focus on the metabolic and genetic response of
mammalian cells to physical forces such as those encountered in bioreactors. The
work is directed at elucidating molecular level events which control mechano-
biological coupling. With this understanding, changes in environmental factors
will be tested to help eliminate mammalian sensitivities to externally applied
forces.
