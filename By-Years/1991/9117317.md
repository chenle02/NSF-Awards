The PI will investigate energy release in solar flares by: (i) incorporating a
nonuniform guide field and/or a larger coronal density in the electron-heated
models in order to try and suppress the blueshifted component of the soft X-ray
line profiles, thereby bringing them more into line with observation; (ii)
exploring models to explain the hard X-ray/soft X-ray correlation; (iii)
developing our impulsive coronal energy release model to include line-tying
effects and (non-adiabatic) conductive and convective cooling; (iv)
investigating the role of the high-energy radiation itself in the flare energy
budget.
