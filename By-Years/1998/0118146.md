The project focuses on general purpose trajectory design algorithms for high
dimensional, highly nonlinear systems evolving in complex environments. The goal
is to solve the currently intractable problem of trajectory generation and
optimization for high-fidelity models of various types of autonomous vehicles,
using an approach that combines methods from differential geometry, nonlinear
control theory, robot motion planning, randomized algorithms, and mathematical
programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
