9450611 Chittenden The Arkansas Consortium of Chemistry Programs wishes to
reorganize their chemistry programs in parallel with the NSF-funded Arkansas
Statewide Systemic Initiative for the improvement of science education, an
initiative focused principally in the K-12 sector but having 13-16 extensions.
The proposed study will have three segments: the reorganization of the
curriculum as a whole and of specific courses within the curriculum; attendant
changes in the delivery of classroom instruction; and of laboratory instruction.
The production of new textual materials will follow from these innovations. The
vehicle for promulgating curricular changes and their delivery will be recent
advances in computing and communications. We will study technologies such as:
distance learning using interactive uplink/downlink systems; computer modelling
and simulation; personal computer-based data acquisition/analysis systems for
teaching laboratories; chemistry-related computational and drill software,
video, and interactive CD-ROM. We propose to include broad, thematic elements in
our BS and BSE programs, statewide, in Chemistry and in related programs:
biology, engineering, pre-healing arts - pre-med, pre-dent, pre-vet. These
common themes, stressed strongly in the lower division courses, will be chosen
after careful study of existing and potential model curricula. Particularly
stressed will be the theme that contemporary chemistry is conducted as a more
interdisciplinary enterprise than current compartmentalized chemistry curricula
would suggest. ***
