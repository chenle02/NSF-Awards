An enormous carbonate megabank formed and thrived on the Nicaragua Rise in the
Oligocene and early/middle Miocene, portions of which form the segmented
platform/basin geometry seen today. Current intensification caused by this
platform blocking the northward flow of the Caribean Current resulted in
widespread unconformities in the Florida-Bahamas region. The present study will
connect three previous study sites by a network of high- resolution seismic
profiles. Dredging of exposed outcrops and piston coring will provide samples of
the older substrata. Eventually an ODP drilling program will be proposed for the
Nicaragua Rise, based partly on the results of this program.
