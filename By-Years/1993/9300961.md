The project will conduct a post-disaster survey on the damage caused by
Hurricane Iniki that hit the Island of Kauai on September 11, 1992, and will
collect and analyze data on selected aspects of this event. The meteorological
characteristics of the hurricane at surface levels; the performance of
structures during the hurricane; coastal and near shore damage; and some aspects
of the human response during and after the hurricane are some of the topics to
be studied. Comparisons between this hurricane and Hurricane Iwa (1982) will be
drawn, and recommendations for the mitigation of future extreme wind episodes
will be made for the benefit of the populations affected.
