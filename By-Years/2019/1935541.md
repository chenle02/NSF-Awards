Groundwater is an important resource for drinking water and food production.
However, groundwater is being depleted across Earth. This conference is focused
on the sustainability of heavily stressed groundwater resources. The conference
provides a venue to discuss groundwater hydrology and groundwater supply and
demand. The goal is to identify new pathways toward groundwater sustainability.
These pathways will incorporate water law, human-induced stresses, the
protection of natural resources, and data analysis tools. The conference brings
together a diverse group of researchers from the hydrology, law, economics, and
social science communities. The conference emphasizes the active participation
and involvement of early-career scientists and underrepresented scientists from
the U.S., which is well-aligned with the NSF's goal of developing the next
generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
