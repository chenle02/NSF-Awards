The sense of taste is used by all organisms to determine whether potential food
items will be ingested or rejected and is critical for an organism's survival.
The taste system is made up of multiple cell types that detect chemicals in food
and then send a specific signal describing that stimulus to the brain. The goal
of this project is to characterize recently identified signaling pathway in
taste cells that contributes to the detection of taste stimuli. Characterization
of these signaling pathways will provide a better understanding of how the taste
system works and how the brain gathers information about its surroundings.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A combination of calcium imaging, molecular biology, and
immunocytochemistry will be used to better understand these recently identified
signaling pathways and define their physiological role in the formation of taste
signals that are sent to the brain. The findings that emerge from this project
will improve understanding of how taste receptor cells that are located on the
tongue can detect chemicals in food and translate that information into a signal
that the brain can understand. This information is critical for two reasons: 1)
understanding how chemicals are detected from the environment has important
implications in feeding behaviors including the regulation of food intake, and
2) information about the physiology of these neuronal cells will translate into
a better understanding of how signaling pathways function in all neurons.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This broader impacts of this project include provision of
research and training opportunities for multiple graduate and undergraduate
students, including both minorities and women. Students will be trained in
molecular biology and immunocytochemical techniques as well as live cell calcium
imaging and patch clamp analysis of taste cells. These skills will provide
students with the ability to answer research questions (either in the taste
field or elsewhere) using a multi-faceted approach.
