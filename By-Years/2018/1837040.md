This award provides partial support for three conferences in economic history:
the 2015 and 2016 Cliometrics Conference and the 2017 World Congress of the
Cliometric Society. The research topics bring together economics with
statistics, demography, political science, sociology, anthropology, and
archaeology. The goal is to use scientific methods to analyse historic data
sources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Papers presented at the conference are chosen in
response to an open call for submission. Particular attention in selection goes
to graduate students and new scholars. The steady mixing of newly trained and
experienced researchers creates a unique intellectual environment that has
worked to increase participation in this field of economics. The result is that
young scholars receive the stimulation and encouragement to build strong
scientific records in this interdisciplinary field.
