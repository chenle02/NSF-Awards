The 2nd Optogenetic Technologies and Applications Conference focuses on a
broader range of topics. Highlighting CRISPR and epigenetic applications as well
as optogenetics in cell signaling is unique to this conference. The broader
range of topics allows the conference to host a group of scientists and
engineers with very diverse backgrounds. Hosting this conference for the second
time allows students and early career professionals to share their work and
learn about new advances in a rapidly growing field. Additionally, hosting the
conference again allows continuous growth of members of this community. This
growth encourages discussion among normally separated scientists and engineers
and encourages collaboration in the field, which is critical to accelerating the
development of novel therapeutics. There are dedicated efforts to reach out to
students to attend this conference as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optogenetics is
an emerging technique that allows researchers to use light in order to control
living cells that have been modified to be light sensitive. Optogenetics has a
myriad of applications in fields such as healthcare, energy, and chemical
manufacturing. Because of rapid advancements in the field as well as a high
potential to be used in industry, the 2nd Optogenetic Technologies and
Applications Conference is designed to showcase the novel and cutting-edge
research being conducted in the field. The Conference touches on a broad range
of topics including advances in fundamental science, applications in cell
signaling and epigenetics, and applications to a number of fields including
neuroscience, cardiology, control of metabolism, and drug
delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
