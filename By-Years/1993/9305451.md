9305451 Karato This award provides partial funding for the upgrade of the high-
pressure rock deformation laboratory in the Department of Geology and Geophysics
at the University of Minnesota. The funds are to be used to construct equipment
for triaxial deformation studies under conditions of up to 2 GPa and 1700K (a
so-called Griggs apparatus) and a piston-cylinder unit for studies up to 6 GPa
and 2500K. The University of Minnesota is committed to providing the remaining
funds needed for this equipment construction project. Specific research topics
that will be carried out with the new facilities include the rheological
properties of minerals at high temperature and pressure, the solubility and
diffusivity of water in minerals and its effect on physical properties, the
partitioning of elements between silicates and iron alloys, the wetting
relationships between molten iron alloys and solid silicates, and the kinetics
of microstructure developments in minerals found in ultradeep xenoliths. All of
these studies bear significantly on understanding the structure and evolution of
the Earth's dynamic interior. ***
