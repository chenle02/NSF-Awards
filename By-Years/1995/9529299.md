This professional development fellowship supports training and research
activities on ethics and current practices of fact checking in the reporting of
science news. While accepted in some publication domains, fact-checking or the
sharing of written text with news sources for their review for inaccuracies is a
controversial practice. Critics charge it compromises journalistic independence,
while proponents believe the practice would improve accuracy and quality and
build trust and respect between scientists and journalists. The fellow is a
chemist with experience writing science news articles, whose faculty appointment
is in technical communication. The project mentors are professors of journalism
and mass communications with specialties in the sociology of risk communication
and ethics. With the assistance of her mentors over the course of this award,
the fellow will develop and participate in seminars and tutorials to 1) lay the
fundamental groundwork for understanding the ethical issues and the dynamics of
power and control in the interactions between scientists and journalists over
fact-checking, 2) trace the historical origins of ethical guidelines and
attitudes relating to the practice of fact-checking, 3) survey reporters in the
field in order to understand better the current practices and attitudes toward
fact-checking, and 4) explore casuistry or the use of cases, as a framework for
analyzing journalists' decision-making processes relating to fact-checking. In
addition to assisting in research in areas of interest to the mentors and
publishing results in the literature, the fellow will enhance her capabilities
to carry out further scholarly work in the realm of science communications. The
team will also develop a workshop based on project outcomes for scientists and
journalists.
