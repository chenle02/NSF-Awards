EIA-0203971 Gianfranco Ciardo College of William &amp; Mary Structured Methods
to Evaluate the Performance of Distributed Software&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our
goal is a collaborative research effort aimed at removing the computational
barriers to the widespread adoption of Markov chain modeling technology in the
software performance engineering process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will approach
the problem from different and complementary points of view, and have the
necessary means to solve many of the remaining computational issues. The results
of the proposed research will open up the Markov modeling field to a surge of
new, and probably unanticipated, research activity in very diverse areas of
national and international importance, and provide a path towards the
compositional performance assessment of systems built from off-the-shelf
software modules.&lt;br/&gt;
