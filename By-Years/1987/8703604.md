Robert Seeley will carry out research in certain differential operators with
strong singularities. These arise naturally in a variety of geometric and
physical problems. A geometric example is provided by the manifolds with conic
singularities. The classical Dirac monopole and conformally invariant field
theories are sources of physical examples. The research will involve index
problems for first order singular operators. Seeley has recently been involved
in developing a technique for computing the index of such operators. He will
continue to develop this technique and seek extensions to the case of iterated
cones where the cross-section has a conic singularity. He will also consider
families of regular operators degenerating to a nonsingular limit.
