This project involves four senior research topologists (William Browder, Wu-
chung Hsiang, John N. Mather, and William P. Thurston), one postdoctoral
associate (Lang-Fang Wu), and three advanced graduate students. Their research
topics are quite various. Browder will study free actions of certain topological
groups on finite-dimensional spaces. He will also study fixed point theorems and
regularity of minimal surfaces. Hsiang will work on a number of problems related
to the cyclotomic trace map, including the notorious Novikov conjecture in
L-theory as well as some more tractable ones. Mather's research deals with area-
preserving diffeomorphisms of infinite cylinders. There are several hard
conjectures about invariant curves under diffeomorphisms and their rotation
numbers. Thurston will work toward his famous geometrization conjecture for
3-manifolds. In addition, he will work on automatic groups, self-similar
tilings, one-dimensional real and complex dynamical systems, and other topics.
Wu's research concerns the Ricci Flow equations on manifolds and orbifolds. All
these topics are in the mainstream of research in topology. It is appropriate to
involve graduate students in their study. For example, the geometrization
conjecture of Thurston is a notoriously difficult problem. It subsumes the
Poincare Conjecture, which dates to the turn of the century. Nevertheless,
pieces of it have been the stuff of numerous Ph.D theses by Thurston's students
for more than a decade.
