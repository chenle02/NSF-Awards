Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1607236, Principal Investigator: Mladen
Bestvina&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interplay between algebra and geometry is one
of the classical themes in mathematics. Traditionally, one studies geometric
objects via their symmetries. In geometric group theory the situation is
reversed: one starts with a group of symmetries of an algebraic object (for
example, another group) and constructs a geometric object with the same
symmetries. This proposal focuses on the study of symmetries of a free group.
Surprisingly, its geometry is to a large degree governed by hyperbolic geometry
that goes back to Gauss, Lobacevski, Poincare and others, most recently to
Gromov and Thurston. The goal of the project is to better understand this
phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of the large-scale geometry of the
outer automorphism group of a free group on n generators, usually denoted
Out(F_n) has made great strides in recent years, but several fundamental
questions are still open. The principal investigator has proposed a strategy for
proving the Novikov and Farrell-Jones conjectures for this group. The strategy
is modeled on the proofs of corresponding conjectures for mapping class groups,
taking into account the extra complications present in Out(F_n). The steps in
the strategy provide concrete questions the PI plans to attack. More
specifically, a goal is to prove that Out(F_n) has finite asymptotic dimension,
to better understand the boundary of the complex of free splittings, and to
study the extent to which the orbit map from Out(F_n) to a suitable product of
projection complexes fails to be a quasi-isometric embedding. Additional
questions include characterization of convex cocompactness in mapping class
groups, uniform hyperbolicity of standard Out(F_n)-complexes, and cubing the
pants complex.
