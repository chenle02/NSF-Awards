Neurobiology has benefited greatly from the use of model systems. Simple
invertebrate preparations have provided a means to study neuronal communication.
Results from these models have proven applicable to mammalian systems and have
shed light on molecular mechanisms underlying behaviors, especially the
neurobiology of learning and memory. Brazilian opossums, with their great
immaturity at birth, have proven to be an excellent model for studying neural
development. Dr. Jacobson has an active colony of these valuable animals which,
unlike the North American opossum, are small in size, and easy to handle and
raise in the laboratory. Moreover, these Brazilian opossums are pouchless thus
providing an easy access to young. Thus, these animals are ideal for
investigating the mechanisms underlying the sexual differentiation of the brain.
Dr. Jacobson will be maintaining her colony during the next year and will
continue her work on the development and steroid regulation of sexual
dimorphisms within the CNS. In addition, the opossums will be available to other
investigators whose science will benefit greatly from the use of this valuable
model system.
