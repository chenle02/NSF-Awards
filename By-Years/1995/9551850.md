This new interdisciplinary computer classroom uses a network to link 24 student
PCs, an instructor PC, a printer, a CD tower, and a file server. Several Windows
statistics packages and databases are installed to support training and
interactive learning. A separately cabled visual/audio communication system
(VACS) permits the instructor to manipulate any or all student PC displays,
anonymously share student displays, or share the instructor's VGA display. The
VACS requires no software, is compatible with a variety of hardware, allows
virtually instantaneous sharing of screens without resolution loss, and is well-
suited for multimedia. The VACS allows real-time testing, formation of teams,
audio communications, and video-to-VGA conversion. The interdisciplinary lab is
shared by 21 courses in 5 departments to teach basic and advanced statistics
classes, reaching over 1200 students per year. Innovative uses include helping
students from several disciplines do original analyses using visualization and
graphics; access large, meaningful databases; work in teams and interactive
groups; make live computer presentations; and compare features of alternative
statistical packages. The classroom enables faculty to conduct experiments in
active learning with immediate feedback - regarded by educators as a key to
improving understanding and retention.
