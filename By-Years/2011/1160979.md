Planning Grant: I/UCRC for Spatiotemporal Thinking and Computing

George Mason University (GMU), Harvard University (HU), and the University of
CaliforniaSanta Barbara (UCSB) will conduct a planning meeting with industry,
university, government agencies, and associations to a) determine the
feasibility and viability of developing a center for spatiotemporal thinking and
computing, and b) plan the research agenda for the proposed center.

The proposal seeks to establish an I/UCRC for spatiotemporal thinking and
computing as a collaboration platform among universities, industry, government
agencies, and other organizations to enable research and education to 1) improve
the US geospatial research infrastructure base; 2) enhance the intellectual
capacity within the future engineering and science workforce; and 3) establish
the US leadership in spatiotemporal thinking and computing. The proposed center
will be established based upon the previous successes at each of the three sites
including: a) the Center for Intelligent Spatial Computing (CISC) at GMU for
spatiotemporal computing/software development; b) the Center for Spatial Studies
(CSS) at UCSB for spatial thinking and analyses; and c) the Center for
Geographic Analysis (CGA) at Harvard for spatiotemporal applications.

The Planning Meeting will solicit input from potential Center members and
develop projects and priorities for research. There are existing programs at the
three campuses with potential overlap, but the mission of the new Center would
be to integrate these technologies into a comprehensive spatiotemporal theory
and applications. Research results and success stories will be disseminated
through publications in relevant spatiotemporal venues as well as among the
center member sites for adoption and outreach. The PIs plan to include leading
relevant professional organizations to help broadcast the research results and
recruit new members through their organizational channels. The PIs also intend
to collaborate with complementary I/UCRCs to broaden the impact of the proposed
center's research results.
