9600125 McBay This project will continue to provide experiences in the Federal
sector for five undergraduate students. Participating students will spend 10
weeks in the Washington, DC area during the summer of 1996 and return to their
home institutions for additional experiences during the academic year.
Experiences for the students during the summer include: a two-day pre-internship
placement; and a two-day post-internship reflection period. During the nine-week
period, interns will be guided by their mentors in the work setting. The post-
internship period will take place at the QEM offices and will involve students
and their mentors.
