The regulation of the outgrowth of nerve processes, and their guidance to
appropriate targets, is an important element of the developmental program
responsible for generating the circuitry of the adult nervous system. During
development the tips of neuronal processes, the growth cones, undergo a period
of rapid outgrowth. Unknown at this time, however, are the mechanisms that
initiate the transition to the rapid outgrowth phase. The preliminary result
that form the basis for this research is the finding that a specific enzyme
accumulates at a high level in the growth cone just prior to the onset of rapid
outgrowth. The studies that will be performed are designed to determine if this
enzyme induces the nerve process to undergo outgrowth, and the possible
mechanisms whereby this induction occurs. The results will be of fundamental
importance in understanding the processes that are involved in guiding the
processes of nerve cells to their appropriate targets during development.
