This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Minority Serving -
Cyberinfrastructure Consortium (MS-CC) is a collaborative initiative to improve
cyberinfrastructure at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs),
Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs)
and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). In collaboration with Internet2
and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, MS-CC is developing
mechanisms to increase access to cyberinfrastructure resources, funding, and
professional development opportunities for faculty, staff, and students at
HBCUs, TCUs, HSIs, and other MSIs. MS-CC is taking an agile and adaptive
approach to operating as a consortium, with a long-term commitment to learning
and adjusting based on successes and lessons learned, matched to the diverse
size and missions of these colleges and universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key
outcome of this grant is the formalization of a vibrant community of practice
across MS-CC campuses that involves collaboration on cyberinfrastructure,
education, and research applications. This grant enables HBCUs, TCUs, HSIs and
other MSIs to accomplish together what they cannot do separately. The MS-CC is
broadening participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) by historically underrepresented groups in the United States’ research
enterprise, enabling new perspectives to emerge and expand capabilities for the
nation. MS-CC is advancing our nation’s economic growth, national security and
global prosperity in ways that reflect the unique expertise and talent from
HBCUs, TCUs, HSIs and other MSIs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
