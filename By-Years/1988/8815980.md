This is a 4 year research program to elucidate the mechanism of regulation of
enzymes controlling photosynthesis. One pivotal mechanism is the cytosolic
fructose-2,6-bisphosphate system that regulates sucrose synthesis and breakdown
in leaves. The objectives are to: (1) purify and characterize at the protein and
gene levels newly identified leaf enzymes that synthesize and degrade
fructose-2,6-bisphosphate; (2) determine whether these same activities of
nonphotosynthetic (sink) tissues containing amyloplasts reside on enzymes
similar to those of leaves. In parallel, studies will be continued on the
chloroplast ferredoxin-thioredoxin system, a protein-mediated mechanism that
links light to the regulation of enzymes functional in photosynthesis and
related processes. These studies will (1) deduce the importance of catalytically
active thiols in the photoregulation of target enzymes in isolated chloroplasts
and leaves, and (2) characterize the remaining poorly understood component of
this system--the novel enzyme ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase (FTR)--with
respect to mechanism of action, crystal structure, and EPR/redox properties.
This research will increase our understanding of how plants synthesize and store
starch and sucrose, the major reservoirs of edible carbohydrate.***
