ECS-9710631/9711231 Prem Kumar/Martin Fejer This proposal is to develop compact
and reliable sources of highly-squeezed light using lithium niobate waveguides.
The proposed experiments rely on traveling-wave degenerate second-harmonic
generation and optical pamaretric amplification exploiting the (2 nonlinearity
of lithium niobate. The group has done a theoretical work on this subject and
predicting the squeezing of both the fundamental and the second harmonic fields
even in the presence of phase mismatch. The work in the present proposal is to
build the waveguide devices and to verify the theoretical prediction. An
integrated device that can produce squeezed light to expedite the transfer of
such research into devices for practical applications. The development of such a
source would remove an important barriers to the application of squeezed light.
The PI has submitted a revised work statement and the corresponding budget for
one year. The Program Directors have reviewed the work statement and the revised
budget. The proposal is also being submitted from Stanford University with an
identical project description, but with budgetary details relevant to the work
to be carried out a Stanford. The funds sought by the Stanford proposal are
included in the budget as a subaward.
