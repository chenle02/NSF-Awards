The goals of the current project are to (1) attract middle school and high
school girls to the study of mathematics and to nurture and support their
interest in this discipline; (2) give the middle school and high school female
participants the chance to interact with college level women pursuing science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) degrees, women faculty in STEM
disciplines, and professional women from industry, government or the financial
sector; and (3) assist teachers by providing new ideas for teaching mathematics
to girls and underrepresented minorities. These will be pursued through the
activities of the national network of Sonia Kovalevsky Mathematics Days and the
participation of the Association for Women in Mathematics at the 2012 USA
Science and Engineering Festival.

The proposed activities will include a projected total of 3,050 middle school
and high school girls (1,250 middle school and high school girls will be served
by the Sonia Kovalevsky Days Program and the rest will be the participants at
the USA Science and Engineering Festival) and 150 mathematics teachers in the
growing national mentoring network involving women faculty, and graduate,
undergraduate, high school and middle school women students interested in
mathematics. These activities will help develop awareness of job opportunities
and possible career paths for middle school and high school women students
interested in mathematics and they will attract women to the study of
mathematics by providing women student participants with competent and engaging
mathematical instruction intertwined with strong mentorship by undergraduate and
graduate women students in STEM disciplines who are in position of scientific
leadership at the college level.
