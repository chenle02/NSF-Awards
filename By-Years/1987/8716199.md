Non-heme active sites are found in a variety of mono- and binuclear iron
proteins involved in a wide range of biological functions. Containing metal ion
sites of unusual ligation and geometry, these proteins often exhibit unique
spectral features quite different from those of small molecule transition metal
complexes. It has been Dr. Solomon's goal to understand active site spectral
features in terms of geometric and electronic structure and to define their
contributions to reactivity. He now plans to further characterize the electronic
structure of binuclear non-heme iron proteins including hemerythrin,
ribonucleotide reductase, acid phosphatase and methane monooxygenase through the
use of variable temperature and variable field magnetic circular dichroism,
circular dichroism and adsorption spectroscopy techniques.
