A central problem in studies in science, technology and society concerns the
relationships between technological changes and changes in attitudes and
behaviors, values, and social policy. This research aims to monitor one set of
such changes, namely, those associated with increased ability at genetic
forecasting. Because these technological developments are relatively new, the
investigation can attempt to trace their impact on attitudes and values from the
beginning. The proposed study will analyse three interrelated developments:
reporting about genetic screening and related issues in the mass media;
positions toward genetic screening taken by a variety of interest groups; and
public knowledge, attitudes, and values related to genetic screening, as
measured by personal interviews with a national sample of adults. The project
allows 80 pilot interviews and one baseline survey of a national sample, which
can be repeated in future years. Developments in biotechnology and the way these
developments are communicated to the public will be monitored in selected mass
media indexes as well as some specialized publications. A small social survey of
potential interest groups likely to represent a spectrum of views will also be
undertaken. Results of the project will be disseminated in published papers and
public and professional presentations. The data and associated materials will be
appropriately archived. This project addresses an important issue. The principal
investigator is very well qualified, as are her advisors. It is likely that
follow-on efforts will continue after the period of this award. The project is
designed well and plans for the development, dissemination, and archiving of
results are appropriate. University support is good. An award in the total
amount of $144,871 is recommended. Of this amount, $75,000 will be made
available immediately.
