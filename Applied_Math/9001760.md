This research will focus on four areas: 1) integrability theory for linear
differential systems and perturbation theory for the feedback linearization
equations of nolinear control theory. This work will support the program of
engineering research of nonlinear control of air-space-craft at NASA-Ames
Research Center directed by Dr. George Meyer. This research was cited in the
recent NSF Report on Control Theory as a prime example of the practical success
of the application of geometric methodology. 2) Geometric and sheaf-theoretic
methodology in the knowledge-representation and computation theory side of
computer science. This will provide mathematical support for the Discrete Event
System and Artificial Intelligence research. 3) Lie- theoretic methods in
numerical analysis developing new geometric and Lie-theoretic methodology for
the numerical algorithms of linear algebra and differential equations. 4)
Infinite pseudogroups in elementary particle physics looking for the ntural
mathematical synthesis of String and Standard Model gauge theories, utilizing
the Cartan-Matshushima-Guillemin-Sternberg- Conn theory of structure of infinite
Lie pseudogroups.
