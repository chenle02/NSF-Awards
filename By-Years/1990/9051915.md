The Earth Science curriculum at Pacific Lutheran University is being enhanced by
the development of an upper division course in geophysics and the expansion and
modification of the content of several other existing courses. For students to
experience the practical aspects of geophysics, the department is acquiring a
state-of-the-art seismograph, an proton magnetometer, a laptop computer, an
8-color pen plotter, a digitizer, and software packages to store, manipulate,
process, and model geophysical data. In addition, computer applications of
geophysics projects and related courses are being stressed in order to better
prepare students for future geological careers. The university will contribute
an amount equal to the award.
