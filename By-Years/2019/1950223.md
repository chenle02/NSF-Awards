This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
Sites program in the SBE Directorate. It has both scientific and societal
benefits in addition to integrating research and education. Cutting edge
research in cognitive science and artificial intelligence requires
interdisciplinary training that is not available at all universities, especially
those that serve minorities typically under-represented in research. The
Language, Cognition, and Computation Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) program at Stanford University aims to address this challenge. It provides
talented undergraduates from diverse backgrounds with an opportunity to do
mentored cognitive science research in top laboratories, paired with a
supportive program framework that includes technical training, professional
development, and academic discussion. The goals of this program are to: 1. Train
the next generation of researchers in the study of language, computation, and
cognition; 2. Help promising students discover the excitement and value of
research; 3. Develop new, innovative, ambitious student-led projects in member
labs; and 4. Support the interdisciplinary cognitive science research community
at Stanford and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive science and its core
disciplines – psychology, linguistics, and computer science – are seeing a major
convergence around themes of uncertainty and learning. As psychology and
linguistics are becoming more computational, computation is returning to its
cognitive roots. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the recent artificial
intelligence boom: AI techniques developed in psychology decades ago have
undergone a resurgence in machine learning. Students in the REU program will
contribute to research in these areas through mentored research via cognitive
experiments with adults and children, theoretical development, use of artificial
intelligence models, and statistical analysis of pre-existing
datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
