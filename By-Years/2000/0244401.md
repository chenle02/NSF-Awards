Abstract:

The principal investigator and his collaborators will embark on his study of
arithmetic geometry of Shimura varieties of symplectic and unitary type. After
the development of the p-adic deformation theory of automorphic forms on
reductive groups admitting Shimura varieties, one should now be able to fathom
its full implication in more arithmetic research in algebraic number theory. We
pursue the following goals: 1. construction of p-adic automorphic L-functions of
general linear groups; 2. proof of non-vanishing modulo a given prime p of such
L-values; 3. determination of divisibility by p of the L-functions; 4. possible
proof of the anticyclotomic main conjectures in an non-abelian setting. In
addition to these main projects, the investigator will study jointly with his
graduate students, the zeta function of Shimura varieties twisted by non-soluble
mod p Galois representations and Hilbert's twelfth problem over general totally
real fields.

A systematic study of elliptic modular forms whose coefficients are (p-adic)
analytic functions was started by the principal investigator and has been
developed into a deformation theory of automorphic forms on larger classical
groups. The elliptic theory has found numerous profound applications. For
example, it was used as an essential ingredient of a proof of Iwasawa's
conjecture by Wiles, of the proof of longstanding Fermat's last theorem and the
Shimura-Taniyama conjecture by Wiles and R. Taylor and of a proof of the Artin
conjecture of many non-soluble two dimensional Artin representations by R.
Taylor and his collaborators. The principal investigator will pursue such
applications in a more general framework of automorphic forms on classical
groups. This would results new cases of non-abelian class number formulas (that
is, a proof of some main conjectures of automorphic Iwasawa theory) which
connect purely arithmetically defined invariants to purely analytically defined
values of zeta functions (thus opening a way of computing such numbers by
analytic means).
