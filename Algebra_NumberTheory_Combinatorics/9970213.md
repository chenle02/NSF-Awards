SALTMAN 9970213

Professor Saltman proposes to study questions concerning division algebras and
invariant fields. In the area of division algebras, he will study questions that
all involve ways of describing these objects. One series of questions concern
special, so called semidirect product, division algebras with arbitrary ground
field. He is asking whether they are even more special cyclic algebras. Another
series of questions in involve considering general division algebras with
special ground fields, in this case function fields of curves over p-adics, and
asking whether they are cyclic. The second area of study of Professor Saltman,
invariant fields, will also have two strands. The first series of questions
concern trying to use Galois cohomology to show certain of these fields are
nonrational. The second series of questions involve simply studying these
invariant fields and, for example, investigating division algebras with these
invariant fields as center. Division algebras are simple objects that have been
studied for over a hundred years. The basic idea is to consider finite
dimensional vector spaces with a product that is well behaved. That is, the
product is associative and, as in the real numbers, every nonzero element has an
inverse, but the product is noncommutative (i.e. a times b is not b times a). It
turns out the these objects embody deep properties of their centers which are
the more familiar ``fields'' like the rationals or the reals. Describing all
division algebras with a fixed center is really saying something deep about the
arithmetic of this center. There are ``generic'' or very general division
algebras whose properties in some ways reflect the properties of all division
algebras. Their centers are, however, hard to understand so called invariant
fields. One can directly study these invariant fields and thereby understand
more about division algebras. One can use, as tools in this study, a whole array
of mathematics including algebraic geometry, Galois cohomology, and algebraic
K-theory.
