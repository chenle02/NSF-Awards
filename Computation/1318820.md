This project aims to develop algorithmically scalable high-order numerical
techniques. The essential components consist of numerically-constructed one-
dimensional basis functions, which correspond to a set of optimal bases in the
function space in some sense. Expansion bases for higher dimensions are then
developed from such functions. Methods employing these new bases exhibit
superior properties in terms of numerical efficiency and algorithmic
scalability.

The investigator develops techniques that make computer simulations of physical
processes both very accurate and very fast. These computer simulations permeate
essentially every aspect of modern life. They are indispensable and critical to,
for example, the design of airplanes and spacecrafts, discovery and design of
new materials, understanding and prediction of severe weather conditions such as
tornadoes and hurricanes, understanding and prevention of oil spills. The
significance of the project lies in that the techniques developed herein can
significantly reduce the time to acquire the solutions in simulations, and
simultaneously substantially increase the simulation accuracy.
