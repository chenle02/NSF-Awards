There are large reliable differences in probability judgments made by
individuals in Western countries like the United States and those in numerous
Asian countries. Most differences pertain to calibration. (Good calibration
exists, for example, if about 40% of the events that are assigned probability
judgements of 40% actually happen.) However, differences in discrimination have
been documented too. (Discrimination is the ability of judgements to sharply
distinguish instances when a target event will occur from those when it will
not.) Several potential explanations of the observed differences are to be
tested in experiments with subject groups in the United States and a number of
Asian locations. One hypothesis is that the effects are limited to judges'
directly reported assessments, which are not their opinions. Another claims that
the differences are restricted to a narrow class of events. A third explanation
says that they reflect societal differences in the relative importance of
various aspects of judgment quality. The hypothesis of primary interest asserts
that the effects rest on cognitive processing habits rooted in different
educational practices. The proposed studies promise insights about universal
judgment mechanisms as well as mechanisms peculiar to given cultures. They
should provide guidance about problems in cross- national communication and
cooperation and the transferability of decision technologies.
