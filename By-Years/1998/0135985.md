Nerve cells (neurons) in the mammalian brain often have elaborate treelike
branching of fine cellular extensions called dendritic arbors, which receive the
chemical signals of activity from other neurons. Like an antenna, the location
and number of branches on a dendritic arbor organize the pattern of the afferent
input, so the decision about where and when to form a branch is critical. The
intracellular structures of these dendrites include cytoskeletal components
called actin and microtubules, and these components are dynamic, changing the
dendritic structure over time by elongation or retraction or stabilization of
the branches at particular points. It remains unclear what the mechanisms are
that determine the patterning of these often highly specific arbors during
development and growth. To approach this question, this project combines several
recent technical advances that give the ability to 1) accelerate dendritic
development significantly in cultured neurons from the hippocampal region of the
brain; 2) follow the expression and trafficking of proteins and organelles
within the living neuron by high-resolution microscopic time-lapse imaging; and
3) to create patterned substrates, using novel creative nanofabrication
techniques to provide external cues for cellular development. The experiments
will determine the roles of actin and microtubule dynamics, and the influence of
external cues such as cell adhesion molecules and location of afferent contacts
from other neurons, on dendritic branching.&lt;br/&gt; Results will provide a
major advance on an important topic of neural development where fundamental
information is still unknown, and the interdisciplinary approach will enhance
interactions between biology and engineering. The excellent integration of
educational activities with the research will have a major impact on research
experience in this liberal arts college, and even on the local public
schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
