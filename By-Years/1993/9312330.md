9312330 Dwoskin The proposed symposium and follow on workshop will examine the
forces shaping engineering research in academia in the US. The goal of the
project is to characterize the changing demands on academic engineering research
(changes coming both from outside academia and from within) and to identify
potentially effective responses to such changes on policymakers. The symposim
and workshop will be held in conjunction with the National Meeting of the
National Academy of Engineering at the Academies' Beckman Center in Irvine,
California in February 1994. The symposium will be designed to allow the various
involved parties to put forth their views. The papers presented at the symposium
and discussions a the workshop and the smaller, follow on workshop will be the
primary basis for an assessmsnt by a committee of NAE members of the changing
demands and possible responses.
