Twelve IBM compatible computers are being procured. These computers are used in
five undergraduate laboratories: Human Learning and Memory, The Psychology of
Learning, Perception, Social Psychology, and Tests and Measurements. They are
also used in statistics recitations, and by students conducting independent
research projects. The technical capabilities of these computers, and the
availability of off-the-shelf software, allows us to develop new laboratories
and instructional modules, that cannot currently be developed. The institution
is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
