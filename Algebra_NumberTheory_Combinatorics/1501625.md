Polynomials are mathematical functions that describe many different kinds of
behavior in mathematics, physics, and engineering. They are concrete enough to
be easily manipulated by hand or computer, and easy to understand
mathematically, but also flexible enough to model many different situations in
nature and science. Commutative algebra and algebraic geometry are the large
branches of mathematics concerned primarily with understanding polynomials and
the geometric shapes they define. Their broader applications range from the
computer aided design used in the automotive and entertainment industries to the
error correcting codes used in many digital media. This project in commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry focuses on basic research in these fields, while
broadly training a diverse group of PhD and undergraduate students in
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

One specific type of algebra to be investigated are cluster algebras, which are
commutative rings defined iteratively that have turned up in many branches of
mathematics and physics, including the classical field of total positivity for
matrices, the representation theory of lie algebras, number theory, Teichmuller
theory, mirror symmetry, Poisson Geometry, discrete dynamical systems, string
theory, wiring diagrams and networks, and more. The specific proposed research
involves 1) developing the commutative algebra of cluster algebras, including
basic notions such as localization and blowing up, as well as prime
characteristic features such as test ideals; 2) reduction to prime
characteristic and the iteration of the Frobenius map to understand
singularities, cohomology and other features of algebraic varieties and
commutative rings, studying invariants defined via Frobenius in prime
characteristic, their relationship to cluster structures and their potential use
in birational geometry; and 3) settling a question of Kollar on the behavior of
local cohomology under base change (the main application of which is to reduce
questions about maps between local Picard groups of complex varieties to
characteristic p). The PI's role as a senior researcher is an integral part of
the project: training the next generation of algebraists is woven into the very
fabric of the research and one of the project's main objectives.
