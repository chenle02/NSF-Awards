The University of Massachusetts will plan and convene a small invitational
conference to stimulate science and mathematics department faculty at major
research universities to become actively involved in the scientific preparation
of teachers by redesigning introductory science and mathematics courses. The
conference will seek to produce collaboration among scientists, mathematicians,
educators, and cognitive scientists in modernizing course content, incorporating
recent educational research results, and in the case of science courses,
providing opportunities for hands-on experiences. If the conference is
successful, the result should be the development of introductory science courses
in which elementary education majors and liberal arts majors will gain a better
understanding of science concepts and the nature of scientific inquiry. Cost
sharing for the conference by the University of Massachusetts is 20%.
