Proposal #9401918 Staroselsky The goal of this work is to develop mature
computational simulation tools to allow scaling up the designs of laboratory
size or semi-industrial granular flow system to full scale industrial
dimensions. Practical applications range from the design of chutes to hoppers to
bins and other systems for transporting bulk solids. The specific goal of Phase
II is to develop user friendly, general geometry and highly efficient computer
codes for the simulation of the dynamics of these flows. This work involves
combined analytical and numerical of the increasingly dense and complex granular
material with real-particle effects. The theoretical work will be based on
state-of-the-art statistical-mechanical methods, an effort which will culminate
in the development of reliable macroscopic equations for the pertinent
macrofields. The numerical studies will be concerned with the development of
improved computational and diagnostic means. Particle dynamics molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations with a few million particles will be issued to test
the macroscopic equations and to improve the results obtained regarding the
single-particle and two-particle distribution functions. The results studies
will be used to develop both a finite-volume continuum mechanical code and a
complementary, highly efficient MD code. The finite-volume code for bulk solid
transport analysis will facilitate the scaling-up of small and medium-scale
designs of chutes, hoppers, and bins to full-scale industrial applications.
