The overall objective of the proposed research is to characterize a class of
trans-acting regulatory genes that produce an inverse dosage response on the
white eye color locus. A saturation mutagenesis involving hybrid dysgenesis,
ethyl methanesulfonate and X-rays will be conducted to recover transposon
insertions, point mutants and chromosomal rearrangements in inverse regulators
effective upon white. Secondly, the autosomes will be screened for segmental
trisomics that alter the expression of white. A previously isolated mutant in an
inverse regulator of white will be used to determine the tissues in which the
recessive recombination. Other genes expressed in the eye will be tested to
determine whether these are affected by the inverse regulator that works on
white. A refined set of white promoter fusions will be constructed and
transformed into the Drosophila germline. These will be tested with the inverse
regulator to determine the sequences of the white gene required to respond.
Selected examples of inverse regulators that are P element insertion mutants
affecting white will be cloned and used to analyze the gene products via DNA
sequencing and protein fusion productions. Finally, the involvement of the
inverse effect in X chromosomal dosage compensation will be examined by
determining whether white locus regulatory mutants exhibit dosage compensation
in metafemales and by conducting a reversion analysis on white- ivory, a non-
compensating allele that does not respond to inverse regulators, to establish
whether compensation and response to inverse regulators is correlated. An
understanding of how gene expression is regulated is central to insight into
genetic mechanisms and development. This proposal contains innovative
experiments which should result in increased knowledge relating to mechanisms
involved in gene dosage compensation and trans-acting regulatory loci in
Drosophila.
