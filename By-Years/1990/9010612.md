This study will explain how different types of living arran- gements affect
future education, employment, and earnings of teenaged mothers. Most previous
research highlights the negative impact of teenaged child bearing on women's
economic status. However new findings reported by researchers at the University
of Pennsylvania who have followed more than 400 teenaged mothers for 2 years
show that many teenaged mothers break out of poverty by the time they reach
midlife. This study hypothesizes that the types of households in which teenaged
mothers live during adoles- cence is an important determinant of which among
them are abler to complete their education, find steady jobs, and become self-
sufficient adult. Data for this study come from a 1979-1988 nationally
representative survey that has interviewed several thousand young people of both
sexes annually from adolescence through their 20s. This study is significant
because it will show which types of living arrangements promote or inhibit
economic independence following parenthood. It will show the importance of
social supports in shaping the lives of young mothers. Findings will increase
understanding of the household structures of young women who are
disproportionately at risk of becoming welfare dependent.
