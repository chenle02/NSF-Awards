For many years, the Physics Advanced Laboratory course at Reed College did not
fulfill its goal of familiarizing junior-level students with the concerns of
contemporary experimental physics research. Rather than a systematic
introduction to experimental research, it was chiefly an advanced electronics
course. The faculty have recently redesigned the Advanced Laboratory to (1) more
effectively expose junior-level physics majors to the concerns and techniques of
modern experimental physics research, (2) develop students' skills as autonomous
researchers, and (3) construct an instructional laboratory in a cost-effective
manner. The laboratory consists of flexible, component-based research stations
that can be configured for both guided experiments that model well-designed
research projects, and, with alterations to the experimental parameters,
independent student projects. In order to broaden the scope of the Advanced
Laboratory, resources for experiments in astronomy and radio astronomy are being
added. There is a growing consensus that research-based science curricula,
involving hands-on, investigative modes of learning, greatly aid the development
of scientific maturity in undergraduate students.
