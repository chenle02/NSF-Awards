The field of scanning probe microscopy is expanding rapidly. Scanning tunneling
and atomic force microscopes are being utilized in applications in industry and
research in the fields physics, chemistry, and materials science. To maintain
the excellence of our departments, the university is obtaining scanning probe
microscopes and integrating them into several laboratory courses. The targeted
courses are Modern Physics Laboratory, Physical Chemistry Laboratory, Advanced
Laboratory, and Surface Science. Students enroll in these courses during their
sophomore, junior, and senior years. Since most of these courses are required of
the respective majors, students use the equipment in multiple courses. The
equipment can also be used in student research, in conjunction with independent
research courses, and for a summer research program.
