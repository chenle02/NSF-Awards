This award provides a continuation for the University of Arizona
Industry/University Cooperative Research for Water Quality. The center
investigates physical, chemical and microbial processes that affect the quality
of surface and subsurface waters including potable supplies. Good quality
drinking water is defined as "water with acceptable purity, taste, and odor
characteristics, which is safe with respect to human health and welfare."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goals of the Center are: 1) to improve the
flow of scientific knowledge that affects water quality, from the University of
Arizona to industry, government agencies, and the general public; 2) to develop
support for water quality research; 3) to provide graduate students with a broad
industry perspective; 4) to inform and educate the public regarding water
quality issues; and 5) to ultimately achieve self-sufficiency by bonding with
long-term industry and government partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature of
the research has focused on the following six areas: Water Security; Fate and
Remediation of Commercial Industrial Contamination; Agrochemical Products and
Practices that Influence Water Quality; Municipal Waste Treatment and Reuse;
Mining; and Potable Water Quality. &lt;br/&gt;
