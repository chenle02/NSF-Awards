This project will improve the subject matter and teaching back-ground of 25
junior high school and senior high school mathematics teachers in the Chicago
area. The project will be conducted as separate workshops for each of two years.
Topics will include algebraic content, linear and quadratic equations, Pascal's
triangle, MuMath, word problems, geometric concepts, probability, and computer
graphics. The summer workshop will be seven weeks in length. Each daily session
will combine content and discussion of ways the materials can be used in regular
mathematics classes. During the academic year, the participants' classes will be
observed in order to provide constructive feedback. A conference will be
conducted during January.
