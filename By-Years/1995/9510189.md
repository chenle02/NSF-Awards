9510189 Storm This award from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program
provides funds to enable attendance of the 1995 Gordon Conference on Analytical
Chemistry by assistant professors at the beginning of their careers and by a
special group of graduate students who have won highly-competitive one-year
fellowships for their research in analytical chemistry. The conference theme,
analytical chemistry in small domains, is an extremely important one from both
academic and practical points of view. For example, obtaining data concerning
the chemical composition of the boundary layer between two parts of an
electronic microcircuit is a formidable research challenge, but is of utmost
importance in understanding the action of the circuit and improving its
performance.
