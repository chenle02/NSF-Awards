The proposed work is an initial step toward developing synthetic polymeric
sorbents that mimic biological binding mechanisms. Proteins exhibiting multi-
interactive mechanisms and competition at a particular site are selectively
satisfied by those protein materials which most closely fit energetically a
specific binding point. The research will initially demonstrate a separating
agent capable of selectively absorbing solutes that require mechanisms which
utilize both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction. To develop improved
separating agents by mimicing nature requires a thorough understanding of
relevant mechanistic interactions. Although a large amount of information is
being generated on how proteins bind to molecules, there is considerably less
knowledge concerning solid-liquid adsorption mechanisms. Thus, it is proposed to
initially examine three binding mechanisms; hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic
interactions and charge transfer complexation. Finally, in the later stages of
the work it follows that these interactions will be coupled to develop
separating agents which mimic biological binding. To provide a better
understanding of these phenomena as well as to permit the extrapolation of these
results, appropriate thermodynamic descriptions have been developed.
