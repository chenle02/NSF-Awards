This grant permits Dr. Cerling to examine the extent to which soil carbonates
contain useful climatic information. It is possible that the stable isotopic
composition of paleosol carbonate may provide a direct measure of climatic and
ecological conditions for non.marine sites. Since oxygen isotope composition in
rainwater is affected by temperature and may vary by almost 20 per mil if this
is perserved in paleosol carbonate it may provide a potential climatic
indicator. The isotopic composition of soil carbon varies by about 15 per mil
and is primarily a function of the proportion of C4 plants in the local setting.
Since this vegetation is also influenced by climate carbon isotope ratio of soil
carbonate may also reflect climate. Dr. Cerling will collect samples along both
latitudinal and altitudinal transcents to document variation in the isotopic
composition of modern soil carbonate which is due to ecological and climatic
factors. He will also measure the isotopic composition of soil organic matter
and respired soil carbon dioxide to document important controlling processes.
Finally he will analyze a series of anthropologically significant soils from
both Africa and Asia. This research is important because, if successful, it will
provide an important anthropological tool. To understand how humans developed it
is essential to understand the environments in which they lived and how these
changed over time. While techniques are well established for marine sediments,
terrestrial materials are much more difficult to interpret and very little work
has been done. This project should help to remedy the situation.***//
