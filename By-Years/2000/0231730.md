Morse is working on a project involving a filtration for &lt;br/&gt;the space of
symmetric functions that depends on a positive &lt;br/&gt;integer k. In earlier
work, Lapointe, Lascoux, and Morse &lt;br/&gt;introduced new families of
polynomials that lie in these subspaces,&lt;br/&gt;and they made a number of
assertions relying on their characterization &lt;br/&gt;of these elements. Among
these conjectures is one stating &lt;br/&gt;that their elements form a basis for
the k-subspaces of the symmetric &lt;br/&gt;function space and that the
Macdonald polynomials expand positively on &lt;br/&gt;this new basis. More
generally, their claims lead to a family of &lt;br/&gt;positivity conjectures
which will provide a natural refinement for &lt;br/&gt;many fundamental concepts
in symmetric function theory. For example, &lt;br/&gt;their elements appear to
play a role in the k-subspaces analogous to &lt;br/&gt;the important role that
the Schur functions play for the symmetric &lt;br/&gt;function space. Morse is
working on proving these conjectures and is also &lt;br/&gt;investigating the
possible representation theoretic interpretation &lt;br/&gt;for these
polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of symmetric functions is a
classical part of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics with a wide variety of applications in
fields&lt;br/&gt;including physics, engineering, and computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;Recent development in the study of symmetric
functions&lt;br/&gt;was made with the introduction in 1988 of a new family
of&lt;br/&gt;symmetric functions called the Macdonald
polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;Remarkably, these polynomials have also been found to
play an&lt;br/&gt;important role in areas such as geometry, representation
&lt;br/&gt;theory, and many-body physics. The successful completion of
&lt;br/&gt;this project would prove important properties of the Macdonald
&lt;br/&gt;polynomials and more generally, would provide a natural refinement
&lt;br/&gt;for the fundamental concepts in symmetric function theory.
