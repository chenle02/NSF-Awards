This award will support student travel and participation in a workshop focussing
on climate science and science policy organized by the American Meteorological
Society. The workshop will be held from June 2-11, 2002 in Washington, D.C. and
participants include seasoned researchers, new investigators, and students. The
workshop participants will explore, among other issues, the nexus of
communication between those who generate climate data and those who use such
information for formulating science policy. One area of focus for the workshop
is examining the influence of paleoclimatic research in guiding our knowledge of
climate variability and in formulating science policy.
