This award provides funding for participation in the conference "2018 Shanks
Workshop on Mathematical Aspects of Fluid Dynamics" that will be held March
24-25, 2018 at Vanderbilt University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference
focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of partial
differential equations and mathematical fluid dynamics. A number of
distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.
This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups,
researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and
participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make
this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different
