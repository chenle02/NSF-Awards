This Presidential Faculty Fellow Award will support interdisciplinary work in
interstellar chemistry. The principal investigator, Dr. Lucy Ziurys, will
perform high resolution millimeter and submillimeter spectroscopy in the
laboratory of metal-containing free radicals, and then search for these metal
compounds with radiotelescopes to establish their abundances and distributions
in the interstellar medium.
