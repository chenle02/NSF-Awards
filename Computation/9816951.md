The investigator develops new numerical methods for the solution of problems
involving the interaction of flexible boundaries and the incompressible fluids
in which they are immersed. Typical applications of such problems are found in
biology and physiology. The approaches pursued include Lagrangian and Eulerian
methods based on impulse variables, which combine elements from other numerical
techniques such as vortex and projection methods. A hybrid particle method is
developed for high Reynolds number flows. In this case the accumulated effect of
immersed boundary forces is accounted for through the evolution of impulse
variables. The viscous effects are modeled using a deterministic method for the
diffusion of vorticity using vortex monopoles. Finite-difference grid-based
methods are also developed for the solution of the these problems in moderate
Reynolds number flows. Making use of the Lagrangian representation of the
flexible boundaries, the investigator and his collaborators use ideas from the
Lagrangian impulse method to describe the evolution of the immersed boundaries
within the framework of the grid solution. The researchers highlight
improvements to existing numerical methods for this type of problems.

The numerical solution of fluid flow problems with thin flexible moving
boundaries is motivated partly by the wide range of potential applications in
biology and physiology. For example, the membranes of the inner ear, the walls
of the heart or lungs, muscle tissue, swimming jellyfish and eels can be modeled
as thin membranes embedded in a fluid. These examples are part of everyday life
and yet many of their technical aspects are not fully understood. The
development and availability of reliable numerical simulations that could help
our understanding of such commonly occurring natural phenomena is of great
importance. Numerical methods can be used to conduct improved computer
simulations of new heart valve designs; computer simulations of collapsible
tubes with a fluid inside, such as arteries weakened by disease, can be studied;
efficiency in swimming motions of a single organism as well as the apparently
synchronized patterns of groups of animals can be analyzed; new propulsion
mechanisms can be devised. Undulatory motion, for example, is present in
organisms of a wide range of sizes because it is the preferred swimming mode of
spermatozoa as well as eels and snakes. The mathematical solution of such
problems lies at the crossroads of natural sciences, mathematical modeling and
scientific computing.
