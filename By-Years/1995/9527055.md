This project will undertake a statistical investigation of the substorm
expansion initiation and evolution utilizing the maximum time resolution ground
and space based observations available. The purpose of this investigation will
be to document in detail the average of substorms with great precision and to
resolve outstanding questions regarding the time sequence of substorm phenomena.
Results of this project should allow substorm model predictions to be evaluated
and should also place significant constraints on the models themselves.
