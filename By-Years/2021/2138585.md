Databases with biological sequencing data hold a treasure trove of biological
data that can be used to aid experimental design and find relevant prior
experiments for new biological projects. However, these rapidly growing archives
are heavily under-utilized due to our inability to rapidly query the raw data
within them. Just as search engines transformed our ability to broadly and
deeply access information online, search indices have the potential to
revolutionize the ways in which sequencing data in these archives is used. In
this project methods to enable fast and easy access to these databases will be
developed. This will contribute to the “Googlification” of life-science data,
spurring broad scientific advances. Additionally, as part of the project, a
“Writing in CS” course as well as an exercise booklet for probabilistic analysis
of algorithms will be developed. Workshops on emerging methods for sequence
analysis will be organized, and training to underrepresented undergraduates,
graduate students and postdocs will be provided. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project advances research across all areas of life science that work with
sequencing data. It creates&lt;br/&gt;powerful indexing data structures and
querying algorithms for databases of sequencing experiments. This can allow
biologists to query sequencing databases to find experiments which express a
certain transcript of interest, show differential levels of expression between
two transcripts, contain a known splice junction or gene fusion, or contain a
small genome of interest. This project will facilitate a biologist to be able to
execute many biologically-stated queries on a database of raw DNA and RNA
sequencing experiments. The results of this project will be available on

reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
