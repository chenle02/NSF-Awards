The goal of this seminar series is to reestablish and continue the scientific
contacts between United States and U.S.S.R. researchers in the field of large-
scale mathematical optimization. Large-scale optimization has received renewed
interest and importance over the last ten years due to the research of Soviet
and United States mathematicians working on interior-point and special-structure
methods, and the introduction of parallel computers. This seminar series will
enable the two research communities to become updated in each others work and
pave the way for future cooperative research in the development of new
procedures and their application. A two- seminar series is scheduled. The first
will be held in College Park and the second in Moscow.
