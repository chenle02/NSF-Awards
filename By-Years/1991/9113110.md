HOL is a general theorem proving system developed at the University of
Cambridge. Developed as a mechanization of a higher-order logic, HOL is now
being used in a variety of applications ranging from hardware design
verification to reasoning about communication protocols. The purpose of this
workshop is to bring together the HOL user community to exchange ideas about the
future directions for HOL. The workshop topics include: progress in integrating
HOL into more traditional design and development environments; scrutiny of HOL
from logicians expert in higher-order logics; application of HOL as a formal
methods tool in verification.
