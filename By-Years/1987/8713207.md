A workshop was held at the University of Rochester on June 1 and 2, 1987 to
consider experiments in particle physics which do not involve the use of
accelerators. The workshop was open to all interested physicists and there was
wide international participation. About 180 physicists registered. This action
would cover part of the cost of publishing the proceedings. The topics covered
were: Large Underground Detectors, Solar Neutrinos, Cosmic Rays, Dark Matter,
TeV Gamma Rays, and Neutrinos from Supernova.
