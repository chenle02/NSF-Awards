There has been growing interest in non-equilibrium phase transitions, yet our
understanding of them is far from complete. The proposed research will explore
transitions far from equilibrium in several specific systems: fluid invasion,
magnetic domain wall motion, fluid spreading, friction, and shearing of solids
and fluids. In addition to allowing insight into basic features of non-
equilibrium transitions, the work will address systems of technological
importance. The first three processes are prototypical examples of interface
motion through disordered media. Disorder impedes interface motion and a finite
force is needed to initiate flow. Two types of critical phenomena have been
identified at the onset of motion: depinning and percolation. One goal of the
research will be a complete characterization of these transitions for specific
models. The variation of the depinning force, the critical exponents, and the
interface morphology with the spatial dimension and nature and strength of the
disorder will be explored. Phase transitions between different universality
classes will also be studied. Studies of friction and sheared systems will
explore the role of internal degrees of freedom in producing discontinuous phase
transitions. One focus will be the shear-induced melting transition in colloidal
suspensions. This work will also provide information about flow of solids under
high shear stresses. A second focus will be stick-slip friction - alternate
sticking and sliding between two surfaces. Stick-slip motion leads to squeaks in
hinges and to wear of moving parts. The proposed research will extend recent
studies which indicate that stick-slip friction is caused by periodic non-
equilibrium phase transitions.
