This award supports the research in algebraic geometry of Professor Andrew
Sommese of the University of Notre Dame. Dr. Sommese's project is to continue
his research on hyperplane sections of complex projective manifolds and the
projective classification of complex varieties. He will also continue his
studies of the zero-dimensional subschemes of smooth complex projective
varieties. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the
oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary
flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis
and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as
in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
