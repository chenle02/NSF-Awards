Focusing on "law-in-action" rather than "law-on-the-books," this project
examines the evolution of employer practices and policies during the initial
stages of implementation of a new workplace law. Theories from organizational
sociology and the sociology of law emphasize that the ultimate effects of laws
are significantly shaped at the interpretaton and implementation stages, though
these stages have not been studied as frequently as the legislative and judicial
processes. The introduction of a new, unprecedented law in Indiana creates an
unusual opportunity to study the evolution of legal sensemaking and compliance
in context. This award is made through the NSF's Small Grants for Exploratory
Research mechanism because timing is critical: data gathering must begin
quickly, during the initial implementation stage, before interpretations shift
and memories fade.

The specific law to be studied, Indiana Senate Bill 219, requires that, to the
extent possible, employers provide private space for women employees to pump
breast milk. In contrast to many enacted statutes that shape conditions of
employment, the implementation of SB 219 will be uncomplicated by pre-existing
policies, enabling the researcher to study how organizations respond to laws in
the absence of a status quo. The project will involve interviews and surveys as
well as archival data analysis.

This study will have both theoretical and practical implications. The project
will make fundamental contributions to the state of knowledge regarding how
organizations approach and implement new laws. Also, the new law studied in this
project relates to many ideas deemed important to American society: social
support for family decisions, the conflicts between public and private rights,
and tension between work life and family life. Greater understanding of how
organizations approach these topics, as well as of how they filter laws
generally, is necessary for more effective and appropriate law making in future.
