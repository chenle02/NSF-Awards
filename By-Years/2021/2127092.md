This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be an environmentally
friendly method for dyeing textiles, providing a cleaner alternative to the
toxic coloring agents that plague the $33B global dye market - starting with
indigo dyes. Brands and mills are eager for a solution that does not require the
industry to compromise between sustainability and performance. This project uses
microbial processes to reduce the need for key harmful chemicals in the dye
application process, thus minimizing the human and environmental damage caused
by denim dyeing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project addresses the
problem of hazardous conditions and toxic chemical usage in the indigo dye
industry. Indigo remains the sole blue dye for denim because of its beautiful
blue color and unique fading properties, which has not been successfully
replicated by any other dye molecule. This project aims to improve upon an
engineered microbial strain that produces an indigo dye precursor molecule via
fermentation; this precursor is then purified into a drop-in indigo dye ready
for denim mills to use. The objectives are to 1) engineer the microbe to produce
less of a toxic byproduct, 2) adapt the strain to increase its tolerance of the
final product, and 3) transition from an undefined, complex media composition to
a fully defined, more inexpensive medium. This will lead to a more efficient and
cost-effective process at scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
