Computational chemistry plays an increasingly important role in the development
of our "insight" into chemical and biological systems. Much of this change has
been fueled by the development of new methods in computational statistical
mechanics, e.g., molecular simulation methods for fluids and proteins, and
quantum chemistry. To insure continued progress in this area, access to modern
computers is vital. This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program
and the Instrumentation and Instrument Development Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University acquire, maintain and
operate a mini-supercomputer. The areas of research that will be enhanced by the
acquisition include: 1) Quadratic configuration interaction 2) Development and
evaluation of direct SCF methods 3) Development of thermodynamic simulation
methods and their application to biologically significant problems 4)
Development of theory of long-range electron transfer in thermally mobile
biological media.
