9730839 Tombrello This project utilizes a combined modeling-
simulation/experiment approach to advance understanding of cluster-atom
trajectories and track morphologies in solids from MeV cluster ions. Ion
implantation into semiconductors for doping and other processing continues in
prominence, and with multiple ion and cluster source availability basic
understanding of the fundamental processes involved can provide future guidance
for utilization in electronic/photonic materials processing. The overall
objective of the project is to employ computer simulations to extract basic
knowledge from laboratory experiments. Since the physics of the interaction
between the ion-ion cores of the cluster atoms is not known for clusters
traveling in solids, the simulations include this needed information only as a
parameter. By comparing the results with various experiments, increased
understanding of these interactions can then be gained. %%% The project
addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having
high potential technological relevance in semiconductor processing. The research
will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to
important aspects of electronic/photonic device and circuit fabrication. An
important feature of the program is the integration of research and education
through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically
significant area. ***
