The photosynthetic reaction center in which, on absorption of a photon of
light, an electron is forced to travel sequentially through various component
molecules making up the center, has a two-fold axis of symmetry. However, it is
surprising that the electron transfer follows an asymmetric pathway, travelling
down only one specific side of the symmetrical unit. Dr. Woodbury will combine
molecular genetic techniques with modern spectroscopic analysis techniques to
determine direction, kinetics and thermodynamics of the electron transport in an
attempt to explain this puzzling charge separation process.
