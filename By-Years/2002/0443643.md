With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Multiuser Instrumentation Acquisition (CRIF:MU) Program, the Department of
Chemistry at Mississippi State University will purchase a laser ablation -
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS). This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including 1) the analysis of the
composition of wsteforms produced with different stabilizers and processes in
nuclear waste stabilization studies; 2) monitoring of soil composition in
phytoremediation processes; 3) the determination of glaze and clay composition
in modern and archeological pottery; 4) the detection of impurities in
semiconductors materials; 5) the determination of leaching of metal ions from
bone replacement and dental implants into surrounding tissues; and 6) the
determination of the exact composition of aluminum alloys, to predict their
properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to
probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a
vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. These studies
will have a significant impact in environmental sciences and biochemistry.
