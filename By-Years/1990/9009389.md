The long range objective of this program is to develop cell culture procedures
that can be readily applied to improve the efficiency of producing monoclonal
antibodies. The proposal focuses on using engineering approaches to describe
cells at the metabolic level so that methods in which hybridoma cells utilize
energy to proliferate and produce monoclonal antibodies can be better understood
and more effectively controlled. It is proposed to integrate expertise from
three technological loci: biosensing, cell culturing, and mathematical modeling,
and to integrate these in order to improve processing procedures.
