This project will develop an educational infrastructure in New England to
provide science educators with background knowledge and equipment to prepare
students to work in the aquaculture industry and related businesses. The project
seeks to implement and expand existing aquaculture programs and to increase the
number of teachers and faculty in middle, secondary and postsecondary
institutions in New England who are knowledgeable in the sciences, technology
and use of laboratory equipment to enable students to learn about the emerging
aquaculture industry. The project will also adapt existing curricula and develop
new aquaculture curricula in topic areas where none currently exist.
