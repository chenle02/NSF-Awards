During the summer of 2002, western North America experienced one of the largest
forest fires in recorded history. The Biscuit Fire burned nearly one half
million acres of mostly pristine habitats in Oregon and California. This project
will exploit the mosaic of replicated burned and unburned sites left by this
fire, and apply an experimental approach to address general questions in
community ecology. Because the P.I.s had collected pre-burn data on the
structure of the plant and ant communities in this area, they are in a unique
position to follow trajectories of community re-assembly compared to initial
conditions. At replicated sites they will erect barriers to exclude ants, a
major seed dispersal agent, and test for effects on rates and trajectories of
plant community assembly, especially in isolated fens. This work will
significantly extend our knowledge on ant-plant community interactions and re-
assembly after catastrophic fire.
