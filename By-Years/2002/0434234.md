AST-0434234&lt;br/&gt;Babu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A vast range of statistical
problems arises in modern astronomical research, particularly due to the flood
of data produced by astronomical surveys at many wavebands. Equally important is
the great increase in the complexity of the data sets, and while the scientific
promise is tremendous, it depends critically on the ability to extract useful
knowledge. This is a multifaceted project encompassing interdisciplinary
astrostatistical research, with novel educational and outreach efforts. Specific
projects include maximum-likelihood and resampling methods, computational
algorithms for statistics for extremely large streaming datasets, the real-time
classification of variable objects, hidden Markov models for stellar activity
time series, and the treatment of missing data from small high-dimensionality
datasets. There will be a particular emphasis on addressing the needs of the
emerging Virtual Observatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the
development and offering of summer tutorials, both locally and on the Web,
providing improved access to advanced statistical procedures, hosting active
associates, and sponsoring astrostatistical conferences and sessions. Short
intensive courses will help in training of graduate students and young
researchers: advances in statistics will be brought into the toolbox of
practicing scientists.
