9529752 Rudnick This project will observe temperature (T) and salinity (S) in
the upper ocean and evaluate competing hypotheses about how T-S variability
along isopyclals, introduced by surface fluxes and advection, is reduced to
establish a T-S relationship. This area of investigation is of great importance
to understanding near-surface processes and their relationship to the large-
scale circulation, but remains virtually unexplored. Recent developments in
towed vehicles make this exploration possible now. Changes in the T-S
relationship and the density ratio with changing horizontal scale will be key
elements in distinguishing competing theories of T-S regulation. Field data will
be obtained using a depth-controllable, towed vehicle (SeaSoar) equipped with T,
S, and pressure sensors. Three different sampling strategies (constant depth,
isopycnal, and sawtooth) will be employed during a series of long (1000 km)
tows. ***
