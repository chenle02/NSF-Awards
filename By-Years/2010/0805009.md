This award will allow four US invited speakers to attend the Society of
Experimental Biology (SEB) Satellite meeting entitled Nuclear Envelope and Golgi
Cell Biology(http://www.sebiology.org/meetings/Marseille/Golgi.html) on 10 July
2008.The objective of the symposium is to bring together for the first time
researchers investigating the nuclear envelope (NE)and the Golgi in plants.
While the nuclear envelope is generally considered more related to the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and especially the outer nuclear envelope membrane
an extension of the ER, new lines of evidence indicate a hitherto unappreciated
connection between the NE and the Golgi in animal cells.

Because of the differences both in NE composition and Golgi mitotic biology in
plants, it is considered crucial to expose a group of plant biologists to this
concept and encourage both information exchange of current research findings and
the development of possible future projects to address this connection in
plants.
