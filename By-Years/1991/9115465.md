A study of the intermediate scale, time-dependent coupling of the solar wind,
magnetosphere and ionosphere is proposed. Such a study will allow for a detailed
investigation of how energy, momentum and mass is transferred from the solar
wind across the magnetopause, into the magnetosphere, and along auroral field
lines into the ionosphere. Both analytic and numerical techniques will be used
to describe the dynamics of localized reconnection at the magnetopause, and the
relation of reconnection to the impulsive penetration of plasma and to the
response of the magnetopause to dynamic pressure perturbations in the solar
wind. A previously developed numerical model will be used to describe the global
response of the magnetosphere to driving perturbations at the magnetopause. On a
more localized scale, a three-dimensional model is being developed to describe
the detailed interaction of auroral currents with the ionosphere. This model,
along with accompanying analytic theory, will be used to describe the trapping
of Alfven waves in the cavity formed by the sharp increase of the Alfven speed
above the ionosphere. The overall goal of this research program is the
understanding and modeling of the plasma processes which couple energy from the
solar wind to the ionosphere.
