This proposal focuses on the enzymatic synthesis of methyl chloride. Methyl
chloride transferase, an enzyme which has been recently discovered in Dr.
Hager's laboratory, catalyzes the synthesis of methyl chloride from
S-adenosylmethionine and chloride ion. Methyl chloride is the most abundant
halohydrocarbon in the upper atmosphere and thus becomes a potential candidate
for destruction of the ozone layer. The annual global emission rate of methyl
chloride from biological sources is estimated to be 5x106 tons. However, there
is scientific disagreement concerning the role of naturally occurring
halometabolites and man-made chloro- fluoro hydrocarbons (CFCs) in terms of
ozone destruction. %%% Methyl chloride transferase in marine algae and
halophytic plants may be a mechanism for the injection of massive amounts of
methyl chloride into the atmosphere. For example, ice plant grows abundantly on
a world-wide basis in temperate coastal regions, thus can be a major contributor
to atmospheric methyl chloride. The enzyme may also play a role in salt
tolerance of plants. Transformation of soy bean with the gene for the enzyme may
lead to the development of salt tolerant plants.
