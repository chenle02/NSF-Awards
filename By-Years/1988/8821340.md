The work proposed in this project addresses the development of a sensing
mechanism for real-time detection of fuel quantity and rate applied to the
closed-loop fuel injection control for diesel engines. A novel approach will be
pursued involving rapid signal analysis of the needle lift of a modified
injector, using an intelligent sensor interface to the main engine controller.
The project includes the experimental validation of the sensing method, the
study of improved computer architectures for the intelligent sensor interface,
and the evaluation of the potential of closed-loop fuel control for improving
the emissions and operational characteristics of diesel engines.
