The first Southern California Number Theory Day funded through this grant will
take place in October of 2016 at the University of California, Irvine,
subsequent meetings funded by this award will take place in 2017,2018 and 2019.
The Southern California Number Theory Day at UCI is a series of annual one-day
conferences in number theory that brings together mathematicians from Southern
California and beyond. The conferences will encourage interactions and
collaborations among number theorists, giving the participants the opportunity
to interact with scholars from other institutions, and giving graduate students
and postdocs the opportunity to interact with senior mathematicians from other
institutions in academia, government, or industry. A special effort will be made
to include speakers from under-represented groups and to encourage participants
from under-represented groups. Information about these meetings may be found at:
http://www.math.uci.edu/~krubin/ntg/number_theory.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
lectures are research talks at the cutting edge of the field, given by
international experts. The collaborations that are formed should lead to new
ideas and useful research results in important areas of mathematics. The
conferences bring together a critical mass of number theorists, in a way that
each Southern California institution individually cannot do with its own
seminars. The conferences also serve as a way to disseminate the latest
research.
