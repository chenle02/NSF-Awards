This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement project will investigate how
national policy changes shape the practices, strategies, and experiences of
resettlement communities by conducting an analysis of how resettlement
communities respond to the arrival of displaced people and communities. This
study will contribute to scholarly research on theories about the relationship
between humanitarianism, diversity, and community integration. The broader
impacts of this research will 1) inform local resettlement policy, 2) inform
local resettlement agenciesâ€™ initiatives and practices; and 3) provide insight
into how local organizations, community members, and displaced people and
communities experience resettlement. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research
Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising
student to establish an independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
study will address the following research questions: 1) how are local
resettlement agencies impacted by changes in resettlement policies? 2) how are
local-residents responding and reacting to resettlement, and 3) how do the
experiences of displaced people and communities differ based on geographic
location. To answer these questions, the PIs will use ethnographic and
qualitative methods that include semi-structured interviews with resettlement
agency employees, service providers, displaced people, and residents; focus
groups; and participant observation. The results from this research project will
provide new insights regarding resettlement programs and how resettlement is
practiced and experienced in small and medium-sized cities, particularly as
national perspectives on displaced people undergo rapid
change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
