The goal of this proposal is to provide partial funding for a second X-ray area
detector for use in the Molecular Biophysics Department of the Hauptman-Woodward
Medical Research Institute, and for the refurbishing and modification of the
existing image plate detector Rigaku R- AXIS IIc. The requested funds will be
used to purchase a Rigaku RUH3R rotating anode generator, a four module charge-
coupled device (CCD) detector system from Area Detector System Corporation,
focusing mirrors, K goniostat and low temperature device, and a dedicated
Silicon Graphics workstation. The presence of a second detector will permit the
modification of the existing R-AXIS IIc, which is equipped with a graphite
monochromator, to enable routine target changes.
