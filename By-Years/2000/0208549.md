The objectives of the Cryptyc project are to develop a Cryptographic Protocol
Type Checker, which allows secrecy and authenticity properties of cryptographic
protocols to be specified as types. A formal type soundness proof shows that any
protocol which passes the type checker is guaranteed to satisfy its secrecy and
authenticity requirements.

Prior work on the Cryptyc project has developed a theory and tool which deals
with many, but not all, cryptographic techniques and attacker models. This
project extends the Cryptyc system to include support for more advanced
cryptographic primitives, more sophisticated attacker models, object-based
component architectures, and applies the Cryptyc system to the development of
secure component libraries for cryptographic protocols.
