0404632&lt;br/&gt;Corliss&lt;br/&gt;This award to Duke University provides
support for the acquisition of oceanographic instrumentation to be used on R/V
Cape Hatteras, a 135' research vessel operated by the Duke/UNC Oceanographic
Consortium (DUNCOC) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System (UNOLS) research fleet. Specifically, support is recommended to acquire a
transmissometer and two oxygen sensors for use with the existing conductivity-
temperature-depth (CTD) instrument, and a pinger for use with coring and CTD
operations All of these items are intended for shared-use operation. These
acquisitions should provide a substantial advantage to marine scientists using
R/V Cape Hatteras in their research during 2004 and future
years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
