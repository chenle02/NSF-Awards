Integrative, Hybrid and Complex Systems&lt;br/&gt;University of
Washington&lt;br/&gt;Hui Liu&lt;br/&gt;Design and Prototyping for Network
Convergence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop
new network architectures for achieving convergence of digital broadcasting and
(two-way) cellular data networks while delivering the quality-of-service
necessary for multimedia distribution. The research approach is two-pronged. The
first component is a joint design method for hybrid services to be natively
supported in a collaborative cellular network. The second component of the
research is a method for dynamic spectrum reuse within an extended cognitive
radio (IEEE 802.22) framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This
project addresses theoretical questions and associated system design issues
underpinning the transition of next-generation digital broadcasting to broadband
collaborative networks. The problems addressed are relevant to the recent
availability of new radio frequency spectrum for broadcast and emerging industry
standards, such as MediaFlo and Mobile WiMAX, that similarly seek an
evolutionary path towards such a convergence. The project, while not specific to
the above technologies and standards, is intended to result in cross-cutting
commercial impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research seeks new
architectures to provide significant capacity gains and spectrum saving in
converged networks as compared to traditional, isolated wireless networks.
Integral to this work is the cross-training of information technology
professionals and scientists in communication and information theory as well as
in networking and practical wireless system design. Further, the investigators
plan to communicate results from this research to inform the IEEE Task Group
802.22 in its consideration of standards for network convergence.&lt;br/&gt;
