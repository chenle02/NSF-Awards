Whillans, Wilson, Goad OPP 9527571 Abstract This award supports a project to
initiate Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements for rock motions in South
Victoria Land and vicinity. The results will be used to test some of the leading
models for ice-sheet change and tectonism, in particular, whether the continent
is rebounding due to reduced ice load from East or West Antarctica and whether
there is tectonic motion due to Terror Rift or uplift of the Transantarctic
Mountains. A modest program to measure ice motion will be conducted as well. The
motive is to test models for ice flow in the Allan Hills meteorite concentration
region and to determine whether small glaciers in the Dry Valleys are thickening
or thinning. Monuments will be set into rock and ice and GPS receivers used to
determine their locations. Repeats in later years will determine motion. Field
activities will involve close cooperation with the USGS.
