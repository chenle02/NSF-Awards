Two related studies of stimulated Raman scattering will be carried out. One is
a study of soliton formation in stimulated Raman scattering induced by pi phase
shifts in the Stokes beam. The second is a study of the quantum fluctuations
which appear to play a major role in the formation of spontaneous solitons and
phase waves and also in the decay of induced solitons. Goals include obtaining
quantitative data on the dependence of soliton decay on detuning over a range of
pressures and pump intensities, determining whether in the study of
spontaneously generated solitons one can monitor the predicted phase waves
independently, and determining how much observed quantum frequency fluctuations
are influenced by the amplifier as the spontaneous emission quantum field is
amplified to a macroscopic level.
