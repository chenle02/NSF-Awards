An undergraduate course in experimental biochemistry is revitalized by
integrating modern biochemical research into an existing core laboratory
curriculum. The project is designed around investigation of TBP, a protein
transcription factor. The experiments consist of purifying a cloned fusion
protein, and then testing the protein for transcriptional activity against wild
type and mutant templates by measurement of mRNA synthesis in vitro, and for
DNA-protein interactions in gel electrophoresis mobility-shift assays using
probes generated by the PCR technique.
