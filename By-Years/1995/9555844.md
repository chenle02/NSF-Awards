*** 9555844 Salah The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Haystack
Observatory, will initiate a 3-week, summer commuter, Young Scholars project
with a year-long academic year follow-up program in astronomy, physics and
mathematics for 60 students entering grades 8 and 9. The project activities will
apply physics and mathematics to experimental observations and studies of
astronomical sources of radio emission; measurements of distances, velocities
and vectors, analysis of plate motion data and studies of earthquakes; and
investigations of the earth's atmosphere, its variations and human effects on
the environment. The students will engage in classroom discussions, group
activities, research and field trips. Each student will be provided an
opportunity to work with a scientist or mathematician who will serve as a
mentor. The Observatory's instrumentation and computers will be used in the
gathering and analysis of data, in the electronic networking of the students
with each other and with the Observatory staff. There will also be group
activities throughout the year and strong interactions with the science teachers
and other students in the class. ***
