Isopod crustaceans are a diverse and ecologically important group of arthropods
that range from terrestrial habitats to the deep sea. They constitute an early
and successful evolutionary branch of the crustacean family tree. Dr. George
Wilson of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography proposes a study of the
evolutionary relationships among the major groups of isopods. Representative
species from all isopod suborders will be sampled for histological sectioning,
light, and electron microscopy. Genitalic anatomy and morphology will provide
most of the data for an analysis of evolutionary relationships. The proposed
research will establish an evolutionary framework for the isopod crustaceans,
thereby creating a platform on which other research projects can be built. As a
result of this project, future studies of the form, function, development and
biogeography of isopods will be set in an evolutionary context, providing new
insight into the history of crustaceans and the process of evolution itself.
