Through this planning grant, steps are being taken to develop the framework for
a Teaching Fellows and Master Teaching Fellows program. Through this program,
Bard College is expanding its impact on high needs schools in New York City,
California's Central Valley, and upstate New York. As part of this planning
project, the guiding philosophy behind the program is being defined and program
elements are being planned based on that philosophy. The curriculum and
structure of an existing MAT program is being revised to support the needs of
the Fellows and to align the project with the goals of the Noyce program. A non-
profit organization that has the willingness, capacity, and expertise to support
the goals of the program is being identified and recruited. A detailed
assessment plan is being developed that details the measures and methods of data
collection and analysis. Other planning activities include identification of
sources of university cost share, securing school district support for
implementing salary supplements for the Fellows, and defining the roles and
responsibilities of all participants.
