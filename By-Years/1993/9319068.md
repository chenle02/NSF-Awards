Abstract 9319068 Fritts This project will measure the dynamics of the
mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) at high time and spatial resolution (2
minutes and 2 kilometers) using two medium frequency (MF) radars. The first
radar will be built near McMurdo and the second either at Palmer Station or, if
it is logistically more convenient, at the nearby Peruvian station on King
George Island. These instruments will allow detailed studies of large and small
scale motion fields and their latitudinal and temporal variability. When the
data are compared to similar products from Northern Hemisphere radars it will be
possible to study inter-hemispheric differences in the behavior of the MLT,
which preliminary studies indicate are quite substantial. ***
