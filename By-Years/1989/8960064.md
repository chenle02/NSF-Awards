The objective of this program is to evaluate the feasibility of drilling deep
core holes (40,000 to 50,000 ft) using reelable coiled-tubing drill rigs with
slim-hole coring tools. This system has potential for reducing sampling time and
cost in deep Continental Scientific Drilling Project wells (40,000 to 50,000 ft)
and in deep petroleum exploration holes by 60 to 80 percent. Coiled-tubing rigs
reel solid, continuous tubing (1.25 to 2.25- in. diameter) onto large drums at
high speeds, thereby greatly reducing tripping and coring time. The tubing is
straightened by a special "injector" head as it is reeled into the hole. This
study will include a technical review and analysis of all components of a
coiled-tubing coring system to determine if it is feasible to adapt coiled-
tubing rigs to deep, high-pressure coring applications.
