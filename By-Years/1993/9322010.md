9322010 Cordes The University of Alabama Computer Science Undergraduate Research
Program brings together nine students from small schools throughout the South.
They participate in ongoing research projects with the faculty members in the
Computer Science Department (and closely related disciplines) at The University
of Alabama. The program is ten weeks in duration, spanning the same time frame
as the summer term at The University of Alabama. Individuals from small,
primarily undergraduate schools in the South are the major focus of this
program. Emphasis is placed on the recruitment of female and minority students.
The program actively recruits students from Colleges and Universities across the
South. Students from institutions that lack a graduate program in Computer
Science, as well as predominately minority institutions, are the major focus of
the recruiting efforts. The program at the University of Alabama targets
students who have completed three years of studies and have an interest in
participating in current research efforts underway in the Department. u raduate
