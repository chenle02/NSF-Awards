Because different astrophysical processes show characteristic emission at
different wavelengths, astronomers seek many different wavelength windows to the
universe. The difficulty of making infrared observations from typical optical
observatories led NASA to construct a 3-meter dedicated telescope on the summit
of Mauna Kea, Hawaii in the mid-1970's. NASA decided, however, that half the
total observing time would satisfy its needs, and allocated the other half to
visitors. The National Science Foundation has provided funds to support these
visitors since the opening of the telescope in 1979. While the NASA observers
examine objects related in some way to NASA space missions, the visitors are
free to observe any object of sufficient scientific interest, whether in or out
of our Galaxy. The modest amount of money is used for accommodations, local
transportation, cryogen (to cool the telescopes), and publication in the
scientific journals. The success and diversity of the program fully justify its
continued funding.
