Ensuring the security of today's computer systems is an urgent and
difficult&lt;br/&gt;problem. The complexity and rapid pace of change in current
software systems&lt;br/&gt;prevents developers from verifying or auditing the
code thoroughly enough to&lt;br/&gt;eliminate vulnerabilities. This project
seeks to provide security defenses&lt;br/&gt;that work in the presence of
compromised operating systems and applications.&lt;br/&gt;Even if an attacker
compromises the operating system, these defenses will&lt;br/&gt;continue to
ensure their intended security policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new level of
security is made possible by adding a virtual-machine layer&lt;br/&gt;underneath
the vulnerable operating system and applications. This
additional&lt;br/&gt;software layer enables new security services that do not
depend on the&lt;br/&gt;integrity of the target software. This project explores
four new security&lt;br/&gt;services that can be added via virtual machines: 1)
the ability to replay&lt;br/&gt;and analyze the complete, instruction-by-
instruction execution of a computer&lt;br/&gt;system, including actions after
the point of compromise; (2) the ability to&lt;br/&gt;recover the system to a
prior state after an intrusion; (3) the ability to&lt;br/&gt;prevent intrusions
by safely testing hypothetical "what if" scenarios; and (4)&lt;br/&gt;the
ability to detect intrusions by monitoring all actions of the
computer&lt;br/&gt;system.&lt;br/&gt;
