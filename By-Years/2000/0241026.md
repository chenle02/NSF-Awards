This proposal request support to partially fund acquisition of an inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer, which will supplement existing
analytical capabilities at Rutgers University. The new instrument will be
primarily used for elemental rations (e.g., Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca) in foraminifers and
other biogenic carbonates in support of paleoceanographic research. The new
instrument will also be available to researchers and students in the Department
of Geology and Department of Environmental Sciences at the university for
projects that do not require the high-sensitivity and resolution of ICP-MS. The
instrument will serve as a training tool for students in the Earth and
environmental sciences at both the undergraduate and graduate level. &lt;br/&gt;
