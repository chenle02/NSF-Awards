This project is collaborative with David D. Yao of Columbia University. The
principal investigators developed the notions of strong stochastic convexity and
directional convexity which are sample-path based structural properties
essential to the analysis and optimal design of stochastic discrete event
systems in general and queueing networks in particular. This project focuses on
properties relating to structural and policy changes in queueing networks. To
model and understand these changes, notions of monotonicity and convexity do not
apply directly. New concepts and new machineries along the lines of stochastic
rearrangement and stochastic majorization will be developed. These notions
provide mathematical support for "pairwise interchange" arguments that are
widely used in scheduling, control, and resource allocation. Preliminary studies
have demonstrated their usefulness and effectiveness in dealing with structural
and policy changes. Furthermore, these properties are natural extension of
stochastic convexity. A new, unified hierarchy of (sample-path based) second-
order properties in queueing networks appears to be now emerging. Together,
these properties will support the (static) parametric design of queueing
networks, and dynamic scheduling and control.
