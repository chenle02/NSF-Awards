This award provides support for several international activities directed by the
International Council for Science that are closely aligned with the strategic
goals of the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and with several NSF
programs on Global Change Research. This award will help support US leadership
in international science activities and to enable collaborations that are
mutually beneficial for US science and international partners in areas of global
strategic importance. These activities will principally focus on two global
environmental research activities in the World Climate Research Program. This
program seeks to provide fundamental knowledge about the climate system and to
address key challenges in the global environmental change.
