This award enables Loyola College in Maryland to connect to NSFNET through a
56,000 bit per second link to the mid-level network SURANET, the Southeastern
Universities Research Association Network. Access to NSFNET provides the faculty
and students with access to supercomputers, data archives, a variety of network
gateways, automated library catalogs, and a wide range of software. Primary
applications include file transfers, electronic mail communication between local
and remote researchers, and remote login to and use of supercomputers and other
research facilities. The shared Loyola/College of Notre Dame Library will also
be accessable to other users on the Internet.
