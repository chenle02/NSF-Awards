The objectives of the proposed research are to understand the interactions which
occur in a synergistic viral infection. Proposed experiments focus on the
interaction of two unrelated (+)-stranded RNA viruses of plants, potato virus X
(PVX) and potato virus Y (PVY). In mixed tobacco infections with these two
viruses the accumulation of PVX is greatly increased over that in singly
infected plants, while that of PVY is unchanged. The immediate goal of the work
is to determine the level at which the increased accumulation of PVX is
regulated. The steady state levels, time course of accumulation and rates of
synthesis of coat protein and various viral RNAs will be measured in singly and
doubly infected plant protoplasts. Later aims are to pinpoint the specific
sequences on the PVY and PVX genomes which are important for the increased
accumulation of PVX in co- infected cells. These experiments will use transgenic
plants expressing subsets of the PVY genome, as well as genetically engineered
PVX mutants. Recent studies have shown similarities in diverse plant and animal
viruses based on genome organization,mechanisms of gene expression, and sequence
homology of virally encoded, nonstructural proteins. These results suggest that
elucidation of molecular mechanisms for virus interactions obtained in one
system may well apply to a diverse group of other virus systems. This work
should give insight into a fundamental biological phenomenon and, particularly
if the results are found to apply to a number of viral systems, may be of
economic importance.
