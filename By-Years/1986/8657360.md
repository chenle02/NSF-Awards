Dr. Vogel will conduct a research program with this Presidential Young
Investigator award which will focus on the application of millimeter and
centimeter wavelength astronomy techniques to the study of the interstellar
medium and star formation. Three areas will be emphasized: the protostellar
collapse phase, the evolution of ultracompact HII regions, and star formation in
nearby spiral galaxies. Conclusive evidence for the collapse of an interstellar
molecular cloud to make a star has been extremely difficult to obtain. One
problem has been that the characteristic signatures of collapse become evident
only on the smallest spatial scales, which makes high angular resolution
observations essential. Another problem is that other gas motions such as
outflow occur as the collapse continues. Dr. Vogel will concentrate on a sample
of objects which do not show evidence of masking gas motions, and he will use
newly available observational facilities and techniques in an attempt to obtain
the elusive direct evidence of a cloud collapsing to form a star.
