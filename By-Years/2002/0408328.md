This is a continuation of the Conference Series on Dynamical Systems and
Differential Equations, a bi-annual event with a new hosting university every
time. Details and history of the series can be found at http://AIMsciences.org.
The goal of this conference is to gather mathematicians and scientists with
different training background and research approaches, to report on their recent
achievements, exchange new ideas and look for future directions in an atmosphere
that prompts considerable intellectual interaction and inspiration. The
conference program will consist of nine invited plenary talks and about 200
invited talks in 15 special sessions. Topics of special sessions represent
currently active research areas within the focus of dynamical systems and
differential equations. Young researchers will have the opportunity to present
their talks at a special session or contributed session. The conference will
also feature a session devoted to discussions about future directions and
perspectives in the fields of dynamical systems and differential equations.
Results of the discussion will be reported and published.
