This project is to support the study of the causes of the antarctic springtime
ozone depletion. A series of ozonesonde balloons will be flown from Palmer
Station from August through October 1987. The information obtained will be of
value to both the second National Ozone Expedition (NOZE-II) in McMurdo and the
NASA aircraft measurements which will be operated out of Chile. The proposer is
an expert in the measurement of ozone by this technique.
