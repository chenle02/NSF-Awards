software to aid persons with disabilities. The primary goal of the work is to
provide a meaningful design experience for the engineering student that will
directly aid a specific disabled individual. Some 20 projects are envisaged each
year during a three year award. Typical projects are in the areas of Wheelchair
Trainers for disabled children, Sonic Cane for the visually impaired, Loudness
Level Indicator for the hearing impaired to learn the proper speaking level,
Electronic Compass for the visually impaired, Light Activated Toys for children
with limited hand capacities, Cooking Timer for the deaf, Rocking Wheelchair,
and a People Presence detector for the deaf. Results of the design projects will
be published annually in the report National Science Foundation Engineering
Senior Design Projects to Aid the Disabled. ***
