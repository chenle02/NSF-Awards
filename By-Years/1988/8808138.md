The project concerns the role of statistical design, modeling, and analysis in
quality engineering. Because industrial experimentation is usually expensive,
emphasis is given to techniques and strategies which minimize experimental
effort, and maximize information gained from analysis of results. Central topics
are: reduction of variation; designing products robust to transmitted variation
and to environmental variation; modeling control processes to achieve better
understanding of the roles and possible conflicts between statistical process
control (SPC) and automatic process control (APC); developing bases for choosing
standards; and data-based prediction of possible future upsets.
