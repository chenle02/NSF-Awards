Previous support from the NSF has allowed the following objectives to be largely
accomplished. Development of mutant tRNA genes that would suppress termination
at amber codons 2) Isolation of mammalian cell lines or cell conditions that
allow efficient suppression of termination at nonsense codons 3) solation of
mutants of animal viruses with nonsense lesions in essential genes, and 4) the
use of these reagents to explore the genetics and molecular biology of both
animal viruses and mammalian cells. Further and continuing objectives are to 1)
develop a series of cell lines with opal and ocher suppressor tRNA's 2) develop
an inducible suppressor system that does not involve gene amplification 3) the
isolation of nonsense mutants of adenovirus and 4) to continue to develop
methods for homologous recombination in mammalian cells. Much of the power of
genetic systems such as yeast and Drosophila is a result of the sophisticated
technology available to investigators working with those systems. The general
theme of this research is to develop such methods for use with mammalian cells.
%%% The value of genetic systems often correlates with the methodology available
to those working with those systems. The use of suppressor tRNA's in prokaryotic
and yeast systems allowed data to be accumulated which could not have been
otherwise obtained. The ease with which genes can be inserted at the proper
position in the yeast genome has made yeast one of the most useful of
experimental genetic systems. The work projected in this proposal is designed to
make some of those tools and methods available to investigators working with
mammalian cells and mammalian viruses. New suppressor tRNA's will be
constructed, new nonsense mutants of adenovirus will be sought and methods for
homologous recombination in mammalian cells will be devised.
