This project studies mathematical models of random paths in random environments
and percolation models that describe random growth. The goal is to describe
typical large scale behavior and to quantify deviations from the typical
behavior. The emphasis is on finding universal principles that apply to classes
of models that share fundamental characteristics. There are two main directions
of research. (i) The study of the combinatorics, probability distributions and
large deviations of 1+1 dimensional exactly solvable models in the Kardar-
Parisi-Zhang universality class. Outcomes of this research include rigorous
verification of fluctuation exponents conjectured in the physics literature, new
connections between combinatorics and models from probability and statistical
physics, and better understanding of the integrable structures underlying exact
solvability. (ii) The study of more general models of random paths and growing
clusters with probabilistic tools. This work will lead to variational
descriptions of limiting free energies and limit shapes, and the identification
of structures in these models that enable us to study their universal
fluctuation properties. The grand goal is to establish some universal properties
for models beyond the narrow set of explicitly solvable cases.

This project investigates mathematical models that describe complex
interactions, growth, and motion of particles in an irregular environment. These
mathematical systems incorporate randomness to model irregularity and
unpredictability. The goal is to discover general mathematical laws that govern
such systems. These systems appear quite different at microscopic and
macroscopic scales. So it is important to understand how different rules for
small-scale evolution lead to different large-scale systemwide behavior. Real-
world phenomena that such mathematical studies can illuminate include the motion
of vehicles, packets in a communication network, fluid particles in a tube,
wetting transitions where fluid spreads in a porous medium, epidemics advancing
in a population, or the fluctuations of a polymer chain in a fluid. Over the
long term understanding complex interactions has profound implications for
science and engineering and thereby for society. Models of the kind described in
the proposal are intensely and concurrently studied by mathematicians, natural
scientists, social scientists, and engineers.
