In 1987, Dr. Rosemary G. Gillespie discovered a remarkable radiation of spiders
in the genus Tetragnatha in the Hawaiian islands. She is currently describing
the structure, behavior, and ecology of each of 50 previously-unknown and 8
known species found nowhere else on earth. Although Tetragnatha species are
abundant and widely distributed on earth, the Hawaiian spiders are more diverse
than those known in the rest of the world combined. The ultimate goal of the
work proposed here is to explain the mechanisms by which this diversity was
generated. Crucial to that goal is the construction of an accurate pattern of
relationships (phylogeny) of the species. Recently, the use of DNA sequences to
augment more traditional data used to determine relationships has already
sequenced a segment of DNA from some of these species. The work proposed here
will expand that data set in order to delineate the approaches which shall be
taken in studying the mechanisms of explosive diversification in this group. The
results of the final work should have broad implications in the field of
phylogenetics and systematics at the species level, not only within
ecologically- diversifying species swarms in Hawaii, but in continental habitats
as well.
