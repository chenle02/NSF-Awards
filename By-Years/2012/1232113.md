This award supports graduate student participation in the 22nd International
Symposium on Gas Kinetics (June 18-22, 2012;
http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/events/GK2012/). The biennial, week-long meeting on
the University of Colorado campus in Boulder, CO includes the chemistry research
themes: Alternative Fuels and Renewable Energy, Combustion Chemistry,
Atmospheric Chemistry, Multi-phase Chemical Processes, Heterogeneous Chemical
Processes, Fundamentals of Chemical Reactivity (Theory), Experimental Methods
and Applications, and Ions and Chemical Processes. The symposium consists of
distinguished invited speakers as well as contributed oral and poster
presentations. Enrollment for the symposium is approximately 200 delegates. The
broader impacts of the symposium derive from offering an opportunity for young
scientists to meet, network, and exchange ideas with leaders in atmospheric
chemistry as well as other leading fields in chemistry. Graduate students are
encouraged to present the results of their own research at this meeting.
Students (U.S. citizens) from underrepresented groups in the field will be
targeted for receiving support.
