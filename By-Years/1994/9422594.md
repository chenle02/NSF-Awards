9422594 Milikh The objective of the proposal is to provide the computational and
physics framework required for a quantitative understanding of the puzzling
phenomenon of high altitude optical flashes generated above giant thunderstorms,
and their potential correlations with observed gamma-ray and radio emissions.
Key physics ingredients of the model include utilization of the electric field
of the upward propagating electromagnetic pulse due to cloud-to-cloud,
predominantly horizontal, discharges, in conjunction with the physics of runaway
phenomena due to the presence of cosmic ray secondaries. Preliminary estimates
indicate the variability of such a model and its agreement with key
observational features. The development of a comprehensive code that will model
quantitatively high altitude lightning and its potential association with radio
and gamma-ray emissions is proposed. The proposed research is relevant to the
development of a mechanism responsible for direction transient electric coupling
between the ionosphere and the stratosphere, and can thus have implications for
the global electric circuit of the earth. ***
