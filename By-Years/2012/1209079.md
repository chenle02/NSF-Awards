This action funds Joshua Raymond Williams of Texas A&M University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Impact of dam construction on South Korean estuary
sediment transport," during the summer of 2012 at Korea Ocean Research and
Development Institute in Ansan-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. The host scientist is Dr.
Hee Jun Lee.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to advance the knowledge of
the sediment dynamics and stratigraphy of the Nakdong and Yeongsan estuaries.
Anthropogenic engineering in the last century has resulted in episodic river
discharge through estuarine dams, significantly impacting the timing and flux of
sedimentation within the coastal zones of Busan and Mokpo. Through high
resolution geophysical (CHIRP) and core data, the impact of alterations
modifying the sediment trapping efficiency of the estuaries is being determined.
In order to effectively quantify the changes within the Nakdong and Yeongsan
rivers drainage basins, a spatially referenced database is being constructed and
includes timing and placement of the construction of major dams, available
hydrographic data from gauging stations, historical and modern land usage maps
and bathymetric charts, aerial photographs, and geologic and soil survey data.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
