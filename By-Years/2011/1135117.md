1135117 (Moses). An ad hoc NRC committee under the Science and Technology for
Sustainability Program will identify and describe the need for sustainability
linkages among domains such as energy, water, and health that are not routinely
considered in decision making. The premise is that sustainability is a systems
problem that cannot be achieved by separately optimizing its pieces. The study
and subsequent report will highlight priority areas for interagency cooperation,
at the federal level, on specific sustainability challenges and opportunities,
as well as impediments to transdisciplinary jurisdictional programs and
associated scientific research gaps as they relate to a systems approach to
sustainability. The study will build upon existing and emerging expertise
throughout the scientific, technological, and policy communities, describing the
nexus where domains intersect but existing institutions and disciplines do not.
The committee will convene a series of fact finding meetings, commission expert-
authored case studies, review the pertinent literature, and author an overall
consensus report. The report will include a decision framework that can be used
by U.S. policymakers and regulators to help them examine the consequences,
tradeoffs, synergies, and operational benefits of sustainability-oriented
programs. The decision framework will include social, economic, and
environmental dimensions of sustainability.
