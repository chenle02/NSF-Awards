As virtualization spreads throughout the data center, the communication
endpoints within the data center are becoming virtual machines (VMs), not
physical servers. Therefore, the network facilities for packet processing and
security must operate all the way to the VM. This last hop switching among
virtual machines within the physical server has become a critically important
component of the data center network. This project will explore the design space
of server/switch integration, in which software and hardware based switching are
more efficiently integrated directly into the server. More specifically, it will
decouple the switching operations and distribute their implementation throughout
the virtualized system. This project will be comprised of the following thrusts:
&lt;br/&gt; - Efficient Software Switching via a decoupled software switching
architecture using a flow-based approach that eliminates these&lt;br/&gt;
overheads and that enables efficient switching in software&lt;br/&gt; -
Judicious choice and use of hardware acceleration. &lt;br/&gt; - The Rack
Becomes the Server via having the network control plane learning the hardware
topology, monitoring the network traffic,&lt;br/&gt; instructing the hypervisor
to move communicating VMs closer to each other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the
demand for data center capacity continues to increase at an incredible rate, it
is becoming critical to minimize the number of physical machines. This research
will transform the way in which networking is implemented on future systems,
enabling the effective use of 100s of virtual machines per physical machine.
This reduction in physical machines can have significant societal and economic
impacts. If U.S. data centers used virtualization technology to achieve just
half of the power reductions predicted by Intel, we would save $3.5 billion of
electricity and prevent the release of 322 million pounds of CO2 per year.
