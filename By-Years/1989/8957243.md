This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to develop and use new techniques for the study of size-selected ionic clusters.
Insight will be obtained on the structure and dynamics of various clusters, the
relationship to properties of the condensed phase, and the nature of ion-solvent
interactions. Professor Okumura's research is supported by a Presidential Young
Investigator (PYI) Award. The experiments will be accomplished on a
sophisticated ion beam apparatus designed for infrared and optical spectroscopy
of mass-selected ions. High efficiency ion counting techniques will be used to
detect indirectly the absorption of laser radiation through tandem mass
spectrometry. Time-resolved pump-probe experiments will be used to explore the
dynamics of reactive processes within simple and complex (including solvated)
clusters and in the condensed phase. Mass-selected clusters will also be
deposited on appropriate substrates for structural probing at atomic resolution
using scanning tunneling microscopy.
