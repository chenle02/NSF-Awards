US Fish and Wildlife have provided support to the Office of Polar Programs by
allowing the project of Dr. James Estes, University of California, Santa Cruz,
to use the MV Tiglax. The project (OPP 99-85814) titled "Introduced Foxes And
Seabirds: The Role Of Top-Down Processes In Controlling Marine Subsidies To
Terrestrial Ecosystems" worked in the Aleutian Islands, for 15 days, beginning
7th August ending 22 August, 2001. The vessel was well matched for the type of
work, and OPP intends to develop an interagency agreement with US Fish and
Wildlife for future support using MV Tiglax.
