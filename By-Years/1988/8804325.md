The undergraduate research program of the Department of Pharmacology, University
of South Alabama, will provide research experiences for nine undergraduates. The
focus of the program is cellular signalling, e.g., how hormones, calcium, cyclic
nucleotides, protein phosphorylation, and induction of specific intracellular
proteins may influence cell function. The eight participating faculty have
extramural research support and ongoing, active research programs. Students will
be provided a research experience in a laboratory selected by them on the basis
of summary descriptions and discussion with the investigator. In addition,
students will receive a formal review of the general area of cell signalling via
an organized weekly course. Students will be recruited from regional
undergraduate institutions that do not themselves provide formal research
experiences for undergraduates. Recruiting will be accomplished through science
counselors, mail brochures and campus visits. Students will be provided
compensation and access to student facilities (e.g., housing and meal services).
