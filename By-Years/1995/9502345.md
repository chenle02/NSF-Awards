The project will create operating system support and a programming environment
for developing and maintaining long-running parallel and distributed
applications that are continually evolving, such as automated manufacturing and
scientific computation. Supporting changes at runtime requires an efficient,
dynamic reconfiguration facility and an extensible programming environment. The
scope of the research includes building toolkit at the system level, end-user
environment for developing applications including algorithm design, prototyping,
and evaluation of the efficiency and usefulness of the facility. The toolkit
will utilize partial-order semantics and is based on the hierarchical state
machine formalism. The programming environment is based on a scalable software
architecture for specifying and verifying application behavior. The educational
component of the CAREER project will develop advanced and introductory courses,
and computer laboratories on parallel processing. These developments, present
effective venue for providing advanced education and research training to
graduate and undergraduate minority students and equipping them to meet
challenges in a world that is increasingly dependent on distributed computer
systems.
