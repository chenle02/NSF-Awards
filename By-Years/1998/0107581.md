This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "How does neural
activity instruct the system-wide modifications in brain structure that occur
during development of the visual system?" Spontaneously generated "retinal
waves" are required for early visual system development. This research uses a
combined theoretical and experimental approach to determine (1) how
physiologically relevant neural input causes appropriate modifications at
individual retinogeniculate synapses, and (2) how these retinal-wave-driven
modifications result in system-wide competition that drives retinogeniculate
development.
