9321323 Wake This is a proposal to study the role of the environment in
generating differences among organisms, using the salamander family
Plethodontidae as a model. The project will examine the reaction norm (range of
differences) of number of trunk vertebrae with respect to developmental
temperature in the salamander family Plethodontidae. Reaction norms will be
determined by raising clutches in different temperature environments. These data
will then be examined within the framework of a phylogenetic (genealogical)
hypothesis for these salamanders. %%% This work will reveal 1) basic patterns of
change in this anatomical system, particularly in the amount of plasticity as
determined by environmental variance; 2) the causal basis of geographic
variation in the salamander genus Batrachoseps; and 3) the relationship of
plasticity to among-species variation in number of trunk vertebrae and other
anatomical traits. This will shed much light on the phenomenon of anatomical
plasticity in reaction norms in vertebrates.
