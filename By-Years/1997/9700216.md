It is widely believed that NP does not equal coNP. This means that there are
coNP sets for which some elements require superpolynomial length proofs of
membership. Are there coNP sets for which the average element requires
superpolynomial length proofs of membership? Exponential length? One goal of
this research is to find evidence that such sets exist. For example, what is a
plausible complexity theoretic assumption under which these average case hard
coNP sets exist? Such a result would generalize the study of average case
complexity to work against nondeterministic algorithms. Furthermore, arguing for
the existence of these sets is part of an approach to proving the independence
of P not equal NP. It has already been argued that the existence of doubly
exponentially -hard one way functions rules out P/poly-natural proofs that
SATISFIABILITY requires superpolynomial circuits. Furthermore, this implies that
propositional proof systems with the interpolation property do not have
polynomially bounded proofs that SAT is not in P/poly. It might be possible to
generalize the `natural proof/interpolation' approach in order to prove an
important independence result for SAT not in P/poly. If average case hard coNP
sets of the right type do exist, then there are no NP/poly-natural proofs of SAT
not in P/poly. This would imply that propositional systems with the existential
interpolation property do not have polynomially-bounded proofs of SAT not in
P/poly. Hard coNP sets would have two important consequences. 1) Generalize the
known limits of P/poly natural proofs to NP/poly-natural proofs. 2) Extend
independence results from systems with the interpolation property to systems
with the existential interpolation property. The more powerful independence
tools might be extensible to a proof system such as Extended Frege.
