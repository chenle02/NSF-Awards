Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Antarctic Meteorological Research Center
(AMRC), located at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, serves several
communities by maintaining and extending the stewardship of meteorological data
pertinent to the Antarctic continent, its surrounding islands, ice sheets and
ice margins and the adjacent Southern Ocean. This data will continue to be made
freely available to interested researchers and the general public. Activities of
particular interest for the current award include the development of an enhanced
data portal to provide improved data and analysis tools to the research
community, and to continue to add to the evolution of the Antarctic-Internet
Data Distribution system, which is meant to overcome the costly and generally
low bandwidth internet connectivity to and from the Antarctic continent.
Operational forecasting for logistical activities in the Antarctic, as well as
active Antarctic meteorological research programs, are clearly in need of a
dependable, steady flow of meteorological observations, model output, and
related data in what must be a collaborative environment in order to overcome
the otherwise distributed nature of Antarctic meteorological and climatological
observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMRC interaction with the public through
answering e-mail questions, giving informal public lectures and presentations to
K-12 education institutions through visits to schools will help to raise science
literacy with regards to meteorology and of the Antarctic and polar regions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;
