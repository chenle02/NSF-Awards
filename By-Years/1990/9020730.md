Drs. Tomasko, Doose, and Peter Smith, at the University of Arizona, will
analyze observations in hand and to be taken of Saturn, Titan, and Jupiter in a
coordinated effort which makes use of several existing and new theoretical
tools. These include: 1) input from photochemical calculations regarding the
vertical profile of the production rates of gases that can form solid aerosol
material; 2) extension of an existing cloud physics program that includes
sedimentation, coagulation, and condensation to evaluate the number densities
and size distribution of haze particles; 3) evaluation of the absorption
coefficients of methane at low temperatures; 4) creation of a radiative transfer
code for use in the thermal infrared; and 5) the use of radiative transfer
modelling codes for evaluating the reflection and absorption of sunlight from an
atmosphere containing the vertical distribution of haze predicted by the
photochemical and cloud physics program. The bright and dark cloud features
which dominate the appearance of Jupiter and Saturn play important roles in the
chemistry, heat balance, and dynamics of their atmospheres. It is now known that
a haze of small particles is formed in the stratospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, and
Titan by photochemical reactions. These particles fall to tropospheric levels
where they can act as nuclei for the condensation of several atmospheric gases
such as ammonia and methane. The coordinated efforts of these investigators will
greatly increase our understanding of the physical and chemical processes
involved in the production, transport, and recycling of atmospheric aerosols as
well as their role in driving the radiative and dynamical state of these
atmospheres.
