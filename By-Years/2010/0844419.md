Biology is now an information science, increasingly dependent on the array of
biological resources, such as expert-curated databases. The knowledge in these
databases ultimately derives from literature, but the transfer requires experts
to read, extract and structure the information for the database, which is both
labor and expertise expensive. There has been significant progress in
performance of text mining and information extraction tools to support the
process, much of which has been demonstrated in the context of challenge
evaluations and assessment. However, all of these have measured results such as
precision and recall, rather than focusing of whether the tools help the
intended end users. The PI will work closely with database curators to assess
the impact of the tools and develop evaluation methods to guide tool developers.
The measures will be used in upcoming text mining evaluations, for the first
time making the evaluation process interactive and enabling the evaluation of
utility and usability.
