This project investigates how metabolic energy is coupled to betaine transport
in Lactobacillus acidophilus, i.e., whether it is ATP-driven or chemiosmotically
coupled to the flux of H+ or other ions. A second objective is to investigate
the mechanism by which osmotic upshock activates the transport carrier. The
effects of varying the driving forces for transport and the osmotic pressure on
betaine uptake will be studied, employing primarily intact cells and membrane
vesicles. The third objective is to clone the betaine permease gene of
Lactobacillus into Escherichia coli to study energy coupling mechanisms and
regulation in a system that is better understood with respect to bioenergetics.
The permease gene will be cloned into Gram positive bacteria of industrial and
agricultural importance, such as Streptococcus and Clostridium. %%% Many species
of bacteria tolerate high salinity by accumulating high levels of low-molecular
weight chemicals. One stain has been isolated that is significantly more
resistant to osmotic stress than other strains because it possesses an active
glycine betaine (betaine)-specific active transport system. This betaine
permease is unique in that it is activated, and not induced, by increased
osmotic pressure, and thus offers a new opportunity for studying regulation of
solute transport.
