The Colorado State University (CSU) proposes to continue operating the research
weather radar known as CHILL as part of the national Lower Atmosphere Observing
Facility (LAOF) suite. CSU-CHILL is a state-of-the-art dual-frequency (S- and
X-band), dual-polarization radar located in Greeley, Colorado that provides
radar data in support of NSF-funded scientific research. During the next
performance period (2015-2017), CSU will deploy the CHILL radar in support of
research projects deemed to be of exceptional merit by the peer review process.
CSU-CHILL staff will maintain and operate the radar to facilitate cutting-edge
research in the areas of atmospheric dynamics and cloud physics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSU-CHILL fulfills an important role in the suite of NSF-
supported lower atmosphere observing facilities by providing a dual-frequency
radar system capable of obtaining high-quality data with which to study
important questions about severe weather. Users of CSU-CHILL have conducted
research into topics such as winter storm development, storm electrification,
and in-cloud microphysical processes, including the development of methods to
identify the size and type of precipitation based on various radar parameters.
Future deployments include a project to compare radar observations to surface-
based, 3-D camera images of winter precipitation to validate algorithms for
hydrometeor identification, and participation in the flight testing of the new
storm penetration research aircraft. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSU-CHILL staff will
continue to run a very competitive Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
program for the next two summers. Student participants in the REU program
complete hands-on research projects centered on the operation and calibration of
an advanced weather radar. CHILL is also known for its Virtual CHILL (VCHILL)
software, which allows access to archived CHILL data for classroom and/or
research use, and also facilitates remote operation of the radar by university
classes studying meteorology. CSU-CHILL staff will complete the incorporation of
a solid-state S-band transmitter into the radar system. This development is
expected to bring significant benefit to other S-band radars, including those
operated by the National Weather Service, through reduced cost and improved
reliability.
