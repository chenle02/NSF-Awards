0233371&lt;br/&gt;Penner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for US-
France collaboration in chemistry supports annual visits by a US graduate
student to France. The project is led by Reginald M. Penner of the University of
California at Irvine and Frederic Favier of the University of Montpellier 2. The
objectives of the research are: (1) the synthesis of nanowires composed of two
metals; (2) the development of methods for attaching receptor molecules to the
surface of metal nanowires; and (3) the evaluation of nanowires as chemical
sensors. The project takes advantage of a method, developed by the French
investigator, for synthesizing metal nanowires. The US investigator brings to
the collaboration expertise in electrochemical methods and electrodeposition of
nanowires and mesoscale particles. The US graduate student will benefit from
training in synthetic procedures developed in the French
laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award represents the US side of parallel
proposals to the NSF and the CNRS. NSF will cover travel funds and living
expenses for the US graduate student. The CNRS will support visits by French
researcher to the United States. &lt;br/&gt;
