Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of lasers is ubiquitous in
modern science and technology, with applications ranging from optical
interferometers to compact disk players. This project investigates the physics
of quantum dots that are coupled to microwave cavities. Quantum dots are
nanoscale devices that can be used to trap single electrons. A microwave cavity
consists of two 'mirrors' that trap a single photon of light for a relatively
long period of time. The research team has shown that it may possible to create
a new type of laser by flowing single electrons through a quantum dot that is
coupled to a cavity. The research team is performing measurements to determine
if single microwave photons can be generated with the device. In addition to
training graduate and undergraduate students, the principal investigator will
support a comprehensive outreach program. A 'quantum device' website is being
constructed and new tutorials will be created to demonstrate basic concepts in
classical mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to understand the dynamics of
quantum dots that are coupled to a single microwave cavity. Single electron
tunneling in this system results in photoemission and the statistics of the
resulting light field is being studied. By pumping single electrons through a
cavity coupled double quantum dot, the research team is attempting to create a
deterministic single photon source that operates in the microwave regime. Photon
detection aspects are being studied, by using one double quantum dot as a photon
emitter and a second double quantum dot as a photon detector. The experiments
are made possible by cutting-edge technological advances in quantum dot devices
and quantum limited amplification. In the advanced phase of the program, the
research team will couple multiple quantum dots to a single microwave cavity and
search for collective effects. For example, do charge transitions in one double
quantum dot couple to another quantum dot that is located ~ 1 cm away via the
cavity field? Is it possible to observe collective enhancements in photon
emission, such as Dicke superradiance? In addition to the technical effort, the
research team will develop a 'Quantum Device Wiki' that introduces the basic
aspects of quantum devices (single electron charging and Pauli blockade). The
Wiki also supports several simulation packages that will be of use to the
technical community. The principal investigator is creating short classical
mechanics tutorials that will be posted on the internet for open access.
