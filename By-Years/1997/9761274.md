MUSYN Inc. propose to integrate modeling, simulation and control functions in a
unified modeling infrastructure providing initial tools for parameter
extraction, control-oriented uncertainty modelling, and worst-case simulation,
all of which are critical in the application of virtual prototyping throughout
the commercial world. The backbone of the product under development is a linear
fractional transformation data structure, which serves as a universal,
computationally attractive framework for treating integrated modeling problems.
Through generality combined with ease of use, the modeling tools developed will
find applications in a number of industrial settings.
