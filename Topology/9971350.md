Title: "Invariants of knots and 3-manifolds, their properties and topology"

Abstract: This research studies quantum and finite type invariants of
3-manifolds and their relationships with classical topological and geometrical
invariants. The investigator will continue to study the universal finite type
invariant of homology 3-spheres which he developed in joint work with J.
Murakami and T. Ohtsuki. In particular, he plans to develop the theory further
to include other 3-manifolds and to study the topological quantum field theory
associated with the Le-Murakmi-Ohtsuki invariant which is different from those
associated with usual quantum invariants. He will try to understand the topology
of these new invariants and find their applications. One of the projects is to
study relations between the hyperbolic, or more general, simplicial, volume of
knots and their quantum invariants (to prove the Kashaev-Murakami-Murakami
conjecture).

The theory of knots and 3-manifolds is an old branch of mathematics which has
gained renewed interest among mathematicians and physicists after the discovery
of the Jones polynomial and its relation to theoretical physics (quantum field
theory, high energy physics). In fact, it is now one of the most active domains
in mathematics. Many results of knot theory may also find applications in
molecular biology. To classify knots and 3-manifolds, mathematicians use
"invariants". This research project studies new classes of invariants of knots
and 3-manifolds and their relationships with the classical ones. The new
invariants are very powerful in distinguishing knots and 3-manifolds.
