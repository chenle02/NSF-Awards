The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a Fourier transform raman spectrometer
for use several upper level courses and in undergraduate research. Among the
experiments being performed by upperclassmen are comparision of Raman and
infrared spectra for symmetrical and unsymmetrical halogenated hydrocarbons,
study of a variety of transition metal carbonyls, and the role of individual
amino acids in the function and structure of proteins. A new polymer course is
being developed to take advantage of the availability of Raman spectroscopy. The
undergraduate research program is also benefiting from the new instrumentation.
