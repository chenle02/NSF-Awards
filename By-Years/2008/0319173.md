This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will increase
accumulation of nutritional compounds in plants through overexpression of
membrane transporters. Plants are the source of a wide range of natural
metabolites important to human nutrition including vitamins, antioxidants, and
fatty acids. However these compounds are often produced at exceedingly low
concentrations, making cost-efficient extraction extremely difficult.
Specialized proteins called ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters mediate
movement of these metabolites across membranes for accumulation in storage
organelles, such as the plant vacuole. Prior research has shown that
overexpression of membrane transporters in crop species can dramatically
increase accumulation of specific metabolites. In this Phase I project, ABC
protein transport function will be further characterized and applied to
improving the efficiency and yield of plant-based nutraceutical production. The
commercial application of this project is in the area of agricultural
biotechnology. The use of ABC transporter technology is expected to lead to
production of transgenic crop varieties with increased levels of specific
carotenoids, unsaturated fatty acids and plant sterols.
