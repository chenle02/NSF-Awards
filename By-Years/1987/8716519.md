The P.I. will study ripples in the ocean using an optical scanner which was
developed and successfully used for laboratory wave studies. In this project,
the device will be used in field conditions to make measurements of the
statistical properties of the air-sea interface. These will be used to address
the mechanisms and processes of production, modulation, dissipation, and
suppression of the ocean ripples. The resulting information will be useful for
understanding air- sea interaction per se, as well as the radar return used in
remote sensing for measuring wave and wind characteristics.
