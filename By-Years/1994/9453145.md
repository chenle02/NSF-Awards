9453145 Lindsey The Midland Public Schools plan to enhance all their elementary
teachers in science. This project builds on their focusing on elementary science
beginning in 1989. At that time they partnered with the community and developed
a centralized materials and technical support system. The project will take
place over a three year period, and will combine the resources of the Midland
Public Schools, private industry, universities, and the community, to support a
well-defined, inquiry-based, hands-on science teaching methodology in each of
Midland's 12 elementary schools. The institute will consist of a two week summer
institute for an initial group of 118 teachers. Twenty-four (two from each of
the 12 buildings) of these teaches will be prepared to become science mentors
for their schools. A final week will occur during the school year. Trained along
side of the teachers will be substitute teachers. In each of the subsequent two
years, an additional 70 teachers will participate with the core group of 24
leaders and 24 substitutes. The project requested $713,936 from NSF with
institutions/agencies and the school district providing 229% in cost sharing.
