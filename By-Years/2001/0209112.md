Data summarization and estimation can serve as a useful tool for a diverse set
of applications ranging from traditional database query optimization to OLAP
applications and the exploration of large data sets. During the course of this
project, data estimation and summarization techniques will be developed for
datasets with different modalities: point datasets, datasets containing objects
with spatial extents, and stream datsets. The approach is specifically based on
the use of histograms in different contexts. One of the main problems of
applying estimation techniques in a database management system is the unknown
characteristic of the distribution of the data that will populate a given DBMS.
In fact, in order for such a technique to be useful, the estimation technique
should be effective for different kinds of data distributions and query
patterns. This is because a DBMS is used for a variety of applications resulting
in a wide spectrum of data that populates the database. A new estimation
technique called the golden estimator has been identified that employs
cumulative probability distributions for creating histograms and captures the
underlying data distribution. This technique can also be used to adapt to
changes in the query patterns. For objects with spatial extents, this project
will lead to histograms derived from Euler's formulation for graphs. For stream
datasets, a variety of approaches will be explored that are amenable to maintain
histograms dynamically. The research results will be evaluated in the context of
the Alexandria Digital Library and the Digital Campus projects at
UCSB.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
