0123224&lt;br/&gt;Kohlstedt&lt;br/&gt;This award supports David Kohlstedt and
students from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities in a collaboration with
Stephen Mackwell of the Bayerisches Geoinstitut at the University of Bayreuth,
Germany. The project will focus on the evolution of melt topology during
deformation of partially molten mantle rocks. The research is motivated by the
observation that a small amount of melt has a large effect on the physical
properties of a partially molten rock. The connectivity and geometry of the melt
network control permeability, rheology, electrical conductivity, seismic
velocities, and seismic attenuation. A new torsion apparatus in the German lab
provides the best test bed to investigate the evolution of melt topology;
quantification of the dependence of melt distribution on stress state for
developing models of melt redistribution is best accomplished by direct
comparison of results of experiments performed in each lab separately. The work
plan provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the
international travel and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
