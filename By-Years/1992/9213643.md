This is a three-year research study of the atmospheric cycles of ozone,
reactive nitrogen, and sulfur in the troposphere. The project will be comprised
of three related investigations focussing on specific aspects of the global-
tropospheric-chemical system that are presently poorly understood and are of
fundamental importance to the regional and/or global environment. One
investigation will focus on understanding the genesis of ozone episodes in rural
areas of the southern United States and will make use of the sizeable air
quality database that is being gathered by the Southern Oxidants Study. A second
investigation will be aimed at better understanding the chemistry of sea salt
aerosols over the remote marine atmosphere and their effect on the cycle of
atmospheric S and the production of climatically important sulfate particles and
cloud condensation nuclei. A third investigation will attempt to elucidate the
processes responsible for determining the global distributions and abundance of
reactive N compounds and ozone through the application a three-dimensional
Global Chemical Transport Model. This last study will represent a continued
collaborative effort between scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology
and NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.
