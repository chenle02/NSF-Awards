The research described in this proposal is focused on theoretical and
computational studies of photophysical processes in proteins. These studies will
include simulations of time resolved fluorescence spectra of chromophores in
solution and in proteins. Two kinds of chromophoric systems have been chosen for
study: (1) naturally occurring indole/tryptophanyl chromophores in water and in
protein (e.g. T4 phase lysozyme), and (2) synthetic fluorescent chromophores
attached to protein (e.g. apomyoglobin). The proposed project involves a close
collaboration between laboratories with complementary expertise in respectively,
molecular electronic structure theory and computer simulations of proteins and
liquids, and contains the following objectives: (1) to develop appropriate
potential energy functions for selected chromophores to be used in simulations
of optical excitation processes in solution and in protein; (2) to characterize
the dielectric response of a protein to a sudden charge redistribution; (3) to
use simulations to distinguish between alternative molecular relaxation
mechanisms which may account for the picosecond time evolution of the red shift
in fluorescence spectra of tryptophan residues in proteins; (4) to explore the
sensitivity of the "medium" (water, organic solvent, protein) response to the
optical excitation of model chromophores as a function of basic molecular
properties of the chromophore.
