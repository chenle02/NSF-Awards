9523977 Stuiver They propose to begin exploring the potential of Lechuguilla
Cave, New Mexico, for obtaining oxygen-isotope paleoclimate records extending
throughout the Pleistocene. At this time, the famous Devil Hole calcite
speleothem is the only stable isotope record reaching back to the middle
Pleistocene in the Southwestern US (Winograd et al, 1992). They have recovered a
mammillary calcite speleothem from Lechuguilla Cave which is older than the
Devils Hole calcite. This sample the has the potential, through oxygen isotope (
18O) measurements, of providing a paleoclimate record comparable in resolution
to that at Devils Hole. One of the significant tasks in any such study is the
development of a numerical age chronology. They will use electron spin resonance
(ESR) spectroscopic dating to accomplish this goal.
