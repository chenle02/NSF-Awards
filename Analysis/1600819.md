This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants in
the "Annual Spring Institute on Noncommutative Geometry and Operator Algebras
(NCGOA) 2016" that will be held from May 17-25, 2016, on the campus of the
University of Bonn, Germany.

This event is the fourteenth installment of the Vanderbilt Noncommutative
Geometry and Operator Algebra (NCGOA) spring conferences, a series that each
year brings together a diverse group of roughly one hundred mathematicians whose
primary research interests are in operator algebras and related topics. The main
foci of the 2016 event, which will not be held in Nashville but will be
integrated into a trimester program on von Neumann algebras at the Hausdorff
Institute in Bonn, are deformation/rigidity theory, free probability theory, and
subfactors. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate
students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work. More
details can be found at the conference website: http://www.him.uni-
