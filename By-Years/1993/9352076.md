Computer technology is being used in calculus and statistics courses to enable
students to readily visualize mathematical concepts. The learning of the
concepts is the primary focus, rather than the manipulation of symbols. Guided
discovery and problem solving strategies enable students to develop deeper
understandings and stronger intuitions of the material. The technological tools
available to today's work force are being incorporated into the mathematics
curriculum, better preparing students for future employment.
