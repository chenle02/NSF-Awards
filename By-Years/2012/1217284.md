In this project, the PI is developing theoretical foundations for performing
iterative computations on massive data in a distributed environment. Based on
the developed theory, the PI aims to build highly scalable and efficient
distributed frameworks for iterative computations. The distributed framework
takes the burden of describing the iterative process away from programmers and
performs the iterative updates in an efficient manner. A series of programming
models will be developed aiming to challenge the conventional wisdom that
synchronization is essential and iterative computations have to be performed in
an ?iteration by iteration? manner. The goal of these proposed programming
models and supporting distributed frameworks is to lift the burden of the
programmers in specifying execution order of iterative updates and communication
mechanisms, and automatically optimize the execution of the computation in a
cluster of machines. The technologies developed in this project will have
immediate important applications with broader societal impacts such as road
traffic prediction, biological information discovery, online marketing, and
computer forensic analysis.
