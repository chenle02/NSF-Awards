This grant will support the participation of junior investigators and students
in the FASEB summer research conference on Lymphocytes and Antibodies. This will
be a small meeting with a strong scientific program covering a number of
selected topics of intense current interest and activity in basic immunobiology.
The small size and residential arrangements of the meeting allows extensive
discussion among the participants who share a multidisciplinary interest in
problems of specific recognition and regulation in immune function.
