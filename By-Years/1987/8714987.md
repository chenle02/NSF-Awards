The recent discovery of the T-cell receptor has generated enormous interest in
T-cell development and function. In an effort to study T-cell differentiation
two cell types have been derived which appear to represent two stages of early
thymocyte development: 1) a cell type that arises spontaneously under certain
conditions in tissue culture, and 2) an immature T-cell line resulting from the
Abelson virus (A-MuLV) infection of 13-14 day old thymocytes from C57Bl/6 mice.
In this study it is proposed to characterize in detail both cell lines, and to
employ techniques developed in this laboratory to infect early thymocytes with
wild type A-MuLV to obtain T-cell lines stably transformed with a temperature
sensitive mutant of Abelson virus (ts-A-MuLV). Immature thymocytes transformed
with ts-A-MuLV and shifted to the non-permissive temperature for v-abl (the
Abelson virus oncogene product) expression, under conditions suitable for T-cell
differentiation, may retain the capacity to proceed along the normal pathway of
T-cell differentiation. This system may produce important information on the
differentiation of T-cells previously unobtainable from T-cell lines "frozen" in
one stage of development.
