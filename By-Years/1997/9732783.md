Abstract CTS-9732783 L.-S. Fan, Ohio State Univ. This award will provide partial
travel support for academic speakers at the 9th International Fluidization
Conference in Durango, Colorado, May 17-22, 1998. This conference is the leading
international forum in the field of fluidization, and takes place each three
year in a different country. The Conference is co-chaired by Prof. L.S. Fan and
Dr. T. Knowlton, and it is organized by the Engineering Foundation. The focus of
the conference will be on emerging technologies involving fluidization, and
international participation. Papers from over 28 countries representing almost
all the important fluidization research groups worldwide will be highlighted by
several invited lectures of Prof. R. Jackson, Prof. W.P.M. van Swaaij, Prof. S.
Mori and Dr. W.C. Yang. The conference covers a variety of subjects, from
fundamental multiphase flow to applied topics in chemical, petrochemical, mining
and mineral processing. Free-forum poster sessions will allow the presentation
of most recent research work. A special session will be dedicated to video
presentations. The refereed proceedings will be prepared in advance and
distributed at the conference. ***
