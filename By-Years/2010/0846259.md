0846259&lt;br/&gt;Carrico&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expected to provide new insight into
fundamental assembly, trafficking, and immune interaction of viral particles.
The PI's goal is to utilize chemical biology concepts to enable basic virology
and therapeutic applications. The PI's university and high school education
programs are taking advantage of modern teaching principles to bring chemical
biology principles to the forefront. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outlined research program will build upon the
fundamental strength of Stony Brook's chemical biology research and educational
programs. The PI plans the development of new core curriculum as well as an
aggressive outreach program, both of which are designed to bring
underrepresented students into science and give them the tools to turn their
interests into a career.
