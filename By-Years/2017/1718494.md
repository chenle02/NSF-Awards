Information theory studies the fundamental laws that govern information
processing systems. For instance, the Shannon Capacity of a noisy channel is the
largest rate (in bits per channel use) that bits can be reliably communicated.
Information theory has had an enormous impact on how information is acquired,
processed, compressed, and transmitted. Examples include channel coding and data
compression, both of which are used extensively in Internet and cellular
communications. This project focuses on connections between performance and
codebook symmetry. One part focuses on using symmetry to help low-complexity
decoders achieve near-optimum performance for codes relevant to 5G cellular
standards. This project will also train several graduate students, hence an
important broader impact of this project is the production of highly-trained
workers in electrical engineering and computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many theoretical results in information theory use
random codebooks to encode messages. Researchers have long sought families of
deterministic algebraic codes that provably achieve capacity. In a recent
breakthrough, the PI and his coauthors showed that sequences of sufficiently
symmetric codes achieve capacity on the binary erasure channel. Since Reed-
Muller codes satisfy the required symmetry condition, we now know that such a
code family was discovered by Muller in 1954, only 6 years after Shannon's
introduction of channel capacity! The project focuses on whether symmetric
codebooks can be used in more general settings to approach information-theoretic
limits. In particular, the goals are to determine: (i) How general is the
phenomenon of capacity via symmetry? (ii) What performance gains can be achieved
in practice by exploiting symmetries? (iii) Can symmetry be utilized to approach
the information-theoretic limits of other problems?
