With this award the principal investigator will use analytical and numerical
tools to study the long-time behavior of solutions of certain dissipative
partial differential equations such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the
Navier-Stokes equations. Of particular interest is the approximation of a set
called the global attractor, which is a finite-dimensional, fractal set that
lies inside of an infinite- dimensional phase space. In order to describe the
global attractor the principal investigators plan to construct an algebraic
approximation method that uses smooth finite- dimensional manifolds to
approximate the fractal set and then to implement this method on a computer.
From an abstract point of view one can regard the solutions of a partial
differential equation as generating a space of trajectories or curves that is
infinite-dimensional. This is one reason why the study of such equations is
difficult. Fortunately, though, within this infinite-dimensional space reside
sets of finite dimension that characterize how solutions behave for very large
times. And since these sets are finite- dimensional, it is possible to describe
them approximately using numerical and analytical techniques. With this award
the researchers will study finite-dimensional objects called global attractors
that arise in the solution sets of equations from fluid dynamics.
