The goal of this research project is to develop algorithms to solve dual problem
of structure and motion recovery of nonrigid objects from multiple 2D views.
Previously, algorithms have been developed that can recover point
correspondences in nonrigid motion from range data sequences. If only 2D
projections (perspective or scaled orthographic) are available, not only motion
but also structure (i.e. 3D coordinates) of the surface points need to be
determined. There are several research questions related to nonrigid motion and
structure recovery which are being addressed. .First, depending on the observed
motion, which of the various nonrigid motion models should be utilized (that
include determination of the number of parameters to be estimated)? Second, once
the motion model is decided, how many feature points, over how many frames are
required in order to estimate the motion and structure of the points under
consideration? Further, the derived solutions need to be extended to line (and
other) features. This local motion modeling approach is often noise sensitive
and may have problems handling large deformations. Those drawbacks will be
addressed bycombining local techniques with global models. Global models under
investigation include time-varying superquadrics and hyperquadrics, spherical
harmonics as well as FEM models.
