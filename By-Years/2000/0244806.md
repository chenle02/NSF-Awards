This research focuses on the use of a dual Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT0 to study
the simultaneous confinement of alkali atoms and metastable rare gas atoms. In
particular, ultracold collisions between one alkali atom (rubidium) and one
metastable noble gas atom (argon, krypton) will be studied as well as collisions
between unlike metastable noble gas atoms (argon and krypton). The experiments
will be centered on ionization rates in the ultracold collisions and
photoassociative spectroscopy during the collisions. Results of the experiments
will be used to gain a fundamental understanding of heteronuclear collisions and
molecular formation at ultracold temperatures as well as to determine scattering
lengths which are important for sympathetic cooling, to determine potential
curves for comparison with molecular structure calculations, to test cold
collision theories in a new regime, and to better understand heteronuclear
Penning and associative ionization processes in ultracold collisions. On the
broader impacts, the project serves as a versatile training ground for graduate
and undergraduate students while helping to increase the participation of women
and minorities in science.
