This research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site project is in the areas
of chemistry and biochemistry. For a three-year period beginning in 1992, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer engaged in fundamental,
"hands-on" research, under the direction of faculty members from the Department
of Chemistry and Biochemistry. The research projects offer a very broad exposure
to chemical research. A unique feature of the REU site activity is the
departmental commitment to funding of participants to attend a regional American
Chemical Society meeting, regardless of whether a paper is to be presented.
