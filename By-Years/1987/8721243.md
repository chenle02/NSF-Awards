The goal of this project is to understand how vibrationally excited molecules in
solids dissipate their excess mechanical energy, and how this dissipation
process is related to chemical reaction rates in solids. These process are
experimentally investigated using the techniques of time dependent spectroscopy,
particularly in the ultrafast time domain. Research will be performed in three
specific areas: (1) Fundamental studies of vibrational relaxation and
vibrational cooling in molecular crystals, (2) Optical damage studies of
crystals, polymers and glasses, and (3) Chemical reaction Kinetics in a glassy
matrix.
