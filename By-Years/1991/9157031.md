This project deals with elastic and quasielastic light scattering from systems
that are far from equilibrium. One of the goals is to understand better the
dynamics by which systems reach equilibrium states from initial, non-equilibrium
conditions. Initial work will focus on binary polymer blends as they phase
separate after being quenched from a liquid melt state. A factor, important in
determining scattering wavelengths, is wetting phenomena, i.e., the preference
of one of the phases for the surface of the container. The apparatus being
developed for this research will have the sensitivity to probe these surface
effects and thereby allow investigation of a fundamental but heretofore ignored
effect. Materials preparation aspects of the project will focus on use of a
shear cell to elongate monodisperse droplets to yield ellipsoids that can be
frozen in shape by photo-crosslinking. These ellipsoidal colloids should provide
novel phases and phase transitions that have been predicted theoretically, but
not yet observed experimentally.
