Titanium is of interest as a dopant in various laser hosts for tunable solid-
state laser applications. The present proposal will evaluate a new laser
material, titanium doped lanthanum magnesium hexaaluminate (LMAO) for tunable
solid state lasers. This project will combine the known advantages of the Ti
dopant, LMAO host and the Heat Exchange Method for crystal growth to show
feasibility of producing Ti:LMAO crystals.
