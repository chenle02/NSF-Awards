This U.S.-Poland research project in civil engineering between Dr. Antonio
Nanni of Pennsylvania State University-University Park, and Dr. Andrzej Brandt
of the Institute of Fundamental Technical Research, Polish Academy of Sciences,
Warsaw will entail experimental and analytical studies to prepare rational
methods and technologies for the strengthening and repair of outdoor concrete
structures (e.g., bridge decks and piers, road and runway pavements). The
researchers will combine their experience in: 1. application of short fiber
reinforced mortars and concretes for repair of concrete structures; and 2.
strengthening and repair of concrete structures using fiber-reinforced plastic
reinforcement for lateral confinement or replacement of conventional steel
reinforcement. This project in civil engineering fulfills the program objective
of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United
States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
