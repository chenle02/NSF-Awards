9725918 Brook This award supports a project to develop and apply a new technique
for quantifying temperature changes in the past based on the thermodynamic
principle of thermal diffusion, in which gas mixtures in a temperature gradient
become fractionated. Air in polar firn is fractionated by temperature gradients
induced by abrupt climate change, and a record of this air is preserved in
bubbles in the ice. The magnitude of the abrupt temperature change, the precise
relative timing, and an estimate of the absolute temperature change can be
determined. By providing a gas-phase stratigraphic marker of temperature change,
the phasing of methane (with decadal precision) and hence widespread climate
change (relative to local polar temperature changes) can be determined (across
five abrupt warming events during the last glacial period).
