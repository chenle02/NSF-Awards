Biological Sciences (61) In this project the anatomy, physiology and
microbiology faculty at three different colleges within Yuba Community College
District are collaborating to integrate similar laboratory equipment and
teaching activities that have proven benefit. Data acquisition systems for
physiology are providing the basis for student-led inquiry. Microscopy, as a
method of scientific discovery, is being used in Microbiology. Multiple avenues
of anatomy learning (organ and cadaver dissection, models, Adam Interactive) are
being combined with collaborative writing projects to encourage understanding,
not just memorization. Experienced faculty are proving training and mentoring to
ensure success. The intellectual merits of this project include the use of
study-led inquiry and the scientific method to enhance scientific understanding
and scientific self-confidence. Critical analysis of data and results is being
emphasized along with writing in all courses. The activity has broad impact in
that it is affecting approximately 1200 students, mostly women and increased
numbers of minority, economically disadvantaged, and geographically isolated
students.
