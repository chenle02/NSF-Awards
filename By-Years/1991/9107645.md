The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project under the Hungary
Joint Fund between Dr. Joseph Mascarenhas, State University of New York at
Albany and Dr. Beata Barnabas, Agricultural Research Institute of the Hungarian
Academy of Sciences, is to develop methods for the production of mature, viable
pollen from microspores cultured in anthero. The work will involve exposing
microspores by making a cut in the anther wall prior to micro- projectile
bombardment and the pollen will then be matured in anthero. If and when this
preliminary work indicated that the system seems to be working well, the pollen
matured in anthero will be used for pollination to study stable transformation
of maize plants. Maize is a very important agricultural crop both in Eastern
Europe and the US and a simple transformation procedure using pollen would be of
significance for basic studies in genetics and developmental biology of the
plant and in the engineering of new traits of agronomic value. This project in
plant physiology fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence.
