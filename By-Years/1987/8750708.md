As part of a three year departmental plan to improve undergraduate instruction,
the Chemistry Department of Southwest Missouri State University has recently
acquired a multinuclear, variable temperature 90MHz nuclear magnetic resonance
sprectrometer. This instrument is being used in courses in organic chemistry,
organic qualitative analysis, physical chemistry, molecular spectroscopy, and
biochemistry, with particular emphasis on it use in the interpretation of 13C
NMR spectra. The availability of the new NMR system is also providing for
additional undergraduate research projects in organic chemistry, biochemistry,
polymer chemistry, analytical chemistry, and physical chemistry.
