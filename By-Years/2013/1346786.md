The objective of this program is to explore the feasibility of novel family of
microwave and millimeter wave devices using hot carrier transport in MoS2 and
related compounds. The band structure of MoS2 has should enable Negative
Differential Resistance instability. Since MoS2 can be cheaply produced in large
area sheets, this new technology could have key advantages for wireless sensing
biomedical, homeland security, and "Internet of Things," applications. It is
high-payoff and transformative because, if successful, it will enable a whole
new generation of layered-to-bulk microwave and millimeter wave "beyond
graphene" sources, detectors, and sensors, at a fraction of the cost of existing
components. The intellectual merit of the project is in understanding of hot
carrier transport in materials "beyond graphene", and in developing novel
principles of operation for layered ambipolar devices for photonic and electro-
optic applications. The broader impact of the project will be in gaining
understanding of new fundamental physics of hot carrier and ambipolar "beyond
graphene" nanostructures, enabling the development of novel microwave and
millimeter wave devices on large scale at a fraction of the cost of existing
devices; in enabling sensing applications at a large scale, in developing new
approaches for applications of a large variety of "beyond graphene" materials,
in seeding the "beyond graphene" electronics industry; in creating new high-tech
American jobs, and in training the next generation of scientists and engineers
through "beyond graphene" related new curriculum and outreach at all levels -
from K to 12 to post graduate education.
