9560477 Kuo-Ching Liu This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will develop a submicron optical 3-D sensor, capable of performing in
high-throughput, high-duty-cycle industrial applications such as semiconductor
package inspection. Laser confocal microscopy presently meets the increasing
demands of 3-D imaging and is capable of submicron depth resolution. Its
deficiency is the mechanical serving of a minute field depth where the target
might be found. The technique is very slow, requires difficult microscope
calibration, and can require frequent maintenance due to the wear of moving
parts. This Phase I explores an innovative illumination technique for rapid
scanning of a broad depth of field electronically. This sensor's resolution is
an order of magnitude better than the best optical triangulation technique, the
current state of the art in 3-D sensor technology. This technique requires no
moving parts, is minimally impacted by obstruction, and is readily
reconfigurable using interchangeable lenses to suit a wide range of depth-of-
field and resolution requirements. This technology is superior to both confocal
microscopes and optical triangulation for rapid, high accuracy measurement. This
sensor technology will find wide application in semiconductor and integrated
circuit manufacturing, precision electromechanical assembly, precision metrology
(CMM's), optoelectronics, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The
semiconductor industry in particular will need for a submicron sensor with
sufficient speed to conduct in-line inspection of semiconductor packages at
various stages of manufacture.
