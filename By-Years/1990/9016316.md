The rare brief periods of total solar eclipse provide valuable opportunities for
ground-based observers to study the inner regions of the solar corona. Dust
particles in the outer regions of the corona (F corona) are believed to be
orbiting under the combined influence of solar gravitational and radiative
forces which dominate the region. Observational confirmation of the expected
dust velocities within a few solar radii of the Sun are difficult to obtain.
Total solar eclipses offer opportunities of a few minutes for observation and
experimentation with suitable instrumentation. In 1978 a team at Iowa State
University began development of a special electro-optical system to detect and
measure the motion of the dust. The instrument was used in 1979 to record the
first detections of the dust velocity profiles at two points in the corona. Two
attemps to employ improved versions of the instrument system at subsequent
eclipses were not successful. If the sky conditions are optimum for the 1991
eclipse, it is hoped that about 10 times the data that has been previously
collected will be obtained. These measurements would provide information on the
motions of the dust in the F corona.
