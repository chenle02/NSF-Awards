Viscoelastic materials with fading memory exhibit behavior that is intermediate
between the nonlinear hyperbolic response of elastic materials and the strongly
diffusive, parabolic response of viscous materials; they incorporate a subtle
dissipative mechanism induced by the effects of fading memory. Understanding
these effects is crucial to the proper design of computational methods for
modeling both unsteady and steady viscoelastic flows. Analytical and
computational techniques will be developed for unsteady problems by adapting
methods from the study of hyperbolic conservation laws. Building upon the
understanding of classical solutions and their breakdown, a study of weak
solutions to the governing equations will be conducted using two approaches: the
method of compensated compactness and the random choice method. The latter
requires an understanding of the Riemann problem for viscoelastic flows; its
solution is an essential ingredient for designing computational algorithms.
These ideas will be used to broaden the scope of the established program of
simulation of steady, two-dimensional viscoelastic flows, with the objective of
resolving serious computational difficulties at high Weissenberg numbers. This
research represents a program in scientific computation that unites methods from
mathematical, computational, and engineering disciplines.
