With National Science Foundation support and in close collaboration with
Ukrainian colleagues, Dr. Anthony Marks will conduct archaeological work in
Crimea. Previous excavations have demonstrated the presence of rich Middle
Paleolithic industries which contain human remains in addition to faunal
materials. However these sites were excavated many years ago and employed
techniques which are inadequate by present day standards. Dr. Marks and his
collaborators will re-excavate and study seven of these. In particular they will
attempt to obtain absolute dates for individual stratigraphic levels and will
employ a range of techniques. These include thermolumenescent dating of both
burned flint and sediment, uranium series dating and finally radiocarbon dating
for younger deposits. In addition to obtaining samples for age determination,
excavation will serve to clarify stratigraphic problems and to obtain large
samples of faunal and lithic remains which will be analyzed to reconstruct
Middle Paleolithic lifeways. Both archaeological and fossil data indicate that
anatomically modern humans first appeared in Africa over 90,000 years ago. They
later occur in the Near East but it is not until 40,000 or so years ago that
they are found in the rest of the Old World. Archaeologists wish to trace this
spread because until dates are available for different parts of the world and
patterns of movement known, it is extremely difficult to understand the
processes which lead to the origins and spread of modern humans. The Crimea is
known to contain important fossil bearing sites from the relevant period but the
data are scanty and poorly collected. Since Crimea lies near one of the major
routes out of the Near East it is an area worthy of investigation. This research
is important for several reasons. It will increase the archaeological data base
for an important and little known region of the world. It will add to our
understanding of the origin and spread of modern humans and assist in the
training of Ukrainian archaeologists.
