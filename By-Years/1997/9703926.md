Rydelek 9703926 This award supports a collaborative research project between Dr.
Paul Rydelek of the University of Memphis and Dr. Kazuo Hamada of the National
Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) in Tsukuba,
Japan on the physics of the earthquake process. Dr. Rydelek will spend one year
working on this project in Japan. NIED offers extensive data on earthquakes
collected from a comprehensive network of strong motion sensors, conventional
short period seismometers and newly developed broadband seismic sensors. The
principal investigator will use the Japanese seismic data to test and refine a
recently developed non-fractal model of earthquakes. Understanding the
geophysical processes which result in earthquakes is critical to our efforts to
mitigate the destruction and loss of life caused by these natural disasters.
This project will combine the expertise and data of U.S. and Japanese
laboratories working on earthquake research. The project is supported under the
Science Fellowship Program between the National Science Foundation and the Japan
Foundation Center for Global Partnership. ***
