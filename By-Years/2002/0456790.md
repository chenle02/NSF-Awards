This proposal aims at providing a better understanding of the non-perturbative
interaction of matter with laser pulses for various systems. In each of the
proposed projects, understanding of the nonlinear quantum dynamics will be
advanced primarily with the aid of computer simulations to allow for spatial and
temporal resolution. It is also an aim of the proposal to narrow the gap between
theoretical studies and experimental work.&lt;br/&gt;The first sequence of
projects focuses on new phenomena that occur if the laser fields are
sufficiently intense to either trigger or affect the creation of electron-
positron pairs from vacuum. The studies will build on a computational solution
technique that has been developed recently by the PIs to solve the quantum field
theoretical equations with full spatial and temporal resolution. The second
group of projects examines numerically the single and double ionization
mechanisms for atoms and ions in various static electric, magnetic and laser
fields from highly correlated relativistic states. The third sequence of
projects explores theoretically as well as experimentally the propagation of
laser fields through heterogeneous dielectric random media.&lt;br/&gt;The
Intense Laser Physics (ILP) research group consists of two PIs, two postdocs,
and typically eight undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
