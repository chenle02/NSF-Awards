Blood vessels play a critical role in supplying tissues with nutrients and
gases while removing wastes. In the brain, blood vessels play an additional role
in protecting nerve tissue from fluctuations of constituents that may occur
elsewhere in the body. How blood vessels in the brain play this dual role is the
subject of the research covered in the proposal. The work proposed here focuses
on the blood vessels in amphibians and in reptiles. These animals have a unique
arrangement of vessels in the brain and it is proposed that the arrangement
itself plays an important role in how they work. Understanding how this unique
blood vessel geometry works will allow us to understand the advantages and
limitations to other vascular arrangements as well.
