Girls Incorporated seeks a planning grant of $30,000 from the National Science
Foundation's&lt;br/&gt;Program in Gender Equity to develop a plan and proposal
to reengineer our Operation&lt;br/&gt;SMART program. With the proposed grant,
Girls Inc. will compile and assess the research, &lt;br/&gt;technology, and our
own experience relative to girls and science, math, engineering, and
&lt;br/&gt;technology. We will then convene a meeting of experts to discuss this
body of knowledge&lt;br/&gt;and help map out are engineered program design and
demonstration plan for Operation&lt;br/&gt;SMART. This will enable us to provide
an informed, relevant, accessible, and exciting &lt;br/&gt;new program to
capture and retain the interest of a new generation of girls in the
areas&lt;br/&gt;of science, math, engineering, and technology.
