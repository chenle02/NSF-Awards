Second language learning is critically important in our increasingly global
society. Success in second language learning varies substantially across
individuals, but the reasons for this variability are unclear. An improved
understanding of how language learning works, from neurons to behavior, will
enable the development of highly efficient learning strategies that take into
account differences across individuals. In this project, the investigators focus
on one key aspect of acquiring a new language, namely learning to differentiate
new sounds; for example, when an English speaker must learn the difference
between a trilled 'r' in 'perro' and tapped 'r' in 'pero' in Spanish. Current
approaches to investigate second language learning typically use human behavior
to infer what factors affect language acquisition. However, neuroscience tools
for research in humans lack the necessary precision to directly uncover how
changes in the brain underlie these factors. To address this limitation, the
research team will combine insights from human behavior with observations of how
animals process sound to allow for precise measurement of the brain processes
underlying learning to differentiate new sounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed work will compare learning performance under different learning
scenarios in both mice and humans to identify which scenarios are most
efficient, and to evaluate to what extent the way mice learn to differentiate
sounds is comparable to that of humans. The research team will then use advanced
techniques for measuring the activity of individual neurons as mice learn new
sounds to investigate the neural changes responsible for effective learning. The
project also includes a range of outreach objectives toward integration with
education, broadening participation in STEM, and bridging theory and practice of
language learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
