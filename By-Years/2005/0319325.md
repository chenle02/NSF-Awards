This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
investigate a new coating for artificial knee replacements, using nano-ceramic
materials. The proposed nanoceramic artificial joints, with the wear surfaces
containing ceramic coating against ceramic coating, are expected to be superior
in wear resistance to a CoCrMo alloy against ultra high molecular weight
polyethylene ("UHMWPE") pair. Also, the metallic substrate will provide
considerably higher strength and toughness compared to UHMWPE - ceramic
combination, thereby avoiding brittle fractures. This project will select a
suitable nanocoating composition using a plasma spraying technique for follow on
in-vitro evaluation and physical property characterization.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of prosthetic devices.
This project will allow for the development of artificial prostheses for the
knee, hip, elbow, shoulder and other joints, as well as for treatment of
osteoporosis and sports related joint damage.
