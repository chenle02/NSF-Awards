This research will study the effects of mandatory arrest and no-drop prosecution
policies on domestic batterers. The objective of this study is to understand how
the practices comprising arrest and prosecution shape perpetrators'
understanding and performance of abuse. Past research has approached this topic
exclusively from a deterrence perspective, employing experimental and quasi-
experimental designs to test whether arrest and/or prosecution predict less
reports of future violence than other types of interventions. Drawing from
completed fieldwork which has found that police officers and defense attorneys
minimize and justify abuse in order to make domestic battery suspects easier to
work with, this research explores four hypotheses: (1) batterers' understanding
of abuse is not changed by arrest and prosecution; (2) the practices employed by
police officers and defense attorneys reinforce perpetrators' understanding of
abuse; (3) batterers perceive arrest and prosecution as challenges to their
masculinity; and (4) men will turn to new coercive tactics following arrest and
prosecution in order to reassert their masculinity. These hypotheses will be
investigated through semi-structured interviews with 30 misdemeanor domestic
battery suspects.
