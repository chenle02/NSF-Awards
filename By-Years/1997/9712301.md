9712301 Presnall This award will help support travel expenses for U.S.
participants at the International Pressure Calibration Workshop to be held in
Misasa, Japan in August 1997. The workshop is sponsored by the Institute for
Study of the Earth's Interior at Okayama University in Japan. The purpose of the
workshop is to develop an internationally accepted standard pressure scale to
cover the recently attained range of ultra-high pressures now reproducible in
the laboratory. The development of such a scale is necessary in light of recent
technological advances with diamond-anvil cells and other high-pressure
apparatus that has extended experimentally available pressures (and
simultaneously available temperatures) well beyond the range accessible a decade
ago. ***
