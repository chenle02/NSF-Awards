It is now well established that platelet aggregation is not only important for
primary hemostasis but, when exaggerated, can also lead to the formation of
occlusive thrombi, which form at sites of atherosclerotic plaque rupture,
resulting in a heart attack, stroke or sudden death. Platelets are micron-size
cells - smaller than red blood cells - and when activated they become adhesive
for other activated platelets and they adhere to the vessel wall. Their strong
interaction with nano-size proteins at the sub-endothelium matrix activates and
reshapes them from passively traveling discoids to active spiny spheres. The
length and time scales characterizing such interactions as well as platelet-
blood flow interactions span several orders of magnitude.

We propose a multiscale modeling methodology with focus on flow-modulated
phenomena such as platelet adhesion and aggregation at the micron-scale, and
including nanoscale effects representing the main protein interactions. We will
develop an integrated approach by coupling multiscale representations of blood
flow, ranging from a quasi 1D transient flow in compliant vessels at the largest
scale, to unsteady 3D flows in curved and flexing vessels at the mm range, to
multi micron-scale thrombus formation at a fissure in the lumen of such a vessel
with an atherosclerotic plaque, to changes over short times (seconds and
minutes) in the behavior of platelet structure, receptors and bonds in a
developing thrombus-wall interaction. To this end, we will develop a new
mesoscopic numerical method that bridges the gap between atomistic phenomena and
large-scale phenomena to seamlessly connect length scales from 10 nm to a few
mm. The new simulation approach will be validated systematically against
experiments of varying biological and computational complexity.

We also propose to establish a virtual center for multiscale modeling in order
to provide modelers and experimentalists with quantitative information about
molecular and cellullar processes that can be incorporated into simplified
models. To this end, we plan to organize a workshop on multiscale modeling of
biological processes during the second year of the proposed project. In our
outreach program, we plan to engage pre-college women from the Providence area
in computer and computational sciences. This will involve lectures by our
medical collaborators as well as interactive learning at Brown's virtual
immersive visualization facility.

The potential impact of this work is great as it provides a new simulation
capability for studying biomolecular interactions in blood vessels, organs and
the entire arterial tree in a few hours instead of days or even weeks on a
supercomputer. This, in turn, will allow fundamental studies at the molecular
and cellular level and interaction with macroscales not currently possible with
existing methodologies.
