This award will provide continuing support for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site at Harvard University. A training program in evolutionary
biology is established for undergraduates interested in acquiring research
experience. Under the guidance of appropriate faculty, students will receive
training in theoretical concepts, research problems, and various biological
techniques used to formulate and test hypotheses on these problems. Students
will be encouraged to become familiar with research being conducted in the
laboratory before choosing a specific research topic which they will explore in
detail. Regular interactions between students and faculty are emphasized.
Students will attend a weekly inter-laboratory discussion group where they will
be exposed to research projects conducted in other laboratories, as well as
present and receive feedback on their own work. Facilities and training are
available so that students will be able to conduct independent or semi-
independent research on important questions in evolutionary biology.
