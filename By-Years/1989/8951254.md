The enormous impact of physics upon health care technology has led the Physics
and Biology Faculty at Loyola College to re- evaluate the introductory physics
laboratory course for life science majors. A hands-on approach geared towards
practical, useful applications of physics is an excellent way to learn the
process of doing physics. The project introduces fundamental physics concepts
using robot technology, an important area for bioengineering and industry.
Through a series of seven "lab projects", each focused on a set of related
physical principles, an integrated program on robotics will be taught in
coordination with the lectures. The culmination of the course would be the
actual construction of four robotic arms and two mobile robots. Basic hardware
components form the bulk of the equipment list to allow creativity in design.
This approach reflects the belief that the students will develop a deeper
appreciation of physics if they first understand how individual components work
and later the interconnections necessary for a complex physical system. Combined
with the students' natural curiosity in robots, this proposed work will
stimulate continued enthusiasm in learning physics. The College will match the
award with an equal amount.
