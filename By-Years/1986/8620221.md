Commercially-successful production of useful biochemicals such as insulin,
growth hormone, and interferon depends on the efficiency and effectiveness of
the processes for purifying these substances. Considerable advances have been
made in recent years on the molecular biology of these substances. Therefore the
time is ripe for studying the molecular ion-exchange phenomena (kinetics,
thermodynamics, etc.) that are relevant in the design of large-scale separation
processes. This research outlines a systematic study of such phenomena and
promises to be of potential value in advancing bioseparation technology.
