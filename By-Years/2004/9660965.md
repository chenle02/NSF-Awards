*** 9660965 Tsao This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to
develop a new computer display, called Volumetric Image Display (VID) capable of
displaying three-dimensional (3D) volumetric images in a spatial region. Many
viewers can walk around the display and see the image from omni-directions
simultaneously. The image is real and no glasses are required. This patent
pending technology is directed at solving problems encountered in current 3D
visualization using conventional computer displays. The objectives of this
research are to study, test, and demonstrate the Volumetric Image Display,
hardware system, to develop software tool prototypes for 3D data processing and
displaying. and to study and design the system components required for
displaying high resolution images with gray scale and colors. A low-resolution
prototype has been built and tested to demonstrate the basic concept by showing
simple volumetric 3D images. In this research, a moderate-resolution VID
prototype based on a FLC (ferroelectric liquid crystal) image panel will be
built. A set of software tool prototypes will be developed for processing and
displaying 3D data on the VID prototype. At the completion of the Phase I work,
the system will be the first in the field of volume display capable of 512 x 256
x 400 voxels monochrome image using a FLC device. Later, the system will be able
to display gray scale and color images. The novelty of the proposed technical
approach can make the VID system the first commercial volume display for
practical use. Potential applications include computer aided design in auto-
industry, architecture, molecular research, entertainment such as amusement
machines, 3D game machines, advertising displays, medical imaging, and weather
monitoring. ***
