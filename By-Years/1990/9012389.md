Efforts to model the equable global climate during Paleogene times (~66-35 Ma)
are hampered by a lack of detail in our knowledge of temperature patterns and
ocean circulation during this interval. Drs. Zachos and Lohmann at the Univ. of
Michigan and their colleague Dr. Stott at Univ. of S. Calif. have been awarded
funds to analyze samples from 21 DSDP and ODP sites from three time slices
during this interval. They will measure delta O18 and delata C13 values in
planktonic and benthic forams to establish sea surface temperatures, thermal
structure of the mixed layer/thermocline, and intermediate water
characteristics. Age control will be based on integrated bio- and Sr-isotope
stratigraphies. They intend to reconstruct latitudinal temperature gradients
from these locations across the Indian and adjacent Southern Ocean, and will
evaluate the hypothesis that deep-ocean circulation during the Paleogene was
driven by salinity gradients created by especially intense low-latitude
evaporation.
