Woosley, Stanford AST 97-31569 Dr. Woosley will continue his program of
research into the origin and evolution of chemical elements, the evolution of
massive stars, and the mechanisms and outcome of supernovae explosions. He will
make a number of improvements to his stellar evolution model, including updated
opacities and nuclear reaction rates, improved nuclear reaction networks, the
incorporation of effects of mass loss and rotation, and a more thorough
treatment of convection and mixing. With these improved model results he will
explore the sensitivities of the supernovae explosion properties to the pre-
supernova model. He also will study the physics of flame propagation and
detonation in degenerate white dwarf stars to develop a better understanding of
Type Ia supernovae. In all cases, he will determine the detailed
nucleosynthesis, with the continued goal of understanding the origin and
evolution of the elements. This suite of investigations has direct application
to many related areas of research, such as galactic chemical evolution, the
distance scale in the universe, gamma-ray astronomy, isotopic anomalies in
meteorites, and particle astrophysics. ***
