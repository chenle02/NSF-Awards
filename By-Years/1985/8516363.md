In pulverized coal combustion systems and in coal gasification systems,
radiation is the dominant mode of head transfer both in the combustor and in the
reactor, as well as in the boiler into which the combustion of reaction products
flows. The calculation of radiative heat transfer in such systems requires a
detailed knowledge of the so-called optical properties. The research program
will generate such basic data and will generalize the data to predict the
radiative properities of coal ashes as a function of composition, oxidation
state, wavelength, and temperature.
