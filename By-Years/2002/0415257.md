We are currently witnessing a proliferation of database-powered Web applications
that interact with external users or programs according to workflows of
considerable complexity. This complexity calls for the development of static
analysis techniques capable of exposing bugs (such as non-conformance to a given
secure data access protocol, or to the intended business process) to increase
the confidence in the security, robustness and correctness of Web
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general objective of this project is to
develop new tools and techniques for the high-level specification and automatic
verification of database-powered Web applications. The project investigates the
trade-off between the expressiveness of the Web service specification language
and the feasibility of verification tasks. It also aims at establishing
tractability boundaries and at developing practical algorithms and heuristics
for verification. The technical problems raised bring into play techniques from
logic, automata theory, computational complexity, algorithms, and computer-aided
verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's broader impact consists in
advancing the technology required by the development of trustworthy interactive,
database-powered Web applications. This will benefit a wide variety of
applications ranging from digital government to e-commerce to infrastructure for
scientific applications. This research will encourage closer collaboration
between the database and computer-aided verification communities. The project
will contribute to the development of human resources by training doctoral and
MS students in the critical area of secure and robust Web application
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the project will be widely
disseminated through high-quality conference and journal publications. The
developed tools will be made available via the project's Web site
(http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/~lsui/project) for academic, research, and non-
commercial purposes. &lt;br/&gt;
