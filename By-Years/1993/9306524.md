9306524 Goldberg Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will
include study of mechanisms for producing anomalously large numbers of certain
particles in collisions at high energies. These particles are carriers of the
weak nuclear force. A second related project consists of the analysis of a new
model for the generation of matter, as opposed to anti-matter, in the early
universe. The research plays a key role in the understanding of the present
structure of our universe, and the elucidation of its origin constitutes a major
opportunity to enlarge our knowledge in both theoretical elementary particle
physics and cosmology. ***
