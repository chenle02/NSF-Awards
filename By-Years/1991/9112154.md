The major objectives of this project are to generate data and develop
understanding of the engineering fundamentals of dynamic adsorption of
surfactants, lipids (oil-soluble or water insoluble surfactants), and proteins
at the air/water interface. Dynamic adsorption, as measured either by dynamic
adsorption density or by the dynamic surface tension, affects foam stability and
the preferential concentration of proteins and lipids at the air/water
interface. Such preferential adsorption can be used to separate and purify
hydrophobic proteins, surfactants, and lipids.
