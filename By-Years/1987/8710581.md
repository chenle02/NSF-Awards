The ability of plants to resist pathogenic invasion by fungi often involves
interactions between specific host and pathogen genotypes. Genes from the bean
pathogen, Glomerella cingulata, that are responsible for specific interactions
with Phaseolus vulgaris will be isolated. Experiments with the cloned genes will
address the mechanisms responsible for specific recognition between host and
pathogen. The genes will be used to test whether their expression is induced by
exposure to plants; if so, factors responsible for induction will be identified.
Antibodies made against proteins encoded by these genes will be used to detect
their presence and cellular localization. Experiments will be performed to
determine if these proteins are the primary signals for recognition by resistant
hosts, or if they are cell- wall degrading enzymes that release specific
elicitors that are recognized by the host. If the fungal proteins are the
signals, they will be used to detect the plant receptors. Knowledge of how
pathogens and their hosts interact on both the genetic and metabolic level is of
basic interest but the practical considerations are also immense. Crops are lost
each year to various diseases and only by understanding the basis of disease can
rational preventatives be designed.
