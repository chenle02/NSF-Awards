A three-week long summer school for graduate students in "Modern Applications of
Representation Theory" will take place at the University of Chicago from July 20
to August 6, 2014 as part of the Institute for Mathematics and Applications
(IMA) Graduate Students Summer Programs. In mathematics symmetries are described
by abstract objects called groups. Representation theory, originating in the
work of mathematicians such as Issai Schur and Ferdinand Frobenius at the end of
the 19th century, studies how the structure of groups can be captured by
simpler, linear objects, in particular, matrices. Apart from making groups more
concrete, it has long been realized that this is critical for understanding how
groups act on other objects. For example, in physics one is interested in how
the symmetry groups of nature, such as translations and rotations, act on
physical systems. This is why, starting in the 1920's, the representation theory
of unitary groups, in particular, has been central to the development of quantum
mechanics and particle physics. Recently, surprising connections have also been
uncovered between representation theory and problems of a seemingly very
different character, such as finding the number of operations required on a
computer to carry out arithmetic computations, aligning a large number of noisy
images of the same molecule taken by a certain type of electron-microscope, and
ranking problems in statistical machine learning. The aim of the summer school
is to engage graduate students from across the sciences in research in these
exciting new areas.

In recent years representation theory has found new applications in a range of
domains from cryo-electron microscopy, through machine learning, to holographic
algorithms. The fact that the subject is usually taught for an audience in pure
mathematics makes it challenging for graduate students in more applied
disciplines to learn the material. Conversely, mathematicians are often not
aware of the new, exciting applications of representation theory. This summer
school attempts to bridge this gap by starting with a short introduction to
representation theory, followed by a series of mini-courses on some of the most
recent work on using representation theoretical ideas in imaging, signal
processing, holographic algorithms, quantum computing, algebraic and geometric
computational complexity theory, non-commutative Fourier transforms, and other
areas. Each of these subjects is presented by one of the leading experts in the
area. The website for the summer school can be found here:
