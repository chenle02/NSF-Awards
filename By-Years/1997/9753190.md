9753190 Miller This POWRE award supports a Visiting Professor appointment at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for Dr. M. Meghan Miller, Professor
and Chair of Geology at Central Washington University. Bradford Hager, a
Professor at MIT, is the faculty host. Miller will develop three inter-related
research projects: 1) model results from seven years of GPS measurements in the
Eastern California shear zone, in collaboration with MIT faculty, 2)
geodynamical studies of the Tien Shan, and 3) seed future modeling of results
from a new, permanent GPS array in the Pacific Northwest. In the first project,
GPS observations of plate margin deformation in the Eastern California shear
zone, data reduction in at CWU is mature, and the results are ready for
modeling. In addition, MIT workers have observed a smaller, denser array in the
Coso Hot Springs area, China Lake, for which this network provides regional
context. Modeling and publishing results of this project will be a major focus
of Miller's year at MIT. In the second project, CWU is partner institution on an
NSF-EAR Continental Dynamics project in the Tien Shan of central Asia. Bradford
Hager is the Chief Scientist on this twelve US investigator proposal. Miller is
a member of the four co-investigator field geology team; Hager coordinates the
GPS work. The visit will be a critical time for maturation of the collaboration
on this multi-institution effort. The POWRE award will facilitate this
collaboration. Finally, a visiting professorship would seed new GPS measurement
and geophysical modeling projects for the study of deformation in the Pacific
Northwest and the processes which drive it, under the auspices of the Pacific
Northwest Geodetic Array.
