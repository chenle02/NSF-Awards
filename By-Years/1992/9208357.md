This action provides funding to coordinate and carry out all phases of a
planning effort for a conference to showcase the highly successful
Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) Program established 20
years ago. The conference will be for an audience of 300-500 people representing
current industrial, state, and federal supporters of the I/UCRCs; leaders of
industrial organizations not now members of any of the I/UCRCs; representatives
of state agencies not now supporting I/UCRCs in their states; members of
Congress and their staff; and appropriate representatives of the Executive
Branch of the federal government; presidents and vice presidents for research
from academia; and representatives of the media. Major goals of the conference
will be to provide to the industrial participants insights on the role such
centers might play in supporting the goals of their industry; to inform Congress
of the activities of the I/UCRCs in promoting the nation's industrial growth; to
demonstrate the progress made in conducting an extensive program of industrially
relevant research; and to demonstrate how much of the past research has resulted
in new products and processes. A steering committee will oversee the planning of
the conference and will work together to ensure that the goals of the conference
are met. The Program Manager recommends funding of this planning proposal in the
amount of $79,568 for one year.
