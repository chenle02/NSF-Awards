Starrfield 9417057 Novae occur in cataclysmic binary systems in which a Roche
lobe filling secondary is losing hydrogen-rich material through the inner
Lagrangian point onto a white dwarf primary. The accumulating shell of material
on the white dwarf is unstable to a thermonuclear runaway and hydrodynamic
simulations of this phenomenon reproduce many of the observed features of the
nova outburst. The proposed research falls into two main areas: theoretical
studies of the classical nova outburst and related topics using both the PI s
hydrodynamic-nucleosynthesis stellar evolution code plus a new radiation-
hydrodynamic code and, in addition, optical observational studies in support of
the theoretical investigations. The questions to be answered theoretically are:
(1) Since virtually all well studied novae exhibit enriched nuclear abundances
in the material ejected by the explosion, what is the source of that enrichment?
(2) Since many recent novae exhibit ejecta enriched in oxygen, neon, and
magnesium, what are the consequences of accretion onto ONeMg white dwarfs and
why do these novae eject so much material? (3) Since both V1500 Cygni and GQMus
have been identified as binary systems containing magnetized white dwarfs (AM
Her variable), what are the consequences of strong magnetic fields on the
outburst? (4) Since observations of novae by the ROSAT and IUE satellites have
now measured the turn off times for V1974 Cygni and GQMus, what is the cause of
the cessation of nuclear burning and the return to quiescence of the white
dwarf? (5) Since we now have superb collections of data on the outbursts of a
number of recent novae such as V1974 Cyg, Cas 1993, and LMC 1990#1, how well can
we simulate the outbursts of these novae? (6) Since all fast novae seem to
experience a phase of super-Eddington luminosity, what are the critical factors
that produce this phase? Finally, optical observations to study the evolution of
novae in outburst and determine energy b udgets, elemental abundances, and turn
off times will be continued. ***
