The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is supporting a Satellite
Symposium on Density Functional Theory and Applications which will be held from
June 3-9, 1997 on the campus of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. It is
to be followed immediately by the 9th International Congress of Quantum
Chemistry in Atlanta, Georgia. Density Functional Theory has become a major
theoretical method for electronic structure calculations of molecules and
condensed matter. The symposium will bring together theoretical and
computational chemists, physicists from around the world who are on the frontier
of the development of the basic formalism and applications of density functional
theory. It is anticipated that approximately 200 scientists will participate in
this conference including 50 speakers. What is particularly significant for US
Science is the large size of the symposium and the fact that it is going to be
the first one accessible to a relatively large number of US graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows. This symposium is organized by Prof. W. Yang of Duke
University and Prof. M. Levy of Tulane.
