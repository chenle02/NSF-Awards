The Mathematical Sciences Education Board (MSEB) is a board of the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS) enabled to coordinate and assist the process of
mathematics education reform in the United States. MSEB is charged with building
alliances, promoting cooperation, and encouraging national, regional, and local
projects. The MSEB will pursue the following goals to provide: (1) leadership of
continuing efforts to improve mathematical sciences nationally; (2) coordination
among existing mathematics education projects; (3) service to localities and
states, through assistance in determining curricular goals and higher standards
for all students, and improving teacher preparation; (4) recommendations of ways
to strengthen weak parts of the infrastructure of mathematics education; (5)
information to increase public understanding of the rapidly changing missions
and character of the mathematical sciences; and (6) advice to federal, state,
and local agencies on long-range goals and needs in mathematical sciences
education. In order to pursue these goals, the present proposal will fund five
major initiatives (Leader Initiative): school mathematics projects,
college/university projects, state and local networks, minority programs, and
general outreach. NAS currently supports the executive director and staff of
MSEB, NSF will support the five major initiatives plus policy formation,
strategic planning, and project creation by the Board and its working
committees. Support for project implementation is obtained through separate
grants from foundations and agencies both private and public.
