DMS-9501516 Rothschild/Baouendi The investigators will study the geometry of
real submanifolds in complex space. In particular, they will focus on geometric
and analytic invariants of these manifolds under holomorphic changes of
coordinates. Special consideration will be given to those manifolds globally
defined by real polynomial equations. For many manifolds defined by the
vanishing of real polynomials, any component of a holomorphic transformation
from one such manifold to another must also be a root of a complex polynomial.
Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the century as a natural
outgrowth of studies of functions of one complex variable. It became clear early
on that the theory differed widely from it predecessor. The underlying geometry
was far more difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more affinity
with partial differential operators of first order. It thus grew as a hybrid
subject combining deep characteristics of differential geometry and differential
equations. Many of the fundamental structures were defined in the last three
decades. Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic
mathematical forms.
