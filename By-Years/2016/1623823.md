Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an emerging nondestructive imaging
technology that enables micron scale, cross sectional, and three-dimensional
(3D) imaging of specimens. OCT has been used in a wide range of clinical
applications, including ophthalmology, endoscopy, cardiology, urology,
dermatology, and dentistry, as well as industrial applications such as
nondestructive testing of materials, industrial inspection, and quality control
in the production process. Speed, resolution, and accuracy define innovation in
the OCT market. Development and commercialization of innovative high-performance
OCT technologies will help greatly improve procedure efficiency, diagnostic
accuracy, and patient comfort, and will embody a significant competitive
advantage in the highly competitive, nearly $1B OCT device market.

This I-Corps team developed a space-division multiplexing OCT (SDM-OCT)
technology, which utilizes a parallel imaging approach to achieve over a 10-fold
speed improvement compared to state of the art commercial OCT systems. This
technology can be inexpensively implemented in the next generation of OCT
devices, i.e., new customers, as well as potentially be retrofitted into
existing OCT devices that represents a huge existing customer base. In this
I-Corps program, the team will further optimize the SDM-OCT technology, identify
customer needs from end users, collect feedback from OCT manufactures, and
develop an informed commercialization strategies based on insights obtained
through customer discovery. These will enable the team to expedite the
translation of the SDM-OCT technology from the laboratory to the market in order
to make a positive impact in many fields of clinical and industrial OCT
applications
