9618990 DiRanna This project sponsored by WestEd - formerly the Far West
Laboratory will carry out a four-year project which will prepare Middle School
Teachers to implement exemplary science materials in the Middle School
classroom. Altogether, 100 schools will participate in the program and will
select two teachers who will be prepared by the project to become lead teachers.
In the first year, these lead teachers will receive instruction to provide them
with the content knowledge and teaching skills so that they will be able to use
exemplary materials in their classrooms. Their duties upon returning to the
classroom will be to use the new materials, network with other participants,
work with colleagues to implement the materials school wide and to work with
student parents and school administrators to make them aware of the reform
goals. In the second year the lead teachers continue with their summer institute
and in the school year through 50 hours of on-site professional development,
work with their colleagues to continue the process of implementing the same two
units. In the two ensuing years the same activities take place so that by the
end of the project, the 200 lead teachers will have had 800 hours of in- service
and have introduced eight new science modules into the classroom. In addition,
2-4 more teachers from each of the schools will have had 308 hours of in-service
and will eventually introduce the same modules into their classrooms. All other
teachers in these schools who teach science will have had 168 hours of in-
service to prepare them also to teach the modules. The lead teachers will
disseminate the activities to other schools in the state. Activities for parents
and administrators will take place all four years. Over the life of the project,
1276 teachers and 120 administrators will have been served by the program.
