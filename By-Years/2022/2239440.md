Automated knowledge extraction and discovery methods can address the diverse
needs of different users (e.g., governments for decision making and scientists
for literature summary). A fundamental open problem is how much user effort
automated methods require to obtain useful knowledge. This project aims to
minimize such required user effort with a newly proposed paradigm, extremely
weak supervision â€“ It includes only brief natural-language user input to define
the task (e.g., a list of topics when classifying news articles; location names
when classifying events), guidance similar to task-specific guidelines that
might be provided to human annotators. By using brief natural-language input
instead of labor-intensive annotated training samples, this new paradigm will
help democratize knowledge extraction and discovery, and extend its application
beyond rich companies to ordinary, relatively untrained users with a broad range
of needs (e.g., domain scientists and small business owners). Project outcomes
will be disseminated via top conferences and scholarly publications and
integrated into new courses. This project will also support a diverse set of
graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project focuses on four fundamental, interconnected knowledge extraction and
discovery tasks, i.e., text classification, phrase mining, named entity
recognition, and relation extraction. Following the extremely weak supervision
paradigm, this project will develop a series of novel methods, including (1) an
unsupervised phrase tagging method for both multi-gram and unigram (emerging)
phrases, (2) a text classification method that can take only the most popular
(e.g., top-50%) class names as input to discover novel classes (i.e., new
classes are not explicitly defined by the user) and build a classifier for all
the classes; (3) a named entity recognition method that can take a few popular
entity types and mentions of interest to recognize (emerging) entity mentions of
the same/similar types; and (4) a relation extraction method that can take a few
popular relation types and tuples of interest to discover relations of similar
semantics and extract relevant tuples. All these methods, by design, will be
agnostic to domains and languages and require only the availability of pre-
trained neural language models in a particular domain and
language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
