The global theory of minimal surfaces in space is in a phase of explosive
growth. Many new methods of constructing complete embedded minimal surfaces have
recently been found; in place of a dearth of examples just a few years ago, we
now have a quite varied collection of surfaces, including infinite families. A
basic problem is to classify these examples, i.e. collect them into families
with common properties and understood limits. Fruitful approaches have recently
been developed that combine numerical simulation with methods from the theory of
geometric structures on surfaces and classical complex analysis, notably
Teichmuller theory. Some of the problems the team will attack are: Are there
embedded minimal surfaces with one heliciodal end and arbitrary genus? Is the
classical Scherk surface the unique desingularization of a pair of planes? Of
what families is the Scherk surface the limit point? At the same time, the group
hopes to make progress on simulation of minimal surfaces. For example, we hope
to set up a library of Weierstrass representations of minimal surfaces which is
reproducible, fully documented, and useful as a research tool.

A guiding philosophy in many areas of science, from physics to biochemistry to
ecology, is that nature is maximally efficient; indeed, many explanations of
natural phenomena have at their foundation the assumption that the phenomenon
has optimized some or several of its features in the expression we witness. At
its base, this philosophical principle is mathematical in nature: we search for
principles in science that can be formulated as extremal problems. In
mathematics, we can make this assumption of optimality very rigorous by
expressing it as an equation. This leaves us with the problem of understanding
all of the solutions of that equation. In this project, we aim to study one very
rich type of optimization problem, the minimal surface problem, which is already
known to have a number of quite subtle characteristics. (A minimal surface is
one for which each small piece has less area than any other surface with the
same boundary.) The study of these surfaces has its origins in physical problems
studied first by Euler; then, a century later, the problem also arose in the
studies of the behavior of rotating droplets and soap films by F. Plateau. Today
the applications range from cosmology to the understanding of the structure of
stable periodic structures in compound copolymers. As in many other optimization
problems, for the minimal surface problem, we do not have much general
information about solutions to the equation expressing extremality. At present
though, we do have a wide variety of examples which help to guide our intuition,
and which we are beginning to organize. It is thus a good model problem,
enriching our understanding of all optimization problems.
