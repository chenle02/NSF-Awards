Abstract Presbyterian Healthcare Services - R. Vaughn Connection to NSFNET
Proposal No. NCR-9417126 Presbyterian Healthcare Services network project will
integrate the existing state-wide network at PHS with the NSFNET. This
integration will provide access to national databases from PHS staff and
physicians in addition to fostering peer communication and data exchange with
external sources. Immediate beneficiaries will be the PHS Medical Library, the
PHS Quality Support Services Department and the physicians affiliated with PHS.
Uses include access to bibliographic databases, on- line library catalogs,
electronic mail, and large volume data exchanges with external sources. The
specialized bibliographic databases from the National Library of Medicine, such
as Medline and Cancerline, are also available through NSFNET.
