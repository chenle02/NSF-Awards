A major workshop, "New developments in non-commutative algebra and its
applications", will be held in Scotland, at the Gaelic College on the isle of
Skye, in June 2011. Interaction with other areas of mathematics has been a
central theme of current non-commutative algebra. Connections to algebraic
geometry, symplectic geometry, and representation theory are three major overall
topics of focus for this workshop and the world-class experts who will speak on
them at the workshop.

The general topic of the conference, noncommutative algebra, involves the study
of operations which give different results when performed in a different order.
A famous example of this in physics involves the position and momentum operators
in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. An important subject in current physics
closely connected with the topic is string theory, especially the study of
mirror symmetry. Current trends in noncommutative algebra are highly
interdisciplinary and touch many other fundamental areas of mathematics. A major
workshop such as this brings together many researchers from the U.S., Europe,
and elsewhere, and can be crucial to establishing new collaborations and more
interactions between mathematicians studying different threads of the subject.
This NSF conference grant will allow a larger number of U.S. participants,
especially younger mathematicians, to attend by supporting their travel.
