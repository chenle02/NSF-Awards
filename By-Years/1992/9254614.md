The Brooklyn Children's Museum and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden aim to
cooperatively and cost-effectively develop, evaluate, and produce three
permanent exhibits (2600 sf at BCM, 1200 sf at BBG, and a 3600 sf outdoor
Discovery Garden at BBG) and two copies of an 800 sf traveling exhibit in a
project called Breaking Ground: Plants and People. When complete in 1996, these
exhibits will teach 1.5 million annual public visitors about basics in botany,
ethnobotany, and urban to ecology, promote an understanding of plants'
importance to human life, and foster positive environmental ethics among
children 6-12 years old. This project is important because collaboration with
professional botanists will teach a leading children's museum how to effectively
present in-depth science content, and allow a major public garden to experiment
with interactive exhibits in a natural setting. Joint promotions using NSF-
funded program materials will encourage children in culturally and economically
diverse areas around New York City to return again and again to two important
community resources for informal science education. This strategy will reinforce
learning and promote lifelong appreciation for experiential exhibits in
botanical gardens and for a meaningful depth of science in children's museums.
