This action supports a symposium on superplasticity in materials in spring
1990. The symposium takes an interdisciplinary approach to superplastic forming
by incorporating into the meeting technical discussions of superplasticity in
intermetallics, fine-scale nanocrystalline ceramics, and geological flow. The
meeting provides a forum for discussion of new research results pertaining to
high strain rate superplastic flow. Superplastic forming offers a cost-
effective, efficient process for metal alloy forming and diffusion bonding. The
possible applications of this process to other difficult-to-form materials
offers exciting growth potential to this area.
