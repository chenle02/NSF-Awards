9631665 Atema The mechanisms by which animals detect objects by their sense of
smell are largely unknown. In natural settings odor plumes are broken up by
turbulence into many discontinuous odor patches, hence locating an odor source
is a very hard problem. Computational approaches, using artificial neural nets
have proven highly effective in recognizing complex patterns. Although most
studies of animal pattern recognition are based on visual or acoustic inputs,
the research funded this grant is focused on recognition of temporal odor
patterns. It is proposed that the rapid concentration fluctuations that animals
encounter in turbulent odor plumes contain spatial information and that animals
use such dynamic patterns to guide them to the source of the odor. The
computational research funded by this grant explores candidate search strategies
for such gradients and tests these strategies under various plume conditions. In
addition to increasing our understanding of how animals use their olfactory
systems, the results obtained by this study are expected to be applicable to
robot guidance in underwater search missions, such as locating sources of
pollution in the natural environment.
