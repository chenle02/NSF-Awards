The aim of the proposal is to conduct cutting-edge
computer&lt;br/&gt;simulations to help understand the increasingly rich
observations of&lt;br/&gt;the young Universe. The simulations will study the
damage wrought by&lt;br/&gt;the brilliant life and explosive death of the first
stars. The&lt;br/&gt;material between the stars is cooked by intense, high-
energy radiation&lt;br/&gt;and the simulations will study the consequences of
that&lt;br/&gt;cooking. Particles of dark, non-radiating matter respond to the
force&lt;br/&gt;of gravity, so dark matter could influence the formation of the
first&lt;br/&gt;stars and galaxies. The simulations will study how this
influence&lt;br/&gt;depends on the mass assumed for these poorly-understood
particles.&lt;br/&gt;Comparisons between the simulations and the growing body of
ground-&lt;br/&gt;and space-based observations of the young Universe will
significantly&lt;br/&gt;strengthen the inferences drawn from those observations.
The new&lt;br/&gt;simulations will be suitably visualized and shown to the
public in the&lt;br/&gt;IMAX theatre of the Rose-Hayden Planetarium of the
American Museum of&lt;br/&gt;Natural History in New York City. Prior videos from
this team have&lt;br/&gt;been featured daily in that venue, making it an
effective point of&lt;br/&gt;public access especially for young viewers.
