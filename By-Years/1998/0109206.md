This postdoctoral research project will further refine and examine the
construction and validation of three scales: 1) the African American Church
Scale (ARCH); 2) Parental Version of the Racial Socialization Scale (PVRS); and
3) Adolescent Version of the Racial Socialization Scale (AVRS). Each scale is a
theory-based self-report measure. Separate focus groups consisting of parents
and their adolescents from three predominantly African American churches will be
conducted to assess the multidimensionality and generate items for each scale. A
CFA will be used to investigate and refine the scale underlying dimensions of
the ARCS, PVRS, and AVRS. Factor scales will be produced using data from 225
African American parent and adolescent dyads. Lastly, construct and discriminant
validity approaches will investigate the relationship of these scales to
existing instruments.
