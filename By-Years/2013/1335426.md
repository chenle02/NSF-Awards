The research objective of this award is to study backward wave propagation in
elastic waveguides and how it can be harnessed to create novel acoustic wave
devices and improved nondestructive evaluation techniques. The research approach
is to determine the conditions under which backward waves exist in plates and
thin films, and how to efficiently control wave propagation through mode
conversion between forward and backward propagating waves at interfaces.
Backward wave propagation can lead to non-intuitive physical effects such as
negative refraction and negative reflection of elastic waves and localized
resonances. Experimental measurements and computational modeling will be used to
design and evaluate surface acoustic and plate wave lenses based on negative
refraction, and to assess the potential for using negative reflection and
localized resonances for the nondestructive evaluation of thin films and plates.

If successful, this research will lead to a new approach for manipulating guided
elastic waves by controlling the surface profile of waveguides. Structures
supporting guided elastic waves are commonplace and the results of the proposed
research offer potential improvements to the nondestructive evaluation of
aircraft, pipelines, and critical electronic components. Backward wave
propagation could prove to be an enabling technology, offering a fundamentally
new approach for the design of a wide range of acoustic devices including
resonators, filters, and lenses. It could also have an impact on a broad range
of fields that incorporate elastic wave propagation, from seismology to energy
harvesting. The research will support advanced training for undergraduate and
graduate students, and an education program will be developed where high school
and undergraduate students are introduced to nondestructive testing through
hands-on laboratory work.
