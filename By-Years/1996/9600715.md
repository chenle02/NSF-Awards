9600715 Cox Cilliates possess two nuclei, a vegetative macronucleus and a
germline micronucleus. The macronucleus is produced from the micronucleus by a
programmed series of fragmentation events of the germline chromosomes, deletion
of some sequences and amplification of the remaining DNA. There is only limited
information about the mechanisms involved in this process as well as the
biological function of the deletion reactions. An in vitro system for two of
these developmentally programmed DNA deletion reactions will be developed, the M
and R region deletions from the ciliate, Tetrahymena thermophila. Previous work
from this laboratory has suggested a likely deletion pathway and a protocol is
envisioned in which new DNA substrates are first tested in vivo and then assays
are carried out to detect individual steps of the projected recombination
process in vitro. To facilitate the purification of any relevant enzymes
detected, methods to produce large-scale cultures of synchronously mating cells
will be developed. The ultimate goal is a complete molecular description of the
deletion pathway derived from studies of an in vitro system reconstituted from
purified enzymes and substrates. %%% Programmed DNA rearrangements are not only
a normal part of mammalian genome mechanisms (i.e. immunoglobulin genes) but
also of aberrant genome phenomena (i.e. tumorogensis). An understanding of the
biochemistry of genome restructuring in simple one-celled organisms such as
Tetrahymena can give insight into the mechanisms utilized by more advanced
organisms such as humans. ***
