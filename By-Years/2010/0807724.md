Dr. Mathews and his team will explore the role of cosmic rays, active galactic
nuclei (AGN) and dust in regulating the heating and cooling of the hot X-ray
emitting gas that fills clusters of galaxies. Without a heat source, the gas at
the center of large galaxy clusters is dense enough to cool and should form
stars. We do not see this happening, and infer that the gas is heated in some
way; this work investigates various possibilities. The team will develop
detailed computational models, examining astrophysical processes including dust-
aided cooling, sporadic accretion onto and energy injection from AGN, cosmic-ray
acceleration/diffusion/heating, and convection. He will perform analytic studies
and hydrodynamic simulations of cavities that are inflated in the X-ray-emitting
gas by cosmic rays; to explore mass and energy circulation driven by active
galactic nuclei; and to calculate the radiation from dust grains heated by
random impacts with particles in the hot gas.

Dr. Mathews will write a popular science article on their research, and will
give several public lectures at the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History. A
postdoctoral scholar will be trained by taking part in the research.
