9450874 Misra In most universities, parallel computing is treated as a highly
specialized area of knowledge that is taught only to computer science graduate
students. This prevents undergraduate students in other disciplines from
receiving formal instruction in an area that could prove to be very useful for
solving complex problems in their own fields. An emphasis on interdisciplinary
education and the excellent undergraduate students at the Colorado School of
Mines provide an ideal environment for the development of a course that attempts
to rectify the above shortcoming. This project is a new course that is designed
to teach parallel computing to undergraduate scientists and engineers. The
students in the course work in collaboration with research mentors to design and
implement parallel solutions to problems of their choice. The course teaches
students key issues in parallel computing design and analysis of parallel
algorithms, hardware considerations, software considerations, parallel
programming, and visualization of results. This project requires parallel
hardware, a graphics workstation, and software to enhance the hands-on learning
experience of the students taking this course. It is expected that the knowledge
of parallel computing will make the students more valuable contributors to
industry and better researchers. In addition, it is expected that this course
will prove to be a model that can be used by other schools that are dedicated to
enhancing undergraduate education in science and engineering.
