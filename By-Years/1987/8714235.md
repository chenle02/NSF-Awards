This Biological Facilities Center proposal requests funds to establish a
Microscopy and Imaging Center to meet the research needs of investigators in the
Life Sciences. The present Electron Microscopy Laboratory will be incorporated
into the Center, and it will be expanded by adding a high.resolution electron
microscope and a research quality light microscope. Both will have TV cameras
connected directly to an image processing computer. The instrumentation will be
designed to facilitate a number of new and important techniques including the
examination of frozen.hydrated specimens, very low contrast specimens,
dose.sensitive specimens, "thick" sections, and low intensity fluorescent
specimens. The on.line computer will offer image processing software for both
light and electron microscopical applications. Other computer operations will
include 2D gel analysis and 3D molecular modeling. The instruments will benefit
six primary users and eighteen secondary users, representing the Departments of
Botany, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Veterinary and Animal Sciences, and Zoology,
as well as two of the neighboring private colleges, Amherst and Mount Holyoke.
Collaboration across disciplines are already in progress. A major goal of the
Microscopy Center will be to foster further collaborative efforts by acting as a
focus for the exchange of ideas and information. The Center will collect and
disseminate information on methods through workshops and written manuals. The
Center staff will keep abreast of developments in computer image processing and
make them available to users. Training courses for beginners, workshops in
specialized fields, and informational seminars by users and visitors will be
provided.
