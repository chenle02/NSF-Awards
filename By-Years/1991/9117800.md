This research will address the determination of down-dip slip distribution on
fault surfaces during large earthquakes. This has been a difficult problem in
the past because of limitations in the bandwidth of seismic instrumentation.
This technique will be to use recorded tsunamis for oceanic earthquakes, along
with any land-based geodetic data, to constrain the down-dip earthquake slips.
Earthquakes that will be investigated are the 1944 Tonankai and the 1946
Nankaido earthquakes along the Nankai Trough, Japan, the 1923 Kanto, Japan,
earthquake, the 1964 Alaska earthquake, and the 1960 Chilean earthquake. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
