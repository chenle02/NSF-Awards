Smith In the area of cache memories and CPU performance architecture the
research efforts are directed at three items: 1. A study of the behavior of
vector workloads and the extent to which vector machines can be expected to
benefit from the use of cache memories. Iinitial results suggest that cache
memories would work well. 2. A study of cache consistency in multiprocessors.
Current research is directed at analyzing some multiprocessor traces in order to
understand sharing behavior, and to evaluate the relative performance of a
number of multiprocessor cache consistency algorithms. The project is generating
further traces and study the effect of changes in the source code on sharing
behavior. 3. The mMeasurement of the memory systems of a number of machines to
determine the effect that those memory systems have on overall system
performance.
