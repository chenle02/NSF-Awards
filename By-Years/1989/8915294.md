Biosensors will be constructed and evaluated for monitoring mercury and toluene
in the environment and for monitoring the metabolic activity of cells in a
bioreactor. The biosensors all operate on the same principle of using
microorganisms containing the lux genes to produce light in response to
induction by an analyte. The light will be collected with a simple semiconductor
juction (diode). The microorganisms and the photodiode will be interfaced to
produce a biosensor devise. Advantages of our approach include immediate
commercial opportunities, appropriate sensitivity and selectivity for the
analytes, existing sophistication of light collection and analysis, and
generalizability of the concept to produce a whole range of similar devices
capable of reporting other environmental toxicants, drugs, pharmaceuticals,
organisms and many other biological compounds.
