The objective of this three year proposal is to construct a low temperature
atomic force microscope (AFM) combined with the freeze-fracture/freeze-etch
technique of structural biology research. A prototype is expected to be
completed within three years, and it will be dedicated to instrumentation
calibration and structural study of macromolecules of biological importance.
Structural information on functional proteins in liposome obtained by electron
microscopy is limited to a resolution about 2-5 nm in conventional freeze-
fracture/etch practice, due to the limitation by the gain size of shadowing
metal particles. However, the newly developed AFM, which uses interacting force
between a sharp tip at the end of a cantilever and the specimen surface
topology, can achieve atomic resolution with high signal to noise ratio.
Unfortunately, the conventional AFM applies a much stronger probing force to the
specimen surface than that can be withstood by a biological specimen at room
temperature. At low temperatures this become a minor problem, because a frozen
specimen is less disturbed by the probing force. We propose to build a liquid
nitrogen temperature AFM system, and use this modified AFM for elucidation of
molecular and submit structures of membrane associated and purified
macromolecules. The system incorporates an ambient pressure freeze-fracture/etch
apparatus working in liquid nitrogen and an AFM in pure nitrogen vapor, thus a
freshly prepared specimen is immediately scanned to study its surface structure.
Furthermore, the system is self enclosed and sufficient measure has been taken
to keep specimens free from any contamination, especially water condensation on
the specimen . Thus, the proposed low temperature AFM can be used to elucidate
the molecular structures of a variety of functional membrane proteins and
specific inhibitors, and will provide valuable information about their
interaction, conformational changes, and higher order structures.
