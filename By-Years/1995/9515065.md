Lars J. Olson University of Maryland - College Park SBR-9515065 This research
addresses questions about the management, conservation, extinction and
sustainability of natural and environmental resources. Many of the critical
natural resource and environmental issues facing society are those where the
resource stock or environmental amenity affects social welfare and where the
stock changes over time in response to human decisions and other factors.
Examples include endangered species, preservation, declining fisheries, and
accumulating pollutants such as those contributing to global warming and ozone
depletion. This research will add a stock component to the models which analyze
conservation and stock issues. The analysis will use discrete time deterministic
and stochastic dynamic resource allocation models with non-concave growth or
production functions. The research will advance understanding of the economic
and environmental conditions under which resource conservation and
sustainability can be expected to occur and it explores policy alternatives for
achieving these ends.
