9355018 Bajcsy The proposed program is focused on research and education
relating to the fundamental scientific issues underlying the coordination of
multiple robotic agents for manipulating and transporting objects with limited
assistance from human agents. We argue that the narrow specialization of the PhD
does not always serve the needs of education and engineering today. We propose
an integrated approach to research which fosters multi-faculty-student
interaction. In this approach several faculty and students from different
backgrounds, but with common goals, collaboratively pursue a research agenda
which requires the collective expertise of the group. The interdisciplinary
GRASP Laboratory with faculty and students from four different engineering
departments is uniquely qualified to train PhD students in the focus area and
provide them with the breadth and depth that is required in today's high
technology society. We request five traineeships for the laboratory. ***
