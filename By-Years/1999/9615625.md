AST-9615625 Scherb Drs. Frank Scherb and Fred Roesler at the University of
Wisconsin will carry out a comprehensive program of observations on comet Hale-
Bopp. Hale-Bopp is viewed as a target of opportunity to focus an array of
observational and analysis efforts on understanding the composition and
structure of comets. These investigators will use newly augmented facilities and
instruments at the WIYN telescope on Kitt Peak, Arizona and at the Pine Bluff
Observatory near Madison, Wisconsin. This award is supported jointly by the
Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences at NSF.
