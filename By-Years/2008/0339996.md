0339996&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project addresses the feasibility of performing molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations using numerical database representations of quantum mechanical
potential energy surfaces (PES). The specific objectives are: (1) Perform ab
initio calculations to obtain PES data for a prototype (N2(g)) chemical system;
(2) Design a PES database using data from the first objective; (3) Integrate the
following software: PES database; tessellation and interpolation algorithms; MD
simulation engine; (4)Perform MD simulations using potential energies
interpolated from the PES database; and (5)&lt;br/&gt;Perform analogous Car-
Parinello simulations for speed and accuracy comparisons. The proposed method
does not require the complex and time-consuming process of parameterizing force
fields for MD simulations, and a PES may be determined to any desired level of
theory. The method is general enough for applications in both&lt;br/&gt;reactive
chemical dynamics and MD simulations where bulk material properties are of
interest.&lt;br/&gt;
