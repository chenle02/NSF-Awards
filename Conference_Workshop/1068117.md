The project provides travel support for applied and computational mathematicians
from the US to attend a set of seven coordinated workshops taking place at the
University of British Columbia (UBC), each for 2-4 days within the period July
13-16, 2011. Collectively this set of workshops form the conference Applied
Mathematics Perspectives 2011. This is a satellite conference to the 7th
International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 2011), which
also takes place in Vancouver the following week. The seven workshops cover
various topics related to mathematical modeling using differential equations and
scientific computing, and are organized by experts in each field. They have been
selected from a larger set of workshops by a PIMS/MITACS panel to receive
partial support from those organizations.

All of the workshops address subjects that are currently of great research
interest and are directly related to themes of ICIAM, as well as to NSF priority
areas. Examples include medical and seismic imaging, the development of tools to
increase the reproducibility of research in computational science, and the study
of fluid dynamics of substances that are difficult to model, such as landslides
or industrial fluids or grains. A special effort is made to involve students,
postdoctoral fellows, women, and under-represented minorities from mathematics
and computer science departments throughout the US. Funding primarily is used
for young researchers and other participants who do not have other sources of
funding to attend these workshops. This also facilitates their participation in
the ICIAM conference, a major international conference the following week that
attracts roughly 3000 participants from around the world. The workshops all take
place on the campus of UBC, and benefit from unified organization and the
opportunity for interaction between participants. This creates an aggregate
workshop that is larger than any of the individual workshops, with several
tracks of talks and a common poster session. On the other hand, it is more
focused, intimate, and informal than the ICIAM conference and provides
additional networking opportunities, particularly for young researchers.
