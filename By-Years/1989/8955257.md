PriMath is a three-year project which focuses on the enhancement of mathematics
teaching in primary grades, with particular emphasis on serving gifted learners
of mathematics. Teachers from a collaborative of 13 school districts will serve
as the target audience. The project structure includes a summer institute for
teacher teams, a series of seminars during the academic year, staff visits to
participant classrooms, visits among participants to each other's classrooms,
and in-service offerings by participants. Principals, mathematics curriculum
specialists, and gifted education curriculum specialists will be involved. The
mathematical content focus is in the area of geometry, with emphasis on patterns
and visualization. Teachers will select and adapt existing materials for use
with gifted primary students. Cost sharing is provided in the amount of 1.14% of
the NSF award.
