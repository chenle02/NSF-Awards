Proposal Number: CTS-0218801&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: C.
Pozrikidis&lt;br/&gt;Institution: U California, San Diego&lt;br/&gt;Title:
Investigation of hydrodynamics of suspensions of particles, droplets, and
capsules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the
proposed project is to significantly improve the effectiveness of the boundary
integral method by "hybridizing" it with a finite-difference technique. The
purpose is to be able to carry out numerical simulations with many particles
suspended in a fluid with the objective to study flow characteristics of drops,
capsules, and particles. The novel aspect of the approach is to project the
point force distribution on the boundary on an underlying collocation points and
solve for the flow field on this grid. The method will be applied to
suspensions, emulsions with and without surfactants, capsules, and foams. The
method is shown to be scalable on large parallel processors.&lt;br/&gt;
