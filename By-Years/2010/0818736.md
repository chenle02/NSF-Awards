Until recently it was assumed that the responses of brain areas devoted to the
control of environmental reflexes (such as food ingestion and digestion) were
pre-determined, resulting in stereotyped and predictable outcomes. That is to
say, autonomic reflexes were composed of simple nerve cells acting as relay
stations with no "personality". This project challenges this existing dogma and
proposes that autonomic reflex circuits are highly integrated, with pathways
defined uniquely at multiple specific levels and organized into specific
functional lines. This type of cellular organization also implies that separate
subsets of brainstem neurons display "task matching" capabilities and integrate
vital cardiac, gastrointestinal and respiratory functions. The requirements of
each system vary greatly in response type, timing and duration. The long-term
goal of the present project is to investigate the organization of these reflex
circuits with the intention of uncovering distinctions in the neural control of
visceral functions and the role these variations play in allowing different
responses to ever-changing environmental conditions. The recent data from this
team of researchers show that fundamental differences exist even with the
relatively restricted group of neurons controlling the stomach or the pancreas.
The present project will combine state of the art anatomical, molecular and
electrophysiological techniques to provide evidence of specificity in
communication between the brain and the pancreas. This combination of
experimental approaches will allow the unveiling of a coherent broader picture
discriminating reflex circuits involved in specific metabolic and homeostatic
functions. By providing training in this unique combination of techniques, the
researcher leading this project will continue to foster the career of junior
faculty, postdoctoral fellows and students within, as well as outside, the
laboratory.
