Vector Quantization (VQ) is a source coding technique that is emerging as a
fundamental component in many speech and video coding systems, particularly for
low rate efficient transmission over limited capacity communication channels.
The principal investigator is investigating and developing combined VQ and
channel coding algorithms that substantially advance the current performance
achievable with respect to the overall reproduction quality of the signal in a
narrowband channel or packet network environment. In many applications limited
bandwidth constraints make impractical the use of traditional channel coding
techniques. The algorithms being studied will combine basic VQ compression
techniques for voice and video applications with new channel coding schemes that
use little or no redundancy information. The project will examine in depth and
develop new source/channel techniques for VQ, exploiting combined quantization
and modulation, packet error recovery, index permutations, and selective bit
protection. In addition, a theoretical analysis of the performance of VQ in the
presence of channel noise for asymptotically high resolution quantizers is being
studied, which can lead to better understanding for quantizer design procedures.
