A research course is being taught jointly by members of the Biology and
Chemistry Departments, that introduces students to the theoretical implications
and practical applications of various techniques at the interface of chemistry,
biochemistry and molecular biology. This is particularly important in light of
the current and continued emphasis on biotechnology. A work station approach,
utilizing spectrophotometric, chromatographic and electrophoretic equipment in
an inter-related fashion is the primary focus of the course. Students are being
required to isolate, purify and characterize specific proteins and nucleic acids
using the equipment. The students are being exposed to a variety of scientific
perspectives and techniques as they are actually being carried out in
laboratories. The students are being given the opportunity and the training
necessary to apply these techniques to the problems encountered in their own
research endeavors.
