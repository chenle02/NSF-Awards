The Workshop on Higher-Order Asymptotics and Post-Selection Inference (WHOA-PSI)
will be held on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis from September
30-October 2, 2016. (See http://www.math.wustl.edu/~kuffner/WHOA-PSI.html.)
Post-selection inference is relevant to virtually all areas of statistical
application. Higher-order asymptotics provides the tools and insights needed to
refine basic large-sample results for post-selection inference procedures, and
make them more accurate in the practically realistic setting of small to
moderate sample sizes. WHOA-PSI seeks to merge these fields, foster
collaboration and discussion, and push forward the post-selection inference
research frontier in the direction of higher-order accuracy for inference
procedures. NSF funding will provide travel support for junior researchers to
attend this conference.

Washington University will host a workshop on higher order asymptotics and post-
selection inference September 30 ? October 2, 206. Speakers include Brad Efron,
Jianqing Fan, and Rob Tibshirani. This workshop attempts to address the needs of
applied statisticians utilizing model selection procedures who also need
extremely accurate inference procedures. The workshop will begin with tutorials
on the main topics. This award provides funding for junior researchers to attend
the conference.
