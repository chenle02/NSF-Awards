This project will run several workshops during the summer of 1998 based on
"Calculus: Mathematics and Modeling." The key theme of the workshops will be the
integrated and pervasive use of a computer algebra system throughout the
calculus course. In addition, the workshops will feature a real world modeling
approach to mathematics, writing, group work, guided discovery, and the use of
other technology in addition to computer algebra systems.
