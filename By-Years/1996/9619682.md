9619682 Benziger The Princeton Materials Institute (PMI) at Princeton University
will establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site to bring
sophomore and junior students from other colleges and universities to Princeton
for a ten-week summer research program. The students will participate in a
variety of existing materials science research programs under the direction of
faculty from science and engineering departments that are associated with the
Princeton Materials Institute. Special recruiting efforts are being made to
attract students from minority institutions and colleges where research
experiences are limited. The research experience will be complemented with short
courses in areas of materials science, an engineering ethics seminar, and
laboratory visits to local companies involved in materials engineering. %%%
Princeton University has a history of providing strong support for undergraduate
research. The expansion of the existing undergraduate research activity to
include undergraduate students from other institutions will be mutually
beneficial to the Princeton and to the outside students and faculty. ***
