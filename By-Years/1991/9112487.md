This proposal requests funding to search for and study fossils of early land
animals in North America. The time intervals to be studied are the Silurian and
Devonian Periods, spanning from about 440 million years ago to about 360 million
years ago. The fossils are of arachnids (spiders, etc.), myriapods (centipeds
and millipeds), and insects as well as a few groups of animals that are entirely
extinct. The fossils are preserved as organic remains in sedimentary rocks and
are removed by digesting the rocks with hydrofluoric acid. The material obtained
in this way will aid in understanding the evolution of early life on land, the
relationships within and among the groups named, and how these early animals
functioned.
