The main goals and the intellectual merit of the proposed research are to
advance our understanding and ability to deal with computationally hard
optimization problems, to expand the scope of our methodologies to facilitate
e.ective decision making in multifaceted situations where multiple criteria come
into play, and to formalize problems from other areas and address them
rigorously using the most suitable algorithmic tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One
thrust of the proposed research concerns the development of a coherent
algorithmic theory for multicriteria problems. Such problems are very common and
have been mostly squeezed into an one-dimensional mold so far. Besides the
general theory and algorithm that will be developed, several problems from
databases involving resource and utility trade-o.s will be addressed in this
light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second thrust concerns the further development of
the theory of hard approximation problems. A major objective is to understand
and characterize the degree to which hard problems can be approximated, in
particular, which problems can be approximated within a constant factor,
independent of the size of the instance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third thrust
concerns issues in modeling and analysis of systems, and seeks to
formulate&lt;br/&gt;and bring the relevant problems within the realm of
algorithmic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A broader impact of the proposed
research is expected to be derived from the connections that&lt;br/&gt;will be
pursued between the methodologies and tools from theoretical computer science,
and the&lt;br/&gt;problems and issues that arise in other areas, eg. databases
and system analysis. It is expected&lt;br/&gt;that this will bene.t both sides.
