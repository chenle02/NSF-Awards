One of the fundamental problems in mathematical physics is that of
understanding the ground-state of atoms. This project will examine this problem
in three areas: (1) For a fixed atom of specific nuclear charge, an attempt will
be made to understand its ground state energy, (2) There will be a study of the
asymptotics of the ground state energy as the nuclear charge approaches
infinity, and (3) The project will try to understand qualitative properties of
large atoms such as neutrality, together with related observables, such as
ionization energies. In addition, this project will include work on random
Schrodinger operators, Neumann Laplacians, Scott Correction, and Coulomb
scattering. This project supports a research team under the direction of Dr.
Barry Simon. This project is in the general area of mathematical physics or
theoretical physics and concerns the structure and behavior of atomic particles.
