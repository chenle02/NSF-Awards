9352258 Mims This project will provide non-traditional undergraduate computer
science majors access to concurrent programming and parallel processing. The
Computer Science Program at this institution services a large number of non-
traditional students. These students need remote access to parallel computing
facilities. The goal of the project is to establish a network of parallel
processors in the form of inexpensive transputers that are accessible remotely
via a network file server connected to a telephone switching system. This
project will provide a model system of remotely accessible parallel computing
facilities at a minimal cost. ILI parallel processing projects sponsored by NSF
at other institutions serve as the model for this project. This project enhances
previous transputer based ILI projects by addressing the specific issue of
providing non-traditional students with remote access to parallel processing
utilizing a network of transputers. ***
