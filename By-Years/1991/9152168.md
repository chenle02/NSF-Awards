A first step in the implementation of a common core curriculum is the
establishment of a single Introduction to Engineering Design course in the
freshman year and its associated 30- station computer laboratory. The course
emphasizes the solution of open-ended design problems in each of the engineering
disciplines offered and involves the student in the design process within each
engineering discipline so that the individual can make informed career decisions
while learning the importance of upcoming foundation courses and basic computer
skills. The design problems are multi-faceted requiring the access and usage of
files in word processing, spreadsheet, CAD and problem solver software programs.
The design problems are created by an inter-disciplinary faculty team. Problem
solving skills that utilize the computer and computer software are developed
during the first half of the course. The course is four credit hours with three
hours of lecture and a three hour lab. The course replaces five discipline-
specific introductory courses.
