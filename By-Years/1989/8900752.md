The six students supported by this REU site grant will explore several areas of
research on mathematical problems in the field of topology. The basic question
arises in algebraic topology, specifically homotopy theory, a field of pure
mathematics generally considered beyond the undergraduate curriculum. The
question is within the students' capabilities because it can be reduced to a
computer search for certain kinds of matrices. In algebraic topology, questions
about a topological space are translated into questions about algebraic objects,
usually Abelian groups. These Abelian groups, and homomorphisms between them,
can in turn, be represented by matrices and matrix operations. This allows for
computer representation and manipulation. The undergraduates will design
algorithms and implement them on computers to search for certain kinds of space,
called a nilpotent complex. The computer approach is valuable here because,
though understood in many ways, nilpotent complexes are hard to picture
geometrically. Using these ideas, computer programs have been developed and new
nilpotent complexes discovered. However, major existence questions are still
unanswered. A specific goal of this project is to answer an unsolved question
about the existence of finite three-dimensional nilpotent complexes. A
secondary, but very important, goal is one of improving programs developed
during the past year's REU project. Searching more complex groups is time
consuming. Efficient, faster methods must be created to overcome this obstacle.
