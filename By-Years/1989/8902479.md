A program of both nuclear structure and fundamental nucleon structure
investigations using intermediate energy electrons and protons will be carried
out. A major portion of the structure effort will be directed towards the study
of stretch state particle-hole excitations in light and medium mass nuclei.
These investigations will be carried out at the MIT/Bates linac and at IUCF.
Manley will collaborate with others at KSU on a very important experiment to
measure the neutron charge form factor. He will also plan fundamental
experiments to be carried out on resonance production at CEBAF. Development of
neutron detection capability at the MIT/Bates and CEBAF electron accelerators
will be carried out in support of Manley's experiments.
