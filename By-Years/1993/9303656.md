9303656 McKhann This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Plant Biology. The applicant received her Ph.D. from University of
California at Los Angeles. Her Ph.D. research was in the area of biological
nitrogen fixation with emphasis on molecular biology. She plans to carry out her
postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Adam Kondorosi at the
Institut des Sciences Vegetales in Gif sur Yvette, France. The proposed research
entitled "Functional characterization of a higher plant MAP kinase" will expand
the scientific experience of this Fellow into cell and developmental biology. In
addition, her stay at CNRS will add an international perspective to her research
experience. ***
