9302313 Schilling This proposal is a collaborative research effort between the
University of Rochester and the University of Rhode Island to use multiple
isotopic tracers to investigate the dynamics of outgassing when thermally
buoyant mantle plumes interact with the depleted asthenosphere along the Mid-
Atlantic Ridge (79 N -6 S). This proposal will focus on the isotopic analyses of
the noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Xe) and on the elemental parent/daughter
concentrations (Rb/Sr, Sm/Nd, U/Pb, Th/Pb and Cl). On hand-picked MORB glass, a
complete multi-isotope and concentration data set will be established for
elements of varying volatilities, ranging from Sr, Nd,Pb to He,Ne, Ar, Xe and
Cl. By combining both volatile and lithophile isotope measurements with
geophysical data, this research will attempt to constrain the outgassing
behavior of mantle plumes, the nature, scale length and mixing characteristics
of mantle heterogeneities and the dynamics of plume-asthenosphere mixing. The
four provinces of investigation are: the Equatorial Atlantic, the Jan Mayen-
Mohns-Knipovich Ridge, the Iceland-Reykjanes-Kolbeinsey Ridge and the Azores-Mid
Atlantic Ridge . Each region has unique geochemical and tectonic characteristics
that will provide insights into mantle evolution and plume dynamics.
