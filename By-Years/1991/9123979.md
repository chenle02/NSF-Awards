It is commonly argued that genetic diversity is important for the conservation
of a threatened species. Unfortunately, for most threatened species we know
little about how genetic variation in ecologically relevant traits (e.g. drought
tolerance) may contribute to the survival of a species. This kind of information
is especially important because they provide habitat for many other organisms.
Blue oak (Quercus douglasii), a threatened keystone species in California, is
currently not regenerating throughout much of its geographic range. Blue oak
woodlands are one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems on the planet,
second only to tropical forests. As such, a loss of this species and thus the
habitat it creates would result in a major reduction of biodiversity. This study
will focus on a series of field experiments designed to examine how genetic
variation in morphology and drought tolerance affects survival and growth in
blue oak seedlings and adults. We hope to be able to identify drought resistant
and competitive oak genotypes that may be important sources of germplasm for
current and future efforts to restore and maintain this critically important
species.//
