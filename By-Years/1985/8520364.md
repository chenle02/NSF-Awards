The prediction of vapor/gas volume fraction in a liquid media in a rapidly
depressuring system is a problem which arises in numerous technical
applications. The solution requires knowledge of the number of bubbles per unit
volume of the flashing mixture, as well as the volumes of the individual
bubbles, as a function of time. Carefully-controlled depressurization
experiments are performed in a vertical shock tube, in which mean void fraction
will be measured as a function of time and pressure, with and without the
presence of stainless-steel surfaces using deaerated distilled water. The
nucleus distribution function is determined from these data by a numerical
inversion of the integral equation, or approximately by an inverse transform
procedure. This experimental work gives information on the effective
distribution of bubble nucleii on typical engineering surfaces.
