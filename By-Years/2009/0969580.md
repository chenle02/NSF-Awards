This work focuses on theoretical aspects of tests of fundamental symmetries with
atoms and molecules. The project is driven by searches for new physics, such as
supersymmetry, beyond the standard model of elementary particles, with atomic
parity violation. Such searches rely on exquisite experimental sensitivity to
minute effects of fundamental forces on atomic and molecular structure. High-
accuracy calculations are required for revealing (or extracting constraints on)
new, yet undiscovered particles. The derived constraints are competitive and, at
the same time complementary to the information gained from particle colliders.

The broader impacts of this work evidently reach beyond AMO physics, into
fundamental elementary particle theory. The impacts are broad, as the work may
contribute to extensions of the standard model. In addition, this grant will
support research and education of a graduate student. The student will be
encouraged to participate at meetings and activities of the American Physical
Society. The findings and results will be disseminated through publications in
scientific journals, conference presentations, and the Internet.
