The PIs will model the production, transport, and deposition of glacial
sediments at the Alaska-Aleutian subducting margin during the last 125,000
years. The Cordilleran Ice Sheet and crustal response to ice loading will be
modeled using the University of Maine Ice Sheet Model (UMISM). USISM solutions
will be related to existing sediment datasets and glacial power erosion laws to
determine temporal and spatial patterns of erosion and sediment distribution.
Suspended sediment samples and field measurements of rock strength will be
collected and integrated with the modeling efforts.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:The societal impacts of the study
ultimately include a better understanding of earthquake hazards along this
active margin. The project will involve graduate and undergraduate students.
Data and models will be simplified for online experimental learning modules
targeted at K12/general audiences. Model results will be made available through
the U Maine web server.
