This proposal is to plan for a new multi-university I/UCRC that aims to promote
a research program of interest to both industry and universities on technologies
for wireless internet. This new multi-university center will be able to have a
broad impact on the industry through having its existing resources enhanced by
the addition of the partner that is also being recommended to receive a planning
grant. The two partners are this University and Polytechnic University of New
York.

The proposed Center's goal is to work on two overlapping categories:

- Information delivery focussing on software development, addressing security
and robustness, and - Data transmission related to management of radio resources
and the management of competition and cooperation between different technologies

The proposal deals with an area of significant need and by assembling the two
institutions into one research team, the breadth and depth is enhanced
