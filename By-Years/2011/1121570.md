The ability to induce defense systemically after a local infection allows plants
to control disease spread to additional organs and ward off new infections.
Dehydroabietinal, an abietane diterpenoid that is produced by a variety of
plants, is a potent activator of systemic disease resistance, which is an
inducible defense mechanism activated in the foliage in response to a local
infection. The goal of this project is to characterize the involvement of
dehydroabietinal as a long-distance signaling molecule in plant defense. A
combination of genetic, biochemical, and molecular approaches will be utilized
to accomplish this goal. The proposed activity will enhance our understanding of
long-distance communication in plant defense and provide important insights into
the function of abietane diterpenoids in plants. Broader Impacts: This project
will support the research and training of three graduate and two undergraduate
students, and a postdoctoral fellow. They will receive training in plant
biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, organic chemistry, and mass
spectrometry. In addition, through the instructional activities of the PI and
Co-PIs, this project will bring current knowledge of plant signaling, secondary
metabolism, and stress response, in addition to organic synthesis and mass-
spectrometry techniques, into the classroom. The project will also provide
opportunities to train high school students and future science teachers, and
broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in research through several
programs that are in place at the University of North Texas. This project will
potentially benefit society at large by identifying steps in plant
metabolism/signaling that mediate defense against pathogens. In the future these
steps could be targeted for augmenting disease resistance in plants and thus
enhance the quality and productivity of plants, and by way of limiting the need
for toxic chemicals to protect plants, also benefit the environment and public
health.
