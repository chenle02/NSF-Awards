This grant will support research in machine learning for control of nonlinear
dynamical systems. Drs. Jordan and Jacobs will study multinetwork connectionist
architectures for discovering picewise control strategies, comparing alternative
decompositions of control tasks, and learning multiple tasks simultaneously.
They expect multinetworks to show faster learning rates, better generalization,
more interpretable representations, and more efficient use of hardware than
single neural networks.
