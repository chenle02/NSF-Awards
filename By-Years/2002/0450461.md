This SBIR Phase II research project aims to complete the development of a fully-
characterized, commercial prototype, Advanced Unified Oceanographic Data Logger
(AUDL). This system aims to provide a new commercial standard for standalone
data recording within existing and future oceanographic applications. The same
technology will also provide best-in-class performance within the larger markets
of terrestrial environmental monitoring. One key feature is that the AUDL will
provide a nearly universal sensor interface. It will record data transparently
from analog, serial-asynchronous, and digital sensors and instruments. This will
enable GEOSense to target a wider range of applications and customers, with a
single, low-cost system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GEOSense will provide a
commercial solution that significantly lowers the cost of technical data
acquisition within a number of research and engineering applications. By
reducing the overall cost of data recording, it is expected that the technology
will enhance both the scientific return, and the educational opportunities, from
limited research funds. It is hoped that the widespread application of this
technology will increase the scope of expertise in oceanographic
instrumentation. &lt;br/&gt;
