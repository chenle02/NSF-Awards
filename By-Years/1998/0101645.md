Midlands Technical College is adapting and implementing the telecommunications
education program developed at Springfield Technical Community College's
Northeast Center for Telecommunications Technologies (NCTT). The Departments of
Engineering Technologies and Engineering Transfer are adapting the NCTT
curriculum to include a pre-telecommunications technologies component to be
delivered by secondary teachers to high schools in Richland, Lexington and
Fairfield counties. Laboratories are being designed to house the appropriate
equipment, and Midlands is ensuring the ongoing operation and continued support
for the work.

In addition to articulated coursework in telecommunications in local high
schools, the project is facilitating the professional growth and development of
college and high school instructors as well as recruiting, retaining,
graduating, and placing students in good jobs. Partners include Springfield
Technical Community College, the Northeast Center for Telecommunications
Technologies, the three schools districts, CISCO, the Central Carolina Economic
Development Alliance, the SC State Technical College System, and the Central
Midlands School-to-Work Consortium.
