This program focusses on enhancement in ductility in body-centered cubic metals
where limitations in dislocation mobility exists. Ordered intermetallic alloys
and body-centered cubic metals are investigated and compared. Surface
film/substrate interfaces and internal precipitate/matrix interfaces are
examined under applied static and cyclic stresses. Metal-to-metal, metal-to-
intermetallic, and intermetallic-to-intermetallic interfaces are included in the
study. Surface film softening phenomena are investigated with the idea to
determine what materials respond to this behavior, factors that control it, and
effects of cyclic deformation. High resolution transmission electron microscopy
and atomic modeling of interfaces will be employed.
