The interplay between the chemical environment and the dynamics of species is of
fundamental importance to ecosystems. Recruitment, predation, and biotic
disturbance, for example, are commonly mediated by specific biogenic chemicals
whose alteration can profoundly affect the dynamics of the community. This
project will study the coupling between the presence of biogenic brominated
aromatics and the dynamics of members of three trophic levels in a marine
sedimentary assemblage. The project utilized the production of bromoaromatics by
a worm and its contamination of the surrounding habitat as a model system for
examining the following questions: 1. How does the presence of these compounds
affect rates of predation and disturbance? and 2. How important are bacteria in
controlling the level of sediment contamination? Based on the PI's prior
research it is known that recruitment of some species is radically reduced in
the presence of these bromoaromatics. However, there is a lack of information on
the effects of these compounds on the major disturbance forces in the system,
sediment-biting and digging predators, and on the processes that maintain the
level of these toxic brominated phenols in the sediment. Using a variety of
laboratory and field experiments, this research project will investigate the
effects of the biogenic bromoaromatics on these processes. Given the global
abundance in marine sedimentary habitats of taxa producing brominated aromatics,
these compounds may be very important as structuring forces in marine
sedimentary communities.
