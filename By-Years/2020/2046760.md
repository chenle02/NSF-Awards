A core capability of intelligence is reasoning about hidden information. Many
artificial intelligence (AI) approaches reason about hidden information by
constructing a statistical model and then running a statistical inference
algorithm to learn hidden information from observed data. But many inference
algorithms take a very long time to run when they are learning from a very large
amount of data; or, worse, they might run quickly but give the wrong answer.
This is problematic as the world trends towards large-scale AI. This project
will build new general statistical inference algorithms that will still run
efficiently, even on very large datasets and on very complicated models, while
having provable reliability guarantees. This will promote the progress of
science by making scalable statistical inference reliable. The project will also
further education in AI through the development of open-source course resources
that give students hands-on experience with how scalability and reliability
interact in ML systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which is a class of statistical inference
algorithm that work by simulating a random process that converges to a desired
statistical model. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can give very accurate
statistical estimates, but can scale poorly to large datasets and complicated
models. This project will fix this by building new algorithms that address
scaling to large data and large models with data-subsampling and asynchronous
parallelism, respectively. Throughout, it will focus on proving theoretical
guarantees that expose the trade-off between scalability and reliability for
MCMC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
