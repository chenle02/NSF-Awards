Though economic value is often measured by the price of a collectible work of
art or the number of music recordings sold, the cultural value of these objects
is multifaceted and more difficult to measure. This dissertation seeks to
understand the determinants of cultural-economic value through the study of
music and fine art. The central empirical question asks how industry actors know
which objects have more or less value than others in cultural markets.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through in-depth interviews with curators, talent buyers,
artists, and musicians, this study will collect data on the self-reported value
judgments of respondents, with attention to the construction of knowledge in the
cultural economy. In addition, ethnographic observation of the sound culture
industries in New York City will form a comparative case with current research
in Chicago to understand the relationship between participants' theories of
value and practices of valuation. Interpretive analysis of these coupled data
sets will be used to generate original economic theory about economic value in
addition to the empirical findings in this particular case. The overall goal is
to develop a more complete theory of economic value that takes into account
cultural evaluations in addition to quantitative economic evaluations of prices
and quantity.
