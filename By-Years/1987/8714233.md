This proposal, between Drs. William C. Saslaw and David S. Heeschen of the
University of Virginia, and Dr. Yin Qifeng of Beijing University, is for radio
observations of starburst galaxies. The study will investigate how such
starburst galaxies might be produced, whether by internal or external forces,
and whether the shapes of different starburst regions suggest any
interrelationship. The work will be conducted under the terms of the US-PRC
Protocol for Cooperation in the Basic Sciences. The proposed research will use
the VLA radio telescopes of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory of the U.S.
and the radio inferometer of the Mi-Yun Observatory in China to make
complementary observations. In so doing, this study seeks to integrate the
observation programs of this major Chinese telescope into international
astronomy.
