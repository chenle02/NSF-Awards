This award will provide travel support for graduate students to attend the First
International Conference on Broadband Networks (BroadNets 2004), to be held in
San Jose, California from October 25-29, 2004. BroadNets is a new conference on
broadband networking that covers the spectrum of next-generation networks in
which ultra-high bandwidth is available from access to metro to core. The
conference consists of two symposia, the Broadband Optical Networking Symposium,
and the Broadband Wireless Symposium, as well as several workshops. The
collaborative support of these two events under the umbrella of broadband
networking will contribute to initiate, develop, and foster relationships
between the research communities. For students it is an opportunity to meet and
discuss their research with some of the most notable researchers in these
fields.
