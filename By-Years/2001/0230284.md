This work is the continuation of a joint project with the Polar Research
Institute of China to make measurements of the structure of the upper ocean in
the northern Weddell Sea along the route taken by the PRI's antarctic supply
vessel, R/V Xue Long. The observations, obtained from expendable instruments,
complement existing hydrographic observations along various transects through
the northwestern Weddell Sea region and data from moored current meter arrays in
the Weddell-Scotia confluence zone. This effort builds upon a successful series
of expendable bathythermographs and conductivity-temperature-depth probes
obtained by the science party on board the R/V Xue Long for the past four years.
The west-to-east transit of the Weddell Sea by the ship makes it possible to
obtain a series of ocean soundings that are otherwise unobtainable. The
information is particularly important because strong correlative links between
the upper ocean temperature and salinity, the sea ice edge, and extra-polar
climate features have been established. It has been shown that the Indian Ocean
sector is an anomalous region with respect to connections between antarctic and
lower latitude climatic features and indices. Here the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current makes its closest approach to the continent and the Antarctic
Circumpolar Wave is least well expressed in the existing data. The necessary
instrumentation, both software and hardware, has been installed in the ship and
an excellent working relationship with Chinese antarctic scientists has been
developed.
