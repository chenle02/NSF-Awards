P.I. : HAY, MARK E. Proposal #: 95-29784 PROPOSAL ABSTRACT Understanding prey
defenses is fundamental to a wide range of ecological and evolutionary topics
within marine communities. For example, investigations of differences among
species in secondary metabolites, palatability, and susceptibility to consumers
have provided insights into factors driving specialization, affecting
distribution and community organization, and determining feeding patterns and
digestive efficiencies. The proposed research will focus on within- individual
differences and the plasticity of individuals to respond to perturbations in
their environments.
