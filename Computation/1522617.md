This research will advance a computational method that starts at atomic and
quantum-mechanical level, and bridges the significant gap between atomistic
models and macroscopic properties by deriving a reduced model that only involves
the degrees of freedom near the material interfaces. This ultimately permits the
study of collective properties of materials on much larger scales based on first
principle. Results of the research will be incorporated into graduate courses
and undergraduate summer research programs.

Material properties are mostly determined by the underlying micro-structures.
Geometric interfaces, such as grain boundaries and precipitates, represent some
of the most interesting and important material structures. The goal of this
project is to develop highly accurate computational tools for simulating and
understanding the roles of interfaces in material properties. The advent of
modern computing capability has changed the qualitative nature of much of the
material modeling effort. In particular, computer models that rely on atomic
scale interactions have emerged as a popular approach. In most cases, however,
direct atomistic simulations are still limited to small systems with simple
geometry, and they are unable to deal with the realities of the systems that
they are supposed to describe. With an appropriate mathematical reduction
method, this research will enable large-scale material simulations while still
retaining the accuracy of atomic and electronic level descriptions.
