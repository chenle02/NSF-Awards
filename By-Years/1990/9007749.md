Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) Spectroscopy is the primary technique to study
single electron transfer events between a particiular absorbase and a donor. The
ESR is useful in areas such as solid state chemistry, surface chemistry, solid
state physics, electrochemistry, and material science. This award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry
at Washington State University acquire an Electron Spin Resonance (ESR)
Spectrometer. The ESR will be used in the following research topics: 1. Electron
Spin Resonance Investigation of Pure and Intercalated M2P2X6 Lattices 2. Redox
Chemistry on Metal Oxides 3. The Design and Characterization of Low Dimensional
Magnetic Materials and the Study of Structural Phase Transitions
